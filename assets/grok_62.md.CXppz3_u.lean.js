The most common way humans contribute to the extinction of organisms is by Pick the answer from these options","completion":"Although you have not provided answer options, I can provide you with a comprehensive explanation of the most common ways humans contribute to the extinction of organisms. 1. Habitat destruction: One of the primary reasons for species extinction is the loss or modification of their natural habitat. Human activities like deforestation, urbanization, agriculture, mining, and infrastructure development lead to the removal of vital habitats for various organisms. As these habitats shrink or fragment, the species depending on them find it harder to find food, water, and mates, leading to a decline in population and ultimately extinction. 2. Overexploitation: Overhunting, overfishing, and other forms of excessive resource extraction can push species toward extinction. Many species have become extinct or critically endangered due to the demand for their parts, such as elephant tusks, rhino horns, and tiger bones. Additionally, overfishing can lead to the collapse of entire ecosystems, as the delicate balance between interconnected species is disrupted. 3. Pollution: Emission of harmful substances such as chemicals, pesticides, and plastic waste into the environment disrupts ecosystems and affects the health and survival of numerous species. Pollution can cause habitat degradation, poisoning of food sources, and physical harm to organisms, resulting in population declines and eventual extinction. 4. Climate change: Global warming and climate change, driven by human activities like fossil fuel consumption and deforestation, are creating significant challenges for the survival of various species. As a result of climate change, some species lose their habitats, while others face altered patterns of precipitation, temperature, and other environmental conditions that threaten their survival prospects. For example, certain species may struggle to adapt to rising ocean temperatures and acidification, leading to population decline or extinction. 5. Invasive species: When humans introduce non-native species to new environments, often accidentally or through globalization, these new species can compete with native ones for resources, predate on them, or introduce diseases. This can lead to a decline in native species populations and ultimately extinction. 6. Disease: Human activities sometimes facilitate the introduction and spread of diseases among wild species. For instance, shipping containers and agricultural trade can facilitate the spread of pathogens and pests that affect native flora and fauna. Additionally, human-created environments can provide breeding grounds for disease vectors like mosquitoes, leading to increased disease transmission. In conclusion, the most common way humans contribute to the extinction of organisms is through a combination of factors like habitat destruction, overexploitation, pollution, climate change, invasive species introduction, and disease. All these factors are driven by human activities, and addressing them requires concerted efforts from individuals, communities, businesses, and governments to promote sustainable development, conservation, and environmental stewardship."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. A friend asked me to answer this question: What culture's invasion of the hills that were occupied by two types of settlements was most likely for silver?, using the article: Twenty Palaeolithic sites have been identified in the Mendips, of which eleven represent faunal remains and lithic artefacts recovered from caves. The remaining eight sites refer to surface lithic discoveries, and the artefacts found include points, scrapers, and handaxes. Twenty-seven Mesolithic finds are represented by flint and chert lithics. Large numbers of artefacts have been found near Neolithic, Iron Age, and Bronze Age features, such as the barrows and forts around Priddy and at Dolebury Warren. The caves of Cheddar Gorge have yielded many archaeological remains, as flood waters have washed artefacts and bones into the caves and preserved them in silt. The Cheddar Man, Britain's oldest complete skeleton, was found in Gough's Cave, part of the Cheddar Complex.Within the Mendip Hills AONB, good evidence exists for 286 definite examples of round barrows, including the Priddy Nine Barrows and Ashen Hill Barrow Cemeteries. The Historic England Archive holds over 1,200 entries for the area, and there are over 600 listed buildings, in addition to over 200 scheduled ancient monuments. These protected monuments range from prehistoric barrows and hillforts to the Black Down bombing decoy from the Second World War.Settlement on the Mendip Hills appears to fall into two types. The first, apparent in the Neolithic and Bronze Age Britain periods, and repeated on a small scale in the Middle Ages and post-medieval era, comprised occupation by self-sufficient groups in small communities or isolated farms. The second was represented in the Iron Age Britain and Roman periods by large sites with specialist functions, existing by virtue of their ability to exert power over lowland producers. From the Iron Age onward the ownership of land took on increasing importance, with large landholdings based on the mines or on stock grazing, denying settlers access to the plateau or forcing them off the hills.There is evidence of mining dating back to the late Bronze Age, when there were technological changes in metal-working..., what would be the answer ? The answer to this question is:","completion":"The culture whose invasion of the hills that were occupied by two types of settlements was most likely for silver can be inferred from the given information about the Mendip Hills. In the article, it is mentioned that there is evidence of mining dating back to the late Bronze Age, technological changes in metal-working, and large landholdings based on mines or stock grazing from the Iron Age onwards. Considering these details, it can be suggested that the Roman culture might have been most likely responsible for the invasion of the hills for the extraction of precious metals such as silver. The Romans are known for their expertise in mining and metallurgy, in addition to their conquests and expansions across different territories. In the context of the Mendip Hills, the Iron Age Britain and Roman periods are marked by large sites with specialist functions, which could be indicative of significant mining activities. These sites existed by exerting power over lowland producers, potentially for mining and resource extraction purposes. Furthermore, during the Roman era, the ownership of land took increasing importance, leading to large landholdings based on mines or stock grazing. Taking all this into account, it seems that the Roman culture's invasion of the Mendip Hills, occupied by two types of settlements, was most likely driven by the pursuit of silver and other valuable resources found in the region. Their administrative and technological expertise, along with their expansionist policies, support the argument that they would be most likely to invade the hills for silver extraction purposes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It is partly covered by sea ice throughout the year and almost completely in winter. The Arctic Ocean's surface temperature and salinity vary seasonally as the ice cover melts and freezes; its salinity is the lowest on average of the five major oceans, due to low evaporation, heavy fresh water inflow from rivers and streams, and limited connection and outflow to surrounding oceanic waters with higher salinities. The summer shrinking of the ice has been quoted at 50%. The US National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) uses satellite data to provide a daily record of Arctic sea ice cover and the rate of melting compared to an average period and specific past years. Now, I have a new situation: The Madrigal Ocean and the Listy Ocean are two bodies of water currently under observation by scientists on a planet nearly identical to Earth. Although the studies have just started, the scientists have already discovered that the salinity of the Madrigal Ocean is much lower than that of the Listy Ocean. This isn't much information, but it's progress and the scientists are not going to stop their studies until they learn all that they can about these waters. Answer this question please: Is the Madrigal Ocean probably connected to more or less rivers than the Listy Ocean? A:","completion":"Based on the information provided, it can be inferred that the Madrigal Ocean is probably connected to more rivers than the Listy Ocean, as the lower salinity suggests greater freshwater inflow from rivers and streams."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The app's compatibility with a wide range of file formats, including PDF, Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, has been invaluable in times when I need to review multiple types of documents for work or personal use. Another feature that I especially appreciate is the ability to sync the app across multiple devices. This has proven extremely helpful when I'm on-the-go and need to switch between my smartphone and tablet, ensuring that I never lose track of where I left off in a document or presentation. Also worth mentioning is the fact that at.tomtasche.reader supports quick and painless document searches. Finding a specific page or section within a file has never been so effortless. This feature has undeniably helped me save time and made my work more efficient. However, there is some room for improvement that prevents me from giving this app a perfect 5-star rating. While at.tomtasche.reader does a fantastic job with most file formats, I have experienced occasional difficulties in rendering some more complex PDF files - particularly those with embedded multimedia features. Fixing these minor issues would definitely take this app to the next level. Moreover, I find the in-app ads to be a little intrusive at times. While I understand that ads help support the development of the app, perhaps the developers could consider implementing less obtrusive advertising or offer an affordable ad-free version for those willing to pay for an improved user experience. Overall, I am pleased with my experience using at.tomtasche.reader, and would highly recommend it to anyone in need of an all-purpose document reader. As someone who regularly needs to access and review various file formats, this app has become an indispensable part of my daily routine.

She had been sick for the last few years and, though my job had taken me away across the town, I tried to visit her as much as possible. I helped with the shopping, the cooking and the cleaning and taking her pet cat Mazy to the vet. Sad as her passing away was, what happened to Mazy was even more worrying. Because aunt Suzy had no children, there wasn't anyone who seemed to care for her beloved cat friend. I would have taken her in a short time, but my apartment doesn't allow pets. First, we talked with her neighbors. Mr. Jenkins, who was alone and lived across the street, wasn't interested. Joe and Sally who lived next door had a small child with serious skin allergies . My aunt's best friend Molly who had lived just down the road was unable to take care of herself as she had serious health problems. Second, we thought about our family members. My brother Bobby and his wife Jill were _ at once as they aren't cat people. My cousin in California was a bit interested, but we weren't sure about the trip as Mazy was nearly as old as my aunt (in cat years!). Finally, we came to the local humane society to see whether they would be able to help her find a new home. The problem was that most people and families only welcomed a smart little cat into their home, not a dull old one. In the end, we had to put Mazy to sleep. I had spoken with the vet and realized it was possible for the best. It was so hard to lose aunt Suzy and then have nowhere for Mazy to live. A few months went by and I had gone to my aunt's house to clear out some of her belongings. I happened to see her mailman. Jerry and we started to talk about my aunt when he asked about Mazy. I told him that we had to put Mazy to sleep because we couldn't find a home for her. Jerry got really quiet. \\"I promised Suzy that if anything ever happened to her, I'd take care of Mazy\\", he said sadly. \\"Suzy always said she'd told her lawyer the arrangement.\\" Hearing this, my heart sank to my feet and I almost cried.

What does Balaji Vishwanathan think about GST Bill? What difference will GST Bill make now? Choose your answer. Are these two questions paraphrases of each other? Choose your answer from: [I] no; [II] yes;","completion":"[I] no; Balaji Vishwanathan, a prominent Indian Quoran and technology expert, has shared his views on the GST Bill (Goods and Services Tax) in various online platforms. He generally holds a positive view of the GST Bill, which is a comprehensive tax reform for India. According to his perspective, GST is a significant step towards enhancing efficiency and reducing complexity in the previous tax system. Regarding the first question, Balaji Vishwanathan believes that the GST Bill has the potential to substantially alter the economic landscape of India. The Bill aims to decompose the tax system into a unified structure, removing the cascading tax effect, and promoting the ease of doing business. It is designed to streamline compliance, increase government's revenue, and foster healthy competition among businesses and states. Thus, GST is expected to make India a more attractive destination for multinational corporations and foreign investors. As for the second question, the difference that the GST Bill makes now can be observed on both micro and macroeconomic scales. 1. Reducing tax burden: GST consolidates various indirect taxes such as the Central Excise Tax, Value Added Tax (VAT), and Service Tax into a single tax regime. This consolidation helps reduce the tax burden on consumers and businesses. 2. Simplification of tax processes: GST reduces complexity and simplifies the tax processes by eliminating the need to deal with multiple tax authorities at the central and state level. This makes the tax system more manageable for businesses and minimizes evasion. 3. Enhancing competitiveness: By removing cascading tax effects and reducing costs, GST promotes fair market competition and encourages investment. 4. Increasing government revenue: GST improves tax compliance, which eventually leads to higher tax revenues for the government. This subsequently provides more resources for public spending and development projects. 5. Boosting GDP growth: GST's positive impact on the ease of doing business, investment, and government revenue can collectively contribute towards improved GDP growth in the long run. The two questions mentioned are not paraphrases of each other.

Which way makes more sense to accomplish this goal? A. Fold your towel into its desired form and attach Velcro strips in two spots, one on the front and one on the back,. B. Fold your towel into its desired form and attach Velcro strips in one spot, one on the front or one on the back,.","completion":"Both options A and B can help you accomplish the goal of keeping your towel from falling off the handle of the oven or fridge. However, considering the effectiveness and stability, option A seems to make more sense. Here's a detailed analysis of each option to help you understand better: Option A: Fold your towel into its desired form and attach Velcro strips in two spots, one on the front and one on the back. 1. Enhanced stability: Attaching Velcro strips in two spots (one on the front and one on the back) will provide better stability when the towel is hung on the handle. This will help ensure that the towel remains in place even when you accidentally brush against it or pull on it. 2. Improved grip and support: By attaching Velcro strips in two spots, you're creating a more secure connection between the towel and the handle. This enhanced grip will prevent the towel from slipping or falling off the handle, making it more convenient for you when you need to use the towel. 3. Easier and quicker to fold: With Velcro strips at both the front and the back, you only need to align the strips when folding the towel. This means that you can easily and quickly fold the towel into its desired form without needing to fiddle with the position of the Velcro strips. 4. Better weight distribution: When you have Velcro strips on both sides of the towel, the weight of the towel is evenly distributed across the handle, preventing any strain on one side or causing any damage to the appliance handle. Option B: Fold your towel into its desired form and attach Velcro strips in one spot, one on the front or one on the back. 1. Less stability: Having only one Velcro strip means that the towel will have less overall support, making it more likely to fall off the handle when brushed against or pulled on. 2. Weaker grip and support: With just one Velcro strip, the grip between the towel and the handle will be weaker, potentially allowing the towel to slip or fall off more easily. 3. More challenging to fold: Since there's only one Velcro strip, folding the towel into its desired form may require more adjustments to ensure that the strip is placed in the correct position. 4. Uneven weight distribution: With only one Velcro strip, the weight of the towel will be primarily supported by that strip, causing strain on one side of the handle and potentially damaging the appliance handle over time. In conclusion, option A makes more sense to accomplish the goal of keeping your towel from falling off the handle of the oven or fridge. Attaching Velcro strips in two spots (one on the front and one on the back) provides better stability, support, and weight distribution, making it more practical and effective in the long run."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Apple Computer #39;s stock has continued to soar along with sales of its iPod digital music player, topping 50 a share for the first time in four years.","completion":"This is about the technology company Apple Inc.'s stock performance and its correlation with the sales of its iPod digital music player. The context refers to a period when the company's stock reached an important milestone, surpassing 50 per share for the first time in four years. This surge in stock valuation is attributed to the increasing popularity and sales of the iPod product line. The iPod, launched in October 2001, revolutionized the way people listen to music. The easy-to-use interface, sleek design, and large storage capacity distinguished it from other portable music players at that time. The iPod's success contributed significantly to Apple's revenue growth, leading to a positive impact on the company's stock price. The period mentioned (i.e., first time reaching 50 in four years) likely corresponds to an era when the iPod was thriving, with the company introducing several iterations of the device to cater to different customer segments. These include the iPod Mini, iPod Nano, iPod Shuffle, and the iPod Touch. Each of these products was designed to target various market needs, thereby expanding Apple's customer base and driving up sales figures. The stock's rapid climb in valuation clearly demonstrates the strong correlation between the success of the iPod and the company's overall financial performance. Notably, during the early 2000s, Apple Inc. faced stagnant growth, and the introduction of the iPod bolstered the company's prospects, leading to a renewed vigor in the organization. Moreover, it must be highlighted that the iPod's success laid the foundation for the development and release of the iPhone in 2007. The iPhone integrated elements of the iPod (music player) with telephone capabilities, in addition to introducing a multitude of other features that rendered it a revolutionary product in the smartphone market. This inevitably contributed to bolstering Apple Inc's stock, making it one of the most valuable and recognizable companies in the world. In conclusion, this statement is about Apple Inc's stock milestone, attributed to the strong sales performance of the iPod digital music player. The successful product line not only resulted in remarkable revenue growth, but it also allowed the company to expand its unique product offerings and position itself as an industry leader in the technology space. Ultimately, the impact of the iPod on Apple's stock performance serves as a prime example of how innovative and pioneering products can drive significant and long-lasting business growth."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

First, we have two numbers (3983 and 4060) that both have an \\"i\\" next to them. The problem tells us to subtract these numbers. We need to find out what \\"i\\" is, which is like finding the missing piece of the puzzle. Here's the problem we need to solve: 3983 * i - 4060 * i = 77 Now, let's follow these steps: 1. Imagine you have 3983 blocks and 4060 blocks, each with a picture of an \\"i\\" on them. If you-add -the 4060 blocks from the 3983 blocks, we will find out how many \\"i\\" blocks we have. 2. To find the difference in the number of blocks, we subtract 3983 from 4060 like this: 4060 - 3983 = 77 Now, we know that there are 77 \\"i\\" blocks. So the problem looks like this: 77 * i = 77 3. To find what \\"i\\" is, we need to see how many times 77 fits into 77. In other words, we need to divide 77 by 77: 77 ÷ 77 = 1 So, we found that \\"i\\" is equal to 1. There we go!

The answer to the question should be unambiguous and a phrase in the paragraph. Most questions can have only one correct answer. Q: Passage: In Las Meninas, the king and queen are supposedly \\"outside\\" the painting, yet their reflection in the back wall mirror also places them \\"inside\\" the pictorial space.Snyder proposes it is \\"a mirror of majesty\\" or an allusion to the mirror for princes. While it is a literal reflection of the king and queen, Snyder writes \\"it is the image of exemplary monarchs, a reflection of ideal character\\" Later he focuses his attention on the princess, writing that Velázquez's portrait is \\"the painted equivalent of a manual for the education of the princess—a mirror of the princess\\". The painting is likely to have been influenced by Jan van Eyck's Arnolfini Portrait, of 1434. At the time, van Eyck's painting hung in Philip's palace, and would have been familiar to Velázquez. The Arnolfini Portrait also has a mirror positioned at the back of the pictorial space, reflecting two figures who would have the same angle of vision as does the viewer of Velázquez's painting; they are too small to identify, but it has been speculated that one may be intended as the artist himself, though he is not shown in the act of painting. According to Lucien Dällenbach: The mirror [in Las Meninas] faces the observer as in Van Eyck's painting. But here the procedure is more realistic to the degree that the \\"rearview\\" mirror in which the royal couple appears is no longer convex but flat. Whereas the reflection in the Flemish painting recomposed objects and characters within a space that is condensed and deformed by the curve of the mirror, that of Velázquez refuses to play with the laws of perspective: it projects onto the canvas the perfect double of the king and queen positioned in front of the painting. Moreover, in showing the figures whom the painter observes, and also, through the mediation of the mirror, the figures who are observing him, the painter achieves a reciprocity of gazes that makes the interior oscillate with the exterior and which causes the image to \\"emerge from its frame\\" at the same time that it invites the visitors to enter the painting. Jonathan Miller asks: \\"What are we to make of the blurred features of the royal couple? It is unlikely that it has anything to do with the optical imperfection of the mirror, which would, in reality, have displayed a focused image of the King and Queen\\". He notes that \\"in addition to the represented mirror, he teasingly implies an unrepresented one, without which it is difficult to imagine how he could have shown himself painting the picture we now see\\".

Mr Shaw has so far met 129 friends in Manchester, Birmingham and Stoke-on-Trent. Article:","completion":"Title: Man on a Social Mission: Daniel Shaw's Journey to Meet 730 Facebook Friends in a Year In a world where people often boast thousands of Facebook friends, how many do we truly know? And better yet, how many do we take the time to nurture genuine connections with? Enter Daniel Shaw, a 38-year-old youth worker from the UK, who aims to challenge the notion of superficial social media friendships by going on a mission to meet 730 out of his 1,103 Facebook friends in just one year's time. This ambitious idea was born when Shaw's friends bet that he didn't actually know all his Facebook connections. Never one to back down from a challenge, Shaw took the daring leap and set out to prove them wrong, while simultaneously raising money for a charitable cause - the Motor Neurone Disease Association. As a youth worker, Daniel often encounters young people who struggle with loneliness and depression. In an increasingly digitized world, it's easy to feel isolated despite being constantly surrounded by friends online. By embarking on this journey, Shaw seeks to remind people of the importance of cultivating meaningful relationships, both online and offline, and by doing so, he also hopes to raise awareness and funds for a disease that affects 5,000 people in the UK alone. Though the journey has just begun, Shaw has already managed to meet 129 of his Facebook friends in Manchester, Birmingham, and Stoke-on-Trent, demonstrating his unwavering dedication to the cause. These meetings typically involve face-to-face conversations, sharing stories, and creating lasting memories – experiences that cannot be replicated through likes and comments on a screen. In addition to challenging the status quo of social media use, Shaw's journey is also an inspiring story for people dealing with personal struggles. By showcasing the value and impact of true connection and human interaction, Shaw is encouraging those who may struggle with their emotional well-being to build genuine connections and reach out when they are in need. Through his meetings with friends, Shaw has come across numerous heartwarming stories and developed a deeper understanding of the people he once only knew through their Facebook profiles. These encounters have become a testament to the power of human interaction, illustrating that each and every individual carries a wealth of unique experiences, perspectives, and strengths that can only be tapped into when we take the time to engage and truly listen to one another. Shaw's tireless efforts have been met with immense gratitude by the Motor Neurone Disease Association. The organization relies on generous donations to fund the care and support needed for individuals living with this disorder, as well as to advance the research for treatments and potential cures. Every pound raised through Shaw's journey will make a significant difference in the lives of those affected by the disease. As he continues on this incredible adventure, there's little doubt that Daniel Shaw will achieve his goal of meeting 730 Facebook friends in one year. Through his pursuit, Shaw not only underscores the value of genuine connection and friendship, but also sheds light on an often misunderstood disease, providing hope and inspiration to countless individuals. In a time when social media has become a staple of modern life, Shaw's quest serves as a gentle reminder that authentic connections and friendships, not merely online acquaintances, are what truly nourish the human spirit."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Crombie (viewing the Renaissance in the 19th-century manner as a chapter in the heroic March of Progress) calls \\"a backwards-looking admiration for antiquity\\", in which Platonism stood in opposition to the Aristotelian concentration on the observable properties of the physical world. But Renaissance humanists, who considered themselves as restoring the glory and nobility of antiquity, had no interest in scientific innovation. However, by the mid-to-late 16th century, even the universities, though still dominated by Scholasticism, began to demand that Aristotle be read in accurate texts edited according to the principles of Renaissance philology, thus setting the stage for Galileo's quarrels with the outmoded habits of Scholasticism.

Please answer this question: what temperature does water boil at in fahrenheit?","completion":"Water boils at 212 degrees Fahrenheit (100 degrees Celsius) under standard atmospheric pressure, which is defined as exactly 1 atmosphere (atm) or 14.7 pounds per square inch (psi) or 101.3 kilopascals (kPa). It is essential to understand that this boiling point can vary with changes in atmospheric pressure and other environmental factors. The boiling point of water is dependent on the pressure exerted on the water's surface. As atmospheric pressure decreases, the boiling point of water also decreases. For example, at higher elevations such as on a mountain, the atmospheric pressure is lower, and the boiling point of water decreases. That is why it takes longer to cook foods by boiling at higher altitudes, as the temperature of boiling water is lower than 212 degrees Fahrenheit. In contrast, with an increase in atmospheric pressure, such as in a pressure cooker, the boiling point of water rises. This is why pressure cookers can cook food more quickly, as the water's boiling point increases, causing the water and steam inside the cooker to reach higher temperatures than in a regular pot. It is also important to mention that impurities or dissolved substances can affect the boiling point of water, either by raising or lowering it. Adding substances such as salt or sugar can cause a phenomenon called \\"boiling point elevation,\\" increasing the boiling point of water slightly. This change in boiling point is more noticeable in solutions with higher concentrations of solutes. In summary, water typically boils at 212 degrees Fahrenheit (100 degrees Celsius) under standard atmospheric pressure. However, changes in atmospheric pressure due to elevation or a change in environmental conditions, as well as the presence of impurities or solutes in the water, can cause variations in the boiling point."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the last name of the person who was survived by his third wife, as well as his daughter, Galina, and son, Maxim? In 1964 Shostakovich composed the music for the Russian film Hamlet, which was favourably reviewed by The New York Times: \\"But the lack of this aural stimulation – of Shakespeare's eloquent words – is recompensed in some measure by a splendid and stirring musical score by Dmitri Shostakovich. This has great dignity and depth, and at times an appropriate wildness or becoming levity\\".In later life, Shostakovich suffered from chronic ill health, but he resisted giving up cigarettes and vodka. Beginning in 1958 he suffered from a debilitating condition that particularly affected his right hand, eventually forcing him to give up piano playing; in 1965 it was diagnosed as poliomyelitis. He also suffered heart attacks the following year and again in 1971, and several falls in which he broke both his legs; in 1967 he wrote in a letter: \\"Target achieved so far: 75% (right leg broken, left leg broken, right hand defective). All I need to do now is wreck the left hand and then 100% of my extremities will be out of order.\\"A preoccupation with his own mortality permeates Shostakovich's later works, among them the later quartets and the Fourteenth Symphony of 1969 (a song cycle based on a number of poems on the theme of death). This piece also finds Shostakovich at his most extreme with musical language, with twelve-tone themes and dense polyphony throughout. He dedicated the piece to his close friend Benjamin Britten, who conducted its Western premiere at the 1970 Aldeburgh Festival. The Fifteenth Symphony of 1971 is, by contrast, melodic and retrospective in nature, quoting Wagner, Rossini and the composer's own Fourth Symphony. Shostakovich died of lung cancer on 9 August 1975.

He decides to collect water from a nearby stream and boil it to make it safe for drinking. Will boiling the water increase or decrease entropy? Hint: There are many examples in the chemical world of changes in entropy. Phase transitions are one obvious example. When a substance makes a transition from the liquid state to the gaseous state, the particles have many more possible arrangements, because they are no longer confined to a specified volume in which they are close to each other; gas particles can move freely throughout their container. Vaporization represents an increase in entropy. In the opposite direction, a liquid loses entropy when it freezes to a solid. Because solids have very ordered structures, there are fewer possible arrangements of particles that would result in the properties associated with a solid. The answer is:","completion":"Boiling the water will increase entropy. Entropy is a measure of the degree of disorder or randomness in a system. In the context of George's camping scenario, boiling the water will cause a phase transition from the liquid state to the gaseous state (vaporization). When the water is heated and reaches its boiling point, the water molecules gain enough energy to overcome the attractive forces that hold them together in the liquid state, making them move more freely and becoming water vapor (steam). In this gaseous state, the water molecules are no longer confined to a specific volume, and they can move and be dispersed throughout the container or environment. This increase in the number of possible arrangements of the water molecules and the higher degree of randomness are indicative of an increase in entropy. Conversely, a decrease in entropy would involve a system moving towards a more ordered state, such as a liquid freezing into a solid."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- After disrupting a national election, anti-government demonstrators in Thailand have vowed to keep up their campaign against Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra. The troubled election Sunday, which was boycotted by the main opposition party, appears unlikely to resolve Thailand's protracted political crisis, which has fueled bouts of deadly unrest in the Southeast Asian country. During the tense election process, anti-government protesters stopped candidates from registering, blocked delivery of ballot boxes and prevented people from casting their votes. As a result, voting was disrupted in 69 out of the country's 375 electoral districts, authorities said. The demonstrators have been protesting since November, saying they want to rid Thailand of the influence of Yingluck and her older brother, former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, who now lives in exile. The anti-government movement draws it support from southern Thailand,","completion":"particularly from the urban middle class and royalists, who view the Shinawatra family as corrupt and detrimental to the nation's progress; however, Yingluck's supporters, primarily from the rural north and northeastern regions, argue that her party's policies significantly improve their livelihoods and that she holds a legitimately elected position."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

By 2050 that number will be 70%. We are adding the equivalent of seven New York Cities to the planet every year. This unprecedented urbanization is a sign of economic and societal progress, especially in places such as China and in other emerging markets. But the scale and nature of the challenges facing cities mean that business as usual is not a viable option. More than ever before, the tradition of manufacturing as the key driver of urban economic growth is giving way to an economy based on brains and creativity. Competitive differentiation today is more likely to be based on a workforce's ability to foster innovation than on traditional strengths such as the exploitation of natural resources, physical labor or manufacturing prowess. In fact, according to a new IBM study, the demand for knowledge workers is expected to almost double by 2020 in maturing economies, while the demand for low-skilled employees is expected to decline dramatically. To prosper, cities will need to attract those highly skilled employees and create environments that foster knowledge-intensive businesses. They will have to engage in battles for talent for which many are ill-equipped, and focus more on the quality of jobs created--and the people who choose a city to create and fill those jobs--than on the mere quantity of new jobs. In the U.S., cities face an environment of shrinking municipal budgets and fiscal austerity. The good news, however, is that they already have much of what they need to become more livable while delivering cost savings and improved services to citizens. Much of it comes down to one thing: data. Cities can now, for the first time, make sense of the oceans of data that they collect and turn it into intelligence that can empower city officials to take positive action, especially in four crucial areas: education, transportation, public safety and health. Here are examples of how: Education To attract, retain and cultivate talent, cities must provide access to quality primary and secondary education, as well as lifelong learning for a highly skilled workforce. The paradox is that as the demand for and cost of education increases, budgets to support it are in most places static or shrinking. To manage the shortfall, cities are using information technology to take new approaches to teaching and learning, to increase access and to reduce costs. For example, Mobile County Public Schools, Alabama's largest school district, is applying data analytics to track student performance, identify at-risk students and enable teachers to address and resolve issues before they escalate--all in real-time--so they can prepare students with the right skills and reduce dropout and truancy rates. Transportation Well-managed, accessible public transportation attracts workers to cities, brings commuters to and from work and moves goods from production to consumption. One main challenge for cities is traffic congestion, which lowers air quality, creates noise pollution, diminishes public safety and incurs an annual cost of 87 billion in wasted fuel and lost productivity in the U.S. alone. Many cities are sitting on mounds of untapped data that could help them improve their transport systems. What are the most important parts of this news article?","completion":"The news article discusses the significant role of data in building the cities of the future amidst rapid urbanization. By 2050, 70% of the world's population is projected to be living in cities, leading to a shift from traditional manufacturing economies to knowledge-based economies. In order to prosper, cities need to attract highly skilled employees and foster innovation-driven businesses. Data can play a crucial role in making cities more livable and efficient in four key areas: education, transportation, public safety, and health. 1. Education: Cities need to provide access to quality education at all levels to attract, retain, and cultivate talent. As budgets for education become more constrained, information technology and data analytics are being used to improve teaching and learning methods, increase access, and reduce costs. One example: Mobile County Public Schools uses data analytics to track student performance and identify at-risk students in real-time. 2. Transportation: Accessible public transportation is vital for attracting workers to cities and maintaining productivity. There is a wealth of untapped data that cities can use to improve their transport systems. By addressing traffic congestion issues, which contribute to pollution, public safety risks, and lost productivity, cities can become more attractive and sustainable. In summary, this article emphasizes the importance of data in addressing the challenges posed by rapid urbanization and the shift towards knowledge-based economies. Cities that harness the power of data in areas such as education and transportation will be better equipped to attract highly skilled employees and foster innovative businesses, ultimately creating a more livable, sustainable, and prosperous urban environment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Harry Potter spoilers spread over Internet NEW YORK (AP) -- In the final days before the world learns whether Harry Potter lives or dies, spoilers -- or those pretending to spoil -- are spreading on the Internet. What's going to happen to Harry Potter? A number of Internet postings claim to have the answer. On Tuesday, digital images of what may be the entire text of \\"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,\\" including 36 chapters and a seven-page epilogue, were circulating among Web users. The book was apparently photographed as it lay on a carpet speckled with green and red, a hand at the bottom holding down the pages. A separate link, http://www.zendurl.com/h/hallows, also displayed a seven-page epilogue and a 36-chapter table of contents from \\"Deathly Hallows,\\" coming out July 21 under ultra-tight security. Similar information appeared Monday on http://spoilerboy.googlepages.com/home. Meanwhile, a resident of Vancouver, British Columbia, has said that he downloaded hundreds of pages from the 784-page book and U.S. publisher Scholastic, Inc., has been busy ordering would-be spoilers to remove their information from the Internet. \\"I'm guessing we're in the double digits,\\" says Scholastic spokeswoman Kyle Good, who added that requiring material to be pulled down did not mean it was authentic. \\"There's so much out there that it's confusing for fans.

According to Good, there is more than one version of the full Potter text on the Internet. She said the different versions all \\"looked convincing\\" and all had different content from each other. Leaked copies of other highly anticipated works have appeared online in recent years, from O.J. Simpson's canceled tale of murder, \\"If I Did It,\\" to \\"Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith,\\" which could be downloaded before the film's release with the help of a file-sharing program, BitTorrent, an apparent source of the full Potter book. Author J.K. Rowling, who has said two major characters will die, has begged the public not to give away the ending to her seventh and final Potter book. Fan sites such as The Leaky Cauldron (http://www.the-leaky-cauldron.org/) and MuggleNet (http://www.mugglenet.com) have vowed to keep spoilers away. \\"A lot or our tips about spoilers are coming from fans,\\" Good says. \\"There's a groundswell from fans who find these links and send them to us, saying, 'I'm not going to look at this, but somebody told me about it.' \\" \\"I just hope they find these people and punish them accordingly,\\" said Leaky Cauldron Web master Melissa Anelli. \\"This is exceedingly wrong and mean-spirited.

The Golden Boot, which is awarded to the top goal scorer in various football competitions, has multiple components that contribute to its overall structure and design. Let's break down the statement to provide a clearer understanding of its various parts. 1. Sterling silver: The main body of the Golden Boot award is made of solid sterling silver. Sterling silver is an alloy of silver that contains 92.5% by weight of silver and 7.5% by weight of other metals, usually copper, to strengthen the material. This high-quality silver alloy is known for its durability and brilliance, making it an attractive choice for many applications, including awards like the Golden Boot. 2. Silver gilt: Additionally, the main body of the Golden Boot also features silver gilt, which is a thin layer of gold applied to the surface of a silver object. This gilding process can involve a variety of methods, such as electroplating, chemical gilding, or mercury gilding, to achieve the desired appearance. Silver gilt adds a touch of luxury and opulence to the award, recognizing the exceptional achievements of the recipient. 3. Malachite: The plinth - the base on which the main body of the award rests - is made of malachite, a semi-precious stone. Malachite is a green, banded mineral consisting of copper carbonate hydroxide that is commonly used for decorative purposes, such as sculpture and jewelry, due to its vibrant hue and unique patterns. The choice to use malachite as the plinth material adds visual interest and a high-quality feel to the Golden Boot award. In conclusion, the statement accurately describes the materials that make up the prestigious Golden Boot award. The main body consists of solid sterling silver and silver gilt, offering durability, brilliance, and a luxurious appearance. The plinth is crafted from malachite, a semi-precious stone known for its striking green color and intricate patterns. Collectively, these materials create an eye-catching and impressive award befitting the achievements of the top goal scorer in a football competition."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","completion":"If less blood is carried to the kidneys due to the perturbation, it will result in the following effects on the process: 1. Reduced filtration rate: Since less blood is reaching the kidneys, the amount of blood available for filtration will decrease. This will reduce the filtration rate, and the filters may capture less waste as a result. 2. Possible waste accumulation: A reduced filtration rate means that the waste products may not be removed from the blood as efficiently as they should be. This could lead to a buildup of waste products in the blood, potentially causing health issues. 3. Decreased urine production: As the waste captured by the filters is less, the amount of waste combined with water to make urine will also decrease. This will result in a decrease in urine production and could lead to the bladder not filling up as quickly as it should. The supposed perturbation does have an indirect effect on the process because the reduced blood flow to the kidneys affects the efficiency of waste removal and urine production.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. I have watched quite a few Cold Case episodes over the years, beginning with Season 1 episodes back in 2003-2004. And while most have been good, this particular episode was not only the best of the best, but has few rivals in the Emmy categories. Though some may not agree with the story content (i.e. the male-to-male romantic relationship), I doubt that anyone could watch this without being deeply moved within their spirit. The story is essentially about a case that was reopened, based on the testimony from a dying drug dealer. The two central actors are two police officers in the 1960's named Sean Coop (aka, the cold case victim who goes by his last name, Coop) and his partner, Jimmy Bruno. In the story, Coop is single, a Vietnam war vet, with a deeply troubled past. Jimmy, however, is married, with children no less. Both are partners on the police force and form not only a friendship, but a secret romantic relationship that they both must hide from a deeply and obviously homophobic culture prevalent at that time. The flashback scenes of their lives are mostly in black and white, with bits of color now and then sprinkled throughout. Examples include their red squad car, the yellow curtains gently blowing by the window in Jimmy's bedroom, where Jimmy's wife watched Coop and Jimmy drink, fight, and then kiss each other while being in an alcohol-induced state. I found it interesting that only selected items were colored in the flashback scenes, with everything else in black and white. I still have not figured out the color scheme and rationale. The clearly homophobic tension between fellow patrol officers and the two central actors only heightens the intensity of the episode. One key emotional scene was when Coop was confronted by his father after the baptism of Jimmy's baby. In this scene, Coop's father, Sarge, who was a respected fellow officer on the force, confronts Coop about the rumors surrounding Coop's relationship with Jimmy. One can feel sorry for Coop, at this point, as the shame and disgrace of Coop's father was heaped upon Coop - \\"You are not going to disgrace our family...and you're not my son, either.\\" - clearly indicative of the hostile views of same-sex relationships of that era. Additional tension can also be seen in the police locker room where Coop and another officer go at it after Coop and Jimmy are labeled \\"Batman and Robin homos\\". As for the relationship between Coop and Jimmy, it's obvious that Coop wanted more of Jimmy in his life. Once can see the tension in Jimmy's face as he must choose between his commitment to his wife and kids, his church, and yet his undying devotion to Coop. In the end, Jimmy walks away from Coop, realizing that he cannot have both Coop and his family at the same time. Sadly, Coop is killed, perhaps because of his relationship with Jimmy, but Coop may also have been killed for his knowledge of drug money and police corruption that reached higher up in the force. The most moving scene in the whole episode was when Coop, as he sat dying from gunshot wounds in his squad car, quietly spoke his last words over his police radio to his partner: \\"Jimmy...we were the lucky ones. Don't forget that.\\" The soundtrack selection was outstanding throughout the episode. I enjoyed the final scene with the actor Chad Everett, playing the still grieving Jimmy, only much older by now, and clearly still missing his former partner, Coop. I highly recommend this episode and consider it the best. It is without a doubt the most well-written, well-acted, and well done of all Cold Case episodes that I've ever seen.

She has a secret crush on a handsome commuter named Peter Callaghan (Peter Gallagher), although they are complete strangers. On Christmas Day, she rescues him from the oncoming Chicago 'L' train after a group of muggers push him onto the tracks. He falls into a coma, and she accompanies him to the hospital, where a nurse overhears her musing aloud, \\"I was going to marry him.\\" Misinterpreting her, the nurse tells his family that she is his fiancÃ©e. At first she is too caught up in the panic to explain the truth. She winds up keeping the secret for a number of reasons: she is embarrassed, Peter's grandmother Elsie (Glynis Johns) has a heart condition, and Lucy quickly comes to love being a part of Peter's big, loving family. One night, thinking she is alone while visiting Peter, she confesses about her predicament. Peter's godfather Saul (Jack Warden) overhears the truth and later confronts her, but tells her he will keep her secret, because the accident has brought the family closer. With no family and few friends, Lucy becomes so captivated with the quirky Callaghans and their unconditional love for her that she cannot bring herself to hurt them by revealing that Peter does not even know her. She spends a belated Christmas with them and then meets Peter's younger brother Jack (Bill Pullman), who is supposed to take over his father's furniture business. He is suspicious of her at first, but he falls in love with her as they spend time together. They develop a close friendship and soon she falls in love with him as well.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Stephen Ray Vaughan (October 3, 1954 - August 27, 1990) was an American musician, singer, songwriter, and record producer. In spite of a short-lived mainstream career spanning seven years, he was one of the most influential guitarists in the revival of blues in the 1980s. AllMusic describes him as \\"a rocking powerhouse of a guitarist who gave blues a burst of momentum in the '80s, with influence still felt long after his tragic death.\\" Born and raised in Dallas, Texas, Vaughan began playing guitar at the age of seven, inspired by his older brother Jimmie. In September 1970, Vaughan made his first studio recordings with the band Cast of Thousands, which included future actor Stephen Tobolowsky. They recorded two songs, \\"Red, White and Blue\\" and \\"I Heard a Voice Last Night\\", for a compilation album, A New Hi, that featured various teenage bands from Dallas. In late January 1971, feeling confined by playing pop hits with Liberation, Vaughan formed his own band, Blackbird. After growing tired of the Dallas music scene, he dropped out of school and moved with the band to Austin, Texas, which had more liberal and tolerant audiences. There, Vaughan initially took residence at the Rolling Hills Country Club, a venue that would later become the Soap Creek Saloon. Blackbird played at several clubs in Austin and opened shows for bands such as Sugarloaf, Wishbone Ash, and Zephyr, but could not maintain a consistent lineup. In early December 1972, Vaughan left Blackbird and joined a rock band named Krackerjack; he performed with them for less than three months. In March 1973, Vaughan joined Marc Benno's band, the Nightcrawlers, after meeting Benno at a jam session years before. The band featured vocalist Doyle Bramhall, who met Vaughan when he was twelve years old. The next month, the Nightcrawlers recorded an album at Sunset Sound Recorders in Hollywood for A&M Records. While the album was rejected by A&M, it included Vaughan's first songwriting efforts, \\"Dirty Pool\\" and \\"Crawlin'\\". Soon afterward, he and the Nightcrawlers traveled back to Austin without Benno. In mid-1973, they signed a contract with Bill Ham, manager for ZZ Top, and played various gigs across the South, though many of them were disastrous. Ham left the band stranded in Mississippi without any way to make it back home and demanded reimbursement from Vaughan for equipment expenses; Ham was never reimbursed. In 1975, Vaughan joined a six-piece band called Paul Ray and the Cobras that included guitarist Denny Freeman and saxophonist Joe Sublett. For the next two-and-a-half years, he earned a living performing weekly at a popular venue in town, the Soap Creek Saloon, and ultimately the newly opened Antone's, widely known as Austin's \\"home of the blues\\". In late 1976, Vaughan recorded a single with them, \\"Other Days\\" as the A-side and \\"Texas Clover\\" as the B-side. Playing guitar on both tracks, the single was released on February 7, 1977. In March, readers of the Austin Sun voted them as Band of the Year. In addition to playing with the Cobras, Vaughan jammed with many of his influences at Antone's, including Buddy Guy, Hubert Sumlin, Jimmy Rogers, Lightnin' Hopkins, and Albert King. Vaughan toured with the Cobras during much of 1977, but near the end of September, after they decided to strive for a mainstream musical direction, he left the band and formed Triple Threat Revue, which included singer Lou Ann Barton, bassist W. C. Clark, and drummer Fredde Pharaoh. In January 1978, they recorded four songs in Austin, including Vaughan's composition \\"I'm Cryin'\\". The thirty-minute audio recording marks the only known studio recording of the band. did he ever perform with others","completion":"Yes, throughout his career, Stevie Ray Vaughan collaborated and performed with various musicians and bands. Besides his early years with bands such as Cast of Thousands, Liberation, Blackbird, Krackerjack, the Nightcrawlers, Paul Ray and the Cobras, and Triple Threat Revue, Vaughan formed his own band, 'Double Trouble', in 1978. Double Trouble initially featured bassist Jackie Newhouse, drummer Chris Layton, and vocalist Lou Ann Barton, but the lineup evolved over time, ultimately comprising Layton, bassist Tommy Shannon, and keyboardist Reese Wynans. Stevie Ray Vaughan and Double Trouble released four studio albums: 'Texas Flood' (1983), 'Couldn't Stand the Weather' (1984), 'Soul to Soul' (1985), and 'In Step' (1989). Prior to Vaughan's tragic death in a helicopter crash in 1990, the band recorded the live album 'In the Beginning' (1992) and the studio/live compilation 'The Sky Is Crying' (1991). In addition to his work with Double Trouble, Vaughan collaborated with numerous artists throughout his career. Some notable collaborations include: 1. In 1983, Vaughan contributed guitar to David Bowie's album 'Let's Dance', most notably on the tracks 'Let's Dance' and 'China Girl'. Vaughan was slated to join Bowie on his 'Serious Moonlight' tour but decided to focus on his own band and the release of 'Texas Flood' instead. 2. Vaughan worked with his brother Jimmie Vaughan, a guitarist and founding member of The Fabulous Thunderbirds, on several occasions. The brothers recorded the album 'Family Style' together, released in 1990 after Stevie's death. 3. He joined forces with acclaimed blues guitarist Albert King in 1983 to record the live television special 'In Session', which showcased their mutual admiration and ability to perform together despite their different playing styles. The performance was later released as an album in 1999. 4. In addition to sharing the stage with numerous blues legends such as Buddy Guy, Hubert Sumlin, Jimmy Rogers, Lightnin' Hopkins, and Albert Collins at various concerts and events, Vaughan often participated in jam sessions with various musicians in clubs. These collaborations and performances demonstrate Stevie Ray Vaughan's widespread influence and significant impact on the music community, particularly in the world of blues and rock guitar."},{"prompt":"Instructions: You are given a sentence in Italian.

Josh Mallon and Ace Lannigan are best friends and work aboard the same ship. As their ship returns to the US after a long voyage, they see all the other sailors being mistreated by their wives and girlfriends, and the two friends pledge never to get involved with women again. Unfortunately, this vow is tested almost immediately. First, Ace is confronted by the family of a former lover, Cherry, who insist he marry her. Then Josh, who is the son of rich shipping magnate, has to fend off his fiancee, Gloria, and his father's wishes that he settle down and take over the family business. Things get worse when Josh and Ace get caught up fishing and turn up late for a party to celebrate Josh's engagement. Gloria's hostile drunken brother starts a fistfight and a news reporter takes photographs that cause a scandal. Josh and Ace flee to Hawaii and then head for Singapore. However, the pair only get as far as the island of Kaigoon before their money runs out. They rescue Mima, an exotic local (but not native) from her abusive dance-partner, Caesar, and she moves into their hut. Soon Mima is running the two men's lives, much to their chagrin. The trio try to make money in several different ways, including trying to sell a spot remover that is so bad it dissolves clothes. When Josh's father finally locates his wayward son, he and Gloria fly out to bring Josh back to face his responsibilities. The resentful Caesar leads them to where Ace, Josh and Mima are enjoying a local feast. By this point, both Josh and Ace have fallen in love with Mima.

Write a negative yelp review (OPT: -negative. -positive.).","completion":"Title: A disappointing and lackluster experience As a loyal and frequent diner, it is extremely disheartening for me to write this review, but I feel compelled to share my recent negative experience at this once beloved restaurant. Upon entering the establishment, what used to exude a warm and inviting atmosphere now only resonated with dreariness and a concerning lack of enthusiasm. It appeared that the staff had lost their motivation - a sentiment which eventually trickled down to the quality of their food and service. The waiting time was the first red flag. Despite the restaurant being half-empty and several tables unoccupied, we still had to wait for nearly 20 minutes before being seated. This, of course, led to further disappointment as we realized just how inattentive and disorganized our server was. Our party's repeated inquiries about recommendations and the day's specials were only met with vague and uninterested responses. Once our orders were finally placed, I couldn't help but close my eyes and hope for the best, considering the inauspicious beginning to our dining experience. Evidently, luck was not on our side. It took a whopping 50 minutes to receive our appetizers, which arrived at our table cold and seemingly hastily prepared. The calamari we ordered was chewy and tasted as if it had been collected from the bottom of a long-forgotten freezer. The entrees were no better. The steak, which was ordered medium-rare, arrived well-done and was utterly devoid of flavor, aside from a heavy-handed application of salt. The vegetarian pasta, a dish that had previously been a staple of our visits to the restaurant, was clearly overcooked and swimming in what seemed to be mere oil and wilted, over-seasoned vegetables. The mounting disappointment only prompted us to skip dessert, lest we be served a rock-hard tiramisu or a lackluster lava cake. As we finally asked for the check, it became evident that even ending our dismal dining experience would be a struggle, as our server took their sweet time tallying our bill and processing the payment. Despite our obvious dissatisfaction and the clear downgrade in our dining experience, no staff member even attempted to rectify the situation or offer an apology for our troubles. In conclusion, it is with great sadness that I must give this formerly treasured restaurant a negative Yelp review. The slip in the quality of food, service, and overall ambiance has left a lasting stain on what used to be a favorite go-to spot. I truly hope management takes this review to heart and makes the necessary improvements before any further customers share in the disappointment I so wished to never experience myself."},{"prompt":"Q:Combine facts and answer this: Robert King (born 1959) is an American film and television writer and producer, married to Michelle King, who is also his writing partner, The couple created The Good Fight, an American legal and political drama television series produced, for CBS's streaming service, called what?

And, lets cut to the chase: everything about this film is bad. Its bad enough to laugh at and cry over. The Taekwondo action was over played and unrealistic in many instances. The evil eyes thing was cheesy. However, the left out ending would have been the only descent thing about it. They should have left the evil eyes ending in it. But instead somehow evil is defeated.

But Hadley's delicious oatmeal raisin cookies were calling to her. She walked down the stairs to the kitchen and put a few cookies on a plate. Then she poured a glass of milk. She wondered what Elmo was doing. Was he in the Media Room with Carsie? Their Media Room? Before Elmo and Carsie got together, Elmo and Macy used to spend hours almost every night in that room. Some nights he had almost kissed her. She left her milk and cookies on the kitchen counter and went down another flight of stairs, which came out in the Recreation Room. Macy could hear the sound of the TV coming from Media Room. She tiptoed to the open doorway and peeked in. There she was--that conniving slut--sitting where Macy should have been. How could Elmo have replaced her like that? She thought he had been falling in love with her. How could she have been so wrong? But it could still happen--if that woman would just go away.

The entrance opened on the only addition to the original farmhouse, a smallish room where the receptionist sat at one of two desks. The area was called the secretarial pod. The entrance to Ray's office, both medication and technician area, was right behind the secretary's desk. To the left was another door, kept closed, which led down the hallway to the client sleeping rooms, the dining room and the kitchen. There was a phone right inside the front door (or the back door, depending upon who you asked). When Ray wanted to smoke, he would lean out the front door, propping it open with his back in such a way that he could see down the hallway if he propped that door open as well and answer the phone should it ring. Smoking was prohibited inside the building, a policy which grew increasingly unpopular with both the staff and the clients as the course of the year wore on. By December, Ray would have to do weekly fire drills around three a.m. as a way of politely reminding his anti-social and policy impaired population that any building more than a century old was actually little more than well formed kindling. After enough of those, any problem he had been having with people smoking in the building usually went away. Given the right incentives, even this population could be relatively self-regulating.

Q: Which germ layers are essential for animal embryos to grow and develop into a body? A: Answer:","completion":"There are three germ layers that are essential for animal embryos to grow and develop into a body. They are: 1. Ectoderm: This is the outermost layer. I think of this first because it forms the skin and the nervous system, including the brain and spinal cord. These are critical systems without which an organism would not be able to exist or function. 2. Mesoderm: This is the middle layer. I remember this next because it forms the muscles, the skeletal system, the circulatory system, the excretory system, and most of the reproductive system. These systems are essential for the organism to move, excrete waste, circulate nutrients, and reproduce. 3. Endoderm: This is the innermost layer. This layer forms the lining of internal organs like the lungs, the digestive system, and the respiratory system. Again, these systems are essential for the organism to breathe, digest food, and excrete waste. Each of these germ layers develops into different and essential structures, which are critical for the life of an organism.

It is located on the western side of the country, where it comprises most of the wide and inhospitable Thar Desert (also known as the \\"Rajasthan Desert\\" and \\"Great Indian Desert\\") and shares a border with the Pakistani provinces of Punjab to the northwest and Sindh to the west, along the Sutlej-Indus river valley. Elsewhere it is bordered by the other Indian states: Punjab to the north; Haryana and Uttar Pradesh to the northeast; Madhya Pradesh to the southeast; and Gujarat to the southwest. Rajasthan is an economically backward region of India and has the highest percentage of unemployed youth in North India. Rajasthan is divided into 9 regions; Ajmer State, Hadoti, Dhundhar, Gorwar, Shekhawati, Mewar, Marwar, Vagad and Mewat which are equally rich in its heritage and artistic contribution. These regions have a parallel history which goes along with that of the state. - Western India consists of the states of Goa, Gujarat, Maharashtra and Rajasthan along with the Union territory of Daman and Diu and Dadra and Nagar Haveli of India. The region is highly industrialized, with a large urban population. Roughly, Western India is bounded by the Thar Desert in the northwest, the Vindhya Range in the north and the Arabian Sea in the west. A major portion of Western India shares the Deccan Plateau with South India. Before the partition of India, the now-Pakistani territories of Sindh and Balochistan were also included in this region. - Manabendra Nath Roy (21 March 1887 26 January 1954), born Narendra Nath Bhattacharya, was an Indian revolutionary, radical activist and political theorist, as well as a noted philosopher in the 20th century. Roy was a founder of the Mexican Communist Party and the Communist Party of India. He was also a delegate to congresses of the Communist International and Russia's aide to China. Following the rise of Joseph Stalin, Roy left the mainline communist movement to pursue an independent radical politics. In 1940 Roy was instrumental in the formation of the Radical Democratic Party, an organisation in which he played a leading role for much of the decade of the 1940s. Roy later moved away from Marxism to become an exponent of the philosophy of radical humanism. - The Arabian Sea is a region of the northern Indian Ocean bounded on the north by Pakistan and Iran, on the west by northeastern Somalia and the Arabian Peninsula, and on the east by India.

As minors are generally excluded, the concept is frequently described as \\"universal adult suffrage\\". Many countries make an exception for small numbers of adults that are considered mentally incapable of voting. Other countries also exclude people convicted of serious crimes or people in jail, but this is considered a violation of a basic human right in an increasing number of countries. In some countries, including the United States, it is very difficult and expensive for convicted criminals to regain this right even after having served their jail sentence. In any case, where universal suffrage exists, the right to vote is not restricted by race, sex, belief, wealth, or social status. - India, officially the Republic of India (\\"Bhrat Gaarjya\\"), is a country in South Asia.

His son Purushottam Mavalankar was later elected to the Lok Sabha twice from Gujarat . - An idea for a Constituent Assembly of India was proposed in 1934 by M. N. Roy, a pioneer of the Communist movement in India and an advocate of radical democracy. It became an official demand of the Indian National Congress in 1935, and was accepted by the British in August 1940. On 8 August 1940, a statement was made by Viceroy Lord Linlithgow about the expansion of the Governor-General's Executive Council and the establishment of a War Advisory Council. This offer, known as the August Offer, included giving full weight to minority opinions and allowing Indians to draft their own constitution. Under the Cabinet Mission Plan of 1946, elections were held for the first time for the Constituent Assembly. The Constitution of India was drafted by the Constituent Assembly, and it was implemented under the Cabinet Mission Plan on 16 May 1946. The members of the Constituent Assembly were elected by the provincial assemblies by a single, transferable-vote system of proportional representation. The total membership of the Constituent Assembly was 389: 292 were representatives of the states, 93 represented the princely states and four were from the chief commissioner provinces of Delhi, Ajmer-Mewar, Coorg (Near Madikeri) and British Baluchistan. - The Lok Sabha (House of the People) is the Lower house of India's bicameral Parliament, with the Upper house being the Rajya Sabha.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize this article: Before you touch the animal and try to move him, you should observe him from a distance. Look to see if the animal breathing normally. This means he is taking one breath every three to four seconds. Also notice if he is trying to get up and if so, watch to see if you can tell if his legs are damaged. If he doesn't try to get up, look for obvious injuries such as broken bones sticking through the skin, any excessive or noticeable bleeding, or the presence of gaping wounds. If you have decided that the animal needs immediate help and there is no emergency services on the way, you can approach the animal. As you approach the animal, you should move slowly and speak reassuringly to the animal. The animal will be scared and in pain, so calming tones will work best. Depending on the kind of animal or his size, you need to approach him in different ways. For a small, cat-sized animal, use a blanket or a coat to throw over the animal. This should prevent the cat or other small animal from turning and biting or lashing out with claws while you help him. You have a couple of different options for a dog. You should assume the dog will bite. You can throw the blanket over the dog's head, so his teeth are covered. What might work best, however, is to wrap a tie or a bandage around the dog's muzzle as a makeshift muzzle. Once the mouth is out of action, it is safer to examine the animal's injuries. No matter what method you use, make sure the animal can breath and you don't jostle him around too much. If you have to make a muzzle, make sure he has enough room left to pant and breath. The animal that you hit may go into shock. Animals can die from shock, even if they don't have physical injuries. Watch to see if he is panting, which is a sign of pain and shock. Other signs of shock include collapse, weakness, rapid breathing, pale gums, cold paws, slow capillary refill time, and lack of response to stimulus. If you see the animal in shock, you may need to help him on site before you take him to get help. Only do this is you feel it is necessary to save the animal's life. By the roadside, the amount of help you can give against shock is limited. In practical terms, the best you can do is keep the animal warm and get to professional help as soon as possible. Animals in shock have cold extremities because their circulation is struggling. If it is safe to touch the animal, you need to feel the temperature of the animal's paws. If they feel cool to the touch, he is suffering from chills and you need to wrap him up. For a domesticated animal with no obvious external injuries that need attention, cover the animal with a car rug, your coat, or a blanket. If the animal is small, wrap the coat right around the animal to insulate him from the ground. Never give pain relief medication to the dog. His body, especially in shock, will not absorb the medication and the drug will sit in his gut. This can cause serious gastric ulceration which could be life threatening further down the line. If the animal is bleeding or has an injury which need stabilizing, cover as much of the animal as you can. You should leave the bleeding area exposed for you to work on. If the wild animal seems dazed but has obvious external injuries, try to keep him warm while you wait for emergency services. Don't try to fix his wounds. If he is not recovering and remains dazed, his best chance of survival is being treated by a wildlife rehabilitation officer. If there is no help on the way, you need to transport the animal to the nearest facility. If the animal is merely winded, he may try to get up after a few minutes and wander off.

It provides guidelines on how to determine if the animal is in need of immediate help and the correct way to approach the animal. It advises observing the animal from a distance, checking for normal breathing, signs of injury, and the animal's overall condition. If you decide it needs assistance and there's no emergency service, approach the animal slowly and use a calming tone while speaking to it. For smaller animals like cats, use a blanket or coat to cover the animal to avoid being bitten or clawed. For dogs, assume the dog may bite, and create a makeshift muzzle using a tie or bandage around its muzzle. The article highlights the importance of ensuring the animal can breathe and is not jostled around. It further explains the signs of shock in animals, which can be fatal even without physical injuries. In case of shock, the best course of action is to keep the animal warm and seek professional help as soon as possible. The article warns against giving pain relief medication, as it might cause serious complications. If the animal is bleeding, cover it while leaving the injured area exposed. In the case of wild animals, do not try to fix their injuries, as their best chance of survival is to be treated by a wildlife rehabilitation officer.

PUBLISHED:. 16:33 EST, 9 August 2013. |. UPDATED:. 04:32 EST, 25 September 2013. Wind farms are being given around £30million a year in compensation to switch off or slow down their turbines because up to half the electricity they make is not needed. The cash, which comes from household bills, is paid when the National Grid is unable to cope with the extra power produced during high winds or periods of low demand. Known as ‘balancing’, the arrangement is intended to compensate firms for energy they are unable to sell. Waste of energy: Last weekend up to 30 wind farms were paid more than three million to switch off their turbines. But as the number of wind farms grows, the rates have hit record levels. Firms are often paid more to turn off their giant turbines than for the electricity they produce. Last weekend alone, householders handed £3.1million to energy firms for doing absolutely nothing as up to 30 wind farms were paid to switch off. The energy that could have been produced between Friday and Sunday would have powered up to 12,000 homes for a year. At one point, 40 per cent of all the wind energy set to be transmitted to the National Grid was instead discarded, with the loss being blamed on maintenance work and breezy conditions. More than 95 per cent of payments to energy firms last Saturday were to constrain energy produced by wind farms in Scotland because there is limited network capacity between Scotland and the rest of Britain creating a bottleneck of supply. Weekend of waste: The energy that could have been produced over three days by the unused wind turbines would have powered up to 12,000 homes for a year. The amount of wind energy discarded that day was almost twice as much as any other day on record, and cost families £1.9million. It was one of three days since May when wind farms were told to cut their output by more than a third. On June 30, 46 per cent of energy from turbines was constrained. In total, payments worth almost £15million have been made this year – more than double the amount given in all of 2012. If the trend continues, the bill for the year will be around £30million. The figures only relate to giant turbines connected to the national distribution network, which make up 70 per cent of wind power. There are 5,000 giant turbines across the country, with another 1,000 planned. Under EU law, Britain’s energy consumption from renewables needs to reach 15 per cent by 2020. Payments known as ‘forward trades’ are also made to energy operators by the National Grid. This is where it agrees a payout in advance when the weather is expected to be stormy. In 2011, £18.6million was paid in forward trades, although the figure is likely to be much lower this year. Both payments make up about 1 per cent of a typical household’s electricity spend, according to National Grid. A spokesman said costs were being driven down and the energy lost last weekend was ‘slightly above average’ owing to a combination of planned summer maintenance and high winds. But Dr John Constable, director of the Renewable Energy Foundation, said: ‘The increasing volume of discarded wind energy presents a very strong case for revising UK’s ambitious commitment to EU green targets. Allowing subsidised generators to name their price to stop causing problems is a lousy solution. Expensive energy: Over the first six months of 2013, energy companies have been paid almost £15million to slow down or turn off their wind turbines when the National Grid has been unable to cope. ‘They are abusing their position by holding a pistol to the head of Government and effectively saying we will not get off the grid unless you pay handsomely. Ofgem must do something about this. ‘It’s already a record year and it’s set to be a bumper one looking at the costs. We are on track to spend more on constraining wind than all of the previous years combined. And the problem just seems set to be getting worse.’ Generous taxpayer-funded subsidies for wind farms are set to continue until at least 2020. Onshore wind farms have been guaranteed at least £100 per megawatt hour, which is a unit of energy equal to using a million watts of power in one hour. This is double the current wholesale rate of £50. Offshore wind farms receive £150. Last weekend, two Scottish windfarms charged £200 per megawatt hour to shut off. With greater wind production becoming available all the time, experts warn the overall cost of these payments is set to rise. Energy analyst Mulu Sun said the spikes in constraint payments may be partly due to a lack of capacity, adding: ‘National Grid’s infrastructure should be keeping pace with the building of wind farms, but that is not necessarily the case. This can cause bottlenecks.’ A spokesman for Ofgem said: ‘We have powers to take action against licensed generators if we consider they are gaining excessive benefit when constraints occur.’ Maf Smith, of the wind industry body Renewable UK, said: ‘Wind is a flexible energy source that can be managed to fit our electricity demands by shutting down and powering up easier and quicker than other forms of energy. ‘That is partly why the National Grid calls on wind developers to constrain their power.’ Clarification. A previous article reported that nearly half the electricity produced by wind farms is being discarded. We are happy to clarify that this is the discard rate on particular days rather than an overall figure. What are the important parts of this article?","completion":"1.

The dry adiabatic lapse rate is 10 °C per km (5.5 °F per 1000 ft) of elevation or altitude. Therefore, moving up 100 metres (330 ft) on a mountain is roughly equivalent to moving 80 kilometers (45 miles or 0.75° of latitude) towards the pole.

Mays was born in 1931 in Westfield, Alabama. His father, Cat Mays, was a talented baseball player with the Negro team for the local iron plant. His mother, Annie Satterwhite, was a gifted basketball and track star in high school. His parents never married. In May 1972, 41-year-old Mays was traded to the Mets for pitcher Charlie Williams and 50,000 (292,522 today). At the time, the Giants franchise was losing money. Owner Horace Stoneham could not guarantee Mays a pension after retirement and the Mets offered Mays a coaching position upon his retirement. Mays had remained popular in New York long after the Giants had left for San Francisco, and the trade was seen as a public relations coup for the Mets. Mets owner Joan Payson, who was a minority shareholder of the Giants when the team was in New York, had long desired to bring Mays back to his baseball roots and was instrumental in making the trade. In his Mets debut on a rainy Sunday afternoon at Shea Stadium on May 14, 1972, Mays put New York ahead to stay with a fifth-inning home run against Don Carrithers and his former team, the Giants. On August 16, 1973 of the following season, in a game against the Cincinnati Reds with Don Gullett on the mound, Mays hit a fourth inning solo home run over the right-center field fence. It was the 660th, and last, home run of his major league career. Mays played a season and a half with the Mets before retiring; he appeared in 133 games. The Mets honored him on September 25, 1973, (Willie Mays Night) where he thanked the New York fans and said goodbye to baseball. He finished his career in the 1973 World Series, which the Mets lost to the Oakland Athletics in seven games. Mays got the first hit of the Series, but had only seven at-bats (with two hits). The final hit of his career came in Game 2, a key single to help the Mets win. He also fell down in the outfield during a play where he was hindered by the glare of the sun and by the hard outfield. Mays later said, \\"growing old is just a helpless hurt.\\" His final at bat came on October 16, in Game 3 where he came in as a pinch hitter but grounded into a force play. Mays made his 20th and last All-Star appearance (20 seasons) and 24th All-Star Game appearance on July 24, 1973 when he was used as a pinch hitter. In 1972 and 1973, Mays was the oldest regular position player in baseball. At age 42, he became the oldest position player to appear in a World Series game. Mays retired after the 1973 season with a lifetime batting average of .302 and 660 home runs. His lifetime total of 7,095 outfield putouts remains the major league record. Mays is the only major league player to have hit a home run in every inning from the 1st through the 16th innings. He finished his career with a record 22 extra-inning home runs.

Tony Hall visit the country next week to assess a humanitarian crisis that has festered since the Gulf War of 1990, Hall's office said Monday. The Dayton Democrat, who has traveled to other crisis points including Sierra Leone and North Korea, will spend three days visiting hospitals and other facilities to seek understanding why aid has been ineffective in stemming malnourishment and other medical problems. Iraq has been under economic sanctions since the war ended, which some say have thwarted the country's ability to recover from the devastation of the bombing campaign. The Persian Gulf War destroyed much of the country's medical infrastructure, according to a report by the World Health Organization. In 1996 the WHO found that much of the population existed in a state of \`\`semi-starvation.'' Hall will be only the second member of Congress to travel in Iraq since the war, according to Hall's office. The last visitor was then-U.S. Rep. Bill Richardson of New Mexico, who went to help a pair of U.S. oilmen in diplomatic trouble. Hall flies to Amman, Jordan, on Friday, where he'll spend the night before driving to Iraq. Flights are not permitted into Iraq. Hall is to return to Washington on April 22.

Combine the terms with the variable d: Since both terms on the right side of the equation involve the variable d, combine them by adding or subtracting their coefficients. -96 = (53 - 21)*d 2. Calculate the new coefficient for the variable d: Subtract 21 from 53 to find the new coefficient for d. 53 - 21 = 32 So, the equation now becomes: -96 = 32*d 3. Isolate the variable d: To isolate d, you need to divide both sides of the equation by 32. d = -96 / 32 4. Calculate the value of d: Now, divide -96 by 32: d = -3 So, the value of d is -3.

Genetically modified organisms (GMO) are organisms whose genetic material has been altered by genetic engineering techniques generally known as recombinant DNA technology. Genetic engineering has expanded the genes available to breeders to utilize in creating desired germlines for new crops. Increased durability, nutritional content, insect and virus resistance and herbicide tolerance are a few of the attributes bred into crops through genetic engineering. For some, GMO crops cause food safety and food labeling concerns. Numerous countries have placed restrictions on the production, import or use of GMO foods and crops. Currently a global treaty, the Biosafety Protocol, regulates the trade of GMOs. There is ongoing discussion regarding the labeling of foods made from GMOs, and while the EU currently requires all GMO foods to be labeled, the US does not.Herbicide-resistant seed has a gene implanted into its genome that allows the plants to tolerate exposure to herbicides, including glyphosate. These seeds allow the farmer to grow a crop that can be sprayed with herbicides to control weeds without harming the resistant crop. Herbicide-tolerant crops are used by farmers worldwide. With the increasing use of herbicide-tolerant crops, comes an increase in the use of glyphosate-based herbicide sprays. In some areas glyphosate resistant weeds have developed, causing farmers to switch to other herbicides. Some studies also link widespread glyphosate usage to iron deficiencies in some crops, which is both a crop production and a nutritional quality concern, with potential economic and health implications.Other GMO crops used by growers include insect-resistant crops, which have a gene from the soil bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), which produces a toxin specific to insects. These crops resist damage by insects. Some believe that similar or better pest-resistance traits can be acquired through traditional breeding practices, and resistance to various pests can be gained through hybridization or cross-pollination... Two neighboring farms used different farming methods. Hill farm used GMO seeds, fertilizers and pesticides. Valley farm used only organic methods and non-GMO seeds. Which farm will grow fewer crops with increased germlines? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Valley farm, which uses only organic methods and non-GMO seeds, is more likely to grow fewer crops with increased germlines compared to Hill farm that uses GMO seeds, fertilizers, and pesticides. This is because GMO seeds have been genetically modified to enhance various attributes, such as resistance to pests, diseases, and environmental factors, as well as improved yield potential. The use of GMO seeds at Hill farm allows for the harnessing of these benefits, leading to greater crop production and the possibility of creating new crop varieties with enhanced genetic traits. Additionally, the utilization of fertilizers and pesticides provides further protection for the crops and promotes optimal growth, leading to higher yields. On the other hand, Valley farm's organic approach and non-GMO seeds limit its access to the advantages provided by genetic engineering. As a result, the crops grown at Valley farm may be more susceptible to pests, diseases, and environmental stressors, which can lead to decreased crop production. Furthermore, without the genetic modifications present in GMO seeds, Valley farm is less likely to experience the enhanced genetic traits and germlines present in GMO crops. It is important to recognize that the comparison between the two farms depends on several factors beyond the use of genetically modified seeds, such as soil quality, climate, farming practices, and crop management. However, when evaluating the potential for increased germlines and crop production purely based on the use of GMOs, Hill farm is likely to grow more crops with enhanced genetic traits compared to Valley farm."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What's the first name of the person that the beautiful blonde has an affair with? About to nervously jump off a bridge, scrawny Harry Berlin is a barely functional human being. Just as he attempts to leap off the bridge, he is distracted by Milt Manville, an old friend from fifteen years ago. Harry doesn't really recognize him at first but there appears to be a contrast between the two of them with Milt boasting of how well he is doing in life while Harry tries to listen. Milt takes Harry to his house to meet Ellen Manville (Elaine May), Milt's long-suffering wife. She is complaining that their sex life is non-existent but Milt has a secret lover in the form of beautiful blonde Linda. Milt convinces a barely-there Harry to make a go of things with Ellen so that she is not left lonely when he will divorce her for Linda. It takes a while but Harry and Ellen eventually fall in love. They marry and go to Niagara Falls for their honeymoon but this is when Ellen realizes that Harry is the world's worst roommate and childish at heart. In one example, Harry unexpectedly stomps on Ellen's toe in order to test her love for him. As she hobbles in pain, she asks, \\"What did you do that for?,\\" and in response, he asks her if she still loves him, and she says she does. As Milt and Linda start to settle down as a couple, she quickly realizes that he has an addiction to selling household items and junk for a quick buck, something that she is strongly against. She immediately dumps him, which leads to Milt to want Ellen back when he realizes how much he loves her for real. She admits that she doesn't really love Harry as much as she thought, as his bizarre day-to-day activities get to her. Milt and Ellen plot to get back together and convince Harry to divorce her but he loves her and sets out to prove it by getting a job as an elevator operator in a shopping mall.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more ice forms in the cloud happens, how will it affect LESS waste being removed from the body. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","completion":"No, the perturbation you proposed -- more ice forming in clouds -- does not have a direct or indirect impact on the kidney's function of waste removal from the body. The formation of ice in clouds is a meteorological event, primarily affecting weather systems and patterns. Meanwhile, the kidney's function of waste removal works independently of external weather conditions. It's likely that such changes in the environment do not have a physiological effect on how kidneys process and remove waste from the bloodstream. However, overall hydration and health can be influenced by the larger environment and climate, but these effects do not directly link to the process described.

Rachel was calmed by the pig because Rachel has been attacked by one before and Samantha owns a farm.. b). Samantha was calmed by the pig because Rachel has been attacked by one before and Samantha owns a farm.. Answer:","completion":"Answer: b). Samantha was calmed by the pig because Rachel has been attacked by one before and Samantha owns a farm. Explanation: In this sentence, we learn that Samantha is the one who is feeling calm upon encountering the pig. This is presumably because she has experience with pigs since she owns a farm and understands how to handle them in a safe and responsible manner. On the other hand, we learn that Rachel has had a negative experience with a pig in the past by being attacked by one, which may have resulted in her being fearful or anxious around these animals. Therefore, it would not make logical sense for Rachel to be calmed by the presence of a pig, given her past experiences. Additionally, the sentence implies that Samantha's farm ownership and familiarity with pigs are what brings her the sense of calm in the situation, given her understanding of how to interact with them properly. This likely allows her to feel more in control and at ease, knowing she can avoid any potential harm to herself or others. This answer provides a detailed context for the selected sentence and establishes a clear relationship among the characters, their experiences, and reactions to the presence of the pig. Furthermore, this selection highlights the importance of past experiences and personal knowledge in shaping one's reactions and emotions in different situations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The capital, and largest city, is Baghdad. The main ethnic groups are Arabs and Kurds; others include Assyrians, Turkmen, Shabakis, Yazidis, Armenians, Mandeans, Circassians, and Kawliya. Around 95% of the country's 36 million citizens are Muslims, with Christianity, Yarsan, Yezidism, and Mandeanism also present. The official languages of Iraq are Arabic and Kurdish. - Prince Zeid bin Hussein , GCVO , GBE ( Arabic : ; February 28 , 1898 -- October 18 , 1970 ) was an Iraqi prince who was a member of the Hashemite dynasty and the head of the Royal House of Iraq from 1958 until his death . - The Yazidis (also Yezidis, \\"Êzidî\\") are an ethnically Kurdish religious community or an ethno-religious group indigenous to northern Mesopotamia (see also Ezidkhan) who are strictly endogamous. Their religion, \\"Yazidism\\" is linked to ancient Mesopotamian religions and combines aspects of Zoroastrianism, Islam, Christianity and Judaism. Yazidis who marry non-Yazidis are automatically considered to be converted to the religion of their spouse and therefore are not permitted to call themselves Yazidis. They live primarily in the Nineveh Province of Iraq. Additional communities in Armenia, Georgia, Turkey, Iran, and Syria have been in decline since the 1990s as a result of significant migration to Europe, especially to Germany. The Yazidis' cultural practices are observably Kurdish, and almost all speak Kurmanji (Northern Kurdish). The Soviet Union considered the Yazidis to be Kurds, as does Sharaf Khan Bidlisi's \\"Sheref-nameh\\" of 1597, which cites seven of the Kurdish tribes as being at least partly Yazidi, and Kurdish tribal confederations as containing substantial Yazidi sections. - A Christian (or ) is a person who follows or adheres to Christianity, an Abrahamic, monotheistic religion based on the life and teachings of Jesus Christ. \\"Christian\\" derives from the Koine Greek word \\"Christós\\" (), a translation of the Biblical Hebrew term \\"mashiach\\". - Christianity is a monotheistic religion based on the life and teachings of Jesus Christ, who serves as the focal point for the religion.

She and a coworker couldn’t see eye-to-eye on a project. Should they ask the client to postpone the deadline in order to complete testing or should they deliver a product that wasn’t quite there? “By the time 10 emails had been sent, I was seriously beyond frustrated. We weren’t getting any closer to resolving the situation. I had to do something.” For Cutrone, that “something” was cc’ing their direct supervisor. “It really felt like the right thing to do. The way I saw it, he would see what was happening, step in and make the decision we were unable to make. End of argument.” Wrong. Unfortunately, Cutrone’s “cc’ing up” was a bad career move. Her coworker was furious and her supervisor was not just let in on a revealing email chain, but saw Cutrone’s decision to do so as both self-serving and immature. Shortly after, Cutrone left the company, embarrassed, she says, but much wiser. A decision she made with the best intentions had been perceived as the worst. Instead of efficient, she was seen as undermining. Instead of gracious, petty. According to experts, she’s not alone. Email makes up the majority of our daily communication—especially in business. According to the Pew Research Center, the majority of employed adults (62%) use the internet or email in the workplace. And yet social cues and etiquette are often overlooked. The problem, it seems, is that communication through email can bring out the worst of competitive or controlling behavior. “It’s a very weird dynamic that has happened,” says Cherie Kerr, the founder of ExecuProv, an executive coaching seminar series that borrows from improvisational comedy and the author of The Bliss or “Diss” Connection: Email Etiquette for the Business Professional. “People do or say things via email that they would never do in person. They’d never upstage a higher up in a meeting, but in email there’s this disconnected feeling of not having to look anyone in the eye that emboldens people to act in competitive or even arrogant ways.” “Emily Post was not around when email began,” agrees Marsha Egan, author of the book Inbox Detox and the Habit of Email Excellence. “So people have to make up their own rules. What one person might see as absolutely fine, another might find offensive. That being said, the basis of all etiquette is respect.” Respect, she says, is what Cutrone was lacking in her decision to invite her boss into her disagreement with her coworker. Here, Egan and Kerr take on Cutrone’s misstep and other serious email faux pas—to explain how even the best intentions can be misread—and what the better tack to take might be.

This small, romantic act of kindness shows them that you’re thinking of them. It also reflects commitment and honor, two important elements of chivalry. For example, simple texts like “Hey, just wanted to tell you good morning” or “Good morning! I’ll be thinking of you today” can really brighten your partner’s day. If there’s someone behind you, help them by holding the door regardless of their gender or whether you know them. This kind of common courtesy is an important part of chivalry. For example, if you see someone coming in behind you with their arms full, you should hold the door for them. You should also hold the door for your partner, but only if they’re comfortable with it. Some people like to open the door for themselves as a sign of independence. This is another chivalrous action previously reserved just for women. However, you should apply this kindness to anyone who isn’t as physically fit and may need a seat, such as a pregnant, ill, or elderly person. For example, if you’re sitting on the bus and you see an elderly woman standing up, you could say, “Excuse me, ma’am, would you like this seat?” and offer her your spot. If you see someone being mistreated or bullied, chivalry means stepping in and helping the victim. Stepping in can be difficult to do in the moment, but standing up for others can also be as simple as asking the victim if they need any help or calling for help from a law enforcement official or another bystander. Standing up for others shows chivalrous qualities such as bravery, honor, and loyalty to your principles. For example, if you see someone being harassed on the subway or the street, you could step in and ask the victim if they need any help. This takes the attention away from the harasser and gives the victim some control over the situation. If you don’t feel comfortable intervening or the situation seems risky, you can also approach the victim afterwards and ask them if they need help. Whether you’re interacting with a family member, a significant other, or a stranger, being respectful is an essential part of chivalry. You can show respect through being polite, listening carefully, and valuing others’ opinions. For example, always be respectful to waitstaff at restaurants. When they bring you your food or refill your water glass, remember to say thank you instead of just ignoring the action. If your significant other is telling you about their day, you can show them respect by listening attentively and asking questions to show them that you’re interested.

Multi-choice problem: Continue writing the next sentence in this paragraph: How to buy a car in the usa as a foreigner Shop for a car you can afford. Getting a car loan is not impossible as a newcomer to the u.s., but there are some additional difficulties. Start out by shopping around, perhaps for a used car, that will be cheaper. Available choices: a). Alternatively, you could go to a nearby dealership to branch out of your current vehicle, and possibly for a less expensive option. Dealerships can also offer their own car to foreigners to borrow.; b). Most car dealerships will only take used cars. While most dealerships will only loan in cash, if they have a lower interest rate, you can expect a lower interest rate.; c). If you can afford to pay cash, then you won't need to worry about financing. Research the lenders' credit requirements.; d). Some dealerships may charge a higher interest rate for cars built for ease of maintenance, because of non-recourse credit card business. This, however, isn't always possible.;","completion":"In this scenario, it is best to consider all of your options when purchasing a car as a foreigner in the United States. One possibility is to visit a nearby dealership to explore different vehicles and potentially find a more affordable option (choice a). Dealerships may also offer cars to foreigners to borrow, which could be a helpful solution if you are not planning to stay in the country for an extended period of time. However, keep in mind that most car dealerships will only take used cars as trade-ins, and while many dealerships will only loan in cash, if they have a lower interest rate, you can expect a lower interest rate, thus making the car more affordable (choice b). Comparing interest rates across various dealerships can help you find the best deal for your situation. If you have saved enough money and are able to pay cash outright, there is no need to worry about financing (choice c). This can significantly reduce the overall cost of the car by avoiding interest payments. Research the lenders' credit requirements to get a better understanding of what to expect when purchasing a car as a foreigner. Another factor to consider is that some dealerships may charge a higher interest rate for cars that are built for ease of maintenance due to non-recourse credit card business (choice d). Although this may not always be possible, it is important to be aware of such possibilities when shopping for a car. In summary, purchasing a car as a foreigner in the United States can be challenging, but it is not impossible. By researching interest rates, comparing dealership options, considering paying cash or exploring loans, and acquainting oneself with credit requirements, you can successfully navigate the process and find a car that suits your needs and budget."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Sessions was speaking about freedom of speech on college campuses when the chant broke out at the Turning Point USA High School Leadership Summit at George Washington University. Story Continued Below “I like this bunch, I gotta tell ya, you’re not going to be backing down. Go get ‘em! Go get em’!” Sessions said, when the audience started yelling “Lock her up!” — a staple of Trump’s political rallies that refers to Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server while she was secretary of state. Chuckling and repeating the chant once himself, Sessions then attempted to move on before saying, “I heard that a long time over the last campaign.” The remarkable comment by an attorney general of the United States follows other moves by Trump and his aides that have alarmed not only Trump critics but other fellow Republicans. Trump set off a firestorm by expressing openness to handing over former U.S. ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul to Moscow for an interrogation if special counsel Robert Mueller’s team was allowed to question a dozen Russian intelligence agents indicted earlier this month. When Putin floated the idea, Trump called it an “incredible offer” during a news conference last week. The White House caught more heat when press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Trump would consider revoking the security clearances of former intelligence and law enforcement officials who have publicly criticized the president, including former CIA Director John Brennan and former FBI Director James Comey. Trump has also continued to revel in the “Lock her up!” chant at his rallies, and the high school student crowd at the leadership summit has broken out in the chant multiple times this week. The summit runs through Thursday and features speakers such as Donald Trump Jr., Sen. Rand Paul, British politician Nigel Farage and U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley. ||||| Attorney General Jeff Sessions delivered a blistering attack on campus culture in front of a group of conservative high school students on Tuesday, saying that colleges are creating a generation of “supercilious snowflakes.” “Rather than molding a generation of mature, well-informed adults, some schools are doing everything they can to create a generation of sanctimonious, sensitive, supercilious snowflakes,” Sessions said during a speech at Turning Point USA's High School Leadership Summit in Washington. Sessions focused much of his address on railing against what he called the suppression of free speech on college campuses and hostility against conservative students. He added that instead of fostering open debate on campus, school administrations are bowing to liberal ideologies and “coddling students” with trigger warnings, crying rooms and therapy sessions. “Too many schools are coddling students,” Sessions said. “There was a ‘cry-in’ at Cornell after the 2016 election, therapy dogs at the University of Kansas. … I hope they had plenty of tissues.” Referencing his time at Huntingdon College in Alabama, Sessions said that conservative students today face even tougher treatment from their more-liberal peers than they did when he was in school during the turbulent 1960s. “The hostility was not as great then as it is today on college campuses,” he said. “Stand strong for what you believe in.” Sessions called out a number of schools – including Middlebury College in Vermont and the University of California, Berkeley – that he says have actively tried to silence conservative speakers. Last spring, students protested a scheduled lecture by controversial sociologist Dr. Charles Murray. The incident at Middlebury College eventually turned violent, with protesters shouting down Murray and even putting a professor in the hospital. At Berkeley, which last year saw a number of oftentimes violent protests ahead of planned speeches by conservative figures such as Ann Coulter and Ben Shapiro, school officials have vehemently denied that they have acted to suppress conservative voices on campus or condoned any violence against them. “This university cannot and will not tolerate the harassment of its students, particularly when they are being targeted simply as a result of who they are or what they believe in,” UC Berkeley spokesperson Dan Mogulof told Fox News earlier this year. Mogulof added that there is a common misperception that UC-Berkeley only promotes liberal ideologies. “This is not the 1960s anymore,” he said. “Our student body is more diverse than it has ever been.” ||||| Twitter libs are outraged this morning after Attorney General Jeff Sessions chuckled along with high school students who started a “Lock her up!” (and note how CNN executive producer Jason Morrell adds his spin to the video.

Honours and legacy In 1929, Soviet writer Leonid Grossman published a novel The d'Archiac Papers, telling the story of Pushkin's death from the perspective of a French diplomat, being a participant and a witness of the fatal duel. The book describes him as a liberal and a victim of the Tsarist regime. In Poland the book was published under the title Death of the Poet. In 1937, the town of Tsarskoye Selo was renamed Pushkin in his honour. There are several museums in Russia dedicated to Pushkin, including two in Moscow, one in Saint Petersburg, and a large complex in Mikhaylovskoye. Pushkin's death was portrayed in the 2006 biographical film Pushkin: The Last Duel. The film was directed by Natalya Bondarchuk. Pushkin was portrayed onscreen by Sergei Bezrukov. The Pushkin Trust was established in 1987 by the Duchess of Abercorn to commemorate the creative legacy and spirit of her ancestor and to release the creativity and imagination of the children of Ireland by providing them with opportunities to communicate their thoughts, feelings and experiences. A minor planet, 2208 Pushkin, discovered in 1977 by Soviet astronomer Nikolai Stepanovich Chernykh, is named after him. A crater on Mercury is also named in his honour. MS Alexandr Pushkin, second ship of the Russian Ivan Franko class (also referred to as \\"poet\\" or \\"writer\\" class). Station of Tashkent metro was named in his honour. The Pushkin Hills and Pushkin Lake were named in his honour in Ben Nevis Township, Cochrane District, in Ontario, Canada.

His work is seen as a cornerstone of Russian literature, and his influence on future generations of writers and poets cannot be underestimated. Pushkin's contributions to the fields of literature, linguistics, and national identity have given him a prominent place in Russian history. There are multiple museums, monuments, and plaques dedicated to celebrating Pushkin's life and works. One example is the Pushkin House, a complex of buildings near St. Petersburg, which was once the poet's family estate. It is now a museum and a center for the study of his life and work. Additionally, many Russian schools, streets, and cultural institutions bear his name, further ingraining the importance of his contributions within the fabric of the nation. Internationally, Pushkin has been commemorated through various events and initiatives. The United Nations designated June 6th, his birthday, as Russian Language Day to promote the teaching and learning of the Russian language, further highlighting his contributions to linguistics.

Translate to Czech","completion":"\\"Myšleno z hlediska fotografie.\\" Above is the translation of \\"I mean, from a photography standpoint.\\" to Czech. However, I would like to further explain the term to provide more context to the translation. The phrase \\"from a photography standpoint\\" means looking at something concerning its photographic elements or properties. In Czech, there isn't a direct word for word translation of the phrase, but it is generally understood as \\"z hlediska fotografie\\" which roughly translates to \\"from the viewpoint of photography.\\" Here \\"hlediska\\" means viewpoint or perspective, and \\"fotografie\\" is the Czech word for photography. This may include taking into account aspects like lighting, composition, perspective, or color when analyzing or appreciating a scene or subject, usually in preparation for photographing it. This concept covers a broad range of considerations, from technical settings on a camera to artistic decisions about framing and angle. Photography as an art form may differ between cultures, and this is reflected in the language used to describe it. Thus when translating phrases that include specialized language like \\"from a photography standpoint,\\" it's important to understand both the technical and cultural connotations of the terms. In Czech, photography is widely appreciated as an art form and the language has a rich lexicon of terms to describe different aspects of it. To give you a more nuanced insight, Czech photographers, like those in many other countries, consider such things as světlo (light), kompozice (composition), perspektiva (perspective), and barva (color). They may discuss these elements from a specific hledisko, or standpoint, such as that of a photographer. So the phrase \\"z hlediska fotografie\\" encompasses all these layers of meaning."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below. Which researcher learned less about bromine gases? Two researchers studied air quality over the North Pole, and over Antarctica. Dan was more fond of the south pole, so he studied Antarctica, while Colt liked reading about the North Pole. Hint: Unfortunately, the layer of good ozone is being destroyed by air pollution. The chief culprits are chlorine and bromine gases. They are released in aerosol sprays, coolants, and other products. Loss of ozone has created an ozone hole over Antarctica. Ozone depletion results in higher levels of UV radiation reaching Earth. In humans, this increases skin cancers and eye cataracts. It also disturbs the nitrogen cycle, kills plankton, and disrupts ocean food webs. The total loss of the ozone layer would be devastating to most life. Its rate of loss has slowed with restrictions on pollutants, but it is still at risk.

Movie title: A Trip to the Moon Context: At a meeting of the Astronomic Club, its president, Professor Barbenfouillis, proposes a trip to the Moon. After addressing some dissent, five other brave astronomers: Nostradamus, Alcofrisbas, Omega, Micromegas, and Parafaragaramus agree to the plan. They build a space capsule in the shape of a bullet, and a huge cannon to shoot it into space. The astronomers embark and their capsule is fired from the cannon with the help of \\"marines\\" (most of whom are played by a bevy of young women in sailors' outfits). The Man in the Moon watches the capsule as it approaches, and it hits him in the eye.Landing safely on the Moon, the astronomers get out of the capsule (without the need of space suits) and watch the Earth rise in the distance. Exhausted by their journey, they unroll their blankets and sleep. As they sleep, a comet passes, the Big Dipper appears with human faces peering out of each star, old Saturn leans out of a window in his ringed planet, and Phoebe, goddess of the Moon, appears seated in a crescent-moon swing. Phoebe causes a snowfall that awakens the astronomers, and they seek shelter in a cavern where they discover giant mushrooms. One astronomer opens his umbrella; it promptly takes root and turns into a giant mushroom itself.At this point, a Selenite (an insectoid alien inhabitant of the Moon, named after one of the Greek moon goddesses, Selene) appears, but it is killed easily by an astronomer, as the creatures explode if they are hit with force. More Selenites appear and it becomes increasingly difficult for the astronomers to destroy them as they are surrounded. The Selenites capture the six astronomers and take them to the palace of their king. An astronomer lifts the Selenite King off his throne and throws him to the ground, causing him to explode.The astronomers run back to their capsule while continuing to hit the pursuing Selenites, and five get inside.

He is the one who proposes the idea of a trip to the Moon during a meeting with fellow astronomers and embarks on the journey along with Nostradamus, Alcofrisbas, Omega, Micromegas, and Parafaragaramus. \\"A Trip to the Moon\\" is a pioneering silent film from French director Georges Méliès, released in 1902. The story is inspired by a range of influential science fiction books, including Jules Verne's \\"From the Earth to the Moon\\" and H. G. Wells' \\"The First Men in the Moon.\\" The film is known for its innovative special effects, storytelling, and early exploration of the science fiction genre in cinema. It has been recognized as one of the most important films in the history of the medium, and its iconic image of the Man in the Moon being hit in the eye with a space capsule has been reproduced and referenced in numerous media. In the film, Professor Barbenfouillis and his fellow astronomers embark on a fantastical adventure to the Moon in a bullet-shaped capsule fired from a large cannon. Their exciting journey includes encounters with strange creatures, celestial beings, and lunar landscapes. Upon their arrival on the Moon, the astronomers experience various spectacles and interact with the Selenites, who are the insectoid alien inhabitants of the lunar surface. The Selenites, named after the Greek moon goddess Selene, capture and bring the astronomers to their king's palace. Facing imminent danger, the astronomers fight back, causing several Selenites, including their king, to explode after being hit with force. The astronomers manage to escape, and five of them return to the capsule. Professor Barbenfouillis, the sixth astronomer, uses a rope to tip the capsule over a ledge and back into space while fending off pursuing Selenites. The film concludes with the capsule returning safely to Earth. Despite being a silent film, \\"A Trip to the Moon\\" conveys a captivating and imaginative story through visuals and special effects that were groundbreaking at the time. Professor Barbenfouillis, as the president of the Astronomic Club and the film's central protagonist, leads the expedition to the Moon and proves to be an influential figure, showcasing humanity's curiosity and prowess in venturing into the unknown realms of outer space."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Electrolytic capacitors use an aluminum or tantalum plate with an oxide dielectric layer. The second electrode is a liquid electrolyte, connected to the circuit by another foil plate. Electrolytic capacitors offer very high capacitance but suffer from poor tolerances, high instability, gradual loss of capacitance especially when subjected to heat, and high leakage current. Poor quality capacitors may leak electrolyte, which is harmful to printed circuit boards. The conductivity of the electrolyte drops at low temperatures, which increases equivalent series resistance. While widely used for power-supply conditioning, poor high-frequency characteristics make them unsuitable for many applications. Electrolytic capacitors will self-degrade if unused for a period (around a year), and when full power is applied may short circuit, permanently damaging the capacitor and usually blowing a fuse or causing failure of rectifier diodes (for instance, in older equipment, arcing in rectifier tubes). They can be restored before use (and damage) by gradually applying the operating voltage, often done on antique vacuum tube equipment over a period of 30 minutes by using a variable transformer to supply AC power. Unfortunately, the use of this technique may be less satisfactory for some solid state equipment, which may be damaged by operation below its normal power range, requiring that the power supply first be isolated from the consuming circuits. Such remedies may not be applicable to modern high-frequency power supplies as these produce full output voltage even with reduced input.

However, some improvements could be made to enhance its clarity and fluency. Syntactically, the sentence follows basic English grammar rules, as it has a subject, verb, and object in both of its clauses. In the first clause, \\"you\\" is the subject, \\"give\\" is the verb, and \\"him enough opportunity\\" is the object; then, in the second clause, \\"every senator\\" is the subject, \\"will succumb\\" is the verb, and \\"to corruption\\" is the object. Semantically, the sentence communicates a cause-and-effect relationship between providing opportunities and senators succumbing to corruption, which is clear enough to extract the intended meaning. However, the phrasing could be improved to better convey this idea. For a more clear and coherent expression of the idea, you could consider rephrasing the sentence like this: \\"If given enough opportunity, every senator will succumb to corruption.\\" Here, the cause-and-effect relationship is more clearly stated, using \\"if\\" to signal the conditional structure, and eliminates the potential ambiguity of \\"you give him enough opportunity,\\" which could be misconstrued as suggesting that the reader is expected to provide these opportunities.

To understand why the conclusion can be made, it's essential to break down the given information and relate it to the reasoning process. In the premise, we have: \\"Ah! the Coroner leant back satisfied.\\" This statement suggests that the Coroner, a central figure in the context, is experiencing a moment of satisfaction. When someone \\"leans back\\" after completing a task or following a conversation, it usually conveys the person's emotional state, which can be contentment or a sense of accomplishment. Here, it's explicitly mentioned that the Coroner is satisfied, which asserts that the individual is pleased in some way. The hypothesis provided is: \\"The coroner was pleased.\\" This hypothesis is a simplified interpretation of the Coroner's emotions. As noted earlier, the premise suggests that the Coroner is satisfied, which falls under the umbrella of being pleased. Satisfaction, contentment, and delight are all various expressions of pleasure, proving that the hypothesis is in line with the premise. In conclusion, if the premise is true and the Coroner is indeed satisfied, as indicated by leaning back, then the hypothesis stating that the Coroner was pleased also holds true. The emotional state of the Coroner (satisfaction) supports the hypothesis, and therefore, the conclusion can be made.

Given the question: Process: - Air is drawn in through the mouth - The air goes down the esophagus - The air moves into the lungs - The carbon dioxide is removed - The remaining oxygen enters the body - The remaining carbon dioxide is expelled through the mouth. Question: suppose less acid rain happens, how will it affect LESS oxygen being brought to the body. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect The answer is:","completion":"While the question initially focuses on the processes involved in respiration, it introduces a separate environmental topic, acid rain, which could be confusing. Nonetheless, I will aim to provide a comprehensive response addressing both aspects - the respiration process and the potential relationship between acid rain and oxygen transportation in the body. Acid rain, a consequence of atmospheric pollution resulting from the combination of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) with water, has numerous adverse effects on the ecosystem, including detrimental impacts on water quality, soil, and vegetation. However, it is essential to clarify that acid rain does not directly influence the oxygen transport process within the body, as presented in the question. To better comprehend the asked perturbation and its potential relationship with oxygen transportation, it is crucial to recognize that less acid rain would have an overall positive impact on the environment. Reduced acid rain levels would generally result in healthier forests and vegetation, which in turn, would improve the air quality through diminished pollution levels and increased oxygen production during photosynthesis. Consequently, improved air quality could potentially enable individuals to inhale cleaner air and, subsequently, more oxygen. However, despite a possible connection between air quality and oxygen intake, it is unlikely that a decrease in acid rain would significantly affect the amount of oxygen being brought into the body. This is because the body's oxygen uptake and transport system is relatively efficient and adaptable, maintaining optimal oxygen levels to meet its needs. Furthermore, the respiration process presented in the question contains inaccuracies, as air is not drawn directly into the esophagus. Instead, it is inhaled through the mouth or nose, enters the trachea, and then proceeds through the bronchi and bronchioles before ultimately reaching the lungs. It is within the lungs where the oxygen is transferred into the bloodstream through the alveoli and then subsequently distributed throughout the body via blood cells. Considering the crucial accuracy of the respiration process and understanding the potential environmental benefits of reduced acid rain, its impact on oxygen transportation within the body would likely be minor and would not significantly alter the human respiration process. Therefore, I would say that less acid rain would have minimal or no effect on oxygen transport in the body, as the body's oxygen transportation system is resilient and well-regulated."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Given the question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the full name of the march that Con Whalen said was \\"a waste of time\\" though he enjoyed every step? Before the start of the Second World War, and the establishment of war-based industries, Jarvis's initiatives brought modest relief to Jarrow. By 1939, about 100 men were employed in a small furniture factory and up to a further 500 in various metal-based industries set up on the Palmer's site. Jarvis had acquired the obsolete liners Olympic and Berengaria, to be broken up at the yard. However, after their triumphant homecoming many of the marchers felt that their endeavour had failed. Con Whalen, who at his death in 2003 was the last survivor of those who marched the full distance, said that the march was \\"a waste of time\\", but added that he had enjoyed every step. His fellow marcher Guy Waller, on the 40th anniversary of the march in 1976, said that \\"[t]he march produced no immediate startling upsurge in employment in the town. It took the war to do that\\". These views are shared by most commentators and historians. The Daily Mirror columnist Kevin Maguire calls the march \\"a heroic failure\\", while Matt Dobson, in The Socialist, writes that \\"out of all the hunger marches its aims were the most diluted and it made the most modest gains\\". The historians Malcolm Pearce and Geoffrey Stewart provide a positive perspective, arguing that the Jarrow March \\"helped to shape [post-Second World War] perceptions of the 1930s\\", and thus paved the way to social reform.Perry observes that \\"the passage of time has transformed the Jarrow Crusade ... into a potent talisman with which many apparently seek association\\". Thus the Labour Party, which in 1936 shunned the march, later adopted it as \\"a badge of credibility\\". In 1950 the party featured the Jarrow banners on its election posters; the march then disappeared from view in an era of high employment, only to be invoked again when unemployment again became a political issue in the 1980s. In the late 20th century and beyond, Labour leaders—Michael Foot, Neil Kinnock, Tony Blair—have all associated themselves with the march. In October 1986, on the 50th anniversary, a group...

Madrasa (Arabic: مدرسة‎, madrasah, pl. مدارس, madāris, Turkish: Medrese) is the Arabic word for any type of educational institution, whether secular or religious (of any religion). The word is variously transliterated madrasah, madarasaa, medresa, madrassa, madraza, medrese, etc. In the West, the word usually refers to a specific type of religious school or college for the study of the Islamic religion, though this may not be the only subject studied. Not all students in madaris are Muslims; there is also a modern curriculum. The word madrasah derives from the triconsonantal Semitic root د-ر-س D-R-S 'to learn, study', through the wazn (form/stem) مفعل(ة)‎; mafʻal(ah), meaning \\"a place where something is done\\". Therefore, madrasah literally means \\"a place where learning and studying take place\\". The word is also present as a loanword with the same innocuous meaning in many Arabic-influenced languages, such as: Urdu, Bengali, Hindi, Persian, Turkish, Azeri, Kurdish, Indonesian, Malay and Bosnian / Croatian. In the Arabic language, the word مدرسة madrasah simply means the same as school does in the English language, whether that is private, public or parochial school, as well as for any primary or secondary school whether Muslim, non-Muslim, or secular. Unlike the use of the word school in British English, the word madrasah more closely resembles the term school in American English, in that it can refer to a university-level or post-graduate school as well as to a primary or secondary school. For example, in the Ottoman Empire during the Early Modern Period, madaris had lower schools and specialised schools where the students became known as danişmends. The usual Arabic word for a university, however, is جامعة (jāmiʻah). The Hebrew cognate midrasha also connotes the meaning of a place of learning; the related term midrash literally refers to study or learning, but has acquired mystical and religious connotations. Now, provide a numbered list of answers to these questions: 1. what is the article mainly about? 2. what does the word literally mean? 3. can it be private school? 4. what language does it come from? 5. are all students in madaris Muslim? 6. is it generally considered a religious school in the west? 7. what levels of school does it cover? 8. what is the Arabic word for University? 9. is modern curriculum offered in madrasa? 10. what are some Arabic languages that are mentioned?","completion":"1.

Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: Today, I want to share why I think you should interview real estate agents before hiring one. Why You Should Interview Real Estate Agents Truth be told, I have only purchased one house and I’m in the process of selling it. My husband and I thought long and hard about whether we would try to sell our property on our own or hire someone to represent us. In the end, we chose the latter. If you have ever shared with friends or family that you’re looking for a home or thinking of selling your own, most everyone says something along the lines of, “Oh! I know a realtor I can recommend!” Many of you may know a real estate agent personally as well. I still think it makes sense to interview any prospective agents because they are being paid by you. When you hire someone to do work on your home, you get estimates and gather information about how and when the work will be done. When you are looking for babysitters, you meet them and see how they’ll interact with your child. When you’re an employer, you interview any potential employees. Don’t Take The Easy Route with Previous Agents and Friends Just because a friend is a realtor, doesn’t mean they’ll be the best real estate agent for you. Just because a friend recommends their realtor to you, doesn’t mean you have to hire him/her. It’s business and nobody should take it personally. Interviewing real estate agents just makes sense. Oftentimes, people don’t. Why not just use the realtor that sold you the house you’re currently in? Well, you can. But do you know how that realtor handles business when they are the listing agent versus the buyer’s agent? Do you know if they’ll want to pursue the option to be a dual agent (and double their commission)? Why not interview them while interviewing others? It won’t hurt.

Options: A. they want to buy it B. they tell you not to sell it C. they give you recommendations D. not enough information The answer to this question is:","completion":"C. they give you recommendations Justification: The context mentions that, \\"If you have ever shared with friends or family that you’re looking for a home or thinking of selling your own, most everyone says something along the lines of, “Oh!

Context: With almost two years left of my law degree, and with no intention of doing anything so idiotic as actually attending lectures or studying law, I had plenty of time to come up with my next bid for online fame. The Griff Rhys Jones TV project had stalled after a couple of meetings when everyone involved realised that the idea - to pipe broadband comedy programming into the nation's workplaces under the noses of bosses - was a bit of a non-starter. But I had become quite good friends with Rhys Jones's partner in the project, a comedy writer called Charlie Skelton, and he, Clare and I frequently met to brainstorm possible projects we might work on together. It was during one of these meetings that Clare proposed the idea of starting a comedy magazine - something like Private Eye, but for the Internet generation. My days as a school magazine publisher had taught me that printing magazines and distributing them was a royal pain in the arse and, anyway, if it was to be a magazine for the Internet generation then shouldn't it actually be on the Internet? The Zingin.com newsletter had attracted a ton of subscribers and had a distribution cost of basically nothing so why, I suggested, didn't we start a weekly comedy ezine, sent out by email? And, in a nod to Charlie's failed office comedy project, we could target it at bored office workers, sending the email to them on a Friday afternoon to cure the crushing boredom of those final few hours of the working week. And with that, The Friday Thing was born. To promote our fledgling publication we came up with a brilliant ruse: an online petition to have Friday afternoons declared a national holiday. British people worked harder than any other Europeans (we made up) and so it was only fair that our working week should end at noon on a Friday. We created an official website explaining our demands, registered a web address - letsgetitoff.com (snigger) - and sent a press release to the media.

One day, while she was training, Zelda noticed how she was able to throw the javelin farther than the shot put. This observation left her wondering why this was the case. The most evident reason was that the shot put was much heavier, which limited its potential range. A standard shot put weighed around 8.8 pounds or 4 kilograms for women, whereas a typical women's javelin weighed approximately 1.3 pounds or 600 grams. This significant difference in weight heavily influenced the distance Zelda could achieve with each throw. Moreover, several other factors contributed to Zelda's ability to throw the javelin further. First and foremost was the aspect of aerodynamics. The javelin, designed with a slender, elongated structure, easily cut through the air, minimizing air resistance during flight. On the other hand, the shot put's spherical shape, although efficient in some aspects, hindered its capacity to traverse vast distances because of the increased air resistance it encountered. Additionally, technique played a significant role in the distances Zelda could reach with each throw. Javelin throwing required a combination of speed, strength, and precision in the approach and release, facilitating an optimal trajectory, angle, and force. By contrast, shot put relied heavily on explosive power, primarily derived from the athlete's legs and core. Zelda's sprinting skills, combined with her well-practiced release technique, allowed her to optimize her javelin throws, achieving longer distances than with the shot put. Another crucial factor was the training involved in honing her skills in each of the events. The hours of practice, guidance from her coaches, and her propensity to excel at sports played a massive role in Zelda’s performance. As she was blessed with a lean, agile, yet powerful physique, her body was more naturally suited for the javelin. Zelda's consistent hard work and dedication allowed her to overcome physical limitations tied to the shot put's weight and still perform admirably in both events. Finally, Zelda's exceptional ability to visualize her progress and set achievable goals helped her excel in various sports, including javelin and shot put. She believed in pushing her boundaries and relentlessly worked towards improving her performance in both disciplines. However, it was the shot put's heavier weight that presented her with a greater challenge, and this ultimately led to the javelin taking precedence in her achievements. In conclusion, the difference in weight between the javelin and shot put significantly impacted Zelda's ability to throw the javelin further than the shot put. The heavier shot put, combined with aerodynamic differences, variations in techniques, her physical suitability for each event, and the training she underwent, made this difference quite apparent. Nevertheless, Zelda's unwavering spirit, commitment to excellence, and prowess in both javelin and shot put events served as an inspiration to athletes everywhere."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The school, though, is owned by Delassalle's teacher wife, the frail Christina (Clouzot), and Delassalle flaunts his relationship with Nicole Horner (Signoret), a teacher at the school. Rather than antagonism, the two women are shown to have a somewhat close relationship, primarily based on their apparent mutual hatred of Michel, who is physically and emotionally abusive to both.Unable to stand his mistreatment any longer, Nicole devises a plan. Though hesitant at first, Christina ultimately consents to help Nicole. Using a threatened divorce to lure Michel to Nicole's apartment building in a remote village several hundred kilometers away, Christina sedates him. The two women then drown him in a bathtub and dump his body in the school's neglected swimming pool. When his corpse floats to the surface, they think it will appear to have been an accident. Almost everything goes according to their plans until the body fails to surface, and Michel's corpse is nowhere to be found when the pool is drained.Nicole sees in the paper that the police found the corpse. Christina goes to the morgue and learns it is not Michel's body. There she meets Alfred Fichet (Vanel), a retired private detective. He gets involved in the case, much to Nicole's chagrin.When Christina and Alfred come back, a boy is punished for breaking a window; the boy says Michel punished him. After hearing this Christina becomes very sick. She is unable to be photographed for the school photo; however, it seems that Michel is in it, in the back next to a window. Nicole becomes worried and leaves the school. Christina, overcome by fear, tells Alfred everything. He does not believe her, but he investigates the pool.

In the beginning of the Lenten season in 1959, \\"fifteen years after the War,\\" they travel to a quiet French village that closely adheres to tradition, as led by the village mayor, the Comte de Reynaud (Alfred Molina). Just as the villagers begin observing the forty days of Lent, Vianne opens a chocolate shop, much to Reynaud's displeasure. Vianne wears more colorful clothing than the village women, is an atheist, and has an illegitimate child. She does not fit in well with the townspeople, but is nevertheless optimistic about her business. Her friendly and alluring nature begins to win the villagers over one by one, causing Reynaud to openly speak against her for tempting the people during a time of abstinence and self-denial. The Comte will not admit that his wife has left him; he is romantically interested in Caroline, but he does not pursue her. One of the first to fall under the spell of Vianne and her confections is Armande (Judi Dench), her elderly, eccentric landlady. Armande is unhappy that her cold, devoutly pious daughter Caroline (Carrie-Anne Moss) will not let Armande see her grandson Luc because Caroline thinks Armande is a \\"bad influence\\". Vianne arranges for Luc and his grandmother to see each other in the chocolaterie, where they develop a close bond. Caroline later reveals to Vianne that her mother is a diabetic, though Armande continues to eat the chocolate despite her condition.

Unfazed by traditions and religious dogma, Vianne opens a chocolate shop, drawing the ire of the town's mayor, Comte de Reynaud. Through her daring sense of style and her secular beliefs, Vianne poses a striking contrast to the restrictive atmosphere of the village. As her enchanting chocolates and captivating personality begin to captivate the hearts of the villagers, Reynaud sees her as a threat to the town's principles, accusing her of tempting the residents during a time of penance and self-denial. As Vianne becomes increasingly woven into the fabric of local life, she forms bonds with a myriad of characters, helping them face their inner demons and embrace their true selves. Along her journey, she reunites an estranged grandmother with her grandson, empowers a woman to break free from an abusive relationship, and encourages the townspeople to accept one another's flaws and appreciate life's simple pleasures. In \\"L'Enchantement Chocolat,\\" the powerful message of love, acceptance, and healing through connection is embodied in the delicate art of chocolate-making.

I know that the answer to the question \\"Whose contributions from this period might by recognized by a modern day student of geometry?\\" is in \\"The Hellenistic period covers the period of ancient Greek (Hellenic) history and Mediterranean history between the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC and the emergence of the Roman Empire as signified by the Battle of Actium in 31 BC and the subsequent conquest of Ptolemaic Egypt the following year. At this time, Greek cultural influence and power was at its peak in Europe, Africa and Asia, experiencing prosperity and progress in the arts, exploration, literature, theatre, architecture, music, mathematics, philosophy, and science. For example, competitive public games took place, ideas in biology, and popular entertainment in theaters. It is often considered a period of transition, sometimes even of decadence or degeneration, compared to the enlightenment of the Greek Classical era. The Hellenistic period saw the rise of New Comedy, Alexandrian poetry, the Septuagint and the philosophies of Stoicism and Epicureanism. Greek Science was advanced by the works of the mathematician Euclid and the polymath Archimedes. The religious sphere expanded to include new gods such as the Greco-Egyptian Serapis, eastern deities such as Attis and Cybele and the Greek adoption of Buddhism.\\". Can you tell me what it is?

The statement provided suggests that pursuing sharp reductions in CO2 emissions from the electricity generating sector alone may lead to a dramatic shift from coal to natural gas. This shift could pose a threat to national energy security, cause a substantial increase in energy prices, and harm consumers. Therefore, we cannot conclude that \\"The use of generating electricity from coal to natural gas would not impact national energy security.\\" This is because moving from coal to natural gas for electricity generation could lead to various potential risks and challenges such as: 1. Dependency on gas suppliers: A rapid and substantial shift to natural gas may lead to a higher dependence on natural gas suppliers, both domestic and international. This may create challenges in maintaining a stable and secure supply of fuel for electricity generation, thus impacting national energy security. 2. Price volatility: Natural gas prices can be subject to high levels of volatility, especially when compared to coal prices, due to factors such as geopolitical issues, supply constraints, and weather conditions. A higher dependency on natural gas may lead to an increased vulnerability to price fluctuations that could impact electricity prices and consumers. 3. Infrastructure challenges: A significant shift from coal to natural gas would require considerable investment in new infrastructure, such as gas pipelines, storage facilities, and generating plants. This could strain financial resources and challenge the capacity of countries to develop or upgrade the necessary infrastructure to ensure a reliable and secure energy supply. 4. Environmental concerns: While natural gas is generally considered cleaner than coal when it comes to CO2 emissions, it is not without environmental concerns. For example, methane, the primary component of natural gas, is a potent greenhouse gas. Leakage during natural gas production, transportation, and storage can lead to increased greenhouse gas emissions, partially offsetting the benefits of reduced CO2 emissions. To minimize the risks associated with transitioning from coal to natural gas, it is essential to consider a more comprehensive approach to energy policy, which includes diversifying the energy mix with renewable energy sources, promoting energy efficiency, and investing in new technologies for cleaner electricity generation. This will help ensure that national energy security is maintained while mitigating the potential negative impacts of a rapid shift from coal to natural gas."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize: When thinking about what goals you want to achieve, whether short or long term, aim to understand the root of these goals. People who set realistic goals and expectations have higher self esteems. You can ask yourself the following questions: What is the root of my goal? When did it develop? Why do I want to achieve this goal? Is it based on my desires or someone else’s (e.g. partner, parent, teacher)? Can I realistically achieve this goal based on my personality and past experience? What is the purpose of achieving this goal? What is most important to you? Perhaps your job or your relationship. Focus on the top three things that matter in your life and make sure that you are giving your time and energy to those activities. If you have time and energy to do more activities, add them in gradually. Aim for a good balance. For example, you might say that your top three priorities are your family, job, and choir. Schedule weekly quality family time. Make sure you sleep enough to do well at your job. Plan to have a babysitter on choir nights. Other priorities for a university student might be gaining entrance to medical school, being a good student government leader, and staying fit. In this case, plan out your study times for the MCAT. Also, put your student government meetings in your calendar in advance. Map out your work out times. It is possible that at some times, like the week before your MCAT exam, you must focus even more on just one priority. When you set goals or want to change things about yourself, keep in mind that change does not happen overnight. Strive instead to set mini goals as you work towards a larger goal. Also realize that achieving your goal likely has a few consequences but will not necessarily impact your entire life. For instance, if you want to lose weight, focus on the health benefits of weight loss first. Do not automatically assume it will improve your personal relationships or overall happiness. For example, instead of saying, “I’m going to lose forty pounds this year,” try instead to lose one pound per week for one month. After this time, reassess your situation and make another mini goal. If your goal is gaining entrance into medical school, set mini goals and tasks, like enrolling in organic chemistry, anatomy, molecular biology, and other courses. Then, focus on doing well in your courses. Eventually, add the goal of acing the MCAT. After this, you can add tasks like writing your essays, receiving recommendation letters, gathering transcripts, etc.","completion":"In order to achieve your short-term and long-term goals effectively, it is essential to understand the root of these goals and set realistic expectations. Doing so can contribute to higher self-esteem. To gain insight into your goals, ask yourself questions about the origin, purpose, and feasibility of the goal. Determine if the goal is motivated by your desires or influenced by others such as family members, or teachers. Once you have identified the root and purpose of your goals, prioritize the top three essential aspects of your life to ensure efficient allocation of time and energy. For example, if your priorities are family, job, and a hobby, dedicate time each week to spend quality time with family and ensure proper planning for work and hobby commitments. Similarly, if you are a university student, set priorities like entrance to a prestigious program, leadership roles, and maintaining fitness; then create a schedule to make sure you achieve the desired balance. Understanding the fact that significant change cannot be achieved overnight, focusing on setting and achieving mini-goals can help maintain motivation and make the process more manageable. Break down your larger goals into smaller steps and reassess your progress periodically. For example, if you aim to lose weight, set smaller, achievable weight loss targets and assess your progress every month. Setting smaller goals is helpful in tackling larger ambitions too; for instance, if you aspire to enter medical school, set mini-goals like enrolling in relevant courses, excelling in your studies, and acing the MCAT. Eventually, focus on additional tasks such as writing essays, obtaining recommendation letters, and gathering transcripts as part of the application process. By understanding the roots of your goals, prioritizing essential aspects of your life, and setting achievable mini-goals, you can make steady progress towards your short-term and long-term objectives. Additionally, consider the potential consequences of achieving a goal and avoid assuming significant improvements in unrelated areas of your life, like personal relationships or overall happiness."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A:","completion":"Vladimir Lenin, born as Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov on April 22, 1870, was a Russian revolutionary, politician, and political theorist. He played a crucial role in the 1917 Russian Revolution and became the first head of the Soviet state. Lenin's importance lies in his impact on world history, the development of communism, and his influence on the Soviet Union and other socialist countries. Here are some key facts to help answer who Vladimir Lenin was and why he was important: 1. Ideological development: Lenin's political and economic ideas, particularly his interpretation of Marxism, formed the basis of Leninism, a distinct political theory that later developed into the core of Soviet and Marxist-Leninist ideology. 2. Founding of the Russian Communist Party: Lenin was instrumental in the establishment of the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party (RSDLP) in 1898, which later split into the Bolshevik and Menshevik factions in 1903. Lenin led the more radical Bolsheviks, who ultimately became the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. 3. Role in the Russian Revolution: Lenin played a pivotal role in the Russian Revolution, a series of events that led to the overthrow of Tsar Nicholas II and the establishment of the Soviet Union. Lenin returned to Russia from exile in April 1917 and, within a few months, successfully orchestrated the October Revolution, which brought the Bolsheviks to power. 4. Leadership of Soviet Russia: After the Russian Revolution, Lenin served as the leader of Soviet Russia from 1917 to 1924, first as Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars and later as Chairman of the Council of Labor and Defense. During his tenure, Lenin introduced policies to nationalize industry, redistribute land, and establish a socialist government. 5. Promotion of world revolution: Lenin believed in the international spread of communism. Under his leadership, the Soviet Union supported communist movements in other countries, which led to the formation of the Third (Communist) International or Comintern in 1919. This organization aimed to spread communism globally and unite proletarian nations in their struggle against capitalism. 6. Lenin's death and legacy: Lenin passed away on January 21, 1924, and his death marked the beginning of a power struggle within the Soviet Union that ultimately led to Joseph Stalin's leadership. Despite controversies surrounding his policies and actions, Lenin is remembered as a transformative figure who shaped the course of 20th-century history and altered the geopolitical landscape with the emergence of a new superpower in the form of the Soviet Union."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Having been grotesquely disfigured in an African voodoo ceremony for a transgression against the native populace, Sir Edward Markham is kept locked in his room by his guilt-ridden brother, Julian. Tiring of his captivity, Sir Edward plots to escape by faking his death. With the help of the crooked family lawyer, Trench, they hire witchdoctor N'Galo to concoct a drug to put Sir Edward into a deathlike trance. Before Trench has time to act, Julian finds his \\"dead\\" brother and puts him in a coffin (the title's \\"oblong box\\"). Embarrassed by his brother's appearance, Julian asks Trench to find a proxy body for Sir Edward's lying in state. Trench and N'Galo murder landlord Tom Hacket and offer his corpse to Julian. After the wake, Trench and his young companion Norton, dispose of Hacket's body in a nearby river, while Julian has Sir Edward buried. Now free of his brother, Julian marries his young fiancée, Elizabeth, while Trench, Norton and N'Galo go their separate ways.

Question: I read this background article the other day: An optimal decision is a decision that leads to at least as good a known or expected outcome as all other available decision options.

Given the fact \\"the amount of daylight is least in the winter\\", what is the answer to the question or completion \\"On continents nearer the north pole than the south, winter months such as November see\\" Options are: A). the most daylight. B). the longest daylight. C). growing daylight hours. D). short daylight.","completion":"D). Short daylight. On continents nearer the north pole than the south, winter months such as November see short daylight. This is because, during the winter months, the Earth is tilted away from the sun for the regions closer to the north pole. As a result, the amount of daylight experienced in these areas decreases, leading to shorter days and longer nights. The Earth's axial tilt plays a significant role in the changing amount of daylight throughout the year. The tilt causes the northern and southern hemispheres to receive varying amounts of light and warmth from the sun. When one hemisphere is tilted toward the sun, it experiences more direct sunlight, leading to longer days and warmer temperatures. This is referred to as summer. Conversely, when the hemisphere is tilted away from the sun, it receives less sunlight and warmth, resulting in shorter days and cooler temperatures. This is known as winter. Seasonal fluctuations in daylight also affect the other options mentioned: A). The most daylight - This occurs during the summer months for regions closer to the north pole when the Earth is tilted towards the sun. During this time, the days are longer and nights are shorter. B). The longest daylight - This statement refers to the summer solstice, which typically occurs around June 21st in the northern hemisphere. During the solstice, the Earth's northern hemisphere experiences its most extreme tilt towards the sun, resulting in the longest daylight hours of the year. C). Growing daylight hours - As the northern hemisphere transitions from winter to spring, the days gradually become longer, and daylight hours increase. This is due to the Earth's tilt changing such that the regions nearer to the north pole start receiving more sunlight. In conclusion, on continents nearer the north pole than the south, winter months such as November see short daylight because the Earth is tilted away from the sun for those regions. This results in less daylight and longer nights, causing cooler temperatures and shorter days throughout winter."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Article: Give yourself at least fifteen extra minutes to make sure you have time to get your act together. The first day can already be a little bit stressful, and you’ll feel more relaxed if you’re not running around. This extra time will help you perfect your look, have enough time to eat breakfast, to have a nice shower, and do anything else you need to do to start that first day off on the right foot. It's a good idea to pack your bag the night before school, to make sure you have all the supplies you need. You'll be able to save time in the morning so you won't be rushed. You should know where your first class, or your homeroom is before you walk into the halls of your middle school. If you’re lost, however, just ask a teacher, administrator, or even an older student for help. It’s important to know where you’re headed so you don’t wander around aimlessly or miss out on something important. It’s likely you’ll go to homeroom first, where you’ll meet your homeroom teacher and will get important information about your day. Though having a plan is important, you also don’t have to worry if things don’t go as planned. Even the beginning of your first day of middle school can throw you some surprises, and that won’t be a bad thing. Though you may be feeling shy, you should do the best you can to be as nice and friendly to the new students in your classes as you can. Introduce yourself, ask them about themselves, and talk about what you think of middle school, so far. Smile and wave at people, and make them feel welcome in your presence. Don’t be intimidated by people who seem too cool or too stuck up, either. Just make an effort to be approachable and easygoing. People will be more receptive to new friendships at the beginning of the year, before too many cliques form. The sooner you talk to new people, the more likely you’ll be to connect for real. If you see a cute guy or girl, don’t be afraid to say hi. People like confidence, and you don’t have to be shy about talking to people. Though you may not think it’s cool to care, if you want to get through middle school and start off on the right foot, it’s far better to listen to your teachers, to participate when they ask questions, to take notes, and to avoid any distractions than to act like a know-it-all or like you couldn’t care less. Make an effort to be a good student and to make the most of each class you take. If you care about the material, you’ll have more fun in the process than you would if you were just sulking and waiting for the bell to ring. Though there may not be too many opportunities to participate on the first day, you should do the best you can to show that you care, even if you just ask a question about the syllabus. Make sure you show up to class on time and that you make a good impression right away. You may accidentally make a bad first impression by laughing too much or chattering with your friends even if you’re normally a good student. Unfortunately, first impressions are notoriously hard to break, so try to put your best foot forward when you step into the classroom. You don’t have to suck up to your teachers, either. Just pay attention and act like you really care and you’ll be on your way. Each middle school is different. You should get a sense of how the seating in your cafeteria works. If you can choose a new seat every day, try to plan to meet up with your friends in advance so you can sit together. If you have to choose the same table for the entire year, see if you can get together a group of people to make it work. If you don’t know many people in your new school yet, then don’t worry. Just be friendly, find some people who look nice, and ask if you can sit next to them. If you can, you should try to get to the cafeteria as early as you can. That way, you’ll be more likely to find your friends or to find a place to sit. If you want to make the most of your first day, then you should try to get through it with a big smile on your face. Don’t complain to your friends, criticize your teachers, or dread every one of your classes. Instead, try to approach everything with a “can do” attitude and don’t ever feel like people will never give you a chance. If you smile, expect only the best, and try to stick to optimistic topics, you’ll be having a much better day. Besides, people are drawn to positive people; the more upbeat you are, the easier it will be for you to make new friends. Don’t compare yourself to other people. You may feel like you’re not as good-looking or as well-dressed as some of the people in your school, but this kind of thinking is pointless and will only get you down. Remember that you have a lot to offer, too, and the well-dressed girl in your French class may have her own set of problems. Unfortunately, not every person is at his best in middle school. It’s easy to fall into cliques, to gossip, or just to judge other people you don’t really know. However, if you want to make it through your first day in a good mood, you should avoid judging anyone before you get to know him or her or even being a part of any silly gossip. You wouldn’t want people who barely know you to gossip about you, would you? You don’t know who your best friends will be yet, and you don’t want to find yourself making fun of someone who could have been your best friend if you had only given her a chance.

Until 2001 it was known as the Christian Democrat International (CDI) and before that the \\"Christian Democrat and People's Parties International\\" (until 1999) (this earlier name is, since October 2000, still sometimes used colloquially). It was formed in 1961 in Santiago, Chile as the \\"Christian Democrat World Union\\", building on the legacy of other Christian Democrat internationals who tried to create a Christian-inspired third way alternative to the socialist internationals; in 1982 it was renamed for the first time Christian Democrat International. The name officially changed due to the participation of groups of various faiths. It is the global international political group dedicated to the promotion of Christian democracy. Although it gathers parties from around the globe, its members are drawn principally from Europe and Latin America. Some of them are also members of the International Democrat Union (IDU), although the CDI is closer to the political centre and more communitarian than the IDU. - A European political party (formally, a political party at European level; informally a Europarty) is a type of political party organisation operating transnationally in Europe and in the institutions of the European Union. They are regulated and funded by the European Union and are usually made up of national parties, not individuals. Europarties have the exclusive right to campaign during the European elections and express themselves within the European Parliament by their affiliated political groups and their MEPs. Europarties, through coordination meetings with their affiliated heads of state and government, influence the decision-making process of the European Council. Europarties also work closely and co-ordinate with their affiliated members of the European Commission and, according to the Lisbon Treaty the Europarty that wins the European elections has the right to nominate to the European Council its candidate for President of the European Commission. - The Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) is a global inter-parliamentary institution established in 1889 by Frédéric Passy (France) and William Randal Cremer (United Kingdom). It was the first permanent forum for political multilateral negotiations. Initially, the organization was for individual parliamentarians, but has since transformed into an international organization of the parliaments of sovereign states. The national parliaments of 170 countries are members of the IPU, and 11 regional parliamentary assemblies are associate members. The IPU has permanent observer status at the United Nations General Assembly and general consultative status with the Economic and Social Council. - Santiago de Chile is the capital and largest city of Chile. It is also the center of its largest conurbation. Santiago is located in the country's central valley, at an elevation of above mean sea level. - The European People's Party (EPP) is a European political party. A transnational organisation, it is composed of other political parties, not individuals. Founded by primarily Christian democratic parties in 1976, it has since broadened its membership to include liberal-conservative parties and parties with other centre-right political perspectives. - Lorenzo Cesa (born 16 August 1951 in Arcinazzo Romano, Rome) is an Italian politician, and was elected to the Italian Chamber of Deputies in the 2006 General election representing the Union of Christian and Centre Democrats. He was elected on October 27, 2005 as new party leader, replacing resigning secretary Marco Follini. - The Union of the Centre ( Italian : Unione di Centro , UdC ) is a Christian democratic political party in Italy . Its secretary is Lorenzo Cesa , but its most popular figure and actual leader is Pier Ferdinando Casini . The party is a member of the European People 's Party and the Centrist Democrat International , of which Casini is president . The party was formed in December 2002 as the Union of Christian and Centre Democrats ( Unione dei Democratici Cristiani e di Centro , UDC ) as the merger of the Christian Democratic Centre , the United Christian Democrats and European Democracy . In 2008 the party was the driving force behind the UdC , an alliance comprising , among others , The Rose for Italy , the Populars for the Constituent Assembly of the Centre , the Liberal Clubs , the Party of Christian Democracy , Christian Democratic Party , Veneto for the European People 's Party , the Democratic Populars and the Autonomist Democrats . Since then , the party 's official name was neglected in favour of \`\` Union of the Centre '' and , since most of the UdC member parties have joined the UDC too , the UDC and the UdC started to overlap almost completely to the point that they are now undistinguishable . The UDC was part of the Pole / House of Freedoms from its establishment through 2008 . Later it has been affiliated neither to the centre - right nor the centre - left at the national level . Despite this , the party takes part in several regional , provincial and municipal governments with Forza Italia , the largest force of the Italian centre - right ( notably in Campania and Calabria ) , but recently formed alliances also with the centre - left Democratic Party in other regions ( notably in Marche ) and at the very local level . In the 2013 general election the UdC was part of With Monti for Italy , the coalition formed around Mario Monti 's Civic Choice . More recently the party , which sits in the Renzi Cabinet , has sided with the Angelino Alfano 's New Centre - Right . - The International Democrat Union (IDU) is an international alliance of centre-right political parties.

Answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: The old saying that practice makes perfect seems to make no sense when it comes to schoolwork. Many educators today are looking for evidence to support the case for homework, but are coming up empty-handed. Mary Jane Cera is the academic administrator for the Kino School, and she maintains a no-homework policy across all grades. The purpose of the policy is to make sure learning remains a joy, not a thing that discourages social time and creative activity. At the Kino school, Cera says children often choose to take their favorite parts of school home. \\"A lot of what we see kids doing is practicing music with their friends, and taking experiments home to show their parents,\\" she says. Surveys of Kino graduates suggest that the early control they are given over their education continues to serve them well into college. \\"One of the reasons that we continue to assign much homework is our obsession with tests, although we can agree on the importance of kids doing better on tests through proper homework to some degree,\\"says author Alfie Kohn. In his book The Homework Myth, Kohn points out that no study has ever found a relation between homework and academic achievement and that if kids have no choice in the matter of homework, they're not really exercising judgment, and are instead losing their sense of self-control. However, many supporters of homework argue that life is filled with things we don't like to do, and that homework teaches self-discipline, time management and other non-academic life skills. Wherever the homework debate goes next, it's worth taking a moment to examine if we're doing the right thing about our children's education. The good news is -- it's never too late to start. Answer:","completion":"Which statement aligns with the Kino School's no-homework policy? A) The policy was implemented because students were underperforming. B) The policy aims to make learning enjoyable while fostering social time and creative activity. C) The policy is in place because homework has been proven to improve academic achievement. D) The policy requires students to practice music and take experiments home for homework. Answer: B) The policy aims to make learning enjoyable while fostering social time and creative activity. Explanation: The Kino School has a no-homework policy to ensure that learning remains a joy, instead of discouraging social time and creative activities. As mentioned in the article, children at Kino School often choose to take their favorite parts of school home, such as practicing music with friends or taking experiments home to show their parents. The purpose of the policy is not to focus on academic underperformance, homework improving academic achievement, or a specific requirement for homework-like activities."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Monoamniotic twins are always identical, always monochorionic and are usually termed Monoamniotic-Monochorionic (\`\`MoMo'' or \`\`Mono Mono'') twins. They also share the placenta, but have two separate umbilical cords. Monoamniotic twins develop when an embryo does not split until after formation of the amniotic sac, at about 9-13 days after fertilization. Monoamniotic triplets or other monoamniotic multiples are possible, but extremely rare. Other obscure possibilities include multiples sets where monoamniotic twins are part of a larger gestation such as triplets, quadruplets, or more. Can we conclude that can there be twins in one yolk sac?","completion":"Based on the information about monoamniotic twins, it is important to differentiate between amniotic sacs and yolk sacs as they serve different purposes during pregnancy. Monoamniotic twins, as explained earlier, share the same amniotic sac but have separate umbilical cords. However, the question of whether twins can be in one yolk sac addresses a different aspect of pregnancy and development. The yolk sac forms early during pregnancy and plays a crucial role in providing nutrition to the developing embryo before the placenta is fully formed. Once the placenta takes over, the yolk sac is no longer needed and is gradually absorbed. In the case of twins or higher-order multiples, the development scenario can vary: 1. Dichorionic-Diamniotic (DiDi) twins: These twins have separate placentas, separate amniotic sacs, and separate yolk sacs. These can be either identical (if the split occurs within 72 hours of fertilization) or fraternal twins. 2. Monochorionic-Diamniotic (MoDi) twins: These identical twins share a placenta but have separate amniotic sacs and separate yolk sacs. The embryo splits between 4-8 days after fertilization. 3. Monochorionic-Monoamniotic (MoMo) twins: As discussed earlier, these identical twins share both the amniotic sac and the placenta but have two separate umbilical cords. The embryo splits between 9-13 days after fertilization. Regarding the possibility of twins sharing a yolk sac, it is extremely rare, and there's limited literature discussing this scenario. It is generally considered that each embryo has its own yolk sac for nourishment during early development. In some twin pregnancies, two separate yolk sacs can be seen within the gestational sac. This can be observed during early ultrasound assessments and usually indicates the presence of monochorionic-diamniotic or dichorionic-diamniotic twins. In summary, while it is extremely rare for twins to share a single yolk sac, it cannot be completely ruled out due to the complexity and variability of multiple gestations. Nonetheless, it is more common for each twin or embryo to have its own yolk sac during early development."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Please answer the following question: I can use this background: Wildfires occur when all the necessary elements of a fire triangle come together in a susceptible area: an ignition source is brought into contact with a combustible material such as vegetation, that is subjected to enough heat and has an adequate supply of oxygen from the ambient air. A high moisture content usually prevents ignition and slows propagation, because higher temperatures are needed to evaporate any water in the material and heat the material to its fire point. Dense forests usually provide more shade, resulting in lower ambient temperatures and greater humidity, and are therefore less susceptible to wildfires. Less dense material such as grasses and leaves are easier to ignite because they contain less water than denser material such as branches and trunks. Plants continuously lose water by evapotranspiration, but water loss is usually balanced by water absorbed from the soil, humidity, or rain. When this balance is not maintained, plants dry out and are therefore more flammable, often a consequence of droughts.A wildfire front is the portion sustaining continuous flaming combustion, where unburned material meets active flames, or the smoldering transition between unburned and burned material. As the front approaches, the fire heats both the surrounding air and woody material through convection and thermal radiation. First, wood is dried as water is vaporized at a temperature of 100 °C (212 °F). Next, the pyrolysis of wood at 230 °C (450 °F) releases flammable gases. Finally, wood can smoulder at 380 °C (720 °F) or, when heated sufficiently, ignite at 590 °C (1,000 °F). Even before the flames of a wildfire arrive at a particular location, heat transfer from the wildfire front warms the air to 800 °C (1,470 °F), which pre-heats and dries flammable materials, causing materials to ignite faster and allowing the fire to spread faster. High-temperature and long-duration surface wildfires may encourage flashover or torching: the drying of tree canopies and their subsequent ignition from... Now, I have a new situation: Near the city of Middleton, there are two forests. The Trine forest is a forest tightly packed with trees. Trine has hardly any large open spaces on the ground.

Trine forest is tightly packed with trees, meaning there are more trees in close proximity, creating a dense canopy that blocks sunlight. 2. The dense canopy of trees in Trine forest results in lower ambient temperatures and increased humidity as mentioned, which also implies more shade is provided in comparison to the more open Jimpy forest. 3. Jimpy forest has large areas with a lack of trees, making it less dense and providing less shade overall. In conclusion, the Trine forest, with its densely packed trees, provides more shade than the more open Jimpy forest."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

To begin to appreciate the role of oxygen inside your body, think about when your breathing rate increases: climbing a steep slope, running a race, or skating a shift in a hockey game. Respiration rate correlates with energy use, and that correlation reflects the link between oxygen and energy metabolism. For this reason, the chemical process inside your cells that consume oxygen to produce usable energy is known as cellular respiration . During this process, energy is converted from glucose , in the presence of oxygen, into numerous ATP molecules. The glucose, of course, comes from the food you eat. In biological terms, you do not eat because you are hungry, you eat to get energy. Other heterotrophic organisms also acquire glucose from other organisms, whereas autotrophic organisms make their own glucose, mostly through photosynthesis. Bob is a biologist. Today, he has four samples of organisms to test, sample A, sample B, sample C, and sample D. He induced higher respiration rate in sample A. Then he induced no respiration rate in sample B. Next, he classified sample C as heterotrophic and sample D as autotrophic. In which organism ATP molecules would be produced, sample A or sample B? Answer:","completion":"ATP molecules would be produced in sample A. To understand why ATP molecules would be produced in sample A and not in sample B, we need to consider the conditions set by Bob and the process of cellular respiration. Sample A has a higher respiration rate, while sample B has no respiration rate induced. Cellular respiration is essential for all living organisms because it is the process by which cells generate ATP molecules, serving as the primary energy currency for various cellular activities. This process occurs in three main stages: glycolysis, the citric acid cycle (Krebs cycle), and the electron transport chain. Oxygen plays a crucial role in cellular respiration, particularly in the last stage, the electron transport chain, where it accepts electrons and combines with hydrogen ions to form water, thus enabling the production of ATP molecules. In sample A, the higher respiration rate indicates an increased consumption of oxygen. This increased oxygen demand occurs to meet the energy requirement during periods of heightened cellular activities. As a result, more oxygen is consumed, enabling more efficient completion of the electron transport chain and leading to the production of a larger number of ATP molecules. In contrast, sample B has no induced respiration rate, meaning that oxygen consumption is minimal or non-existent in this case. This absence of oxygen consumption disrupts the electron transport chain, effectively halting the production of ATP molecules. Consequently, sample B is unable to produce the energy needed to fuel cellular activities. Taking into account the information provided regarding sample A and sample B, it is evident that ATP molecules would be produced in sample A, where there is a higher respiration rate. This increased rate enables efficient cellular respiration, allowing for the production of energy in the form of ATP molecules. On the other hand, sample B, with its lack of induced respiration, is unable to generate ATP and thus cannot produce energy for cellular activities."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Scotland Yard chief Bernard Hogan Howe said it was time for the police to get a pay rise. Britain's top cop Bernard Hogan Howe has said it is time for the police to get a pay rise. The Scotland Yard chief said police officers had been hit by years of pay freezes and had seen their standard of living deteriorate 'like everybody else'. His remarks came in response to David Cameron's call for businesses to hand their staff a pay rise in a major speech today. Sir Bernard, appearing on LBC radio this morning, was also grilled on Scotland Yard's battle to combat terrorism. But the Scotland Yard chief was left red-faced after forgetting the number of the anti-terror hotline set up for people to report their concerns about extremism. It came after he was asked by a caller what he made of the Prime Minister's urge for pay rises. The Metropolitan Police Commissioner said: 'I think it's a very good idea, particularly for police officers.' He added: 'I think the point he is making … is that as business costs reduce through fuel and other things, our interest rates down that some of the profits that have been made should be shared with their staff. 'Well I don't suppose that applies to the police but it's certainly true that our officers and staff have seen fixed salaries now for a number of years and like everyone else has seen their standard of living deteriorate. 'So anything that would help them I support. And if that, if it's possible to get a pay rise of course we'd support it.' Sir Bernard said the police had only received a below-inflation 1 per cent pay rise last year after 'two to three years of a pay freeze' following the 2008 recession. He added: 'I think it would be helpful, particularly with the London property market, to make sure that you know our officers are properly rewarded.' The police chief's intervention came after Mr Cameron urged booming businesses to pass on their profits in bigger pay cheques to their staff. In an attempt to create an election feed-good factor, the Prime Minister insisted trading conditions in Britain have 'not been this good for a long time', and it is time employees saw wage rises after years of a squeeze living conditions. It comes as a sharp fall in oil prices is helping to fuel the fastest growth in the UK economy since before the financial crisis. The Prime Minister was accused of hypocrisy after calling for a pay rise for private sector workers, while overseeing continuing wage restraint in the public sector. Bernard Hogan Howe was left red-faced this morning after admitting he could not remember the anti-terrorism hotline number he has urged Londoners to use. The Metropolitan Police commissioner was asked to repeat the freephone number by LBC host Nick Ferrari after a former serviceman called in to say he had not seen it publicised. Sir Bernard said: 'At this second I must admit I haven't got it with me - it's an 0800 number, so it's free ... Every other time I've been in (to the LBC phone-in) I think I have actually mentioned it. 'You could argue it's an unmemorable number.' The commissioner was later informed the hotline number is 0800 789 321. He added: 'It's ascending and descending numbers. It is probably not that easy to remember - as I've just highlighted.' Latest figures show that average wages rose by 1.8 per cent in the year to November, while the CPI rate of inflation stands at just 0.5 per cent. Mr Cameron said: 'The most recent figures show that wages are already growing faster than inflation, and as the economy continues to grow it's important this continues and that everyone benefits. Put simply – it's time Britain had a pay rise.' But it comes after years of prices rising faster than pay, leaving families worse off each month. Critics accused the government of double standards, because pay in the public sector has been frozen or slated to rise by just 1 per cent. Unions claim the average wage is worth £2,500 less a year as a result of pay failing to keep pace with inflation. The TUC's general secretary Frances O'Grady dismissed Mr Cameron's call as 'no more than pre-election mood music'. She said: 'Since David Cameron became Prime Minister, the average wage is worth £2,500 less a year, the worst fall in living standards since Queen Victoria was on the throne. 'Saying it would be nice if wages went up is no more than pre-election mood music. If elected again his policies would do the opposite. 'Huge cuts would take spending back to the same share of the economy as in the 1930s. This would depress the economy and mean public sector wages would fall every year. On top of that he would make strikes almost impossible, holding back pay across every sector.' Unite general secretary Len McCluskey added: 'If Cameron was serious about giving Britain a pay rise then he'd put his money where his mouth is and immediately boost the minimum wage by at least £1.50 an hour with the promise of a living wage. Instead we have empty words, which don't put food on the table or pay the rent.' Unison's general secretary Dave Prentis said: 'If Jeremy Hunt was following David Cameron's lead, he would have implemented the NHS pay review body's recommendations in full last month.' The round-the-clock police operation to guard fugitive WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange is a drain on taxpayers' money and is being reviewed, the UK's most senior officer has said. Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe told LBC radio that the force is assessing its options due to the pressure the operation at the Ecuadorian embassy in London is putting on resources. He said: 'We won't talk about tactics but we are reviewing what options we have. It is sucking our resources.'

Katrina got good grades in exams and was successful in life. As college life progressed, the difference in study habits between Katrina and Carrie became more and more evident. As Katrina's focus and dedication to her studies grew, so did her understanding of the material, allowing her to excel in her courses. Her grades reflected her hard work, resulting in her consistently being on the dean's list. Carrie, on the other hand, took a more relaxed approach to her studies. She preferred to spend her time socializing, attending parties, and participating in extracurricular activities. Her grades suffered as a result, putting her academic standing in jeopardy. Katrina's strong work ethic and determination didn't go unnoticed by the faculty and her peers. She became an active participant in class discussions, and her professors appreciated her keen insights and thoughtful contributions. Meanwhile, Carrie struggled to keep up with the coursework, and her lack of engagement in class did not help her connect with her professors. During her senior year, Katrina decided to take on a research project under the guidance of one of her professors. This experience allowed her to delve deeper into her field of study, and her findings were eventually published in a respected academic journal. This accomplishment boosted her credibility and propelled her to become a well-regarded figure within her chosen field. As graduation approached, the difference in career prospects for Katrina and Carrie was stark. Katrina landed a job offer from a prestigious company in her field, while Carrie struggled to find any job opportunities that aligned with her career goals. In the years that followed, Katrina continued to excel in her career, earning promotions and respect from her peers and superiors. She eventually established herself as an expert within her industry and was invited to speak at conferences, lead workshops, and serve as a mentor to young professionals entering the workforce. Carrie, on the other hand, found it difficult to break into her desired field and eventually settled for a more modest career path. While she enjoyed a relatively stable job, she couldn't help but feel unfulfilled, knowing that she hadn't reached her true potential. Despite their diverging career paths, Katrina and Carrie stayed in touch and remained close friends. Carrie often looked to Katrina for advice and guidance in her professional life. Over time, Carrie learned from Katrina's example and began to take her career more seriously, gradually improving her professional standing. In the end, Katrina's commitment to her studies during college wasn't just about getting good grades. It laid the foundation for her successful career and the opportunities that came with it. Moreover, her achievements also had a ripple effect on those around her, inspiring people like Carrie to strive for more in their own lives. This story demonstrates the importance of hard work and dedication, as well as the far-reaching impact of personal success."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Toulouse-Lautrec and the others ask for Christian's help, and his writing skills allow them to finish their proposed show, \\"Spectacular Spectacular\\", that they wish to sell to the owner of the Moulin Rouge, Harold Zidler (Jim Broadbent).

Step 5: If the current item is an alphabet character, add its index (or position) to the created list. Since we're considering the position of the 1st element to be 1, simply add 1 to the index value returned by enumerate(). Step 6: After the loop, check if your list storing the positions is still empty. If it is, return -1. This means there were no alphabet characters in the input list.

This movie should have won the National Award and would have been my pick to represent India at the Oscars. It is at least a thousand times better than 'Shaaws', which is going to the Oscars, from India, this year. It is such a pity that the information about this (and all other Indian movies) on IMDb is lacking and sometimes even wrong. Sadashiv Amrapurkar played a very important character in this movie and he is not even credited on these pages. The rest of the cast and crew too are not mentioned at all. Awards and nominations for this movie are not given even when Sonali Kulkarni won the Indian National Award for this movie. There was not even a single vote cast for 'Doghi'. 'Doghi' is not a Hindi movie. It is Marathi, and thankfully escapes the song and dance sequence, does not get tangled up in glitzy glamour and half-witted designer ware. It is a real life, soulful story that is made with a rare understanding and respect. 'Doghi' which can roughly be translated as 'two women' is a story of two sisters, Gauri and Krishna. It is actually a very simple story, Sumitra Bhave does not venture into many sub plots, and that makes it a very difficult film to direct. The entire movie is set in a non-descript remote village in Maharashtra and the screen rarely ventures far from the house of the two female protagonists. No aesthetic sunsets in this one. The movie opens and we are introduced to the entire house, which is preparing for Gauri's wedding. Gauri and Krishna's father being a hard working farmer, the house is full and happy; there is nothing wanting in their simple lives. However on the eve of the wedding Gauri's to-be-husband meets with a fatal accident. Gauri's father cannot bear the tragic news and suffers a major stroke. Without a strong, working member the house could have fallen apart but Gauri's mother shoulders the responsibility. She works as and when she can, but cannot make ends meet. But her life still, is easier than Gauri's. Superstitions, that people half-heartedly try to forget, make Gauri an evil luck bringer. She is outcast from the society. Gauri's mother writes to her brother. Desperate for help she accepts his suggestion. He takes Gauri off to Mumbai where she is made to work in brothels. Gauri sends home the money she earns and their conditions improve. Gauri gives her life for that of her family's. However when Gauri returns home for Krishna's wedding, her mother does not come out to meet her. She does not allow Krishna near her and does not allow Gauri in front of the guests. She loves Gauri but fears for Krishna's life. This breaks Gauri completely and she decides to return to her unfortunate life. But Krishna runs out and holds Gauri. She begs her beloved sister to return. Krishna promises to stand by her. Promises that they would face the world  together. There is nothing that is not required in this movie. Everything is necessary and sufficient. Gauri goes off to Mumbai but what she does there is never told  the subtle dialogues tell us what there is to know. It just the bare story, which is profound in its simplicity. 'Doghi' is responsible cinema. It is respectful to the subject it handles. It is respectful towards its audience  it does not think them to have the mental capability of a four year old. The acting is first rate. The direction is marvelous  the silences carry the story forward in a way, no words could have. The script is well researched. Anyone who appreciates good cinema is bound to like 'Doghi'.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Three NY Supreme Court judges could serve past 70 if voters approve amendment Chief Judge Jonathan Lippman is one of three state Supreme Court judges who intend to serve past 70 if a constitutional amendment to raise the retirement age for some judges to 80 passes Tuesday. ALBANY — State Chief Judge Jonathan Lippman is one of three judges on the state’s top court who say they intend to serve past 70 if a constitutional amendment to raise the retirement age for some judges to 80 passes Tuesday. Lippman originally pushed to hike the retirement age for all judges to 80, saying he would be willing to exempt himself and his six colleagues on the Court of Appeals. But ultimately, the Legislature agreed to put a more limited amendment before voters that would only affect state Supreme Court judges. It also allows Court of Appeals judges to complete their 14-year terms even if they pass the current retirement age of 70. Lippman, who would get to serve an additional seven years, and two other Court of Appeals judges, Robert Smith and Eugene Pigott — who both hit 70 within the next three years — said through a spokesman that they plan to continue to serve if the measure passes. That has led some critics of the plan to question Lippman’s lobbying to increase the retirement age for judges. “Was this all about them staying on the court?” asked one insider. A Court of Appeals spokesman said Lippman was serious about exempting that court if the Legislature agreed to try to raise the retirement age for all judges. But that didn’t happen and Lippman — who is close to Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver — believes he has more to accomplish before retiring, the spokesman said. Lippman has argued that mandatory retirement at 70 is outdated. If the three Court of Appeals judges were forced to retire at 70 and Gov. Cuomo is reelected next year, he would get to replace all of them, giving him all seven appointments on the court. Cuomo hasn’t taken a position on the amendment but has raised reservations and questioned whether the state wants judges in their late 70s. Currently, state Supreme Court judges must retire at 70, though they can seek a special re-certification every two years that allows them to serve until 76. The measure to up the retirement age to 80 has the support of the court system and many in the legal community. Critics argue the measure excludes judges who work in criminal, county and family courts, which have the largest caseloads and backlogs. Summary:","completion":"Three justices from the New York's Supreme Court, including Chief Judge Jonathan Lippman, have expressed their intention to serve beyond the age of 70 if a constitutional amendment raising the retirement age for certain judges to 80 is approved. The proposed amendment, which originally included all judges but later limited to state Supreme Court judges, also permits Court of Appeal judges to complete their 14-year terms even if they surpass the current retirement age of 70. Critics have questioned the motives behind these potential changes, pointing out that they exclude judges from criminal, county, and family courts, which carry the heaviest caseloads. Governor Cuomo has yet to express his view on the amendment, but raised concerns about having judges working in their late 70s."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Cust was a distinguished politician active during the politically turbulent 1760s, and his monument at Belton blames his death at the age of 51 to the \\"unusual fatigues of his office\\". His heir was created Lord Brownlow in 1776, and Belton was owned by successive Lords Brownlow for the next 200 years.In the last three decades of the 19th century the 3rd Earl Brownlow spent much time and money restoring Belton, and consequently the house entered the 20th century in a good state of repair and preservation. However, the 20th century was to present Belton and its estate with serious problems. These included the introduction of income tax and death duties which would leave the finances of the Brownlow family severely depleted.At the beginning of World War I, like many other British landowners, the 3rd Earl Brownlow offered his house and park to the Government for war service. The offer was accepted, and the largest and most drastic changes were made in the park since the time of Viscount Tyrconnel's folly building. In August 1914, the house and park were used as the assembly point for the 11th (Northern) Division before its deployment. In 1915, the home depôt and training ground of the Machine Gun Corps were established in the southern part of Belton park. The lie of the land there, where the River Witham passes between the Lower Lincolnshire Limestone and the Upper Lias mudstone, lent itself to the development of the necessary firing ranges close to good communications by way of the Great North Road and Grantham railway station on the East Coast Main Line. The depôt was closed in 1919, the site cleared and the land restored to Lord Brownlow in 1920.

Grumman adds that the Mandela Effect is described as “false memory” by those skeptical of it and an example of a multiverse by others, and defines the term:The Mandela Effect is named for South African statesman and civil rights activist Nelson Mandela. When he died in 2013, news of his death stirred up some surprising — and mysterious — memories. People around the world reported that they remembered hearing of his death decades earlier, in the 1980s. Some even vividly recalled watching his funeral on television … Thus, people who remember seeing Mandela’s funeral in the 1980s may not be simply misremembering. They might have somehow slipped across from an alternate history where Nelson Mandela did die in the 1980s. In our world, he was imprisoned for many years. Likewise, people who recall “The Berenstein Bears” may have grown up in a parallel world where the bears’ name really did end in -stein.Threads about the claim regularly appear on Reddit subs such as r/retconned (devoted to what it calls “the retcon effect” in reality), r/MandelaEffect, and metaphysics-related subreddits in general:Scary Movie – Shorty’s Line \\"\\"I see Dead People\\"\\" from RetconnedSome posters share their commentary with “residue,” trace examples of the alternate-reality version they recall:The \\"\\"I see white people\\"\\" ME from Scary Movie, with decade old residue from MandelaEffectOn Twitter, users frequently tweeted as they happened upon their own alternate memory:I've seen the theory about the Hadron super collider causing us to shift dimensions and that this one isnt 'right'.

Please tell what YOU remember saying? \\"\\"I see WHITE people or I see DEAD people?\\"\\" This is blowing my mind..— Brianna (@babedaaze) February 15, 2018The earliest mention of Scary Movie‘s “I see white people” Mandela Effect we found was from November 2017. In that iteration, the writer surmised the line appeared in the trailer but was later removed for reasons of “political correctness”:[Mass Memory Discrepancy Effect or MMDE]: I see white peopleCurrent: I see dead peopleSome claim that the scene in the original Scary Movie, which lampooned The 6th Sense, had the line “I see white people”, whereas now it’s seen as “I see dead people”. Is this a false memory, or was it really this way originally?It must be said, “I see dead people” just doesn’t make sense. Not only is it the exact line from the film it is parodying, but the black dude saying it just isn’t funny the way “white people” is, or would be … Many people definitely recall this being in the trailer but suspect it was dropped from the main movie. These days, anything remotely racist will come under increased scrutiny – even obvious comedy such as this.But before Mandela died, a comment on a decade-old Yahoo Answers thread responded to the original post about Scary Movie and “I see dead people,” claiming the quote was in actuality “I see white people”:no Scary movie quotes ” I see white people” the Sixth Sense is the movie that quotes thatA commenter responded:All you have to do is read his lips! You can definitely see him say white, and they put smoke to try and cover it up.On February 12 2018, a YouTube video about the Scary Movie “I see white people” Mandela Effect appeared. In its description, the uploader said:In Scary Movie There is a funny line where Shorty does a spoof on the movie Sixth Sense and says” I see white people” instead of dead people. Well guess what I never said that in this reality.More than one commenter described the discrepancy as the “freakiest” one yet, and others referenced it as a pop culture touchstone among their friends:Oh HELL NO!! I have a friend that lives by us and him and his family are the only black family in the area, he says “I see white people” all the time when he walks our door. The freakiest one yet! !Other commenters blamed CERN, an aspect of the conspiracy discussed in broader detail on our page “Did the World End in 2012?” One sub-theory around the Mandela Effect is that European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) experiments with particle physics in 2012 managed to alter reality in minor ways:Mandela Effects like this is why I believe someone (most likely CERN) is doing this intentionally.However, there are non-conspiracy theory answers to many of these questions. One response in objection to this particular claim involves the 2002 movie Undercover Brother. In a March 22 2019 r/MandelaEffect thread, a commenter claimed that the exact line appeared in a portion of Undercover Brother:I see white people: SOLVED from MandelaEffectAn embedded YouTube clip uploaded on March 22 2009 (approximately around the time the Yahoo Answers thread appeared, but several years before Mandela’s death coined the term and popularized the theory and ten years to the date of the thread citing it) was cued to a part where the main character says “I see white people.”The line also appeared in a similar clip uploaded in July 2014. Comments on that thread were divisive, with some users positing Undercover Brother‘s trailer contained the line and caused Mandela Effect proponents to conflate their memories, a theory vociferously rejected by fellow commenters:haha,so you are suggesting to people who NEVER saw the undercover brother movie and vividly feel as if they heard the line in scary movie that they instead had their memories contaminated by “possibly” seeing the trailer for a completely different movie perhaps once or a few times? ?….bahahaha….oooooooookay then….and they say believers have some out-there theories.Scary Movie was released in July 2000, and preceded by trailers; one of the lines the film parodied was from The Sixth Sense, released in August 1999. The Sixth Sense was a breakout hit, which is why the very next year it was parodied in Scary Movie. Another hugely well-received 1999 film was novella adaptation The Green Mile, by Stephen King; it was another runaway hit, and both were widely viewed by moviegoers.Both of these films were large presences at the 72nd Academy Awards ceremony in March 2000, honoring film efforts from the previous year, 1999. Of note is while the 72nd Academy Awards in 2000 was not the most viewed (viewership peaked in 1998), an estimated 46 million Americans watched the ceremony — a number which dropped each year, clocking in at 29 million in 2019.People who have watched the Oscars are likely aware the program’s host typically intersperses announcement and distribution of the awards with entertainment segments, featuring musical numbers and comedy sketches. Comedian Billy Crystal hosted the 72nd Academy Awards in 2000, and one of his comedy bits was a segment panning various celebrities in the audience, musing about what they might be thinking.That segment was uploaded to YouTube in October 2010 (prior to the death of Mandela and the ensuing “Mandela Effect” theory). One joke in particular was well-received by both ceremony attendees as well as YouTube commenters commenting — often before the Mandela Effect Scary Movie rumor took root. At around the 1:15 mark, the camera panned to The Green Mile‘s Michael Clarke Duncan, who died in 2012. As Duncan’s face appeared on the screen, Crystal quipped:I see white people.On a side note, Crystal’s joke was incidentally prescient; the 88th Academy Awards in 2016 (for films released in 2015) led to controversy and boycotts due to the snubbing of nominees of color. In response, the hashtag #OscarsSoWhite was used to voice frustration in the entertainment industry, ushering in changes in the coming years.Regarding the Scary Movie “I see white people” Mandela Effect rumor, it is impossible to assign a truth value to a claim hinging on the possible existence of multiple parallel universes. It is, however, true that a large number of people recall the line and feel the “I see dead people” joke didn’t “work” on the same level as the other did. In discourse, some have speculated that “Mandela Effected” people conflated that line with another in 2002’s Undercover Brother.It also seems possible that some of the 46 million viewers of the 72nd Academy Awards in 2000 remembered Duncan reacting to Crystal’s “I see white people” quip, the two films, and later conflated the joke with Scary Movie.But since it’s impossible to prove a negative, we also can’t really rule out the possibility the line truly was spoken as it is commonly remembered — but in an alternate timeline.\\"","completion":"Claim: Many people recall a line from the 2000 film Scary Movie as \\"I see white people\\" instead of \\"I see dead people,\\" and attribute this discrepancy to the Mandela Effect."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Max Cady (Robert De Niro) is a former client whom Bowden defended 14 years earlier when he was working as a public defender in Atlanta. Cady was tried for the violent rape and battery of a young woman. Bowden, appalled by Cady's crime, buried evidence that might have lightened Cady's sentence or even secured his acquittal. After his release from prison, Cady tracks down Bowden. He studied law in prison and assumed his own defense, unsuccessfully appealing his conviction several times. Cady hints he has learned about Bowden burying the report. Several incidents involving Cady impact the Bowden family, which consists of Bowden's wife Leigh (Jessica Lange) and their teenage daughter Danielle (Juliette Lewis). The family dog is poisoned. Cady lurks near their property. Bowden attempts to have Cady arrested, but police lieutenant Elgart (Robert Mitchum), says there is no evidence of a crime. At a bar, Cady meets Lori Davis (Illeana Douglas), a colleague of Bowden with whom she might be having a love affair. At her house, Cady cuffs her hands behind her back, breaks her arm and rapes her. Lori refuses to press charges, ashamed of what happened. Bowden hires private investigator Claude Kersek (Joe Don Baker) to follow Cady.

Cady secretly tapes the conversation with a hidden recorder. Kersek persuades Bowden to hire three men to beat Cady and intimidate him, but as Bowden watches from a hiding place, Cady turns the tide on his attackers and viciously beats them. Cady uses the recording of Bowden's threat and an exaggerated display of his own injuries to file for a restraining order against Bowden.

Write a title for this article: Not long ago, pasta-maker Barilla was just one more major company that had run afoul of the gay rights movement, a distinction it earned last year when its chairman said he would never feature a same-sex couple in an ad. If gays didn’t like it, he added, they could eat something else. But in a sign of how toxic it has become for a company to be viewed as unfriendly toward gays, Barilla has made a dramatic turnaround in the space of one year, expanding health benefits for transgender workers and their families, contributing money to gay rights causes, and featuring a lesbian couple on a promotional Web site. Barilla has journeyed from gay rights pariah to poster child — on Wednesday it received a perfect score from a prominent gay rights group that rates companies on their gay-friendliness. It is an about-face that highlights how companies, which typically shy away from controversy, are increasingly being forced to take sides in the cultural battle over gay rights and same-sex marriage — and how decisively pro-gay forces have gained the upper hand. Other household-name brands have also found themselves in hot water over actions that were perceived to be anti-gay. Target, for example, strived to make amends after coming under fire in 2010 for political contributions that supported a Minnesota gubernatorial candidate who opposed same-sex marriage. Chick-fil-A stopped giving to certain organizations in 2012 after earning the ire of gay rights groups that accused the fast-food chain of supporting anti-gay causes. Both companies were subject to boycotts, though there has been a counter effort by socially conservative groups to support and embrace Chick-fil-A. The peril for companies is not short-term profits, because boycotts rarely affect revenue directly, said Mary-Hunter McDonnell, a professor of strategy at Georgetown University’s McDonough School of Business. “Really, boycotts are about threatening a company’s public image and reputation,” she said, and a tarnished brand can ultimately hurt the bottom line. In the past, companies had to be careful not to offend groups that opposed homosexuality, said Bob Witeck, a corporate crisis consultant who specializes in gay issues. Two decades ago, Witeck helped American Airlines weather criticism over its decision to market to gays. His advice at the time was for the company to explain to the opposition that this was simply a good business decision. But more recently, opinions have shifted dramatically to the point that it is a positive for some companies to be viewed as supportive of gay rights, particularly among young customers, who might view incidents such as the one articulated a year ago by Barilla as “stupid and backwards,” he said. Starbucks, Nike and Microsoft, for instance, endorsed legalizing same-sex marriage in Washington state in 2012. In the case of Barilla — a 130-year-old company based in Parma, Italy, that is the world’s largest pasta manufacturer — the blowback was fierce in September 2013 when Guido Barilla told an Italian radio host, “I would never do [a commercial] with a homosexual couple, not for lack of respect, but because we don’t agree with them,” according to reports. “Ours is a classic family where the woman plays a fundamental role.” He continued: “If [gays] don’t like it, they can go eat another brand.” The remarks grabbed headlines around the world and prompted boycotts in the United States, where the firm has 30 percent of the pasta market with 430 million in sales in 2013, and elsewhere. Harvard University dumped Barilla from its cafeterias, gay rights groups promoted names of other brands of pasta, and Barilla’s competitors seized on the opportunity to present themselves as more forward-thinking, with Bertolli Germany posting a comment on its Facebook page promoting “pasta and love for all!” Guido Barilla issued multiple video apologies in the wake of the scandal. Barilla Group did not make Guido Barilla available for an interview, but in a statement, he apologized again, adding: “I am proud to say that, as a result of these discussions, we have all learned a great deal about the true definition and meaning of family, and over the past year we have worked hard to reflect that throughout our organization.” Some of the gay advocates who have worked with Guido Barilla since his comments believe his contrition is sincere. “He was horrified at the consequences and his personal beliefs,” said David Mixner, a veteran gay rights activist and author who served as a consultant for Barilla. He called the recent diversity initiative “the most all-encompassing effort to bounce back from an unfortunate misstatement that I’ve ever been part of.” Seth Adam, a spokesman for GLAAD, a gay advocacy group that has also met with Barilla, said it is important to acknowledge someone when they have undergone an “evolution” in support of gay rights. “I’m not giving anyone license to say things that are discriminatory,” he said. “However, I do think it’s okay to learn, and I think we’ve seen that in elected officials to everyday families.” The company’s 100 rating in the Human Rights Campaign’s annual Corporate Equality Index, which is based on internal company policies as well as corporate citizenship, is remarkable, said Deena Fidas, director of the workplace program for the Human Rights Campaign. Last year, Barilla did not even ask to be rated. Of the 781 companies that volunteered to be rated this year, fewer than half got a perfect score. “It is very unusual for a business to take on the full spectrum of CEI criteria in one year,” she said. “Some people may certainly speculate about the motivations here, but at the end of the day it’s irrefutable that at Barilla, you have LGBT-inclusive policies and practices . . . that were not there a year ago.” Talita Erickson, chief diversity officer for Barilla, said that the company has demonstrated its sincerity with its actions. It has expanded its health benefits to include transgender-related care. It has instituted a thorough diversity training that all 8,000 of its workers will eventually undergo. It has broadened its anti-discrimination policy to cover gay and transgender people. The company also has donated money to the Tyler Clementi Foundation, an anti-bullying organization founded by the parents of a gay Rutgers University student who committed suicide, and featured a lesbian couple on a Web site devoted to urging families to eat more meals together. But will same-sex couples be turning up in any television commercials? Not immediately, said Erickson, who explained that the company did not want to be “reactionary” in light of the criticism. “My understanding is we’re absolutely open to having the LGBT community represented in our ads in the future,” she said. “It’s going to happen gradually.” Title:","completion":"From Unfriendly to Supportive: Barilla's Turnaround in Embracing the LGBTQ Community"},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Please answer the following question about this movie plot.

In the heat of argument, Anne, who is driving, gets distracted and pulls out from behind the truck. Another truck comes up in the other lane. Anne attempts to get back behind the other truck but the impatient driver has pulled up too far. Lansdale waves his hand to the impatient driver to move back, and when she does not and Anne has to slam on the brakes, his hand is caught behind the truck, which also stops. The hand is severed completely in a bloody, violent scene. Anne attempts to find the severed hand but it is too late. Lansdale then starts a painful adjustment to not having his right hand, which so happened to be his drawing hand. Anne also adjusts to her guilt of being responsible for the accident and tries to get closer with Lansdale.

Given the question: Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below. Which group of antelope is less adapted to the environment? In sub-Saharan Africa there are two predominant groups of antelope present. The first group of antelope, group A, have long necks and strong teeth. The second group of antelope, group B, have shorter necks and weaker teeth. Because of their longer necks and stronger teeth, the antelope from group A are more easily able to pick fruit and leaves from the tall trees in the region compared to antelope from group B. Hint: The theory of evolution by natural selection was proposed at about the same time by both Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace, shown in Figure below , and was set out in detail in Darwin's 1859 book On the Origin of Species . Natural selection is a process that causes heritable traits that are helpful for survival and reproduction to become more common, and harmful traits, or traits that are not helpful or advantageous for survival to become more rare in a population of organisms. This occurs because organisms with advantageous traits are more \\"fit\\" to survive in a particular environment and have \\"adapted\\" to the conditions of that environment. These individuals will have greater reproductive success than organisms less fit for survival in the environment. This will lead to an increase in the number of organisms with the advantageous trait(s) over time. Over many generations, adaptations occur through a combination of successive, small, random changes in traits, and natural selection of those variants best-suited for their environment. Natural selection is one of the cornerstones of modern biology. The answer is:","completion":"The group of antelope that is less adapted to the environment is group B. To determine this, I examined the information provided in the given paragraph. It states that in sub-Saharan Africa, there are two primary groups of antelope- Group A and Group B. Group A has long necks and strong teeth, which allows them to easily pick fruits and leaves from tall trees in the region, while Group B, with their shorter necks and weaker teeth, struggle to do so. From this, we can infer that Group A is more \\"fit\\" for the environment they're in as they can utilize resources (like tall trees) that Group B cannot due to their physical attributes. This notion ties back to the theory of evolution by natural selection, also mentioned in the paragraph. According to this theory, traits that are advantageous for survival and reproduction become more common over time because they enhance an organism's fitness. Therefore, organisms with such traits are more \\"adapted\\" to their environment, and have greater reproductive success. In this context, the advantageous trait would be having long necks and strong teeth, which Group A possesses. As a result, they're likely to be more successful in this environment than Group B, making Group B the less adapted group."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Please answer the following question: This article: During the 1999 Russian Presidential elections, the two leading candidates are Igor Komarov, a former Colonel of the KGB, and Nikolai Nikolayev, a retired General of the Russian Army. When a car bomb explodes outside one of Komarov's pharmaceutical companies, and a virus is stolen from inside, an investigation by the FSB ensues headed by FSB agents Sonia Astrova and Andrei Kasanov. Their investigation is obstructed by the Director of the FSB, Anatoly Grishin. A British Embassy worker from Moscow, Sir Nigel Irvine, tracks down Jason Monk, a former CIA operative, who ran double agents in the Soviet Union and convinces him to investigate the incident. Once in Moscow, Jason finds an old friend, Viktor Akopov, who agrees to hide Jason from Komarov's men. Viktor steals a residue sample of the bomb used and his scientist friend Tonkin tells him that the explosive used, Semtex H, has a direct traceable link to the FSB. Tonkin is soon killed by Vladimir Dorganosov, the man who attacked Komarov industries and stole the bioweapon. Sonia and Andrei locate Leonid Zaitzev, a cleaner who worked at the Komarov Industries plant and saw Dorganosov steal the virus. As they question him, Grishin appears, arrests Zaitzev and fires Sonia and Andrei. Zaitzev is later killed by Dorganosov while in custody. Sonia goes home to find Jason waiting for her, and agrees to help him access the FSB network. However, they are shot at by Dorganosov, and a car chase ensues. They go to Andrei's house where they find him already dead. After the chase, Dorganosov demands the rest of his payment from his contractor, who is revealed to be Anatoly Grishin.

Please tell me the sentiment of the following review: This is the film in Antonioni's middle period that most critics dismiss quickly, as a 'flawed' look at 60s American youth culture/politics. For what it's worth, I found it more touching and memorable than his more acclaimed films like L'AVVENTURA, perhaps because he shows more emotion & empathy here than anywhere else. The story is simple, but it is used as a frame for Antonioni's brilliant observations of, and critique on American consumerist culture, student life, the counter-culture, and the whole anti-establishment, anti-war backlash that was so prominent then. Even from a purely technical point of view, it is a remarkably crafted film; from the opening credits sequence to the bizarre desert 'love-in', to the use of billboards, and right down to that jaw-dropping, cathartic finale that used 17 camera set-ups (in it's own way, as powerful as the climax of The Wild Bunch). Also, Antonioni chose one hell of a leading lady with Daria Halperin, one of the most beautiful ever to grace the screen. There isn't much 'acting' involved, as this feels more like a docu-drama, and so the use of non- professionals as the lead couple works quite effectively within that context. And the soundtrack is not only filled with marvelous music, its use is impressive as well (I can't forget the start of the film, mostly due to the selection of music - by Pink Floyd - that grooms the visuals so well). Contrary to popular opinion, this is quite an achievement in cinema, and one I would enthusiastically recommend to anyone with a taste or tolerance for the off- beat. Well worth seeking out, and one of those key films of the 60s that demands a DVD restoration/release.","completion":"To analyze the sentiment of this review, let's break it down step by step: 1. The reviewer acknowledges that most critics dismiss the film quickly, but they personally found it more touching and memorable than more acclaimed films. This demonstrates a positive sentiment. 2. They highlight the simplicity of the story but appreciate it for its brilliant observations and critique of American culture. This showcases an appreciation for the film's content, indicating another positive sentiment. 3. From a technical standpoint, the reviewer considers the film to be remarkably crafted, praising various aspects such as its opening credits, use of billboards, and the climactic finale. This demonstrates the reviewer's admiration, marking another positive sentiment. 4. The reviewer also compliments the choice of the leading lady Daria Halperin, stating that she is one of the most beautiful to grace the screen. Additionally, they believe the use of non-professionals fits the docu-drama style, contributing to the film's effectiveness. These statements represent further positive sentiments. 5. Lastly, the reviewer praises the film's soundtrack and its use in the film, both in terms of music selection and how it accompanies the visuals. In conclusion, the reviewer's sentiment is overwhelmingly positive. They appreciate various aspects of the film, such as the story, technical elements, acting, and soundtrack, and they contradict the popular opinion by calling it \\"an achievement in cinema.\\" The reviewer enthusiastically recommends the film to others who have a taste or tolerance for the off-beat and expresses a desire for a DVD restoration/release, reinforcing their positive sentiment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: The answer to the question: What was the name of the album that had it's press tour interrupted after Bono was seriously inured in a bicycle accident in Central Park on 16 November 2014? is inside the article: Throughout the 360° Tour, the band worked on multiple album projects, including: a traditional rock album produced by Danger Mouse; a dance record produced by RedOne and will.i.am; and Songs of Ascent. However, the latter was not completed to their satisfaction, and by December 2011, Clayton admitted it would not come to fruition. The sessions with Danger Mouse instead formed the foundation of U2's next album, and they worked with him until May 2013 before enlisting the help of producers Paul Epworth, Ryan Tedder, Declan Gaffney, and Flood. The band suspended work on the album late in 2013 to contribute a new song, \\"Ordinary Love\\", to the film Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom. The track, written in honour of Nelson Mandela, won the 2014 Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song. In November 2013, U2's long-time manager Paul McGuinness stepped down from his post as part of a deal with Live Nation to acquire his management firm, Principle Management. McGuinness, who had managed the group for over 30 years, was succeeded by Guy Oseary. In February 2014, another new U2 song, the single \\"Invisible\\", debuted in a Super Bowl television advertisement and was made available in the iTunes Store at no cost to launch a partnership with Product Red and Bank of America to fight AIDS. Bono called the track a \\"sneak preview\\" of their pending record.On 9 September 2014, U2 announced their thirteenth studio album, Songs of Innocence, at an Apple product launch event, and released it digitally the same day to all iTunes Store customers at no cost. The release made the album available to over 500 million iTunes customers in what Apple CEO Tim Cook called \\"the largest album release of all time.\\" Apple reportedly paid Universal Music Group and U2 a lump sum for a five-week exclusivity period in which to distribute the album and spent US100 million on a promotional campaign.

The answer to the question: What is the name of the person who might have assisted with the underdrawing in Van der Weyden's workshop? is inside the article: The Annunciation draws heavily on van der Weyden's 1430s Louvre Annunciation, his c. 1455 Saint Columba altarpiece, and the Clugny Annunciation (c. 1465–75), which is attributed to either van der Weyden or Memling. Memling almost certainly was apprenticed to van der Weyden in Brussels until setting up his own workshop in Bruges sometime after 1465. Memling's Annunciation is more innovative, with motifs such as the attendant angels that were absent in the earlier paintings. According to Till-Holger Borchert, not only was Memling familiar with van der Weyden's motifs and compositions, but he might have assisted with the underdrawing in van der Weyden's workshop. The shutters on the right are copied from the Louvre panel, the knotted curtain appears in the Columba triptych's \\"Annunciation\\".A sense of movement is conveyed throughout. The trailing edges of Gabriel's garment fall outside the pictorial space, indicating his arrival. The Virgin's \\"serpentine\\" pose, with attendant angels supporting her, adds to the sense of flow. Memling's use of color achieves a startling effect. The traditional rays of light are replaced with light color indicators; the white clothes rendered in \\"icy\\" blue, the angel to the right in yellow patches seems \\"bleached by light\\", the left-hand angel appears to be steeped in shadow, dressed in clothes of lavender and bearing deep green wings. The effect is iridescent, according to Blum, who writes, \\"this shimmering surface gives [the figures] an unearthly quality, separating them from the more believable world of the bedchamber.\\" The effect deviates from the pure naturalism and realism which typifies Early Netherlandish art, causing a \\"startling\\" juxtaposition, an effect that is \\"unsteadying\\" and contradictory., can you guess it ?

Answer the following question: When travelers think of an Adriatic cruise, scenes of Venice, Italy--its canals, bridges, piazzas, and stunning architecture--come to mind. It's one of the most popular cruise destinations in Europe. And for many, the sail-away from Venice, through its Giudecca Canal, is an awe-inspiring experience. Venice may be known as La Serenissima, or \\"the most peaceful,\\" which, however, isn't entirely accurate these days. Venetians have been increasingly concerned about the impact of tourism and the potential for an environmental disaster off its shoreline due to the number of cruise ships that enter and exit its lagoon . That's why earlier last month, Venice announced a new policy to forbid the transit of cruise ships to the city via the Giudecca Canal. It's not that the city wants to shun the cruise industry altogether: It simply wants to force traffic further away from the landmarks along the shoreline. City officials say that most ships will now transit the Contorta Sant'Angelo Canal. Additionally, the city is _ the size of ships that can visit Venice, as well as the total number of ships that call on it on a daily basis. As of January 2014, Venice plans to reduce the visitations of larger ships (those that are 40,000 tons or heavier) by 20 percent. This effectively caps the number of ships that can enter per day to five. In November, ships heavier than 96,000 tons will not be allowed to enter Guidecca Canal at all. How the city plans to carry out the new five-ships-per-day rule remains to be seen and have yet to be announced. Which ships will be allowed passage? Will it be first-come, first-served? However they proceed, cruise line executives want their passengers to know that Venice will remain a regular port of call--even if the transit to and from the city must evolve. The new policy was issued in order to _ . A) stress the accuracy of Venice's fame for peace B) reduce the damage to Venice's enviironment C) depend less on the crusie industry D) limit the number of toursits Answer:","completion":"The new policy was issued in order to reduce the damage to Venice's environment. Venice's decision to change its policy regarding cruise ships and their transit through the iconic Giudecca Canal was driven mainly by growing concerns about the potential impact of these massive vessels on the city's fragile environment and infrastructure. Over the years, the influx of tourists and frequent visits by large cruise ships have started to take a toll on Venice's delicate ecosystem, as well as its historic and architectural treasures. In order to address these concerns and to preserve the unique beauty of Venice for future generations, the city officials decided to implement a set of new measures aimed at mitigating the environmental impact of the cruise industry on the Venetian lagoon. Among these measures are the ban on the transit of cruise ships through the Giudecca Canal and the redirection of their traffic to the Contorta Sant'Angelo Canal, which is located further away from the city's most famous landmarks along the shoreline. Moreover, the city is looking to limit the size of the ships that can visit Venice, as well as the total number of ships that can call on it on a daily basis. As of January 2014, Venice is planning to reduce the visitations of larger cruise ships (those that are 40,000 tons or heavier) by 20%, effectively capping the number of ships that can enter the city per day at five. In November, ships weighing more than 96,000 tons will be completely disallowed from entering the Giudecca Canal. The new policy's primary objective is to lessen the strain on Venice's environment and infrastructure while still maintaining the city's connection with the cruise industry. Although certain aspects of the policy implementation (such as the allocation of passage rights to specific ships) have not been fully detailed yet, the cruise line executives have reassured their passengers that Venice will remain a regular port of call, with the transit to and from the city simply adapting to the new regulations. In summary, the main purpose of the new policy is to reduce the damage to Venice's environment caused by the cruise ship industry rather than limiting the number of tourists or depending less on the cruise industry. Venice intends to preserve its unique charm and appeal, as well as protect the city's historical and natural resources for generations to come."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Realize that 'You' are consciousness.\\"","completion":"Title: Embracing the Power of Consciousness: Moving Deeply into the Now Introduction: The human mind often finds itself lost in a tangled web of thoughts, memories, and future plans. However, the true essence of our being lies in living in the present moment. A simple yet profound idea to achieve this state is to move deeply into the Now and realize that 'You' are consciousness itself. This article delves into the transformative power of this realization and how it can help us live a more balanced, fulfilling, and mindful life. Step 1: Understanding Consciousness Before we explore how we can access the power of being present and embracing consciousness, it is essential to understand what consciousness is. Consciousness is the state of being aware, capable of thought, perception, and feeling. It is your mind's subjective experience of the world that creates your reality. Embracing the idea that 'You' are consciousness helps us realize that we are not just separate individuals confined to physical bodies, but a collective field of awareness experiencing the world through various perspectives. Step 2: Accepting the Present Moment One of the most crucial elements of moving deeply into the Now is accepting the present moment as it is. Many people spend most of their lives trapped in the regrets of the past or the anxieties of the future, thereby missing the beauty and depth of life happening right now. Acceptance doesn't mean giving up; instead, it means acknowledging the current situation without judgment, resistance, or denial. Step 3: Redirecting Your Attention To move deeply into the Now, start by redirecting your attention to the present moment. Pay attention to your breath, your bodily sensations, and the sounds and sights around you. This practice helps you withdraw focus from the continuous loop of thoughts and take refuge in the peace and silence of the present moment. Step 4: Engaging in Mindful Activities Incorporating mindfulness into everyday activities, such as walking, cooking, or even washing dishes, can help bring your attention to the present moment. For example, when you walk, observe each step, feel the ground beneath your feet, and notice the rhythm of your breath. These simple acts will gradually enhance your awareness of the present and deepen your connection with the Now. Step 5: Cultivating Gratitude and Compassion By embracing our consciousness, we can develop a greater sense of gratitude for the present moment and deepen our connections with others. As we become more in tune with our conscious selves, our compassion grows. We become more sensitive to the feelings and needs of others, and their suffering becomes ours. This interconnectedness propels us to serve and help others and fosters a more harmonious and compassionate society. Conclusion: Moving deeply into the Now and realizing that 'You' are consciousness is a powerful idea for leading a mindful and transformative life. By cultivating presence, fully embracing the present moment, and developing a deeper connection with our true self and others, we can unlock the potential to live a more balanced, fulfilled, and blissful existence."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

We introduce our main characters: a small-town detective named Sarah, a renowned chef named Antonio, the ship's captain Justin, and a diverse group of passengers, each with their individual backgrounds, motives, and secrets. Step 2: The incident On the second night of the voyage, a large number of passengers fall sick, experiencing severe food poisoning. The common link between them is that they all ate one of the meal options at the exclusive gala dinner held earlier that evening. Step 3: Investigation begins Sarah, the detective, is called in to find out what caused the food poisoning, as the situation falls under her jurisdiction. The captain, Justin, coordinates with her and provides her access to the kitchen, staff, and passenger manifests. Step 4: Unraveling the mystery Sarah interviews the affected passengers and confirms that the poisoned dish was, in fact, a seafood platter prepared by Chef Antonio. Antonio is questioned and claims that he prepared the dish according to standard procedure, with fresh ingredients, and maintains his innocence. Step 5: Background checks and discovering motives Sarah begins to look into the backgrounds of the passengers and crew members, seeking any potential motives or connections to the incident. During her investigation, she discovers that a few passengers have criminal records or suspicious past activities, including fraud, theft, and even poisoning. These passengers become her primary suspects. Step 6: Distractions and red herrings As the investigation continues, several red herrings emerge, such as false confessions and planted evidence, to divert Sarah's attention. However, she remains undeterred in her pursuit of the truth. Step 7: Tension and climax The tension escalates as Sarah narrows down her suspects and confronts each of them, but none provide concrete evidence of involvement. Gradually, the poisoned passengers begin to recover, leading to the belief that the perpetrator will get away with the crime. But Sarah discovers a crucial clue in the form of security footage, where one of the suspects is seen tampering with the seafood before it was prepared by Chef Antonio. Step 8: Resolution and aftermath Sarah apprehends the perpetrator, revealing their motive – a twisted form of revenge against another passenger who has caused them great suffering in the past and happened to be among those poisoned. The passengers' food poisoning incident was an elaborate setup to target one specific individual. In the end, the movie reaches its conclusion as the suspect is taken into custody, and the ship resumes its journey, albeit with a renewed sense of caution and appreciation for the fragility of human life."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

A:","completion":"The bio contains several key details about Svend Poulsen, a Danish military commander of the 17th century. 1. Svend Poulsen served in the armies of three Danish kings: Christian IV, Frederick III, and Christian V. This shows his long and dedicated service to the Danish monarchy across different reigns. 2. He fought in three significant wars during his career: the Torstenson War (1643-1645), the Second Northern War (1655-1660), and the Scanian War (1675-1679). These conflicts demonstrate Poulsen's extensive experience in military campaigns, particularly in battles against Sweden and the involvement of the Dutch Republic. 3. Svend Poulsen led the \\"Snaphane\\" militia in guerilla warfare against Sweden in occupied Zealand (a region in Denmark) from 1658 to 1659. This suggests that he was adept and resourceful in using unconventional methods to defend his homeland from foreign invasions. 4. Svend Poulsen has been popularly referred to as \\"Svend Poulsen Gønge\\" and the name \\"Gøngehøvdingen\\" was first used by Danish author Carit Etlar in 1853. This illustrates that Poulsen's memory and legendary image were preserved in Danish historical and literary circles. 5. The historicity of Svend Poulsen's aliases has been disputed, which implies that some aspects of his story may have been fictional or romanticized, and that the true extent of his accomplishments may remain uncertain. In summary, the bio informs us of Svend Poulsen's service to the Danish monarchy, his involvement in significant wars, his leadership in guerilla warfare, the popularization of his exploits through literature, and the controversy surrounding the authenticity of his aliases. This provides a comprehensive understanding of his role as a military commander in 17th-century Denmark and his impact on Danish history."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

So when my friends were in town shopping for presents for their fathers, I decided since my mother was both Mother and Father, no one else was like her, who better deserved(be worth) a present on Father's Day than her? I bought her a little set of tools, just a few things, hammer, pliers and screwdriver and a box to put all these things in. I got some ideas from my grandfather and named it Mother's Tool Box. She was excited, more at the thought of being cared for on Father's Day than of the present. She always said she liked her Father's Day memories better than the Mother's Day ones. It made her feel special -- and she was. I have noticed in the past few years, greeting cards are even made for \\"Mother on Father's Day\\". Ever since then, my mother has got cards on Father's Day.

The men's basketball team has over 1,600 wins, one of only 12 schools who have reached that mark, and have appeared in 28 NCAA tournaments. Former player Austin Carr holds the record for most points scored in a single game of the tournament with 61. Although the team has never won the NCAA Tournament, they were named by the Helms Athletic Foundation as national champions twice. The team has orchestrated a number of upsets of number one ranked teams, the most notable of which was ending UCLA's record 88-game winning streak in 1974. The team has beaten an additional eight number-one teams, and those nine wins rank second, to UCLA's 10, all-time in wins against the top team. The team plays in newly renovated Purcell Pavilion (within the Edmund P. Joyce Center), which reopened for the beginning of the 2009–2010 season. The team is coached by Mike Brey, who, as of the 2014–15 season, his fifteenth at Notre Dame, has achieved a 332-165 record. In 2009 they were invited to the NIT, where they advanced to the semifinals but were beaten by Penn State who went on and beat Baylor in the championship. The 2010–11 team concluded its regular season ranked number seven in the country, with a record of 25–5, Brey's fifth straight 20-win season, and a second-place finish in the Big East. During the 2014-15 season, the team went 32-6 and won the ACC conference tournament, later advancing to the Elite 8, where the Fighting Irish lost on a missed buzzer-beater against then undefeated Kentucky. Led by NBA draft picks Jerian Grant and Pat Connaughton, the Fighting Irish beat the eventual national champion Duke Blue Devils twice during the season.

Q:Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: We know, painkillers in a tablet can make your headache go away, and antibiotic from a tube can prevent your cuts from becoming infected. Can medicine come in chicken eggs? A team of scientists from Scotland says \\"yes.\\" They've kept some special chickens that lay eggs with disease-treating drugs inside. These drugs are made of molecules called proteins. Animals make thousands of proteins--they're the main ingredients in skin, hair, milk, and meat. Since animals can make proteins easily, they're good animals for making protein drugs. Researchers have already made cows, sheep, and goats that pump out protein drugs in their milk. But chickens are cheaper to take care of, need less room, and grow faster than these other animals. \\"Those qualities could make chickens a better choice to become living drug factories.\\" says Simon Lillico of the Roslin Institute near Edinburgh, Scotland. Lillico and a team of researchers changed chickens' DNA--the code that tells cells how to make proteins--so that the birds' cells made two protein drugs. One drug can treat skin cancer, and the other treats a nerve disease called multiple sclerosis. The scientists changed the chickens' DNA so that the birds made these drugs only in their egg whites. This protects the chickens' bodies from the drugs' possible harmful effects and makes it easy for scientists to collect the drugs. These special chickens can pass on their drug-laying abilities to their chicks. So far, the Scottish researchers have kept five generations of drug-producing chickens. But the scientists need to improve these chickens. The chickens don't make enough drugs to treat people yet. Once the researchers perfect their technique, you might eventually take your medicine from chicken eggs. Question: Which of the following is Not True according to the passage? - It takes much shorter time for chickens to grow than cows, sheep and goats. - Compared to cows, sheep and goats, chickens are less expensive to be raised. - Chickens can produce the best quality of drugs among the drug-producing animals. - Chickens are smaller in size than cows, sheep and goats and therefore need less room.

In this sentence, the speaker is emphasizing that they have created a registry, which is a collection of records or data. This could refer to a variety of situations, such as compiling a list of people, items, or resources. The term \\"registry\\" is often used when referring to official or organized records, and creating a registry can serve different purposes, such as better organization, improved communication, or facilitating collaboration between different entities. The process of compiling a registry typically involves several steps: 1. Identifying the purpose: Clearly understanding and defining the objective of the registry is crucial, as it helps determine what data needs to be collected, how it should be organized, and what eventual uses the registry might serve. 2. Determining the scope: Determining what exactly will be included in the registry is essential. This could involve defining categories, setting criteria for inclusion, or outlining parameters for the data required. 3. Gathering and compiling data: The actual process of collecting and organizing the relevant information is key to the success of the registry. This could involve research, surveys, interviews, or accessing existing documents and databases. 4. Creating the registry format: The registry could be in different formats such as a physical or electronic document, a spreadsheet, or a database. The chosen format should correspond to the purpose and scope of the registry. 5. Maintaining and updating: A registry should be regularly updated to ensure its accuracy and relevance. Establishing a clear process for how changes and updates are made will keep the registry reliable and useful. 6. Ensuring security and privacy: Ensuring that sensitive information in the registry is protected and that privacy concerns are addressed is essential. This could involve establishing security protocols, password protections, or the use of encryption tools. 7. Communication and collaboration: Sharing the registry with relevant stakeholders and allowing for collaboration can make the most of the resource. This might involve creating a shared online platform, hosting meetings or workshops, or providing guidelines for using the registry. In summary, the phrase \\"I would also like to point out that I have compiled a registry\\" suggests that the speaker has gone through the process of creating an organized and purposeful collection of data or records.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. By. Daniel Miller. UPDATED:. 06:45 EST, 17 February 2012. Nerves of steel: Nik Wallenda will be the first to tightrope walk over the falls for a century. It may not have been the most appropriate choice of phrase. But when Nik Wallenda was told he was to be allowed to attempt a tightrope walk across Niagara Falls, he said: ‘I’m thrilled to death.’ If the 33-year-old daredevil survives his 1,800ft-long walk on a two-inch thick rope over the famous site, he will become the first to ever achieve the feat. After months of campaigning, Mr Wallenda was yesterday given permission by Canadian officials to attempt the death-defying stunt this summer. He had already secured support from the American side of the falls last year. Mr Wallenda, who comes from a long line of circus performers, will walk across the most powerful waterfall in the world on a wire rope without a safety net. The stunt will take up to 40 minutes through mist and spray, 220ft above the bottom of the gorge. It is the first time anyone has attempted to walk on a tightrope over the actual waterfall – in 1859 the acrobat Charles Blondin crossed the gorge on a tightrope, but his stunt was downstream from the actual waterfall. Stunts over the iconic attraction, which forms the international border between the Canadian province of Ontario and the U.S. state of New York, have been prohibited for more than 100 years. After giving Mr Wallenda permission to perform his stunt, the Niagara Parks Commission insisted it could be attempted only once every 20 years. Last night Mr Wallenda, from Florida, said: ‘It’s been a dream of mine since I was six years old. I haven’t had a chance for it to settle in yet. I’m thrilled to death. 'This was a dream many told me was impossible. I’m blessed, that’s all I can say.’ Don't look down: This will be the first time anyone has tried to walk over the falls themselves rather than downstream in the gorge. Mr Wallenda, who lives with his wife Erendira and their three children, has been tightrope-walking since he was two. In 2008 he walked and then cycled across a high-wire suspended from skyscrapers in Newark, New Jersey. The feat won him a place in the Guinness Book Of Records for the longest and highest bicycle ride on a high-wire. He currently holds six Guinness World Records. His great-grandfather Karl founded the Flying Wallendas, the family’s daredevil circus act. However, he fell to his death aged 73 from a tightrope in high winds in Puerto Rico in 1978. His great-grandson said: ‘My family has always been taught to never give up. We’ve gone through it all, triumph and tragedy. So at no point did I think I would throw in the towel.’ Delight: Daredevil Nik Wallenda has finally been granted permission to attempt to tightrope walk across the Niagara Falls. Mr Wallenda will wear suede shoes designed to grip the wire in the wet and will train on a full-scale high-wire rig on an airport runway in Pittsburgh, with simulated mist. ‘I’ll be walking through the mist thrown off by the falls,’ he added. ‘I’ve done walks further and higher. This will be the most iconic.’ Last September New York Governor Andrew Cuomo signed a bill giving him one year to perform the feat. Feat: Maria Spelterini walks across a suspension bridge on a tightrope. Very high wire: Wallenda tightropes 12 stories above a street in Newark with no safety net in 2008 before riding a bicycle on the way back. Yesterday Janice Thomson, chairman of the Niagara Parks Commission, said: ‘This decision was approved in part in recognition of the role that stunting has played in the history and promotion of Niagara Falls. ‘We have made it clear that this is a very unique one-time situation. It’s not an everyday activity and will not be allowed to become an everyday activity.’ The area around the falls has suffered from a decline in industry and struggles to attract visitors despite its world famous centrepiece featuring in films such as Superman II and 1953’s Niagara, starring Marilyn Monroe. French acrobat and tightrope walker Charles Blondin was the first ever person to cross a section of Niagara Falls on a 1000 foot long tightrope in 1859. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"This article is about a brave man named Nik Wallenda, who wants to walk over Niagara Falls on a tightrope!

People haven't been allowed to do stunts like this at Niagara Falls for more than 100 years, but Nik got permission to do it.

If \\"Woman holding flowers wearing formal clothing.\\", can we conclude \\"The woman is wearing jeans.\\"?","completion":"Based on the given description, \\"Woman holding flowers wearing formal clothing,\\" we cannot conclusively determine that the woman is wearing jeans. The statement indicates that the woman is dressed in formal clothing, which typically refers to attire that is appropriate for more elegant or sophisticated events and settings. Jeans are generally considered casual wear and are usually not associated with formal events or attire. Formal clothing for women may include garments such as evening gowns, cocktail dresses, tailored suits, or dressy separates. These clothing items are often made of luxurious fabrics, such as silk, satin, or fine wool, and may feature embellishments like lace, beads, or sequins to enhance their elegance. The style and level of formality may vary depending on the specific event or occasion, cultural norms and expectations, as well as personal preferences and fashion trends. Jeans, on the other hand, are typically made of denim, a casual fabric that is associated with everyday wear, leisure activities, and informal settings. While jeans can be dressed up with accessories or combined with more formal pieces for a smart-casual look, they are generally not considered appropriate attire for formal events where more refined and sophisticated clothing is expected. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the woman in the given scenario is wearing jeans based on the description provided. Her attire, being described as formal, is more likely to consist of outfits that are traditionally associated with evening wear, dressy events, or sophisticated occasions.

The town's name is derived from an aboriginal word for 'windy'. - The Great Dividing Range, or the Eastern Highlands, is Australia's most substantial mountain range and the third longest land-based range in the world. The range stretches more than from Dauan Island off the northeastern tip of Queensland, running the entire length of the eastern coastline through New South Wales, then into Victoria and turning west, before finally fading into the central plain at the Grampians in western Victoria. The width of the range varies from about to over . - Bunnaloo is a village community in the central southern part of the Riverina and situated about 37 kilometres west from Mathoura and 45 kilometres south west of Deniliquin . In 2006 , Bunnaloo had a population of 126 people . Bunnaloo Post Office opened on 1 April 1926 and closed in 1974 . Bunnaloo Public School opened in 1928 and is still running . Currently , it has approx. 50 students attending . Students in Years K to 6 attend from all around the area . The current principal is Darren Devereux . - Irrigation is the method in which a controlled amount of water is supplied to plants at regular intervals for agriculture. It is used to assist in the growing of agricultural crops, maintenance of landscapes, and revegetation of disturbed soils in dry areas and during periods of inadequate rainfall. Additionally, irrigation also has a few other uses in crop production, which include protecting plants against frost, suppressing weed growth in grain fields and preventing soil consolidation. In contrast, agriculture that relies only on direct rainfall is referred to as rain-fed or dry land farming. - New South Wales (abbreviated as NSW) is a state on the east coast of :Australia. It borders Queensland to the north, Victoria to the south, and South Australia to the west. It has a coast line with the Tasman Sea on its east side. The Australian Capital Territory is an enclave within the state. New South Wales' state capital is Sydney, which is also Australia's most populous city. , the estimated population of New South Wales was 7.5 million, making it Australia's most populous state. Just under two-thirds of the state's population, 4.67 million, live in the Greater Sydney area. Inhabitants of New South Wales are referred to as \\"New South Welshmen\\". - In geography, a plain is a flat area. Plains occur as lowlands along the bottoms of valleys, coastal plains and as plateaus or uplands at high elevations. In a valley, a plain is enclosed on two sides but in other cases a plain may be delineated by a complete or partial ring of hills, by mountains or cliffs. Where a geological region contains more than one plain, they may be connected by a pass (sometime termed a gap). Plains may have been formed from flowing lava, deposited by water, ice, wind, or formed by erosion by these agents from hills and mountains. - The Riverina is an agricultural region of south-western New South Wales (NSW), Australia. The Riverina is distinguished from other Australian regions by the combination of flat plains, warm to hot climate and an ample supply of water for irrigation. This combination has allowed the Riverina to develop into one of the most productive and agriculturally diverse areas of Australia. Bordered on the south by the state of Victoria and on the east by the Great Dividing Range, the Riverina covers those areas of New South Wales in the Murray and Murrumbidgee drainage zones to their confluence in the west. - Australia, officially the Commonwealth of Australia, is a country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent, the island of Tasmania and numerous smaller islands.

He first takes Iron Bar A and puts it out on his porch on a rainy day. Then he puts Iron bar B in an airtight bag and removes all of the oxygen and air to vacuum seal it. After some time passes the bar he left outside is completely covered in rust. He removes the bar in the vacuum sealed bag and to his surprise it has no rust at all. Because there was no oxygen and water in the air tight bag, iron bar B has no rust at all. Iron bar A was exposed to a lot of water and oxygen and there for it rusted completely. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which iron bar was exposed to more water and oxygen, Iron Bar A or Iron Bar B? Hint: Iron is first oxidized to iron(II) ions by oxygen. In the second step, the iron(II) ions are further oxidized and combine with water and oxygen gas to produce a hydrated form of iron(III) oxide known as rust. Rusting is one of many example of corrosion. Corrosion is the deterioration of metals by redox processes. Corrosion causes enormous amounts of damage to buildings, bridges, ships, cars, and other objects. It has been estimated that corrosion costs the U.S. economy over 100 billion dollars each year.

I had drunk too much, I confess, though we all had. Somehow, Tasha and I began to argue the worth of Solevgrad jazz, as inconsequential a topic as I can imagine. She had studied it in school, so she thought herself as an expert. I once had a neighbor who played it constantly, loudly, and badly, so I thought I knew it better. Malaquez tried to mediate, but I saw him as siding with Tasha. So, I think, did she. The subject shifted from music to Tasha's obsession with fame, undoubtedly by a leap that I made.

Please answer the following question: This article: Another major influence in his work was the rise of interest in vernacular architecture. By the time Douglas moved to Chester, the black-and-white revival using half-timbering was well under way, and Douglas came to incorporate this style in his buildings in Chester and elsewhere. The black-and-white revival did not start in Chester, but it did become Chester's speciality. The first Chester architect involved in the revival had been Thomas Mainwaring Penson, whose first work in this genre was the restoration of a shop in Eastgate Street in the early 1850s. Other early Chester architects involved in the revival were T. A. Richardson and James Harrison and it came to be developed mainly by T. M. Lockwood and by Douglas. Part of Douglas's earliest work for the Grosvenor family, the entrance lodge to Grosvenor Park, used half-timbering in its upper storey; this is the first known use by Douglas of black-and-white. Other vernacular motifs were taken from earlier styles of English architecture, in particular, the Tudor style. These include tile-hanging, pargetting and massive brick ribbed chimney stacks. In this style, Douglas was influenced by the architects Nesfield and Shaw. Douglas also used vernacular elements from the continent, especially the late medieval brickwork of Germany and the Low Countries.A characteristic of Douglas's work is his attention to both external and internal detailing. Such detailing was not derived from any particular style and Douglas chose elements from whichever style suited his purpose for each specific project. His detailing applied particularly to his joinery, perhaps inspired by his experience in his father's workshop, and was applied both to wooden fittings and to the furniture he designed. A further Continental influence was his use of a Dutch gable. The most important and consistently used element in Douglas's vernacular buildings was his use of half-timbering, which was usually used for parts of the building.

If you are digging a trench for a sprinkler system, you may only need to dig 9-12 inches deep depending on the height of the sprinkler, and 5 inches wide depending, again, depending on your sprinkler system. Consult the instructions that came with your sprinkler system before installation. You’ll need a D-handle sharp shooter shovel and a trenching or clean-out shovel. These can be purchased at any hardware or gardening store. For clearing roots, pruning shear or a Pulaski digging tool can help you quickly remove this obstruction. Wearing gloves will protect your hand from blisters and splinters, and comfortable work boots will provide foot protection and traction. Be careful when you dig around trees or other pipes. Roots can add a significant time to your excavation, and a ruptured gas line will require you to call your gas provider immediately. Severed utility lines could also leave you without power until your electric company can fix the problem. If you're digging near trees, make sure that your trench will not invade the tree’s protected root zone (usually the part of the roots that lie directly below its branches). If you're digging near pipes, try to determine where any other pipes may be. New pipes should be at least 1.5 feet away from another. Use the D-handle shovel to loosen the dirt along both sides of the soon-to-be trench. This will make it easier to dig out the dirt in the middle while physically establishing your dig line alongside the guideline you laid. Cut both sides of the hole with your shovel, break up the topsoil, and then work both sides of your trench until you have loosened enough soil to merit clearing. Once you have accumulated enough loose soil, use the trenching shovel to remove it out of your way. This may be a pile off to the side, or it may be a location you choose prior specifically for backfill. Depending on the depth and length of your trench, this could take a considerable amount of time and effort. Use your D-handle shovel to break up the soil and the trench shovel to clean it out until your trench is the desired length and depth. Running into roots might require you to place the pointed end of your shovel on the root and stomp, which should sever most small-medium sized roots. More developed root systems might require a Pulaski digging tool. Pruning shears are another good option, if your shovel fails and you do not have a Pulaski digging tool on hand. An unsupported trench can be extremely dangerous, as collapsing soil can kill someone standing in the trench. Any trench 3 feet (0.91 m) (0.9m) deep, and some shallower trenches in soft soil, should be supported by side walls (such as timber posts and panels) before digging any deeper. You can increase safety by \\"benching\\" (digging in tiered levels), or by digging the walls at a slope instead of vertically. An experienced trench excavator may choose to keep the trench unsupported at depths up to 5 ft (1.5 m), but only under stable soil conditions. Follow the 3 ft (0.9 m) rule if you do not have expert supervision. Summary:","completion":"Before digging a trench, it's important to check for underground power lines, pipes, and other utilities by calling \\"Digline\\" at 811. To dig a trench, first, mark the path with stakes and string. The depth and width of the trench will depend on what it's for. You'll need a D-handle sharp shooter shovel, a trenching shovel, gloves, and work boots. Be careful around trees and existing pipes. Start by loosening the dirt along both sides of the trench with the D-handle shovel, then use the trenching shovel to remove the loose soil. You might need to cut through roots or use a Pulaski digging tool for bigger roots. If your trench is deeper than 3 feet or in soft soil, make sure to support the walls with side walls or by digging in tiers or at a slope. Remember, safety is always important when digging trenches."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Our education system was invented. There were no public systems of education before the 19th century. They all came into being to meet the needs of industrialism. So the most useful subjects for work are at the top and you were probably driven away from what you did as a kid at school--things you liked--because you would never get a job doing that. Is that right? Don't do music. You're not going to be a musician. Don't do art. You're not going to be an artist. In addition, the whole system of public education around the world is a process of university entrance. And the consequence is that many highly talented, brilliant, creative people think they're not because the thing they were good at wasn't valued at school. I think we can't afford to go on that way. In the next 30 years, more people worldwide will be graduating through education than since the beginning of the history. Suddenly, degrees aren't worth anything. When I was a student, if you had a degree, you had a job. But now you need a Master's degree where the previous job required a Bachelor, and now you need a Ph.D. for the other. It's a process of academic inflation , and it indicates the whole structure of education needs changing. All the great teachers I've ever met and worked with are people who can inspire interest and curiosity and light up people's imaginations with the interests they themselves have for a particular field of work. I mean, teaching is not only a process of giving people direct instructions and information they have to memorize, it is much more than that. I believe our only hope for the future is to rethink the fundamental principles on which we are educating our children. And our task is to educate their whole being so they can face the future.

Instructions: Given a command in a limited form of natural language, provide the correct sequence of actions that executes the command to thus navigate an agent in its environment. A command can be broken down into many different actions. Actions are uppercase and are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. The word 'opposite' turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command.

Part #2: The word 'opposite'. Usage: For the command \\"run opposite left\\", the agent will first turn around by executing \\"I_TURN_LEFT\\" and \\"I_TURN_LEFT\\" and then \\"I_RUN_LEFT\\". It meets the criteria since the agent turns backward in the specified direction before running left. Part #3: The word 'around'. Usage: Given the command \\"run around left\\", the agent will execute the action \\"I_RUN_LEFT\\" while turning around, which results in \\"I_RUN_LEFT\\", \\"I_TURN_LEFT\\", and \\"I_TURN_LEFT\\".

Answer the following question: I have a new situation: Two neighboring islands Grey island and Sand island both contributed to global warming by their actions. Grey island contributed way more because they were more careless. But I can use this background: Another major cause of extinction is global warming , which is also known as global climate change. During the past century, the Earth's average temperature has risen by almost 1°C (about 1.3°F). You may not think that is significant, but to organisms that live in the wild and are constantly adapting to their environments, any climate change can be hazardous. Recall that burning fossil fuels releases gasses into the atmosphere that warm the Earth. Our increased use of fossil fuels, such as coal and oil, is changing the Earth’s climate. Any long-term change in the climate can destroy the habitat of a species. Even a brief change in climate may be too stressful for an organism to survive. For example, if the seas increase in temperature, even briefly, it may be too warm for certain types of fish to reproduce. What is an answer for this question: Which island burned less fossil fuels? Answer:","completion":"Step 1: Identify the islands mentioned in the situation The situation mentions two islands: Grey island and Sand island. Step 2: Understand the context of the problem Grey island and Sand island both contributed to global warming by their actions. Burning fossil fuels is one of the major causes of global warming, as mentioned in the background information. Step 3: Analyze the level of contribution to global warming from both islands Grey island contributed more to global warming as they were more careless, while Sand island has a lower contribution to global warming. Step 4: Relate the level of contribution to global warming to fossil fuel consumption Since burning fossil fuels releases gases into the atmosphere that warm the Earth, the greater the amount of fossil fuels burned, the higher the contribution to global warming. Step 5: Determine which island burned less fossil fuels based on their contribution Since Sand island contributed less to global warming, it can be inferred that Sand island burned less fossil fuels compared to Grey island.

Just after he bought the house with his ill gotten gains from his band's over-hyped, over-marketed, and over-bought sophomore Disc, he drove me out to see it in his beautiful but nauseating '70 Datsun 240 Z. All the smog combined with the pinball effects of winding up the hill at teeth-numbing speeds had me puking for an hour after we got there. I took the last turn at the top of the hill and watched the rising sun crest over the black blocks of the city, her angel wings soiled and cheapened with the soot of 12 million get-away drivers. Rick's house came into view out of the fog, its large glass panes sparkling like the last clean surface of an oversized ashtray. I parked between a blue hatchback and Rick's favorite toy: a 350 horsepower Impreza he had smuggled here from Japan. All his more expensive rides were in the garage, collecting dust and gaining vintage resale value. I rang the bell.

The answer is:","completion":"Kim Sigler, born on May 2, 1894, in Schuyler, Nebraska, was an accomplished American politician who dedicated his life to public service. Known for his affiliation with the Republican Party, Sigler was a devoted Methodist and received his education from the prestigious University of Michigan. Throughout his illustrious career, he held various key positions, most notably serving as the 40th Governor of Michigan. Sigler's political journey began when he assumed office as the Governor of Michigan on January 1, 1947. His term, marked by determination and a strong commitment to public welfare, lasted until January 1, 1949. During his tenure, Sigler worked closely with Eugene C. Keyes, the then-Lieutenant Governor of Michigan. Together, they tirelessly strived to implement policies and make decisions in the best interest of the state and its residents. Before ascending to the esteemed position of Governor, Sigler had succeeded Harry Kelly, who had valiantly led the state in the years preceding his term. Sigler's impact as Governor was significant within Michigan's political landscape, and upon completing his term, G. Mennen Williams took over the baton as Sigler's successor, eager to build upon the foundations his predecessor had laid. A dedicated family man, Sigler was married to Mae L. Pierson, who, like her husband, was devoted to the welfare of the Michigan community. Together, they formed a strong partnership and supported one another in various aspects of their personal and public lives. Unfortunately, Sigler's life was cut short on November 30, 1953, at the age of 59. He passed away in Augusta, Michigan, leaving behind an extraordinary legacy and a lasting impact on the state he had devotedly served. Today, Kim Sigler is remembered not just as the 40th Governor of Michigan, but as an exemplary figure in American political history—a steadfast, deeply committed leader who, with unwavering dedication, made a difference in the lives of many."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

However, I can offer some general insight on how someone in Bailey's situation who heard God's voice and was believed to be insane might feel afterward. 1. Relief: If Bailey truly believes that they heard God's voice, they might feel a sense of relief and consolation, even if others think they are insane. The spiritual experience could provide comfort and a sense of purpose for them. 2. Isolation: If Bailey's friends and family consider them to be insane, Bailey could feel socially isolated and disconnected. They might struggle to talk about their experience or feel misunderstood and ostracized. 3. Confusion: Bailey might experience confusion over their mental state, as they might question whether their experience was truly divine or a symptom of a mental health issue. 4. Fear: If Bailey becomes convinced that their experience was a symptom of mental illness, they might be afraid of the potential consequences, such as stigmatization, losing their support network, or being confined to a psychiatric institution. 5. Hope: Depending on the message that Bailey believes they received from God, they might also feel a sense of hope for the future, whether for personal growth, healing, or their life's journey. Ultimately, it is essential to remember that Bailey's emotions would likely be complex and multifaceted, making it difficult to predict their exact feelings.

If adopted by the CPUC, this would lock PG&E customers into 40-55 percent higher rates for DWR power over the next 10 years, compared to customers of Southern California Edison and SDG&E. It discriminates against PG&E?s customers and has not been subject to public review, due process, or cost justification by DWR or the CPUC. The CPUC has postponed the vote on the DWR cost shifting issue until later this month (Sept 20th, or sooner).

Write a title for this article: Jered Harvey, a student at Pace, was thrown onto the tracks of the 2 and 3 subway line at Fulton St. Thursday night by a homeless man, but managed to get back on the platform before a train came. A gallant college student was punched in the face and thrown onto the subway tracks after coming to the aid of a woman being beaten on a Manhattan platform Thursday night. Jered Harvey, 19, never panicked and managed to get back onto the platform at Fulton St., on the 2 and 3 line, before a train roared into the station. He escaped from the railbed despite the madman trying to prevent him from climbing back up, Harvey said. The hero may have picked up his calm demeanor from his stepfather, Olivier Busquet, an accomplished professional poker player who has earned over 3 million in his career. Rayfield Grant, 29, who is homeless and has a history of drug-related arrests, was collared following the dramatic confrontation and arraigned Friday on charges of second-degree attempted murder and first-degree attempted assault. Harvey, a 5-foot-8, 135-pound economics student at Pace University, said he had just finished an evening class and was headed back to his residence hall in Brooklyn when he saw Grant punching a woman on the platform about 10 p.m. Some 20 straphangers turned a blind eye to the melee. RELATED: FAMILY OF QUEENS MAN CRUSHED BY TRAIN SUES MTA “It seemed like everybody was walking away, just ignoring it, which was crazy because they were beating the hell out of each other,” Harvey said. So he took it upon himself to intervene — though the chivalrous student was careful not to appear threatening. “I walk up to them and say, ‘I don’t know you, I don’t want any trouble, but come on, let’s not do anything rash,’” Harvey recalled. But his soft talk did little to soothe Grant’s rage. “Oh, you want to help?” Grant said, according to Harvey. Then Grant started swinging, grabbed the teen by the neck and pushed him to the tracks, Harvey said. The Good Samaritan landed hard on one knee but was able to avoid rolling onto the third rail. He immediately scoped out his surroundings, and decided he needed to ditch his backpack. A woman sitting on a bench stared blankly at Harvey as he tried to escape the tracks, the teen said. “Can you hold my bag? Can you please just hold my bag?” Harvey pleaded. But the woman ignored him. As he tried to clamber back onto the platform, Grant allegedly stood in his way. “He was boxing me out,” Harvey said. “I moved right, he moved right. I moved left, he moved left.” RELATED: SUBWAY PUSHER IN COURT Harvey decided if a train arrived, he would be safe in deep drainage ditches on the tracks. “Worst-case scenario, I figured I could lay down,” he said. “I’d be dirty, but I’d be fine.” Eventually, Harvey was able to climb to safety as the commotion over the shocking turn of events grew. Once on the platform, the student ran into a friend from Pace, and Grant began getting in both of their faces and swinging wildly, Harvey said. The friends ran aboveground and called the police. Bizarrely, Grant did not flee on an arriving train, but instead walked right into the clutches of authorities swarming the scene, Harvey said. The suspect was held in lieu of 75,000 bond or 50,000 cash after his arraignment. “The defendant is a predicate felon,” Assistant District Attorney Andrew Stengel told the judge. “This defendant has a bench warrant history. He is a probation violator.” Harvey didn’t require medical attention. RELATED: SUBWAY PUSHER'S EXCUSE: I WAS STILL MAD ABOUT MY TOSSED TIMBERLANDS “All in all, I think I’m lucky there wasn’t a train coming in,” Harvey said. “It didn’t end as badly as it could have.” His mother, who lives on the upper West Side with her poker-playing husband, admired Harvey’s noble deed. “He just wanted to help,” Lorelei Busquet said. “He wasn’t trying to create a confrontation or challenge this person. He just felt that nobody was helping and someone had to do something.” But she couldn’t help but add that her son wasn’t a “tough guy.” “Next time,” she said. “Just call the police.” Title:","completion":"\\"Brave College Student Saves Woman and Escapes from Subway Tracks After Being Pushed by Angry Man\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

We investigated whether circulating osteopontin (OPN) could be used as a biomarker for cervical cancer. We employed a monoclonal antibody (mAb 659) specific for the unique and intact thrombin-sensitive site in OPN using an inhibition ELISA. We found significantly higher levels of OPN in 33 cervical cancer patients in both the plasma (mean +/-SD, 612 +/-106 ng/ mL) and serum (424 +/-121 ng/mL) compared to healthy subjects [409 +/-56 ng/mL, from 31 plasma samples (P < 0.0001), and 314 +/-98 ng/mL, from 32 serum samples (P = 0.0002), respectively]. Similar results were obtained when the plasma from a bigger group (147 individuals) of cervical cancer patients (560 +/-211 ng/mL) were compared with the same plasma samples of the healthy individuals (P = 0.0014). More significantly, the OPN level was highest in stage III-IV disease (614 +/-210 ng/mL, from 52 individuals; P = 0.0001) and least and nondiscriminatory in stage I (473 +/-110 ng/mL, from 40 individuals; P = 0.5318). No such discrimination was found when a mAb of a different specificity (mAb 446) was used in a similar inhibition ELISA to compare the two groups in the first study; a commercial capture ELISA also failed. The possibility that the target epitope recognized by the antibody probe in these assays was absent from the circulating OPN due to protein truncation was supported by gel fractionation of the OPN found in patients' plasma: 60-64 kDa fragments were found instead of the presumably full-length OPN (68 kDa) seen in healthy people. How these fragments are generated and what possible role they play in cancer biology remain interesting questions. . As a member of the family of small integrin-binding ligand, N-linked glycophosphoproteins (SIBLINGs), OPN is highly conserved among mammals [3] . Human OPN has 314 amino acids, including a unique and conserved thrombin-sensitive site. Cleavage of this site by thrombin, which normally occurs in the circulation, fragments the protein roughly into two equal halves, each with different biological activities. The amino-terminal half of the protein binds to a variety of cell surface integrins, such as αvβ1, αvβ3, αvβ5, αvβ6, and α8β1, through the arginine-glycine-aspartate ( 159 RGD 161 ) motif in the protein, and also with α4β1 and α9β1 integrins, through the thrombin-generated site ( 162 SVVYGLR 168 ). The carboxy-terminal half interacts with the CD44 cell surface splice variants, CD44v6 and CD44v3 [4, 5] . Through these various extracellular interactions, thrombin-activated OPN plays pivotal roles in diverse physiological processes, such as bone remodeling, inflammation, and wound healing [6], as well as in various pathologies, including autoimmunity [7-9] and tumor metastasis [10] or progression [11, 12] . Thrombin-activated OPN has also been reported to inhibit the apoptosis in, or promote the survival and proliferation of, cancer cells [3] . More recently, OPN was shown to exert an intracellular function which can affect diverse cellular processes such as tumor progression [13] and interferon-α production in dendritic cells [14] . Here, too, these functions require the OPN protein to be appropriately cleaved, not by thrombin, but by various caspases [15] or produced as appropriate truncates from RNA splice variants [16] [17] [18] . Extracellularly, various metalloproteinases (MMPs) also cleave OPN into various types of fragments which have various tumorigenic or biological activities [19, 20] . Overexpression of OPN in the form of mRNA transcripts or intracellular proteins was observed in tumor tissues derived from breast or lung cancer [21, 22] , ovarian cancer [23] , and cervical cancer [24] [25] [26] [27] . Significantly increased levels of circulating OPN were also reported for several types of cancer including cervical cancer [26] , prostate cancer [28] , and colorectal cancer [29] . However, there were conflicting reports regarding head and neck squamous cell carcinoma [30, 31] . In addition, different diagnostic kits were found to yield quite different results from one another for the same patient samples [32] . We were interested to use this non-invasive method to examine our cervical cancer patients. This type of cancer is very common in Hong Kong [24]; it is highly invasive and lethal since the disease can progress rapidly and asymptomatically from preclinical-lesion to overt cancer. We were disappointed with the results obtained initially using a commercial OPN detection kit, and consequently decided to devise our own detection assays. We herein describe the development of such an assay based on the use of a unique monoclonal antibody and an assay format that is used infrequently-inhibition ELISA.","completion":"Title: \\"Circulating Osteopontin as a Potential Biomarker for Cervical Cancer: Detection using Inhibition ELISA with a Unique Monoclonal Antibody\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

However, when I had to cancel, they don't respond by e-mail even though their confirmation said you can e-mail to cancel. I finally called and the person says it will take 5-7 business days to process and depending on when my bank applies the refund. I called 10 days later and now that person said it actually takes 7-14 business days. I know that at some point I'll get the refund but they are so quick to charge you and takes forever to refund your money back. Customer service is key in this business. I'd rather stay at a different location next time. How would this review be described in terms of sentiment?

The reviewer expressed dissatisfaction with the resort's customer service, the lack of a timely response to their cancellation request, and the prolonged refund process.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Do these questions have the same meaning? Does toasting or microwaving sourdough bread kill the beneficial bacteria (probiotics)? Why is it so difficult to toast bread while cutting it? Options: (a). no (b). yes","completion":"(a) No These two questions do not have the same meaning. They are different in their focus and the concepts they explore. Let me explain each question in more detail: Question 1: Does toasting or microwaving sourdough bread kill the beneficial bacteria (probiotics)? This question is concerned with the impact of toasting or microwaving sourdough bread on the beneficial bacteria present in it. Sourdough bread contains probiotics, which are live microorganisms that can provide various health benefits, such as improving digestion and boosting the immune system. The person asking this question wants to know if the heat generated during toasting or microwaving the bread damages or destroys these beneficial bacteria, potentially reducing the health benefits of eating sourdough bread. To answer this question, it is important to understand that probiotics are sensitive to heat. When sourdough bread is toasted or microwaved, the temperature can reach levels that destroy these microorganisms. Generally, probiotics are most effective when consumed alive, and they may lose their efficacy or be entirely inactive if exposed to high temperatures for an extended period. Thus, toasting or microwaving sourdough bread can indeed kill the beneficial bacteria present in it, especially if the bread is exposed to high heat for an extended period. Question 2: Why is it so difficult to toast bread while cutting it? This question addresses a practical challenge of toasting bread and cutting it simultaneously. This situation seems unusual and might be the result of a misunderstanding or misinterpretation. However, if we take the question literally, it involves the difficulty of performing both actions at once, which are not intended to be carried out together. Toasting bread is typically done in a toaster, toaster oven, or even on a stovetop using a pan for a few minutes each side. The purpose of toasting is to achieve a crispy texture on the outside of the bread while maintaining a tender and moist inner crumb. On the other hand, cutting bread involves the use of a knife to slice it into desired sizes. Attempting to toast bread while cutting it would be difficult for several reasons: 1. Safety: Toasting typically requires heat which means that you would have to hold and cut the bread while it is being exposed to a heat source, posing a risk of burns or accidents. 2. Practicality: Toasting bread requires a consistent and even heat applied over a specific period. Moving the bread around while cutting it would make it difficult to achieve an even and consistent toasting. 3. Convenience: Cutting bread is best done on a cutting board or another stable surface, while toasting requires a toaster or pan. Attempting to perform both tasks simultaneously would be quite cumbersome and inefficient. In summary, these two questions do not have the same meaning. While the first question relates to the impact of toasting or microwaving sourdough bread on its probiotic content, the second question deals with the difficulty of toasting bread while cutting it. They focus on different aspects of bread preparation and consumption, so the appropriate answer is (a) no."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Movie title: Priest Context: Father Greg Pilkington, newly assigned to St. Mary's parish in inner-city Liverpool, is startled to discover Father Matthew Thomas is engaged in a sexual relationship with rectory housekeeper Maria Kerrigan. Moreover, Father Thomas is a left-wing radical and an outspoken proponent of Liberation Theology, leading him to constant clashes and bickering with the Bishopâwho nevertheless appreciates his abilities. While the young protagonist's personal traditional conservatism and religious beliefs are offended by the older priest's blatant disregard for his vow of celibacy, he struggles with his own homosexual urges, especially after he meets Graham at a local gay hangout and the two embark on a physical relationship. Meanwhile, student Lisa Unsworth has confided she was sexually abused by her father, who confirms her story. Both have revealed their secret in the confessional, however, so Father Greg is required to honour the sanctity of the Sacrament of Penance and not reveal what he has been told. He tries to warn her mother to keep a close watch on her, but the naive woman believes her daughter is safe while in the care of her husband. When Mrs. Unsworth discovers her husband molesting Lisa and realises the priest knew what was happening, she lashes out at him. Adding to his torment is his arrest for having sex with Graham in a parked car. When he pleads guilty to the charge, the story is headlined on the front page of the local newspaper and, unable to face his parishioners, Father Greg relocates to a remote rural parish headed by a disapproving and unforgiving priest. Father Matthew convinces him to return to St. Mary's, and the two preside over a Mass that is disrupted by the loud protests of those opposed to Father Greg's presence on the altar. Father Matthew demands they leave the chapel. The two priests then begin to distribute the Eucharist, but the remaining parishioners ignore Father Greg and line up to receive communion from Father Matthew.

However, it does not provide any direct evidence or information about the hypothesis, \\"Two men are robbing the gas station.\\" To determine if the hypothesis is true, we would need additional information about the situation occurring at the gas station. The premise solely focuses on the two girls walking down the street and does not mention any activity taking place at the gas station.

In an outcome few could have imagined several weeks ago, Jones defeated controversial Republican candidate Roy Moore, who had the backing of President Donald Trump. In the wake of Jones' victory, Democrats are more confident about success in next year's congressional midterm elections, and Republicans are looking for a way to rebound. Late Tuesday, Jones paid tribute to the voters and staffers who supported him in his longshot victory over Moore. \\"This campaign has been about common courtesy and decency and making sure everyone in this state, regardless of which ZIP code you live in, is going to get a fair shake in life!\\" he told supporters. Moore was unable to overcome allegations of sexual misconduct stemming back decades involving several women who were teenagers at the time while Moore was in his 30s. Moore stopped short of conceding the race, however, saying, \\"We have been painted in an unfavorable and unfaithful light. We have been put in a hole, if you will, and it reminds me of a [Bible] passage in Psalms 40, 'I waited patiently for the Lord.' That is what we have got to do.\\" Moore had the full backing of the president in the final days of the campaign after Trump initially held back his endorsement in the wake of the allegations against Moore. The president responded Wednesday to questions at the White House about the Alabama race and said that he had hoped for a different result. \\"I wish we would have gotten the seat. A lot of Republicans feel differently. They are very happy with the way it turned out,\\" he said. \\"But as the leader of the party, I would have liked to have the seat.

Tired of killing, war veteran Jefferson Waring rides west, but in Missouri he sees \\"squatters\\" mowed down by men working for rich, ruthless Artemus Taylor. He spends the night at Independence newspaperman Peter Sharpe's place, but is jailed when daughter Cathy Sharpe finds this total stranger in her room. The local marshal, John Harding, is just one of many men on Taylor's payroll. Peter's business is threatened by banker Stone unless he takes Taylor's side against \\"squatters\\" settling in the region. The blind and wheelchair-bound Taylor and ambitious daughter Norah are secretly aware that railroad surveyors are considering laying tracks nearby, so they want all the land for themselves. Jeff decides to leave. Norah and henchman Ding Bell intercept him; Norah shoots at him but misses. They take him to see Artemus, who tells a vocally reluctant Bell to take Jeff off to a remote canyon and murder him. Under Norah's instructions, Artemus's chief thug Sam Tobin goes after them to murder both; he wounds Jeff and kills Bell, but not before Bell hits him with a fatal shot. A doctor treats Jeff's wounds but Marshall Harding turns up and charges Jeff with the two killings. When the situation escalates and two of Taylor's thugs gun down Peter Sharpe, Jeff breaks out of jail and organizes a group of settlers to resist Taylor's planned big attack. The settlers slaughter Taylor's thugs; Taylor dies of a heart attack; Norah, having shot and she thinks killed banker Justin Stone in order to get some getaway money, is killed by him as she leaves. Jeff stays in town to run the paper with Cathy.

It is responsible for taxes, tariffs, and similar revenue-raising initiatives, as well as other policy issues like Social Security, unemployment benefits, and Medicare. The committee plays a significant role in shaping domestic policy and legislation that has a direct impact on the U.S. economy. The members of the Ways and Means Committee are not single issues, like \\"Social Security,\\" but rather, they are individuals, Representatives elected by the people from their respective districts.

The Committee usually consists of majority and minority party members, and its composition reflects the overall make-up of the House of Representatives. As of the 117th Congress, which started in 2021, the Ways and Means Committee is chaired by Representative Richard Neal (D-MA), with Representative Kevin Brady (R-TX) serving as the Ranking Member. The committee has 42 members in total, 25 of whom are Democrats and 17 are Republicans. You can find the full list of current members on the official House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee website (https://waysandmeans.house.gov/subcommittees).

Read this: Jean Macfarlane founded the University of California, Berkeley's Institute of Human Development, formerly called the Institute of Child Welfare, in 1927. The Institute was instrumental in initiating studies of healthy development, in contrast to previous work that had been dominated by theories based on pathological personalities. The studies looked at human development during the Great Depression and World War II, unique historical circumstances under which a generation of children grew up. The Oakland Growth Study, initiated by Harold Jones and Herbert Stolz in 1931, aimed to study the physical, intellectual, and social development of children in the Oakland area. Data collection began in 1932 and continued until 1981, allowing the researchers to gather longitudinal data on the individuals that extended past adolescence into adulthood. Jean Macfarlane launched the Berkeley Guidance Study, which examined the development of children in terms of their socioeconomic and family backgrounds. These studies provided the background for Glen Elder in the 1960s, to propose a life-course perspective of adolescent development. Elder formulated several descriptive principles of adolescent development. The principle of historical time and place states that an individual's development is shaped by the period and location in which they grow up. The principle of the importance of timing in one's life refers to the different impact that life events have on development based on when in one's life they occur. The idea of linked lives states that one's development is shaped by the interconnected network of relationships of which one is a part; and the principle of human agency asserts that one's life course is constructed via the choices and actions of an individual within the context of their historical period and social network.

Article: The man who invented Coca-Cola was not a native Atlanta, but on the day of his funeral every drugstore in town shut up the shop in honor of him. He was John Styth Pemberton, born in 1833 in Knoxville, Georgia, eighty miles away. Pemberton was a chemist, sometimes known as Doctor, who, during the Civil War, became an officer and led a cavalry troop. He settled in Atlanta in 1869, and soon began making such patent medicines as Triplex Liver Pills and Globe of Flower Cough Syrup. In 1885, he registered a trademark for something called French Wine Coca-Ideal Nerve and Tonic Stimulant. A few months later, he formed the Pemberton Chemical Company, and hired an accountant named Frank M. Robinson, who had not only a good head for figures, but, attached to it, so unique a nose that he could judge the ingredients of a batch of syrup merely by sniffing it. In 1886 --- a year in which, as contemporary Coca-Cola officials like to point out, the English writer Conan Doyle made Sherlock Holmes known publicly and France found the truth about the Statue of Liberty --- Pemberton invented a syrup that he called Coca-Cola. It was a change of his French Wine Coca. He had taken out the wine and added a bit of caffeine, and, when the end product tasted awful, had thrown in some cola nut oil and a few other oils, mixing the mixture in a three-legged iron pot in his back yard and swishing it around with an oar. He distributed it to soda fountains in used beer bottles, and Robinson, with his elegant account's script, instantly designed a label, on which \\"Coca-Cola\\" was written in the style which is still employed. Pemberton looked upon his mixture less as a drink than as a headache cure. One morning in 1886, a man suffering from a headache dragged himself into an Atlanta drugstore and asked for a bottle of Coca-Cola. According to usual practice, druggists should pour a teaspoonful of syrup into a glass of water, but at that time, the man on duty was too lazy to walk to the fresh-water tap. Instead, he mixed the syrup with some soda... Question: How did Pemberton change French Wine Coca formula to make it taste delicious? Answer: The answer is:","completion":"Pemberton changed the French Wine Coca formula to make it taste delicious by removing the wine and adding a bit of caffeine. When the end product still tasted awful, he added some cola nut oil and a few other oils, mixing the mixture in a three-legged iron pot in his backyard and swishing it around with an oar.

Making do with a glass of scotch instead, she meanders through the apartment, brushing her teeth, washing her face, going through a closet and trying on a mink coat for size. As she goes to into the living room, she finds her dress torn on the floor. With a sigh, she heads toward her purse on the table, and finds a note for her with some cash. \\"Gloria - I hope 250.00 is enough. -L\\"Anger washes over her face, as she reels away from the note. Lipstick in hand, she scrawls \\"No Sale\\" on a large mirror in the living room, and leaves the cash on the mantle. She leaves a few dollars next to the scotch bottle to pay for her drink, and leaves the posh apartment in only her slip and the fur coat.After hailing a taxi to a more middle-class area, she knocks on the door of her friend, Steve Carpenter, a composer. At his piano, he makes sarcastic comments as Gloria parades around the apartment. She takes off the coat and teases him - he quietly tenses and commands her to put the coat back on. Gloria persists in teasing him, flirting with him, until she sees that he is being very serious. She puts on the coat, and is about to leave - making sure to proclaim that he is \\"the only person [she] can be honest with.\\" He replies back that he wishes she wouldn't - he doesn't want to have to see her throw away her life like this. After making to leave - he finally calls her back. Both forgiving, he makes coffee and breakfast for both of them. She coyly says that she'll need something to wear home, and that her mother will be appalled if she goes home dressed - or rather undressed - like that. Steve says that he is sure that her mother will not be surprised - but Gloria insists that though her mother is probably aware of her nightlife, they both quietly ignore it. She finally convinces him to call up his girlfriend Norma to bring over...","completion":"Insufficient information to provide an answer."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Does the sentence \\"One day, the village is attacked by Bulblins, who carry off the village's children with Link in pursuit before he encounters a wall of Twilight.\\" answer the question \\"What do the Bulbins take from Ordon?\\"","completion":"Yes, the sentence \\"One day, the village is attacked by Bulblins, who carry off the village's children with Link in pursuit before he encounters a wall of Twilight.\\" provides sufficient information to answer the question, \\"What do the Bulblins take from Ordon?\\". From the sentence, we can infer that the Bulblins take the children from Ordon Village. To elaborate further, the sentence describes an attack on Ordon Village (assumingly from a video game or story) where these creatures called Bulblins invade and kidnap the village children. Link, presumably a protagonist in the story, pursues the Bulblins in an effort to save the kidnapped children. However, his pursuit is hindered when he encounters a wall of Twilight, which likely creates a barrier or some form of obstacle that prevents him from chasing the Bulblins directly. Thus, the answer to the question \\"What do the Bulblins take from Ordon?\\" is the village's children, as indicated by the context provided in the sentence."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Lublin is the ninth largest city in Poland and the second largest city of Lesser Poland. It is the capital and the center of Lublin Voivodeship (\\"province\\") with a population of 349,103 (March 2011). Lublin is the largest Polish city east of the Vistula River, and is located approximately to the southeast of Warsaw by road. One of the events that greatly contributed to the city's development was the Polish-Lithuanian Union of Krewo in 1385. Lublin thrived as a centre of trade and commerce due to its strategic location on the route between Vilnius and Kraków; the inhabitants also had the privilege of free trade in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. The Lublin Parliament session of 1569 led to the creation of a real union between the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, thus creating the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Lublin also witnessed the early stages of Reformation in the 16th century. A Calvinist congregation was founded and certain groups of radical Arians also appeared in the city, making it an important global centre of Arianism. At the turn of the centuries, Lublin was also recognized for hosting a number of outstanding poets, writers and historians of the epoch. What are the answers to this following set of questions: 1. What is Poland's ninth largest city? 2. What is its most recent population? Numbered answers:","completion":"1. Poland's ninth largest city is Lublin. 2.

Answer choices: - planted - dead - fertile - observed - ruined - dormant - reproduce - food The answer is:","completion":"reproduce. To elaborate further on the answer, a flower's purpose is indeed to be planted. However, analyzing the intrinsic function of a flower in the plant kingdom allows us to deduce a more precise purpose. The ultimate aim of a flower is to reproduce and ensure the continuity of the plant species. To achieve this, flowers play a critical role in the process of pollination, leading to the development of seeds, and consequently, new plants. Plants produce flowers in order to create reproductive structures that facilitate pollination – the transfer of pollen from the male reproductive organ (anther) to the female reproductive organ (stigma) of the same or another flower. This process is essential for the production of seeds, which guarantee the continuity of the plant species. Pollination is often facilitated by various agents, such as insects, birds, and wind, which carry pollen from one flower to another. Each of the given answer choices can be evaluated in relation to the reproductive purpose of a flower: 1. Planted: While planting a flower is significant, as it helps secure the flower's place in the soil and its access to necessary resources, it is an action performed by humans or other agents and is not the purpose of the flower itself. 2. Dead: Death is an inevitable part of a flower's life cycle, as it is for any other living organism. However, death does not define the purpose of a flower. 3. Fertile: Fertility is a vital aspect of a flower's ability to reproduce; however, it is a condition that enables the flower to fulfill its purpose, rather than being the purpose itself. 4. Observed: Flowers are undoubtedly beautiful and can be a source of pleasure for humans and other animals that appreciate their visual appeal. However, the primary purpose behind their colorful and fragrant features is to attract pollinators, which help facilitate the reproductive process. 5. Ruined: Ruining a flower is detrimental to its reproductive purpose and works against its natural function. 6. Dormant: While some plants, including flowers, become dormant, particularly during winter months, dormancy is a survival mechanism rather than the ultimate purpose of the flower. 7. Food: Many flowers serve as a source of food for various animals, including insects, birds, and humans. However, while providing food was a way to attract pollinators, it is not the primary purpose of a flower. Its underlying function remains oriented toward reproduction. In conclusion, the most accurate answer choice is \\"reproduce,\\" as the intrinsic function of a flower is to play a vital role in the plant's reproductive process, ensuring the continuity and survival of the plant species."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: In a great many cities, hundreds of people ride bicycles to work every day. In New York City, some bike riders have even formed a group called Bike for a Better City. They declare that if more people rode bicycles to work, there would be fewer automobiles in the downtown part of the city and so less dirty air from car engines. For several years this group has been trying to get the city government to help bicycle riders. For example. They want the city to draw special lanes for bicycles only on some of the main streets, because when bicycle riders must use the same lanes as cars, there are accidents. Bike for a Better City feels that if there were special lanes, more people would use bikes. But no bicycle lanes have been drawn. Not everyone thinks it is a good idea-they say it will slow the traffic. Some store owners on the main streets don't like the idea-they say that if there is less traffic, they will have less business. The city government has not yet decided what to do. It wants to keep everyone happy. On weekends, Central Park-the largest place of open ground in New York-is closed to cars, and the roads may be used by bicycles only. But Bike for a Better City says that this is not enough and keeps fighting to get bicycle lanes downtown.

Ernest Answer:","completion":"Title: The Hand of Fate Genre: Mystery/Thriller/Drama Plot: Act 1: Introducing Ernest Hollway Ernest Hollway is a talented, but struggling artist living in a small suburban town. He is an introvert and keeps to himself, spending most of his time in his studio, creating compelling, dark, and surreal paintings. Ernest's work has long been unpopular, received by his conservative community with fear and disapproval. However, deep inside, Ernest knows his works hold immense significance and he is determined to prove that his artistic vision is meaningful. Act 2: The Anonymous Letter One day, Ernest receives an anonymous letter in the mail. The letter states that his artwork has caught the attention of a powerful and wealthy art patron who wants to showcase his paintings in a prestigious international art gallery. The only condition mentioned in the letter is that Ernest must produce a masterpiece that represents the ultimate self-sacrifice, something that pushes the boundaries of human emotions and physical limitations. Feeling inspired and determined to make the most of this opportunity, Ernest plunges himself into his work, becoming more isolated and detached from reality in the process. Act 3: The Accident As Ernest desperately tries to create his defining piece, he has an epiphany. He believes that true art must come from the depths of the soul, and to fully express himself, he must sacrifice a part of himself to his art. In a moment of madness, Ernest severs his right hand, his painting hand, and incorporates it in his painting, which he now considers his masterpiece. He titles the work \\"The Hand of Fate.\\" Act 4: The Exhibition Ernest's dedication pays off when his masterpiece is accepted into the exclusive international art exhibition. His work garners massive attention, creating controversy and intrigue in the art world. This attention comes with its fair share of suspicion, leading to an investigation to verify the authenticity of Ernest's claim about his hand. Act 5: The Truth Unfolds The police detective, Jessica Adams, assigned to the case is not just interested in confirming the authenticity of Ernest's story – she's determined to discover the true identity of the mysterious art patron behind the anonymous letter. Using the clues she finds, Jessica eventually discovers the patron's identity: it's none other than a local doctor who is known for his eccentric art collection and who has secretly admired Ernest's work for years. Act 6: The Confrontation When Ernest learns about the identity of his secret benefactor, he is both grateful and conflicted. He confronts the doctor, accusing him of taking advantage of his vulnerability and desperation. The doctor, however, insists that he truly believes in Ernest's art and his capacity to change the world through it; he claims that the choice to sever his hand was a test for Ernest — a test of his commitment to his work. The doctor sincerely apologizes for pushing Ernest to such extremes. Act 7: The Aftermath As the film concludes, Ernest is left to grapple with the consequences of his life-altering choice. His artwork is now both famous and infamous, with some praising him for his bravery and others denouncing him as a madman. Ernest and the doctor remain in touch, with the doctor offering to fund an exhibition of Ernest's future works. Ernest begins to find new ways to create art with his remaining hand, coming to terms with the fact that the physical act of creating art is but one aspect of what it truly means to be an artist. \\"The Hand of Fate\\" serves as a turning point in his life, but despite the notoriety and fame it has brought him, Ernest knows he'll never create a piece like it again. Ernest's story stands as a testament to the thin line between artistic vision and self-destruction, showing the audience the depths of commitment and sacrifice one can make in pursuit of their passion."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article:","completion":"Title: Real Madrid Triumphs Over Bayern Munich in Champions League Semi-Final First Leg In what proved to be a nail-biting encounter, Real Madrid clinched victory against Bayern Munich in the first leg of the Champions League semi-final, held at the iconic Santiago Bernabeu stadium. The Spanish giants edged out the German powerhouse with a well-fought 1-0 win, placing them in a favorable position as they head to the second leg of the semi-final clash. The only goal of the game was netted by French striker Karim Benzema, making a crucial impact on the game as early as the 19th minute. A brilliantly executed play by Los Blancos opened up a scoring opportunity for Benzema, who proved clinical as he headed the ball past Bayern Munich's goalkeeper, Sven Ulreich, thereby sealing the match for Real Madrid. Adding to the excitement of the game was the return of Cristiano Ronaldo to the Real Madrid lineup. The Portuguese superstar, who had been sidelined due to injury, was in fine form throughout the match, continuously inspiring and motivating his teammates. His presence on the field was palpable, and his unmatched skill and determination played a crucial role in Real Madrid's triumph over the formidable Bayern Munich. Bayern Munich, however, did not go down without a fight. Despite the early setback, the German outfit showcased a dominant performance, as they monopolized ball possession for the majority of the 90 minutes. Their relentless effort to penetrate the Madrid defense, led by the likes of Robert Lewandowski and Thomas Müller, was a reflection of their unwavering determination to claw their way back into the game. Nonetheless, Bayern Munich was unable to capitalize on their chances, as a toothless attack and the inability to convert opportunities into goals ultimately let them down. Real Madrid's defensive line, led by captain Sergio Ramos, played a critical role in thwarting multiple advances by the Bavarian side. This tightly contested semi-final encounter, which saw two of Europe's most decorated and successful clubs vying for a spot in the ultimate stage of the competition, did not disappoint. The first leg displayed a perfect blend of tactical football, individual brilliance, and heart-stopping moments, a fitting testimonial to the stature and prestige of the UEFA Champions League.

Bayern Munich, on the other hand, will have their work cut out for them, as they look to make a comeback in front of their home crowd. Regardless of the final outcome, football fans around the world can look forward to another enthralling, high-stakes duel between these two footballing giants. The pulsating encounter between Real Madrid and Bayern Munich highlights the beauty of the beautiful game and serves as a reminder of why the UEFA Champions League is considered the pinnacle of club football.

Looking for a harder-hitting rock sound than that of All That You Can't Leave Behind, U2 began recording their eleventh studio album, How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb, in February 2003 with producer Chris Thomas. After nine months of work, the band had an album's worth of material ready for release, but they were not satisfied with the results; Mullen said that the songs \\"had no magic\\". The group subsequently enlisted Steve Lillywhite to take over as producer in Dublin in January 2004. Lillywhite, along with his assistant Jacknife Lee, spent six months with the band reworking songs and encouraging better performances. Several other producers received credits on the album, including Lanois, Eno, Flood, Carl Glanville, and Nellee Hooper; Bono acknowledged that the involvement of multiple producers affected the record's \\"sonic cohesion\\". Released in November 2004, How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb received favourable reviews from critics. The album featured lyrics touching on life, death, love, war, faith, and family. It reached number one in 30 countries, including the US, where first-week sales of 840,000 copies nearly doubled those of All That You Can't Leave Behind, setting a personal best for the band. Overall, it sold 9 million copies globally.

He hides from the dog in a delivery truck, which drives to New York City. The tomcat hears the disembodied voice of a young girl (Drew Barrymore) pleading for help because something is threatening her. The cat is then captured by an employee from Quitters, Inc. \\"Quitters, Inc.\\"[edit] Cigarette smoker Dick Morrison (James Woods) is advised by a friend to join Quitters, Inc. to kick his habit. Clinic counselor Dr. Vinnie Donatti (Alan King) explains that the clinic has a 100% success rate due to a uniquely persuasive method: every time Dick smokes a cigarette, horrors of increasing magnitude will befall his wife and child. Using the tomcat that Donatti's assistant Junk has caught in the street, Donatti demonstrates the first of these horrors: the cat is locked in a cage and tormented with electric shocks. Donatti explains that if his new client should be caught with a cigarette, Dick's wife Cindy will be subjected to the same shocks while he is forced to watch. For subsequent infractions, his young daughter afflicted with Down Syndrome will be subjected to the shocks, then his wife raped, and after the fourth infraction, they give up (i.e. kill him). Not wanting to worry them, Dick hides the looming threat from his family. That night, Dick is angered by the methods Quitters uses and notices an undisposed pack of cigarettes in his desk. He prepares to smoke it, but notices a set of feet in his closet, realizing Quitters Inc. is serious about their threat to ensure he is not smoking. The following day, Dick visits his daughter (also played by Drew Barrymore) and gives her a doll. Donatti is also at the school, warning Dick that if he strays the only thing his daughter would understand is that someone is hurting her because her father misbehaved.

Yao was pressured to enter the NBA draft in 1999 by Li Yaomin, the deputy general manager of the Shanghai Sharks. Li also influenced Yao to sign a contract for Evergreen Sports Inc. to serve as his agent. The agreement entitled Evergreen to 33% of Yao's earnings, but the contract was later determined to be invalid. When Yao decided to enter the 2002 NBA draft, a group of advisers was formed that came to be known as \\"Team Yao\\". The team consisted of Yao's negotiator, Erik Zhang; his NBA agent, Bill Duffy; his Chinese agent, Lu Hao; University of Chicago economics professor John Huizinga; and the vice president for marketing at BDA Sports Management, Bill Sanders. Yao was widely predicted to be picked number one overall. However, some teams were concerned about Yao's NBA eligibility because of uncertainty over whether the CBA would let Yao play in the United States. Shortly after Wang Zhizhi refused to return to China to play for the national team and was subsequently banned from playing for China, the CBA stipulated that Yao would have to return to play for the national team.

For complete details on qualifying items and more, please go to Virginia’s Government Tax Page. Not in Virginia? Search “your state” + “emergency preparedness” or “emergency kit.” You can replace “hurricane” with “earthquake” or “tornado” or any other applicable term for your area. Depending on how much you purchase, the saving on taxes can add up pretty quickly.

'' and under it she put an arrow pointing to the other","completion":"column. She found herself involved in the mind webs of an intriguing plot that needed deciphering. The plot revolved around Drake, a character who aroused in her a mixture of sentiments ranging from curiosity and interest to bewilderment and unsettled unease. It wasn’t merely the psychological aspect of Drake that intrigued her, it was the underlying thought, the undisclosed suspicion he held against Harg Tholan that caught her attention. Harg Tholan was not an innocent character, to begin with. Even though not explicitly guilty, his demeanor and actions were questionable enough to cast doubts upon him. His name resonated with uncanny vibrations, and his existence added a sense of mystery to the intrigue, making the situation even more perplexing and cryptic. In the confusion of this commotion, the pencil was her only companion. It was a tool that helped her connect the tangled loop of thoughts, much like a lighthouse guides a ship struggling amidst a tempestuous sea. But her weapon, her guide, had somehow failed her. The point of her pencil had broken, leaving her feeling restless as if a warrior left defenseless in face of an approaching threat. However, her spirit did not dwindle. She realized that the obstacle was merely a broken pencil tip and not her fervent will to resolve the conundrum before her. Unlocking a new pencil, she wrote under Drake’s column, questioning why he was suspicious of Harg Tholan. The words, finely etched on the paper, looked back at her as if mocking her inability to comprehend the situation. The crisp edges of the freshly sharpened pencil burnt the accumulating cloud of doubts, fuelling her determination to unravel the truth. Feeling accomplished yet anxious, she put an arrow pointing to the other column, a path that had to be followed, another riddle that demanded a solution. The entire scenario appeared as a labyrinth, with multiple lanes and various turns. It was challenging, yes, but it was the kind of stimulation she thrived in. Despite the confusion, she found herself immersed in the joy of the unexplored, a mystery that begged her curiosity. Each name, each suspicion, each underscored doubt was a piece of the puzzle, and she was engrossed in assembling the fragments to form a coherent picture. In essence, she was playing according to her age, nineteen. Full of life, she thrived in adventures and mysteries, finding joy in pursuing the unknown. It was a dance with thoughts and words, a rollercoaster ride into the darkest secrets and shared suspicions. And thus, with a charged belief and armed with a newly sharpened pencil, she was ready to confront the subsequent mysteries that awaited her discerning eyes and speculative mind. The relief of venting out her feelings on paper was inevitably energizing and thrilling, promising her the thrill of the chase she so desired."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This puzzled many of the people around them, considering one would expect Maria to be the better cook. Step 1: Address the choice that has been made. In this case, the choice is [a]. Maria was taking cooking classes. Step 2: On the basis of the choice made, expand the story logically. Since Maria was taking cooking classes, people around her expected her culinary skills to improve and for her to prepare a variety of delicious dishes. However, it was intriguing to see that her cooking still lacked the diversity that Samantha naturally seemed to have. Step 3: Justify the reason or discuss the effects of the choice made. There could be several reasons why Maria's cooking remained less diverse despite taking classes. Perhaps she lacked the passion and creativity required to experiment with new ingredients and recipes. Another possibility was that the cooking classes were focused on a specific cuisine or type of dish, limiting Maria's overall growth as a cook. Step 4: Develop a comparison between the choice made ([a]) and the alternative option ([b]), if possible. In contrast, Samantha had not taken any cooking classes but displayed a natural ability to create elaborate dishes with ease. She seemed to have an innate love for cooking and constantly experimented with new flavors and ingredients. Samantha's enthusiasm and sense of adventure in the kitchen could be part of the reason behind her broader range of dishes. Step 5: Introduce a possible outcome or event occurring due to the choice made. As Maria noticed the stark difference in their culinary abilities, she decided to engage more with Samantha and learn new recipes from her. She realized that while her cooking classes provided her with essential skills and techniques, it was the passion and creativity that she had to cultivate on her own. By spending more time with Samantha, Maria hoped to ignite her latent culinary passion and ultimately become a better cook, capable of creating a rich variety of foods, just like her friend.

At his funeral, the organ played \\"Take Me Out to the Ball Game.\\" Harry Caray's body is interred in All Saints Cemetery in Des Plaines, Illinois. Following his death, during the entire 1998 season the Cubs wore a patch on the sleeves of their uniforms depicting a caricature of Caray. Cubs slugger Sammy Sosa dedicated each of his 66 home runs that season to Caray. Caray had five children, three with his first wife, Dorothy, and two with his second wife, Marian. He married his third wife Delores \\"Dutchie\\" (Goldmann) on May 19, 1975. His son Skip Caray followed him into the booth as a baseball broadcaster with the Atlanta Braves until his death on August 3, 2008. Caray's broadcasting legacy was extended to a third generation, as his grandson Chip Caray replaced Harry as the Cubs' play-by-play announcer from 1998 to 2004. Chip later returned to work with his father Skip on Atlanta Braves broadcasts, where he had worked for a while in the early 1990s. In what Harry Caray said was one of his proudest moments, he worked some innings in the same broadcast booth with his son and grandson, during a Cubs/Braves game on May 13, 1991.

It is important to not confuse the signs of spoilage with the inherent characteristics of a food item. The context mentions the presence of mold, mildew, or any dark green, black, gray, or white growth on the outside of the root as indications of spoilage. These signs of spoilage may negatively affect the taste of the lotus root, but they do not provide information about the taste of a fresh and properly stored lotus root. Lotus root is a popular ingredient in many Asian cuisines due to its crunchy texture and mild, starchy taste. It can be steamed, stir-fried, braised, deep-fried, or used in soups, among other preparations. In all of these instances, the lotus root is cooked before consumption to enhance its flavor and make it more palatable. To accurately determine the taste of lotus root or gauge its popularity as a food ingredient, one would need more specific and inclusive context. This could include information about different recipes, traditional uses, flavor profiles and testimonials from those who have enjoyed lotus root dishes. Without such context, we cannot jump to the conclusion that lotus does not taste good based solely on the fact that spoiled lotus roots can exhibit mold and mildew."},{"prompt":"Read the following article and answer the question.

Answer: Daytime highs in the Piedmont often reach over 90 °F (32 °C) in the summer. Is the question answered in a satisfactory fashion?","completion":"The Piedmont region, located in the eastern United States, stretches from the Atlantic Ocean's coastal plain to the base of the Appalachian Mountains, covering states like New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia. The region is characterized by its rolling hills, rivers, and fertile farmlands. As a result of its geography and locale, the area generally experiences four distinct seasons, with summers ranging from warm to hot. During the summer months, temperatures in the Piedmont region can vary, primarily due to the differences in latitude and elevation across the states included in this area. On average, daytime highs in the Piedmont can often reach temperatures of over 90 °F (32 °C). However, these temperatures can vary depending on the specific location within the region. For instance, at the northern end of the Piedmont, daytime highs in cities like Newark, New Jersey, tend to hover around 80-87 °F (26-30 °C) during the hottest months of summer. Conversely, more southern locations, such as Charlotte, North Carolina, experience higher daytime averages of around 87-92 °F (30-33 °C) in the summer. In the Piedmont's southernmost portions, such as Atlanta, Georgia, summer temperatures often exceed 90 °F (32 °C), with some days even climbing to 95-100 °F (35-38 °C). It is essential to note that these temperatures can be subject to variations in urban heat island effects, particularly in heavily populated metropolitan areas. This phenomenon can cause temperature spikes in city centers compared to rural areas due to factors such as heat-absorbing asphalt and concrete surfaces and limited vegetation. Summertime in the Piedmont region is characterized not only by its hot and often humid conditions but also by the prevalence of thunderstorms and occasional severe weather events. The warmth and humidity can lead to increased instability in the atmosphere, which in turn can cause bouts of heavy rainfall, high winds, and sometimes hail or tornadoes. In conclusion, the Piedmont region experiences a wide range of temperatures throughout its vast area, with daytime highs often surpassing 90 °F (32 °C) in the summer months. It is essential to note that specific temperatures can vary depending on the precise location within the Piedmont and external contributing factors such as urban heat island effects."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Given those answer options, answer the question: You are presented with the quiz \\"Where are deposits of gold found?\\" But you don't know the answer, so you turn to your teacher to ask for hints. He says that \\"vein deposits of gold and silver are formed by igneous intrusion\\" and \\"veins of Gold ore most commonly occur in cracks and fissures in igneous rocks\\". So, what's the best answer to the question? A:","completion":"\\"Deposits of gold are found in areas where igneous rocks are prevalent and in cracks and fissures caused by igneous intrusion.\\" Based on the hints provided by the teacher, we can determine that the best answer to the question \\"Where are deposits of gold found?\\" is related to the presence of igneous rocks and the formation of vein deposits due to igneous intrusion. Igneous rocks are formed when magma (molten rock) cools and solidifies. These rocks are abundant in areas with high volcanic activity, such as around tectonic plate boundaries. The process of igneous intrusion occurs when magma penetrates into pre-existing rocks, forcing its way through cracks and fissures before cooling and solidifying. This intrusion can cause a network of veins, particularly in areas where the pre-existing rocks are brittle and susceptible to fracturing. Gold, along with other precious metals like silver, often forms in these veins. Due to the high temperatures and pressures involved in the formation of igneous rocks and the intrusion process, gold-bearing fluids are mobilized and migrate into the surrounding rocks. Cracks and fissures provide optimal pathways for these fluids to flow, and as the temperature and pressure decrease, gold is deposited in the form of metallic crystals within these veins. Vein deposits of gold and silver can be found in various locations worldwide, with notable examples including the Witwatersrand Basin in South Africa, the Carlin Trend in Nevada, USA, and the Super Pit in Western Australia. These regions bear the geological characteristics necessary for the formation of gold deposits, with a combination of igneous rocks and associated hydrothermal activity. So, to summarize, the best answer to the question, \\"Where are deposits of gold found?\\" is: Deposits of gold are found in areas where igneous rocks are prevalent and in cracks and fissures caused by igneous intrusion. This answer takes into account the teacher's hints regarding the importance of vein deposits, igneous rocks, and the processes of gold formation within these veins."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The answer is:","completion":"Title: Disappointing Experience with com.google.android.gms App Review: I had high expectations from the com.google.android.gms app, given the Google brand name and reputation. Unfortunately, my experience with this app can only be described as a 2-star ordeal. There are multiple reasons for my dissatisfaction, and I will outline them below. Firstly, the user interface appears cluttered and disorganized. Navigating through the app proved challenging. I struggled to locate essential features and settings, which should ideally be easy to access in any modern app design. The poor font choices and ineffective use of colors worsened the experience. Google has created some fantastic, user-friendly interfaces in the past, so this app feels like a subpar effort. Secondly, the performance of the app leaves much to be desired. Despite using a relatively new smartphone, the app consistently crashed and froze, sometimes taking minutes just to load a single screen. This level of lag severely impacted the usability of the app, leaving me frustrated and feeling like I was working with a piece of outdated technology. Moreover, the app drained my smartphone's battery at an alarming rate. In just a couple of hours, the battery life was drastically reduced by 20% when using com.google.android.gms. I believe it is a poorly optimized application, as other high-performance apps do not demonstrate the same issue. Another major drawback of the com.google.android.gms app is the lack of clear instructions and useful help guides. Even after researching the app further and seeking help from online sources, I still found it difficult to grasp the purpose and functionality of certain features. The lack of user documentation negatively impacted my experience and left me uncertain about several aspects of the app. Finally, despite having allowed all necessary permissions, the app's syncing and connectivity were temperamental. My data would occasionally fail to synchronize across devices, and my account wouldn't always recognize my actions on other platforms. I experienced frequent connection dropouts, rendering the app nearly useless at times. In conclusion, I cannot provide a higher rating for the com.google.android.gms app, as my experience has been plagued by poor performance, battery drain issues, inadequate documentation, and frustrating connection problems. Improvement is necessary in various aspects of the app's design and functionality, as it currently does not meet Google's high standards. To anyone considering using this app, I would advise checking out alternatives or waiting for an updated version that resolves these ongoing issues."},{"prompt":"Fact 1: Annelids are worms such as the familiar earthworm.

For those of the Cardinal, Melanchthon, and Durer's final major work, a drawn portrait of the Nuremberg patrician Ulrich Starck, Durer depicted the sitters in profile, perhaps reflecting a more mathematical approach. Despite complaining of his lack of a formal classical education, Durer was greatly interested in intellectual matters and learned much from his boyhood friend Willibald Pirckheimer, whom he no doubt consulted on the content of many of his images. He also derived great satisfaction from his friendships and correspondence with Erasmus and other scholars. Durer succeeded in producing two books during his lifetime. \\"The Four Books on Measurement\\" were published at Nuremberg in 1525 and was the first book for adults on mathematics in German, as well as being cited later by Galileo and Kepler.

However, finding ways to monetize your blog effectively without hampering the user experience is an ongoing challenge for many bloggers. One attractive option for generating additional revenue while adding value to your readers is incorporating affiliate marketing through affiliate ads. This article discusses how to add and manage affiliate ads to your blog, and how they can benefit both you and your readers. Understanding Affiliate Marketing Affiliate marketing is a performance-based marketing strategy that involves partnering with other companies or websites to promote their products or services on your blog. As an affiliate, you earn a commission for each sale or action (such as a newsletter sign-up) that takes place through your referrals. To get started with affiliate marketing, you first need to join affiliate programs that are relevant to your niche or your readers' interests. These programs provide you with unique tracking links that you can use to link to their products or services from your blog. The tracking links enable the affiliate platform to identify when a visitor from your blog has made a purchase, so you can be compensated accordingly. Adding Affiliate Ads to Your Blog Once you have joined suitable affiliate programs, consider the following tips while adding affiliate ads to your blog: 1. Choose Relevant Products and Services Keep your readers' interests and preferences in mind when selecting products or services to promote. This will not only ensure a seamless user experience but also increase the likelihood of your readers clicking on the ads and making a purchase. 2. Place Ads Strategically The placement of affiliate ads can significantly impact their effectiveness and your conversion rates. Ideally, you should place the ads within the content where they're contextually relevant, like in a product review or tutorial. You can also display ads in prominent areas like sidebars, headers, and footers to increase visibility. 3. Include a Mix of Text Links and Banners Diversify your ad formats by using both text links and image banners. This will allow you to cater to different reader preferences and seamlessly integrate ads into your content. 4. Be Transparent and Ethical Disclose your affiliate partnerships to your readers by including a disclaimer on your website. This will demonstrate your commitment to transparency and further build your readers' trust. The Benefits of Affiliate Ads Incorporating affiliate ads into your blog can be beneficial in various ways, including: 1. Increased Revenue Affiliate marketing serves as a passive income source, which can effectively supplement your earnings from other monetization methods like sponsored content or displaying display ads. 2. Monetizing without Detracting from User Experience Affiliate ads, when chosen wisely and implemented strategically, can add value to your readers by introducing them to relevant products and services that enhance or complement the content of your blog. 3. Strengthening Reader Loyalty By recommending specific products based on personal experience or in-depth research, you can further establish yourself as a trusted authority in your niche. This helps foster reader loyalty and increases the likelihood of repeat visits to your blog. 4. Opportunity for Growth As your blog grows and attracts more traffic, your affiliate earnings can increase without requiring any additional effort, making it a scalable monetization method. Conclusion Affiliate marketing offers a lucrative and low-maintenance way to monetize your blog while preserving the user experience. By carefully selecting the right products and services, strategically placing the ads, and remaining transparent about your partnerships, you can successfully cultivate a revenue-boosting strategy that aligns with your audience's interests and preferences. By adding relevant affiliate ads to your blog, you not only generate more income, but also build credibility, enhance reader loyalty, and create a more engaging experience for your visitors. As you continue to grow your blog, don't hesitate to explore new affiliate programs and partnerships to maximize the potential of your online presence."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: What historic home is located at the Depot originally known as Letterkenny Ordnance Depot? Answer:","completion":"The historic home located at the Depot originally known as Letterkenny Ordnance Depot is the historic building known as the Chambers House. This notable structure is situated within the grounds of the Letterkenny Army Depot, which is a United States Army facility located in Chambersburg, Pennsylvania. The Chambers House serves as a symbolic representation of the Depot's extensive history and its role in the region's development. The Chambers House, built in the 18th century, is of great historical significance not only for the Depot but also for the wider community. Benjamin Chambers, the founder of the town of Chambersburg, constructed this Georgian-style structure as his residence, and it exemplifies the architectural trends of that era. The house also displays certain features that are typical of domestic architecture built by the early settlers of the region, such as Pennsylvania German-style log construction. The Letterkenny Ordnance Depot, which surrounds the Chambers House, was established during World War II to support the United States Army's artillery and ammunition needs. The 16,000 acre facility's primary functions were to carry out the maintenance, storage, and distribution of military supplies, equipment, and ordnance materials. The depot was named after the town of Letterkenny in Ireland, reflecting the Irish heritage of many immigrants in the surrounding area. Throughout its history, the Letterkenny Army Depot has undergone numerous expansions and changes in its role, in response to the evolving needs of the U.S. military. For instance, during the Korean War, the depot was a primary repair facility for tanks. During the Vietnam War, it shifted its focus to manage the refurbishment of large numbers of military trucks. In more recent times, the depot has been responsible for the maintenance and overhaul of tactical missile systems, such as the PATRIOT and the TOW unit. Today, the Chambers House serves as a valuable historical resource. It is important to preserve and study this house as it provides the community with a tangible link to the local history, military heritage, and architectural legacy of the Letterkenny Ordnance Depot and the town of Chambersburg. The ongoing efforts of the depot and local historians ensure the historical and cultural significance of the Chambers House is not lost, but rather celebrated and cherished by future generations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Help as much as you can. This brief book is aimed at high school students, but speaks to anyone learning at any stage of life. Its formal, serious style closely matches its content, a school-masterly book on schooling.The author, W.H.Armstrong, starts with the basics: reading and writing.In his opinion, reading doesn't just mean recognizing each word on the page; it means taking in the information, digesting it and incorporating it into oneself just as one digests a sandwich and makes it a part of himself.The goal is to bring the information back to life, not just to treat it as dead facts on paper from dead trees.Reading and writing cannot be completely separated from each other; in fact, the aim of reading is to express the information you have got from the text.I've seen it again and again:some-one who can't express an idea after reading a text is just as ineffective as someone who hasn't read it at all. Only a third of the book remains after that discussion, which Armstrong devotes to specific tips for studying languages, math, science and history.He generally handles these topics thoroughly and equally, except for some weakness in the science and math sections and a bit too much passion regarding history to his students, that was a hundred times more than my history teachers ever got across.To my disappointment, in this part of the book he ignores the arts.As a matter of fact, they demand all the concentration and study that math and science do, though the study differs slightly in kind.Although it's commonly believed that the arts can only be naturally acquired, actually, learning the arts is no more natural than learning French or mathematics. My other comment is that the text aged.The first edition apparently dates to the 1960s--none of the references seem newer than the late 1950s.As a result, the discussion misses the entire computer age.

Given the question: Process: - An isotope has too many protons - The isotope is unstable - The isotope emits radiation - The isotope decays - The isotope loses some atomic particles - The isotope turns into a different element - The isotope is finished decaying and emitting radiation. Question: suppose isotope is less stable happens, how will it affect MORE radioactive decay occurring. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect The answer is:","completion":"A: More When an isotope is less stable, it means that it has an unstable nucleus containing an excess number of protons (or neutrons) compared to a stable isotope of the same element. This instability causes the isotope to decay over time by emitting radiation in the form of particles or electromagnetic waves. The process continues until the isotope reaches a stable state and stops decaying or turns into a different element. If an isotope is less stable, it implies that it has a higher tendency to undergo radioactive decay due to the imbalance of protons and neutrons in the nucleus. The excess number of protons or neutrons results in a repulsive force between the particles, making the nucleus unstable. As a result, the isotope seeks to reach a more stable configuration through radioactive decay. The effect of an isotope being less stable on radioactive decay is an increase in the likelihood of decay events occurring. On a statistical level, less stable isotopes have shorter half-lives, which means they decay more rapidly than more stable isotopes of the same element. Consequently, isotopes with shorter half-lives undergo a higher number of decay events per unit of time. It is important to note that the rate of decay for a specific isotope is constant and not influenced by external factors such as temperature, pressure, or chemical reactions. Therefore, the statement \\"an isotope is less stable\\" is essentially saying that an isotope has a greater probability of undergoing radioactive decay when compared to a more stable isotope of the same element. In conclusion, if an isotope is less stable, it will lead to more radioactive decay occurring due to the unstable configuration of protons and neutrons in the nucleus. The higher probability of decay and the shorter half-life of the less stable isotope result in a greater number of radioactive decay events taking place over a given period. Hence, the answer is A: More."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Entailment in a linguistic context refers to a relationship where the truth of one sentence guarantees the truth of another sentence. In this case, the two sentences you provided express entirely contradictory information about the same event. In the first sentence, \\"Unfortunately, it seems to have failed its first test\\", it is stated that a test has been failed. The adverb \\"unfortunately\\" suggests a negative outcome - presumably one that was not wished for or expected. The main verb \\"seems\\" suggests that based on available information or evidence, this is the case. It does not offer absolute certainty but implies a strong likelihood towards the stated outcome. The key message however remains that the first test was not passed or successfully completed. The second sentence, \\"It seems that it passed the first test\\", conveys the exact opposite information: that the test was passed, or successfully completed. As in the first sentence, the verb \\"seems\\" is used to show that this is a probable conclusion based on available evidence or information. So, the two sentences are providing different outcomes for a likely shared event. Therefore, one cannot be the entailment of the other. Rather, they contradict each other.

Only two people in the world still speak it, and they won't talk to each other. Spoken in Mexico for centuries, Ayapaneco is one of 68 surviving languages in the mainly Spanish-speaking nation. The two speakers are Manuel Segovia and Isidro Velazquez. Though they live only 500 meters from each other in the village, the two men seldom talk to each other. Daniel, an American expert, who is working to make a dictionary of Ayapaneco, says the two men \\"don't have a lot in common,\\" and that Segovia can be \\"active\\" while Velasquez tends to mind his own business and stay at home. While Segovia still speaks to his wife and son in Ayapaneco, neither of them can manage more than a few words. Velasquez hardly speaks his native tongue any more. Daniel is working to preserve the language in dictionary form before its last surviving speakers pass away. According to Daniel, Ayapaneco and the other languages began dying out with the introduction of public Spanish education in the mid-20thcentury. For decades, local children weren't allowed to speak anything else. Many people to cities, starting in the 1970s, also helped the dying out of native languages. Ayapaneco is the name given to the language; Segovia and Velazquez call it \\"Nuumte Oote\\", which means \\"true voice\\". Neither man, however, speaks the same language. The dictionary will contain two versions of the language when it comes out later this year. Those behind the dictionary aren't the only ones trying to save Ayapaneco. The National Language Institute plans to hold classes so that Segovia and Velasquez can pass on what they know to children. It is thought that there are about 6,000 languages spoken on earth and that about half will disappear over the next 100 years. Let's hope the \\"true voice\\" isn't one of them. Question: Segovia and Velasquez seldom talk to each other in Ayapaneco because they _ . Options: (A) both dislike the language (B) don't get along well with each other (C) are too busy to talk to each other (D) don't share the same interests Asnwer: D Output:","completion":"Yes"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I was assisting in the delivery of an infant. My specific task was to work with the rather over-excited father-to-be. He was an absolute delight to work with…very solicitous of his wife all throughout, very cooperative with the staff, and very appreciative of the help we were giving the mother-to-be. The background was that after 7 years of marriage, and 2 tragic miscarriages, THIS pregnancy had come to full term, and the child—deliberately they did NOT want to know the gender—was healthy, and both “mom” and “dad” were excited about the upcoming birth. The child finally emerged, the MD held up the child, and “dad” blurted out “It’s a girl!! You wanted a girl!!! Oh my God, she’s beautiful!!” Then he buried his face on his wife’s shoulder and was sobbing for pure joy. The MD quickly put him to work…he was to cut the umbilical cord. “I’m not going to hurt her, am I??” MD assured him no, he wouldn’t. He made the cut, and came immediately over to the wife…”Honey…are you all right?? I didn’t hurt you??”” While the his daughter was being bathed and checked out by the APGAR nurse, he excited called out the various observations—she as healthy..she was pinking up…she was so beautiful “I can’t believe it.” When the nurse returned the little girl to “mom”, the three of them cuddled together, tears just pouring from his eyes…and we in the birthing suite were all getting teary-eyed ourselves. That was 30 years ago, and I still get tears just thinking about what I consider the most beautiful moment of my life, one that I was lucky to share with these two wonderful people.

Newton Leroy Gingrich (; ne McPherson; born June 17, 1943) is an American politician and author from the state of Pennsylvania who served as the 50th Speaker of the United States House of Representatives from 1995 to 1999. He represented Georgia's 6th congressional district as a Republican from 1979 until his resignation in 1999. In 2012, Gingrich was a candidate for the Republican Party presidential nomination. A central pledge of President Bill Clinton's campaign was to reform the welfare system, adding changes such as work requirements for recipients. However, by 1994, the Clinton Administration appeared to be more concerned with pursuing a universal health care program. Gingrich accused Clinton of stalling on welfare, and proclaimed that Congress could pass a welfare reform bill in as little as 90 days. He insisted that the Republican Party would continue to apply political pressure to the President to approve their welfare legislation. In 1996, after constructing two welfare reform bills that Clinton vetoed, Gingrich and his supporters pushed for passage of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act, which was intended to reconstruct the welfare system. The act gave state governments more autonomy over welfare delivery, while also reducing the federal government's responsibilities. It instituted the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, which placed time limits on welfare assistance and replaced the longstanding Aid to Families with Dependent Children program. Other changes to the welfare system included stricter conditions for food stamp eligibility, reductions in immigrant welfare assistance, and work requirements for recipients. The bill was signed into law by President Clinton on August 22, 1996. In his 1998 book Lessons Learned the Hard Way, Gingrich encouraged volunteerism and spiritual renewal, placing more importance on families, creating tax incentives and reducing regulations for businesses in poor neighborhoods, and increasing property ownership by low-income families. He also praised Habitat for Humanity for sparking the movement to improve people's lives by helping them build their own homes. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: What was Newt's involvement with the Welfare reform?","completion":"Newt Gingrich was heavily involved in the welfare reform during his time as the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives.

Question: What is and where is hydraulic fluid found and used for Suggestion: Common hydraulic fluids are based on mineral oil or water.","completion":"True. To further elaborate, the proposed suggestion is correct as hydraulic fluid, which is crucial to the proper functioning of many mechanical systems, can be found in numerous applications and its base is typically formed of either mineral oil or water. Hydraulic fluid is found and used in several mechanical systems, including: 1. Hydraulic braking systems in vehicles: The hydraulic fluid is used to transfer brake pedal pressure into a force that engages the brakes to stop the vehicle. 2. Hydraulic presses: These are used for forging, molding, and stamping metals. The hydraulic fluid in these presses allows for accurate pressure control and the generation of significant force. 3. Hydraulic elevators: The fluid serves to lift and lower the elevator cab through a complex system of valves and pistons. 4. Earthmoving machinery: Heavy equipment such as excavators, loaders, and bulldozers rely on hydraulic fluid to power their actuators for functions like lifting, pushing, and rotating. 5. Aircraft: Material handling equipment and flight control systems, found on planes, use hydraulic fluid to enable smooth operation and control of various components. 6. Industrial applications: Hydraulic systems form an essential part of a wide array of industrial processes, from production lines to machinery tools. These common hydraulic fluids serve different purposes and have distinct properties based on their base components. The mineral oil-based fluids offer excellent lubrication properties, thermal stability, and resistance to oxidation, making them suitable for most general use hydraulic systems. Alternatively, water-based hydraulic fluids are utilized in situations where fire resistance is a priority, such as in steel manufacturing plants or high-pressure operations. These fluids tend to have a higher risk of corrosion, yet offer significant environmental benefits in instances of accidental leakage or spillage. Considering the accuracy of the proposed suggestion concerning the composition of hydraulic fluids and their ubiquity in multiple applications, the correct answer to the question is \\"True\\"."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the context: How would Jordan feel afterwards? Choices: +a mean person; +a nice person; +like he made the biggest mistake;","completion":"Given the context, Jordan would most likely feel like a nice person after approvingly agreeing to lend his Nintendo Switch console to Addison. This is because he is displaying an act of kindness, generosity, and trust by allowing Addison to borrow something valuable and personal to him. By choosing to share his gaming console, Jordan is demonstrating that he is a considerate person who values his relationship with Addison. This act of kindness could potentially strengthen their bond and create positive feelings between both parties. Jordan might feel a sense of satisfaction knowing that he has made Addison happy and contributed positively to their friendship or relationship. Being a nice person is not about expecting something in return for kindness but rather genuinely wanting to help or make someone else happy. In this situation, Jordan's decision to lend his Nintendo Switch without hesitation indicates a genuine willingness to be helpful and caring towards Addison. To briefly consider the other choices, it is highly unlikely that Jordan would feel like a mean person, as his actions are the opposite of being unkind or selfish. He is openly and willingly sharing his property with Addison, which is a gesture of friendliness. Lastly, unless something unexpected happens regarding the borrowed Nintendo Switch (such as damage or loss), it is also unlikely that Jordan would feel like he made the biggest mistake. This is because lending a gaming console to someone is a relatively common and normal act of kindness that fosters positive connections and trust between people. In conclusion, given the context that Jordan looked at Addison approvingly when she asked to borrow his Nintendo Switch console, it is most plausible that he would feel like a nice person afterwards. His actions portray a sense of kindness, generosity, trust, and consideration for Addison's happiness, significantly contributing to a positive relationship dynamic."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Directed by Marc Forster, this drama narrates the story of Amir, an Afghan refugee living in the United States, who is prompted to travel back to his war-torn homeland to make amends for a past childhood incident. Though the story is set against the backdrop of Afghanistan, it was not practical to shoot the movie in the actual country due to security concerns and ongoing unrest. Therefore, the filming of The Kite Runner took place in multiple locations: 1. Kashgar, Xinjiang, China: The majority of the movie was shot in Kashgar, an ancient Silk Road city in northwest China that shares a border with Afghanistan. The city's landscape, architecture, and cultural resemblance to Afghanistan made it an ideal choice for capturing the essence of the book. 2. Beijing, China: Some additional scenes were filmed in Beijing. 3. San Francisco Bay Area, California, USA: Since part of the story takes place in the United States, specific scenes representing Amir's life in America were filmed in various locations in the San Francisco Bay Area, including Golden Gate Park and the Cliff House restaurant. 4.

Chat Moss could also derive from Ceatta, an Old English personal name and mos, a swamp or alternatively the first element could be the Old English ceat meaning a piece of wet ground. It was recorded as Catemosse in 1277 and Chatmos in 1322. Moss is the local name for a peat bog.Daniel Defoe visited the area in 1724, on his way from Warrington to Manchester: From hence (Warrington), on the road to Manchester, we pass'd the great bog or waste call'd Chatmos, the first of that kind that we see in England ...

What nature meant by such a useless production, 'tis hard to imagine; but the land is entirely waste, excep ... for the poor cottagers fuel, and the quantity used for that is very small. Peat bogs sometimes burst their boundaries, particularly after being subjected to heavy rainfall, and this seems to have happened with Chat Moss in the 16th century.

How is \\"Yenching University\\" said in Russian?","completion":"The name \\"Yenching University\\" is said in Russian as \\"Университет Иньчжао\\" (Universitet In'zhao). For your understanding: Russian language, like many other languages, doesn't have direct equivalent sounds or letters for all English phonetics. Therefore, when translating names of people, places or institutions, it’s often necessary to transcribe, or phonetically replicate, how that word or name is pronounced in the original language, rather than translating its components. The name \\"Yenching University\\" in this case most likely refers to Yanjing or Yenching (Yanjing is the Chinese word for Yenching), which was an old informal name for Beijing. \\"University\\" would just be translated to \\"Университет\\" which is pronounced \\"Universitet\\". The pronunciation of \\"Yenching\\" as it's spoken in Russian speakers will sound similar to the original Mandarin pronunciation—that is, it's an imitation or approximation of the sounds, rather than a meaningful translation of the components of the word. Do remember, transcribing a foreign name or phrase in Russian often relies on convention as much as it does phonetic likeness—what is widely accepted and understood among Russian speakers is just as important as achieving a close approximation of the original sounds. Just to add, the university once known as Yenching University is today part of Peking University, one of the most prestigious universities in China. Yenching University was a private university in Beijing, China, and was known for its high academic level. Speaking more about Yenching University, it was recognized as one of the premier academic institutions in the Republic of China era and it was the first Chinese institution to be a member of the Universitas 21, an international network of universities.

Proper handling of these bookings ensures a hassle-free experience for both the users and service providers. This article elucidates how you can navigate through 'My Bookings,' add remarks, and cancel a booking, thereby enabling more efficient reservation management. My Bookings: A One-Stop Solution for Reservation Management The 'My Bookings' section serves as a valuable resource for managing all your reservations in one place. Whether it's a hotel stay, an airline ticket, or an upcoming event, 'My Bookings' offers a comprehensive view of all your booking details, payment status, and updates. By accessing this section, you can keep track of all your reservations, past and current, and prevent any confusion or overlapping of bookings. Adding Remarks: Customization for Enhanced User Experience The 'Add Remarks' feature allows users to add personalized notes or comments, such as special requests, additional information about the booking, or simply providing feedback or suggestions. This feature fosters better and more efficient communication between the users and service providers. Some potential remarks that can be added include the following: 1. Dietary preferences: Specify any dietary requirements during an event's meal or when booking a hotel with breakfast. 2. Special assistance: Request special assistance, such as wheelchair accessibility, additional accessibility requirements, or an extra pillow. 3. Room preference: Share your preferred room type (smoking or non-smoking), choice of floor, or proximity to specific amenities. 4. Travel companions: Mention travel companion details, such as names and identification numbers, if they are not automatically included with the reservation. 5. Arrival and departure times: Provide accurate arrival and departure times, particularly if they are outside normal check-in and check-out hours. It is essential to double-check any remarks added to the booking to ensure clarity, accuracy, and to avoid any misunderstandings or delays. Cancel a Booking: An Easy Route to Manage Unanticipated Situations The ability to cancel a booking is an essential feature for managing reservations, as it provides the flexibility to accommodate last-minute changes in plans. There might be unforeseen circumstances that could force users to cancel their reservations, such as weather emergencies, personal issues, or even travel restrictions. This option allows users to promptly notify service providers, thereby allowing them to resell the canceled spots and avoid unnecessary losses. Before canceling a booking, users should verify the cancellation policies associated with the reservation. Providers typically have time restrictions and specific regulations that govern cancellations and fees. It is recommended that users minimize the number of cancellations, as excessive cancellations might negatively affect a user's credibility, potentially resulting in higher fees or reservations being refused in the future. Conclusion In summary, the 'My Bookings' section, along with options to add remarks and cancel a booking, empowers users to maintain intricate control over their reservation management process. By utilizing these features, users can ensure a streamlined experience for themselves and service providers, thereby creating a comfortable and stress-free booking environment."},{"prompt":"In this task, you're given a short article.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Please briefly summarize this news article: âClues That Lead to More Clues That Add Up to Nothingâ Imagine that a laboratory rat has just been introduced to a maze. We know that rats will navigate mazes for a reward — a pellet of food, say, or a dose of cocaine — but what if the reward of this particular maze is only the promise of a mystery pellet of unknown origin? And what if the rat finds a new mystery pellet every time it successfully navigates the maze, and each pellet offers a clue to where the next pellet will be found? Will the rat keep searching, collecting clues and mystery pellets until it’s exhausted and undernourished? Will this endless flow of pellets and clues about pellets inspire the rat to form a wiki site on the Web, encouraging other rats in the laboratory to list the dimensions and colors and locations of the mystery pellets that they’ve found? Will this wiki site, in turn, encourage the rats to become increasingly obsessed with these mystery pellets, despite the fact that said pellets turn out to have no nutritive or stimulative benefits whatsoever? Now imagine that the lead researcher enters the lab one day and tells all the rats (in rat language) that there is no answer to the mystery-pellet question. All those clues were arbitrarily placed, based on the whims of each lab assistant, and they don’t mean anything. Still, the lead researcher sincerely hopes that all the rats have thoroughly enjoyed their time navigating this maze. Their loyalty and efforts are much appreciated, and they are now free to go about their lives as if none of this ever happened. What will the rats do then? According to many television writers and development executives these days, the rats will happily march right into the next maze. They will search indefinitely for new mystery pellets: for clues that lead to more clues that add up to nothing. All of which explains how “Lost,” that endless, Mister Toad’s Wild Ride-themed jungle maze of empty mystery pellets and trumped-up suspense, continues to leave its toxic stain on current hits like “Homeland” and “American Horror Story” and threatens, even in death, to kill the current golden age of television. I still remember the first time I heard that “Star Wars” killed the golden age of movies back in the 1970s. As someone who saw “The Empire Strikes Back” 12 times in the theater when I was 10 and owned most of the “Star Wars” action figures, I encountered this statement as nothing short of blasphemy. After all, in that summer of “The Empire Strikes Back,” I crafted an ashtray out of clay and painted the words “I (heart) Harrison” across it in honor of my love for the actor behind Han Solo. I didn’t smoke and, of course, had never met Harrison Ford. But my love for “Star Wars” transcended reason. Hearing that “Star Wars” ended an era of cinematic artistry, for me, was like hearing that not only was there no Santa Claus, but the Easter Bunny and the Tooth Fairy went down with him in a horrible sleigh crash. Today, though, it’s clear that the awkward teddy-bear victory dance that wrapped “Return of the Jedi” (Yub nub! Eee chop yub nub!) was a melodic harbinger of bad times to come. Great action movies like “Jaws” and “Raiders of the Lost Ark” would soon be replaced by clumsy, formulaic movies like “Top Gun” and “Tango and Cash” (and not to mention “Jaws IV” and “Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull”). Thanks in part to “Star Wars,” the eclecticism and cinematic daring of the ’70s would be crushed under the wheels of blockbuster moviemaking. A similar process is under way in the post- “Lost” television world. The first three seasons of “Lost” may have approached the imaginative charms of the original “Star Wars” trilogy, but the next three were nearly as awful as George Lucas’s catastrophic prequels. You could easily picture the stumped writers of “Lost,” helpless in the face of an ever-growing pile of unsolved mysteries, madly skimming Wikipedia entries on space-time geometries and black holes. Summary:","completion":"The news article talks about a lab experiment where rats navigate a maze for a reward. But in this experiment, the rewards are mystery pellets that don't really help the rats. The rats keep searching for these pellets, even though they don't get anything useful from them.

What is the best way to: Reduce water use in dish washer. pick from the following. +Fill dish washer to max before using.; +Fill dish washer half way before using.; Answer:","completion":"The best way to reduce water use in a dishwasher is to fill the dishwasher to its maximum capacity before using it. This method ensures that the dishwasher is operating at its optimal efficiency, conserving both water and energy. There are several reasons why filling the dishwasher to max is a more sustainable practice compared to filling it only halfway: 1. Efficient use of water: Dishwashers are designed to clean a specific number of dishes per load. When the dishwasher is filled to its maximum capacity, it can clean all the dishes in that load with the same amount of water that it would use to clean an underfilled load. By filling it halfway, you essentially double the water needed to clean the same number of dishes as with a full load. 2. Energy conservation: Along with water, dishwashers also consume energy to heat the water and dry the dishes. When the dishwasher is filled to max, it maximizes the number of dishes cleaned per energy unit, reducing the overall energy consumption. On the other hand, operating the dishwasher half-filled doubles the energy consumption for the same amount of dishes cleaned. 3. Time efficiency: A dishwasher's cycle typically takes over an hour to complete. By filling the dishwasher to its maximum capacity, you optimize the amount of time spent on cleaning dishes. Running the dishwasher half-filled means you would have to run it twice to clean the same number of dishes, doubling the time spent doing the chore. 4. Detergent use: Dishwasher detergents are harmful to the environment, and minimizing their use is essential for reducing pollution. Filling the dishwasher to max ensures that you use the least amount of detergent needed to clean the dishes, reducing detergent residue entering the water system. 5. Cost-effectiveness: By using the dishwasher to its full capacity, you save on water, energy, and detergent costs. This helps households save money that can be used to invest in other sustainable practices or products. In conclusion, filling the dishwasher to its maximum capacity before using is the most sustainable and eco-friendly practice among the given options. By ensuring that the dishwasher is operated with maximum efficiency, you contribute to reducing water wastage, conserving energy, and minimizing pollution. This practice also saves time and money, making it the best choice for households conscious of their environmental impact."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Copyright © 2016 Albuquerque Journal The official seal of the University of New Mexico featuring a Spanish conquistador and a frontiersman – a mark affixed on diplomas and used as a backdrop for UNM events for 46 years – has come under fire from Native American students who say it glorifies the violent European treatment of natives. The protesters want the seal – whose roots can be traced to the university’s fourth president, Edward Dundas McQueen Gray, and was most recently updated in 1969 – relegated to the dustbin of history. They have gone so far as to design a protest version with a conquistador and frontiersman standing atop a mountain of skulls and ribcages with the current seal in the background. Red capital letters superimposed on the image read, “What Indians?” The Kiva Club, a Native American student group, and The Red Nation, a Native American advocacy group, say the current seal is offensive. UNM President Bob Frank said many people are attached to the seal, given its long history, but that he’s open to hearing the students’ rationale for changing it. “It’s a seal I have always known,” said Frank, who earned several degrees from UNM in the 1970s. “I certainly understand that people may have different points of view. If they want to talk about it, I am open to the conversation.” The protest seal is the creation of Nick Estes, a doctoral student and a member of the Oceti Sakowin tribe in South Dakota. He and others say the current seal is emblematic of deeper-seated racism at UNM. “I saw it, and I was like, ‘Is this really true?’ ” Estes said at a planning meeting of students and others looking to abolish the seal. “This is my interpretation of what that actually means. I actually couldn’t believe it. I didn’t actually think that this was a real thing that the University of New Mexico would be doing.” The issue isn’t limited to UNM. Last year, there were protesters at Fiestas de Santa Fe, a historical re-enactment that features Don Diego de Vargas “peacefully” reclaiming the city of Santa Fe following the Pueblo Revolt of 1680. Protesters said the fiesta glazes over the violent history between colonists and Native Americans. And in 1998, a statue in Alcalde of conquistador Juan de Oñate was the target of vandals who sawed off the statue’s right foot. Oñate may be most infamously known for the punishment he ordered after the battle of Acoma, which was for every man between the age of 12 and 25 to have a portion of his right foot amputated. When the vandals removed the statue’s foot, they left a note saying, “We took the liberty of removing Oñate’s right foot on behalf of our brothers and sisters of Acoma Pueblo.” Student petition The students are circulating a petition to “minimize the dehumanization of Natives on campus.” As of Friday afternoon, a little more than 100 people had signed it, according to an online copy of the petition available on change.org. “UNM has one of the highest populations of Native students in the Western Hemisphere currently,” the petition reads. “Its seal continues to make a mockery of its Native students and the surrounding Native community.” They also want UNM administrators to build a Native American cultural center. And they said that at least one member of the Board of Regents should be Native American. That decision is up to Gov. Susana Martinez, who appoints regents to the board. Greg Cajete has overseen the Native American studies program since 2001, and he said his students have often raised protests over the seal’s imagery. Cajete, who hails from the northern New Mexico pueblo of Santa Clara, declined to take a position but said he believes it will remain an issue for future students. “It warrants being looked into,” Cajete said. “What its resolution is going to be, that’s up to what people come up with. From my perspective, the University of New Mexico does need to reflect all of the cultures of New Mexico in a positive way.” Up to the regents The official seal is one of many images used to represent the state’s flagship university. But unlike the Lobo mascot used for athletics or the logo featuring Mesa Vista Hall, it requires a vote by the Board of Regents to change it. The president’s office, the university’s office of the secretary and the Board of Regents use the seal on official documents. The seal is also stamped on students’ diplomas. Estes said he and other indigenous students shouldn’t have a “racist” seal marking their academic achievements. “To have this on my diploma is an insult of the highest order,” Estes said. Conversation about the seal has spread to other student groups. Cheyenne Trujillo, president of Chicano/a Studies Student Organization, said her group has discussed the seal and its history but hasn’t decided if it will support the petition. Trujillo said the group is split between those who feel the seal is offensive and should be changed and those who feel that changing the seal would be ignoring New Mexico’s troubled history, an opinion Trujillo shares. “Getting rid of the seal says it never happened,” Trujillo said. Though the students haven’t filed an official complaint with the university, administrators have started to respond to their concerns. Jozi de Leon, vice president for equity and inclusion, attended a meeting where the students discussed their problems with the seal. She said she will work with the students to get their message to other university officials. De Leon said the university’s diversity council, a group of faculty, staff and students focused on diversity on campus, will support the students’ efforts in the future. “This is a university,” de Leon said. “This is the place where we should be having this kind of dialogue. We should be open to listening to the concerns of the students.” ||||| This undated photo shows the University of New Mexicoâ€™s official seal, depicting a Spanish conquistador and a frontiersman, that is drawing accusations of racism from Native American students.

How do you say \\"Social service records (welfare, Medicaid, etc.)\\" in Spanish?","completion":"In Spanish, the term \\"Social service records\\" can be translated as \\"Registros de servicios sociales\\", and the specific types of social services, such as welfare and Medicaid, would be translated as \\"bienestar social\\" and \\"Medicaid\\" respectively. So, to convey the entire concept of \\"Social service records (welfare, Medicaid, etc.)\\", you could say: \\"Registros de servicios sociales (bienestar social, Medicaid, etc.)\\". Let's break down the translation: 1. \\"Registros\\": The term \\"registros\\" refers to records or documentation in Spanish. It maintains the same context as in English when speaking about various types of stored data or archived information. 2. \\"de servicios sociales\\": The phrase \\"de servicios sociales\\" translates to \\"of social services\\" in English. When combined with \\"registros\\", it conveys the meaning of records belonging to social services. 3. \\"(bienestar social, Medicaid, etc.)\\": In this part of the phrase, the specific examples of social services (welfare and Medicaid) have been translated. \\"Bienestar social\\" is the Spanish term for welfare programs and services that aim to provide for the well-being of citizens in need. \\"Medicaid\\", on the other hand, remains the same in Spanish. The \\"etc.\\" abbreviation is also utilized in Spanish and can be used in the same context to denote that there are more services or examples beyond those mentioned. So, when discussing \\"Social service records (welfare, Medicaid, etc.)\\" with a Spanish-speaking audience, you can use the phrase: \\"Registros de servicios sociales (bienestar social, Medicaid, etc.)\\". This translation will help facilitate communication and ensure that your audience understands the specific context regarding social services records."},{"prompt":"Q:This article: The cartoon opens with an introduction of Petunia Pig; Petunia is shown as nervous, tripping on her lines and being unable to pronounce them correctly while on stage, leading an off-screen announcer to quietly tell her not to get excited.

The negative sentiment towards this film arises from the poorly executed character development, lackluster plot, and derivative tropes. From the outset, the script proves to be catastrophic in creating believable, multidimensional characters. Instead, we are introduced to an array of stereotypes that bring nothing new to the table, making it difficult for the audience to connect with or care about their fates. Furthermore, the actors appear to be trapped within the constraints of these uninspiring, one-dimensional caricatures, which prevents them from bringing any depth or nuance to their performances. The plot, on the other hand, is an aimless wander through familiar territory. It quickly becomes apparent that there is no unique vision or compelling story to be found here. Rather, the movie haphazardly stitches together scenes that appear to have been lifted from superior horror films, employing derivative jumpscares and rehashed revelations that simply cannot compensate for the lack of a coherent narrative. Alongside these major shortcomings, the director falls into the same pitfalls that have ensnared countless other horror movies: over-reliance on cheap scares instead of building atmosphere, a tendency to telegraph every twist and turn, and most damningly, an inability to effectively employ (or even recognize) pacing. The result is a tedious, tensionless film that generates much tedium, rather than terror. Ultimately, When Darkness Falls is a bitter disappointment, offering little but unoriginal concepts and an empty imitation of better horror efforts. The film wastes its potential by focusing on superficial scares and neglecting the crucial aspects of character development and storytelling, which leaves the audience with a hollow, unsatisfying experience. In a genre that has seen a recent surge of thrilling and innovative creations, this movie fails to make even the slightest of impacts and is best left in the shadows."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This is not a normal train. This is a maglev train. The word maglev stands for magnetic levitation. Because it has no wheels, there is no friction. Some magnets hold the train up. Other magnets are used to move the train forward. This train can go very fast. It can reach speeds up to 480 kilometers (300 miles) per hour! Magnets are pretty cool. What exactly is a magnet?

Given the question: Rob is experimenting with how air pressure works. To that end, he has designed two tests. In the first test the air flow works as it would in an airplane wing. He labels it as case A. In the second test the air flow works as it would in a race car spoiler. He labels it as case B. He is surprised to see that air flow behaves differently in different situations. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Would case A have higher or lower air pressure above it than case B? The answer is:","completion":"To answer this question, we need to analyze the airflow and air pressure in both cases, in an airplane wing (case A) and a race car spoiler (case B). Step 1: Understand how air pressure works in case A (airplane wing) An airplane wing is designed with an airfoil shape, in which the upper surface is curved and the lower surface is relatively flat. When air flows over the wing, it moves faster over the curved upper surface than below the flat lower surface. According to Bernoulli's principle, a faster air flow creates lower air pressure. Step 2: Understand how air pressure works in case B (race car spoiler) A race car spoiler is a device attached to the rear of the car, designed to create downforce by disrupting the air flow. The air flow above a race car spoiler is, in general, slower than over an airplane wing due to the spoiler's angled, straight shape as compared to the curved airfoil of an airplane wing. The slower air flow creates higher air pressure. Step 3: Compare case A and case B Now that we understand the air pressure above both case A and case B, we can make a comparison to determine which has higher or lower air pressure. In an airplane wing (case A), the air flow is faster, resulting in lower air pressure above it. In a race car spoiler (case B), the air flow is slower, causing higher air pressure above it. Given this information, the answer is: Case A would have a lower air pressure above it than case B."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Please answer the following question: I showed up at the address on Columbine's invitation just before eleven; it was a converted warehouse in an industrial zone on the city's north side. Since it was a Saturday night, everything else was empty for miles. The parking lot was filled with sports cars, hybrids, and shiny suburban tanks. The door facing the parking lot was open, spilling out muted lights and the din of yuppie chatter. It cast a somewhat foreboding aura over the entrance. The first thing I noticed as I approached was the beefy refrigerator in a rented tux blocking the doorway. The second thing was the surveillance camera perched on the wall above his head. I had stopped home and changed first, so I was sure I was dressed mostly appropriately for some rich faux-hipster art party - charcoal gray pinstripe jacket over a TV on the Radio t-shirt, skinny cuffed jeans, Docs, and a black fedora. I certainly didn't look any worse than the other idiots I saw filing in and out of the door. I even had an invitation. So I was fairly confident I'd be able to gain admission to this thing without incident. \\"No, absolutely not,\\" the doorman said, pressing a meaty palm into my chest. \\"I was invited!\\" I said, exasperated. \\"I have documentation.\\" I waved the rave card in front of his face. \\"No dice.\\" I stepped aside to let a couple of aging goths through the door and wondered for a moment if the doorman somehow knew who I was.

Biographical information in this gallery provided by the White House. President Obama will correct a historical act of discrimination next month when he awards the Medal of Honor, the nation’s highest commendation for combat valor, to a group of Hispanic, Jewish and African-American veterans who were passed over because of their racial or ethnic backgrounds. The unusual presentation will culminate a 12-year Pentagon review ordered by Congress into past discrimination in the ranks and will hold a particular poignancy when conducted by the nation’s first African-American president. Although the review predates Obama’s tenure, he has made addressing discrimination in the military — including ending the ban on gay and lesbian service members — a priority as commander in chief. With the ornate White House East Room as backdrop, the March 18 ceremony will mark another step to revisit a history of discrimination in the armed forces as the nation’s demographics and social values shift rapidly. The recipients, whom the White House announced Friday afternoon, served in World War II, Korea, and Vietnam. Collectively, their award ceremony will mark the single largest group of Medal of Honor recipients since World War II, when more than two dozen service members were honored in that conflict’s last days. Just three of the 24 veterans who will be honored are still alive. All but five of the soldiers are Hispanic, Jewish or African American, including Melvin Morris, a former Green Beret who was wounded three times on a mid-September day in 1969 recovering the body of his fatally wounded master sergeant from a jungle ambush in the Chi Lang district of South Vietnam. “I never thought much about it and didn’t until recently,” said Morris, 72, who was decorated three times for his service in Vietnam and retired from the Army after 22 years. “But I think that this is something the military always should address because, in almost every process we have, someone is overlooked.” The unusual historical accounting began in 2002 when Congress, as part of the military spending bill, ordered the Pentagon to look into whether Jewish and Hispanic service members had been passed over unfairly for the nation’s highest military honor. Defense Department officials said there was specific evidence to suggest such discrimination may have existed in the ranks, including instances in which Hispanic and Jewish soldiers apparently changed their names to hide their ethnicity. The congressional order spanned the period from December 1941 through September 2001. The project was an enormous undertaking that sent military personnel officials searching for lost records and battlefield histories amid the complicated politics surrounding the military’s highest honor. Officials from each service branch focused on service members who had been awarded the second-highest medal for gallantry: the Distinguished Service Cross for the Army, the Air Force Cross for that branch, and the Navy Cross for the Navy and Marine Corps. Although that narrowed the review, the Army alone identified more than 600 records that needed reassessment. The smaller branches found 275 among them. “It’s hard to be awarded the medal for a single person, and to go back for all those potential candidates, that is a very demanding scope and record-retrieval task,” said a defense official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to comment on the review. “It was very time-consuming. But we wanted to make sure that, as a process, we did it correctly and that the Medal of Honor process itself was honored.” Many of the veterans under review had passed away, making interviews impossible. Much of the review relied on existing information and comparisons to Medal of Honor recipients, but even then, there were challenges unforeseen when the project began. In 1973, a fire tore through the National Personnel Records Center in St. Louis, destroying as many as 18 million military personnel files. Among those were Army service records from 1912 through 1960, a period that included World War II and Korea. The Air Force lost most of its personnel files from 1947 though 1964. The disaster forced officials to recreate the military history of scores of potential candidates for the upgraded commendation by interviewing family members, fellow battlefield soldiers, and others. The reassessment sent a host of candidates through the various service boards that decide on Medal of Honor recipients and then to the Joint Chiefs for approval. Two dozen veterans — all from the Army — emerged as worthy of an upgrade to the Medal of Honor. They include 17 Hispanic soldiers such as Santiago J. Erevia, a former specialist four who served in Vietnam as a radio telephone operator in Company C, 1st Battalion (Airmobile), 501st Infantry of the 101st Airborne Division. He will receive the Medal of Honor at the March 18 ceremony for “courageous actions” during a search-and-clear mission near Tam Ky, Vietnam. “We’ve wondered why he didn’t receive it the first time and thought it may have been because of his name,” said Jesse Erevia, 41, his son, who lives in San Antonio, not far from his father. Erevia said his father had “some issues” with the Vietnam War, mainly concerning its rationale, and has mixed feelings about military honors in general. But the family is eager to attend the White House ceremony next month to see him receive an award they have long felt he deserved. “He’s never let me down,” Erevia, a tamale salesman, said of his father. “His are big shoes to fill.” The third living veteran is Jose Rodela, a former sergeant first class from Corpus Christi, Tex., who will receive the medal for bravery during fighting in Phuoc Long province, Vietnam, in early September 1969. The review identified one deceased Jewish veteran, former Pfc. Leonard M. Kravitz, to receive the Medal of Honor. In early March 1951, Kravitz was serving as an assistant machine gunner with Company M, 5th Infantry Regiment of the 24th Infantry Division. His actions in combat over two days in Yangpyong, Korea, were deemed worthy of the highest honor. “In this instance, justice was delayed but not denied,” Abraham H. Foxman, national director of the Anti-Defamation League, said Friday in a statement. Morris was the only African-American veteran identified as part of the review. The initial congressional order did not include black service members for reassessment, but it was later amended to allow others deserving an upgraded commendation — not just Hispanic or Jewish service members — to receive one. Of the two dozen soldiers in the White House announcement, five identified themselves on military personnel forms as “Caucasian.” Military officials said their ethnicity or religious affiliation is uncertain, but their battlefield actions were found to deserve the highest honor. Morris grew up in small-town Oklahoma, the son of a “do-it-all carpenter” and a housemaid. He joined the Army because at the time, he recalled, “it was the prestigious thing to do, and if you got in, you went.” As part of a Special Forces A Team carrying out search-and-destroy missions with local Montagnard troops, Morris was ambushed on Sept. 17, 1969, on a jungle patrol. His company commander was shot through the mouth and throat, his operations sergeant was severely wounded by a land mine and his master sergeant, Ronald P. Hague, was killed. “We were a tight crew and we didn’t leave anyone behind,” Morris said. He took soldiers to retrieve Hague’s body three times before succeeding. He said last rites over his friend and then was shot through the chest, the arm, and the ring finger — tearing it off along with his wedding band. After recuperating in a stateside hospital, Morris returned to Vietnam for another tour, this time as the recipient of the Distinguished Service Cross. “I never thought about the medal, whether it should have been another higher one,” he said. “I just kept doing what I was doing.” Morris said he did not consider whether his race played a part in the commendation selection. He was not blind to race; Morris recalled being unable to use the public drinking fountain outside the Southern base where he trained for Special Forces. “This is wonderful,” he said. “I’m overwhelmed. And there are more out there.” Morris said he will travel from his Florida home to the White House next month with his three children and his wife of more than five decades, Mary, who gave him the ring that was shot off with his finger that day in Vietnam. “I haven’t worn one since,” he said.

In recognition of their valor in World War II, Vietnam and Korea, President Obama will present the awards on March 18, according to a statement from the White House. Each of the soldiers was previously recognized by award of the Distinguished Service Cross, the nation’s second highest military award. That award will be upgraded to the Medal of Honor in recognition of their gallantry, intrepidity and heroism above and beyond the call of duty. Congress, through the Defense Authorization Act, called for a review in 2002 of Jewish American and Hispanic American veteran war records from WWII, the Korean War and the Vietnam War, to ensure those deserving the Medal of Honor were not denied because of prejudice. During the review, records of several soldiers of neither Jewish nor Hispanic descent were also found to have criteria worthy of the Medal of Honor. The 2002 Act was amended to allow these soldiers to be honored with the upgrade, in addition to the Jewish and Hispanic-American soldiers. Living recipients Sgt. 1st Class Melvin Morris, African American, Vietnam War On Sept. 17, 1969, soldiers from 1st and 3rd Battalions, IV Mobile Strike Force were conducting a search and clear operation near Chi Lang, Vietnam. Morris, commander of 3rd Company, 3rd Battalion, learned that sister companies from his battalion had encountered an extensive enemy mine field and were engaged with the enemy. Morris immediately reorganized the force into an effective assault posture and moved them forward before he and two other men went to recover the body of a fallen team commander. Enemy fire wounded the two men with Morris, so he helped them back to the main force and then charged alone into the hail of fire. He threw grenades into the nearest enemy bunker. While his men provided suppressive fire, Morris destroyed four more enemy positions to get to his fallen comrade. Morris was wounded three times but he did not stop until he brought the fallen soldier back to safety. Master Sgt. Jose Rodela, Hispanic American, Vietnam War On Sept. 1, 1969, 3rd Battalion, 3rd Mobile Strike Force Command in Phuoc Long Province, Vietnam, moved to support a sister battalion that had suffered heavy casualties. On their way there, the soldiers from 3rd Battalion came under heavy mortar, rocket, machine-gun and small arms fire. The attack was so intense the unit suffered 42 casualties almost immediately. Rodela, a company commander, immediately began to move from man to man in his company, physically pushing them into defensive positions to form a half-moon perimeter. His actions allowed the unit to organize a defensive perimeter. When the firing eased, Rodela jumped up, exposing himself to enemy fire, and began checking for casualties and moving survivors into different positions to try and form a stable defensive line. Spc. Santiago Erevia, Hispanic American, Vietnam War On May 21, 1969, Erevia’s company was engaged in a search and clear operation near Tam Ky in Vietnam’s Quang Tin Province. After a number of light skirmishes, the soldiers, from C Company, 1st Battalion, 501st Infantry, 101st Airborne Division, arrived at a hillside, where they came under heavy enemy fire and suffered numerous casualties. Erevia, the radio telephone operator, was asked by his platoon leader to give aid to four wounded comrades while the others pushed forward against the enemy. While caring for the wounded, the men came under intense automatic weapons and small arms fire from four enemy bunkers about 50 meters to their left. With bullets striking all around him, Erevia crawled from one wounded man to another, gathering up weapons and ammunition. Armed with two M-16 rifles and several hand grenades, Erevia moved in on the enemy bunkers. Erevia pulled the pin on a hand grenade and fired his rifles until he was able to drop the grenade into a bunker, destroying the position and killing the enemy fighter. Erevia continued to move to the other three bunkers and silenced them by throwing a grenade at two positions and firing his M-16 at the last bunker. He then returned to aid in treating and evacuating the dead and wounded from his company. Posthumous awards: Staff Sgt. Salvador J. Lara, WWII Then-Pfc. Salvador Lara led his rifle squad to inflict large casualties on enemy forces. And when they resumed the attack the following morning, his leg was severely injured, and he did not stop for first aid. When his element suffered under withering machine gun fire, he crawled alone to the nearest machinegun and took out the Germans manning it. The action took place on May 27 and 28, 1944, in Aprilia, Italy. Pvt. Pedro Cano, WWII During the months-long battle of Hurtgen Forest, Cano killed 30 enemy troops on Dec. 2 and 3, 1944, in Schevenhütte, Germany. While on a patrol, Cano’s unit took casualties and he played dead, then tossed a grenade at the German soldiers, killing or wounding all of them. He was badly injured shortly thereafter. Sgt. Alfred B. Nietzel, WWII While an enemy assault threatened to overrun Nietzel’s position, he ordered the three remaining men from his squad to retreat for reinforcements on Nov. 18, 1944, in Heistern, Germany. He lay suppressive fire until his ammunition ran out before he was killed with a grenade. His actions delayed enemy troops until reinforcements could occupy defensive positions and halt the hostile drive. 1st Lt. Donald K. Schwab, WWII Schwab led his company over 400 yards of bare, coverless ground against a formidable line of machine-guns and machine-pistols, made three charges with his dwinding group of men before he charged the enemy alone in Lure, France on Sept. 17, 1944. Ultimately, he took out a German pistol nest by ripping off its shelter cover, bludgeoning the gunner with his carbine and dragging him behind friendly lines amid a hail of gunfire. The action so disorganized the enemy troops that they abandoned their defenses and withdrew. Pfc. William F. Leonard, WWII On Nov. 7, 1944, near St. Die, France, Pfc. William F. Leonard braved machinegun fine to assault a hill after his platoon was reduced to eight men, killing two snipers 50 and 75 yards away. Shot in the neck and back, he destroyed a machine gun with grenades, killing its two-man crew. Stunned by an exploding bazooka shell, he advanced to knock out a second machine gun. Staff Sgt. Mauel V. Mendoza, WWII Staff Sgt. Manuel Mendoza single-handedly broke up a German counterattack on Oct. 4, 1944, in Mt. Battaglia, Italy. While wounded, he grabbed a submachine gun, crested a hill and fired on 200 heavily armed enemy troops who were charging the hill from the other side, killing 30 of them. After the enemy withdrew, he retrieved many enemy weapons, captured a wounded enemy soldier and returned to a friendly position. Pvt. Joe Gandara, WWII Gandara’s detachment came under devastating enemy fire from a strong German force, pinning the men to the ground for about four hours on June 9, 1944, in Amfreville, France. Gandara advanced voluntarily and alone toward the enemy position and destroyed three hostile machine-guns before he was fatally wounded. Sgt. Jesus Duran, Hispanic American, Vietnam War On April 10, 1969, in Tay Ninh, Vietnam, Duran, a machine gunner with E Company, 2nd Battalion, 5th Cavalry, 1st Cavalry Division, was on a search and clear operation. As the soldiers moved into an elaborate enemy bunker complex, the lead elements began taking fire from every side. With his M-60 machine gun blazing from his hip, Duran rushed forward and assumed a defensive position near the command post. As the hostile forces stormed the post with small arms fire and grenades, Duran thwarted their efforts with devastating streams of machine-gun fire. Learning that two seriously wounded troopers were pinned down by harassing enemy fire, Duran assaulted the enemy positions, firing deadly bursts on the run. Duran climbed onto a log and fired directly into the enemy’s foxholes, eliminating four fighters and several others as they fled. He then continued to pour effective fire on the disorganized and fleeing enemy. Master Sgt. Jose Rodela, Hispanic American, Vietnam War On Sept. 1, 1969, 3rd Battalion, 3rd Mobile Strike Force Command in Phuoc Long Province, Vietnam, moved to support a sister battalion that had suffered heavy casualties. On their way there, the soldiers from 3rd Battalion came under heavy mortar, rocket, machine-gun and small arms fire. The attack was so intense the unit suffered 42 casualties almost immediately. Rodela, a company commander, immediately began to move from man to man in his company, physically pushing them into defensive positions to form a half-moon perimeter. His actions allowed the unit to organize a defensive perimeter. When the firing eased, Rodela jumped up, exposing himself to enemy fire, and began checking for casualties and moving survivors into different positions to try and form a stable defensive line. Sgt. 1st Class Melvin Morris, African American, Vietnam War On Sept. 17, 1969, soldiers from 1st and 3rd Battalions, IV Mobile Strike Force were conducting a search and clear operation near Chi Lang, Vietnam. Morris, commander of 3rd Company, 3rd Battalion, learned that sister companies from his battalion had encountered an extensive enemy mine field and were engaged with the enemy. Morris immediately reorganized the force into an effective assault posture and moved them forward before he and two other men went to recover the body of a fallen team commander. Enemy fire wounded the two men with Morris, so he helped them back to the main force and then charged alone into the hail of fire. He threw grenades into the nearest enemy bunker. While his men provided suppressive fire, Morris destroyed four more enemy positions to get to his fallen comrade. Morris was wounded three times but he did not stop until he brought the fallen soldier back to safety. Staff Sgt. Felix Conde-Falcon, Hispanic American, Vietnam War Conde-Falcon was a platoon leader on April 4, 1969, when his unit conducted a sweep operation near Ap Tan Hoa, Vietnam. The soldiers came upon an extensive enemy bunker complex, which turned out to be a battalion command post. After artillery and air strikes on the position, Conde-Falcon’s platoon went in to clear the bunker. Conde-Falcon charged the first bunker, heaving grenades as he went. He moved on to two more bunkers, destroying them as well. When he rejoined his platoon, they moved about 100 meters before they came under intense hostile fire. Conde-Falcon single-handedly assaulted the nearest enemy position, killing the fighters inside before running out of ammunition. He picked up an M-16 rifle but was shot by an unseen assailant and soon died of his wounds. Spc. Leonard Alvarado, Hispanic American, Vietnam War On Aug. 12, 1969, while serving as a rifleman during a mission to relieve a sister platoon in Phuoc Long Province, Vietnam, Alvarado recognized and disrupted an enemy raid. Despite his quick reaction, he and his comrades were quickly pinned down by the enemy force that blocked the path to the trapped platoon. As Alvarado rushed forward to engage the enemy, a grenade exploded nearby, wounding and momentarily stunning him. Alvarado killed the grenadier just as another enemy barrage wounded him again. He crawled forward to pull several soldiers back within a hastily-formed perimeter. Realizing that his element had to break away from the enemy force, Alvarado began moving forward alone. Exploding satchel charges kept throwing him to the ground, but Alvarado continued to move and fire, silencing several enemy positions. He continued to lay down suppressive fire on the hostile forces. After the enemy broke contact, his comrades discovered Alvarado had died from his wounds. Sgt. Candelario Garcia, Hispanic American, Vietnam War Garcia was a team leader in B Company, 1st Battalion, 2nd Infantry, 1st Brigade, 1st Infantry Division. On Dec. 8, 1968, during a reconnaissance-in-force mission near Lai Khe, Vietnam, Garcia’s platoon discovered communication wire and other signs of an enemy base camp leading into a densely vegetated area. The soldiers came under intense fire and several were wounded and trapped in the open. Ignoring the hail of bullets, Garcia crawled to within 10 meters of a machine-gun bunker, leaped to his feet and ran directly at it, firing his rifle as he charged. He jammed two hand grenades into the gun port and then placed the muzzle of his weapon inside, killing all four occupants. Garcia then ran 15 meters to another bunker and killed the three enemy inside with hand grenades and rifle fire. He then helped rescue two casualties and joined his company in an assault that overran the remaining enemy positions. Spc. Ardie Copas, Caucasian American, Vietnam War On May 12, 1970, near Ph Romeas Hek, Cambodia, Copas’ company was attacked by a large hostile force firing recoilless rifles, rocket-propelled grenades and automatic weapons. Copas, a machine-gunner, began returning fire but was knocked to the ground when his armored car was hit by an enemy recoilless round. Four other Americans were wounded. Ignoring his wounds, Copas climbed back into the burning vehicle and began firing his machine-gun at the enemy. Copas laid down suppressive fire until the four wounded were safely evacuated; he continued to fight until he was mortally wounded by an enemy round. Cpl. Victor H. Espinoza, Korea Then-Cpl. Victor Espinoza spearheaded an attack to secure “Old Baldy” when his unit was pinned down by withering fire from fortified positions. In daring succession, Espinoza single-handedly silenced a machine-gun and its crew, discovered and destroyed a covert enemy tunnel, and wiped out two bunkers. His actions, which took place Aug. 1, 1952 at Chorwon, Korea, inspired his unit and enabled them to secure the strong-point against great odds. Sgt. Juan E. Negron, Korea On April 28, 1951, near Kalmaeri, Korea, then-Sgt. Negron was told elements of the company were withdrawing from an exposed position, but Negron refused to leave and delivered withering fire at hostile troops who had broken through a road block. As hostile troops approached his position, Negron hit them with hand grenades and stopped their attack. He held the position all night, while an allied counter attack was organized and launched. After the enemy was repulsed, 15 of them were found a few feet from Negron’s position. Pvt. Miguel Armando “Nando” Vera, Hispanic American, Korea Citation summary: Vera, a native of Puerto Rico native, on Sept. 21, 1952, was serving with Company F, 2nd Battalion, 38th Infantry Regiment, 2nd Infantry Division at Chorwon, Korea. Vera’s unit was committed to assault and secure the right sector of the hill “Old Baldy” and, although wounded in an earlier engagement, Vera voluntarily rejoined elements of the platoon regrouping at the hill’s base. Forging up the bare, rocky slope in skirmisher formation, the troops came within 20 yards of hostile positions when they were subjected to heavy artillery and mortar barrages and intense cross-fire from automatic weapons and grenades, which forced them to move back. Vera remained behind to cover the withdrawal and, poured crippling fire into enemy emplacements. During this action he lost his life. Pfc. Demensio Rivera, Hispanic American, Korea Citation summary: On May 22-23, 1951, Rivera, an 18-year-old native of Puerto Rico, was serving with Company G, 2nd Battalion, 7th Infantry Regiment, 3rd Infantry Division at Changyongni. When his platoon’s outpost was assaulted at night, Rivera, an automatic rifleman, tenaciously held his position. When his rifle became inoperative, Rivera employed his pistol and grenades, and eventually fought the enemy hand-to-hand and forced them back. As an overwhelming number of the enemy closed in, he killed four with his only remaining grenade. When his position was retaken, he was found seriously wounded and lying with the bodies of the four enemy dead or dying. Sgt. Jack Weinstein, Caucasian, Korea Citation summary: Weinstein, of Lamar, Mo., was serving with Company G, 21st Infantry Regiment, 24th Infantry Division on Oct. 19, 1951, near Kumson. Weinstein was in the lead as the first platoon of Company G attempted to take an enemy-held position. After gaining the ground, the platoon, consisting of two five-man squads, was hit by a fierce counterattack by about 30 fanatical Chinese Communist troops. Most of the members of the platoon had been wounded in the previous action and withdrew. Weinstein continued to fight off the rushing enemy. At least six killed by Weinstein’s M-1 rifle before he ran out of ammo. Although under extremely heavy enemy fire, he refused to withdraw and continued fighting by throwing enemy hand grenades which were lying near his position. Alone and unaided he held the ground his platoon had fought hard to take. He held out against overwhelming odds until another platoon was able relieve him and drive back the enemy. Weinstein’s leg had been broken by an enemy grenade and old wounds suffered in previous battles had reopened, but he refused to withdraw until wounded comrades could reach friendly lines. Weinstein died on April 20, 2006, at the age of 77. Pfc. Leonard M. Kravitz, Jewish American, Korea Citation summary: Kravitz, a Brooklyn, N.Y. native, on March 6-7, 1951, was serving with Company M, 3rd Battalion, 5th Regimental Combat Team, attached to the 24th Infantry Division, in Yangpyong. Kravitz’s unit was overrun by enemy and forced to withdraw from a defensive position. Kravitz voluntarily remained at his machine-gun to provide suppressive fire. This forced the enemy to concentrate their attack on his own position. Kravitz was killed, but his actions saved his entire platoon. Sgt. Eduardo Corral Gomez, Hispanic American, Korea Citation summary: Gomez, a Los Angeles native, was serving with Company I, 8th Cavalry Regiment, First Cavalry Division, on Sept. 3, 1950, at Tabu-dong. While readying defensive positions, his company was ruthlessly attacked. Gomez maneuvered across open ground to successfully assault a manned tank. Wounded in the left side while returning to his position, he refused medical care, instead manning his post and firing upon the enemy. Although his weapon overheated and burned his hands and his painful wound still bled, he maintained his stand and, upon orders to withdraw in the face of overwhelming enemy superiority, remained to provide protective fire, exacting more enemy casualties.

Baldonado, Hispanic American, Korea Citation summary: Baldonado, a 20-year-old Colorado native, was serving with Company B, 187th Airborne Infantry Regiment, on Nov. 25, 1950, at Hill 171 in the vicinity of Kangdong. At approximately 4 a.m., 2nd Platoon was occupying positions on Hill 171 when the enemy tried to launch a strong attack to occupy the hill. By 6 a.m., the platoon had expended most of its ammo, and the platoon leader decided to commit his third squad. Since there was not time to dig in, Baldonado, a machine-gunner of the third squad, placed his weapon in an exposed position and delivered a withering stream of fire on the advancing enemy, causing them to fall back. The enemy then concentrated all their fire on Baldonado’s gun, and attempted to knock it out by rushing the position in small groups and hurling grenades. Several times grenades exploded extremely close to Baldonado, but failed to interrupt him. The enemy finally withdrew at 7 a.m., after making a final assault on Baldonado’s position, during which a grenade landed near his gun, killing him instantly. Baldonado’s remains still have not been found. Master Sgt. Michael C. Pena, Hispanic American, Korea Citation summary: Pena a 25-year-old native of Newgulf, Texas and World War II veteran, was serving with Company F, 2nd Battalion, 5th Cavalry Regiment (Infantry), 1st Cavalry Division on the evening of Sept. 4, 1950, near Waegwan. His unit was fiercely attacked and Pena led them in a counter-attack, regained the lost positions, and attempted to hold back the enemy. Despite the devastating fire laid by the friendly troops, the enemy continued to hurl themselves at the defenses in overwhelming numbers. During the course of the counter-attack, Pena realized his soldiers’ ammo was running out and ordered his unit to retreat. Pena then manned a machine-gun to cover their withdrawal. Single-handedly, he held back the enemy until the early hours of the following morning when his position was overrun, and he was killed. ||||| Write a summary.","completion":"In 2014, President Obama awarded the Medal of Honor to a group of Hispanic, Jewish, and African-American veterans who were overlooked due to their racial and ethnic backgrounds.

Article: One day, Soapy Smith and I visited a shelter for badly-treated women located in a deserted section of the city. No one smiled a greeting, and they appeared uninterested in Soapy. One little girl in particular moved like a wisp in the background. The staff informed me that she had been there for over a month and had not spoken the entire time. Her mother said she had talked at one time but not in recent memory. I didn't want to imagine what could have happened to rob this little girl of the natural curiosity and enthusiasm so natural to childhood. Spreading a blanket on the floor, I sat down and put Soapy on the blanket. As the silent child circled past me, I told the group that Soapy would come to talk to them if they sat on his blanket. Several children did this, including the silent girl. She sat rigidly at the edge of the blanket, legs held stiffly out straight in front of her. She was staring hard at Soapy. It appeared that he kept making eye contact with her. She didn't reach out to him or encourage him in any way. Rather she sat tensely, just staring. Finally Soapy came to a stop about two inches from her. He quietly reached out and laid his chin on her knee. I was astonished. While a common behavior for dogs, this is not a behavior exhibited by rabbits, especially not by this rabbit. The child did not reach out to touch Soapy. Instead, she slowly leaned toward him.

Summarize this article: Thirty-eight soldiers killed themselves in July, the worst month for suicides since the Army began releasing figures in 2009, according to Pentagon officials. If soldiers continue to take their lives at the current rate, the Army will lose about 200 active-duty troops this year, a number that is significantly higher than any year in the past decade. “Suicide is the toughest enemy I have faced in my 37 years in the Army,” Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, who is leading the Army’s effort to deal with the problem, said in a written statement. “That said, I do believe suicide is preventable.” In July there were 26 active-duty suicides and 12 suicides among National Guardsmen and reservists who were not serving in uniform at the time of their deaths. The combined 38 Army suicides is twice the number of troops killed in Afghanistan this month. The Marine Corps had eight suicides in July, the highest monthly number so far this year, according to the Associated Press. The losses are a significant blow to senior Army officials who had been hoping that the reduced rate of combat deployments and a series of initiatives to improve mental health care would result in a drop in the suicide rate, which surpasses levels for a similar civilian demographic. In recent years the Army has tried to lower its suicide rate by hiring hundreds of new mental health and substance abuse counselors. But it isn’t clear that the additional resources have had an effect, and there is significant disagreement among mental health experts and military officers over how best to deal with the problem. “The military really is trying hard,” said Kim Ruocco, a mental health social worker whose Marine husband committed suicide in 2005. “But we need more money, more resources, and we need to make mental health care a higher priority. There are still too many gaps in care and too long of waits for soldiers seeking care.” Other mental health experts expressed doubt that more mental health resources would fix the problem. “I don’t think we can throw psychiatrists, psychologists and social workers at the problem and make it that much better,” said Frank Ochberg, a clinical professor of psychiatry at Michigan State University. To lower the suicide rate, the military needs to reduce the stigma associated with mental illness, Ochberg said. “The culture does not make it easy to get help,” he said. Senior Army officials on Thursday highlighted the need to encourage more soldiers to seek out mental health care and seemed to play down the need for more counselors. “We want the mind-set across our force and society at large to be that behavioral health is a routine part of what we do and who we are,” Austin said. Austin also said that the Army will continue to work to help soldiers to develop better coping mechanisms to deal with setbacks and loss. There is significant disagreement over how to reduce the stigma associated with mental illness and encourage more soldiers to seek care. Several psychiatrists and at least one retired general began lobbying earlier this year to change the name of post-traumatic stress disorder, a mental condition that is believed to increase the risk of suicide, to post-traumatic stress injury. Those advocating the change maintained that soldiers suffering an injury would be more likely to seek help than those branded as having a disorder. Other advocates have pressed the military to award the Purple Heart to troops suffering from PTSD incurred in battle as part of a broader effort to reduce the stigma associated with mental illness. In 2008, the Pentagon considered changing the criteria but decided that it was too difficult to prove that people were suffering from the condition. ||||| Getty Images A record number of soldiers – 38 – are suspected of killing themselves in July, the Pentagon said Thursday. It marks a startling jump in the suicide epidemic that has been frustrating Army leaders for years. The total included 26 active-duty soldiers – under the Army’s control 24/7 — also an apparent record, and a 117% jump from June’s count of 12 active-duty suicides. (MORE: This Isn’t Funny…) The Army has been fighting suicides when they were occurring at the rate of nearly one a day – in fact, that was the cover line on a Time story last month into the vexing problem of soldiers killing themselves after a decade of war. But July’s 38 likely suicides spread over the month’s 31 days works out to almost 1.25 suicides a day. The toll was 58% higher than June’s 24 suspected suicides, and is roughly 50% more than the average monthly suicide count experienced over the past 18 months. Military suicide data has only been kept diligently in recent years; non-active duty suicides have only been tracked for about five years. So that makes historical comparisons difficult. But the numbers are the highest since 9/11, and several experts believe they mark an all-time high. “The number 26 [of active-duty suicides] is the highest single month we’ve had since 2001,” Bruce Shahbaz, a medical analyst on the Army’s Suicide Prevention Task Force, told Time Thursday morning. “The combined total [38] of both active and reserve is the highest we’ve had since 2001.” Army experts come up empty-handed when trying to account for the surge, although they are noting a shift among suicide victims. “This is the first time since 2001 where we’ve seen non-commissioned officer deaths outnumbering junior enlisted deaths,” Shahbaz says. He and other Army suicide experts have what he concedes is a “very counter-intuitive” explanation. Battleland graphics lab based on Army data They suggest this is happening as the NCOs — more likely to be married, and in the Army for the long haul, than younger troops — begin spending more time at home between deployments. “If you’re on the constant 12-month treadmill of deploy, reset, get ready to redeploy, deploy, soldiers and families don’t work hard to try to reintegrate, because they know that their soldier is going to be gone again,” Shahbaz says. “Issues like minor depression, anxiety and sleep disturbances – those things that are kind of related to post-traumatic stress – begin to surface after a service member has been home for more than a year, and start to reintegrate with their family…I liken it to a pot that’s on simmer – having that person stay back home and reintegrate with their family sometimes allows that pot to boil over.” Retired Army colonel Elspeth Ritchie, once the service’s top psychiatrist and a key warrior fighting Army suicides, fears the toll won’t abate any time soon. “One of the risk factors for suicide is getting in trouble at work,” says Ritchie, now a Battleland contributor. “As the Army downsizes, the getting in trouble may translate into more soldiers facing discharge and possible unemployment,” she says. “Another risk factor is trouble with relationships. After a decade of war, going from having a spouse away most of the time — to being at home all the time — actually may make things worse. Especially if the spouse is underemployed.” (COVER STORY: The War on Suicide?) Those fighting the battle from outside the Army remain dissatisfied in light of the latest suicide count. “Soldiers and their families are falling apart under the pressures, expectations, injuries and illnesses of years of war,” says Kim Ruocoo, who runs the suicide outreach program at the non-profit Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors. “We should expect our troops to need psychological care after all we have asked of them, yet there is still a sense that asking for help is a weak thing and should be avoided. As a result soldiers are waiting until they are very sick before they go for help and very often the response is not quick enough or comprehensive enough.” Retired general Peter Chiarelli, who until January was the Army’s No. officer and top suicide fighter, remained frustrated in a recent interview. “Our suicide rate has doubled since 2001, and it’s obvious that deployments and stress on the force plays a role in this –- there’s no doubt about it,” he says. “The doubling of our suicide rate coincided with our fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan. That’s got to be a contributor.” But it’s bigger than that, he believes. Mental-health problems have never gotten the study – and the resulting research funding – given to cancer and heart disease, he says. “We’ve under-invested in this area for so goddam long, and one of the reasons is because of the stigma associated with it,” Chiarelli says. “No one wants to admit that Uncle Al killed himself.” That’s one of the reasons Chiarelli has gone back to work leading One Mind for Research, an independent, non-profit organization bringing together health care providers, researchers, academics and the health care industry to cure brain disorders. The challenge of soldiers trained to kill turning their guns on themselves – firearms remain the method of choice for most Army suicides – has gotten the Pentagon’s attention. “This issue – suicides — is perhaps the most frustrating challenge that I’ve come across since becoming secretary of defense,” Defense Secretary Leon Panetta told the military’s 4th annual suicide-prevention conference June 22. “Despite the increased efforts, the increased attention, the trends continued to move in a troubling and tragic direction.” “This is not just an Army problem – this is a national problem,” Shahbaz says, referring to a new Centers for Disease Control report showing that nearly 37,000 Americans killed themselves in 2009. While suicide rates for both troops and their age-adjusted civilian counterparts have been comparable in past years, that’s not the case so far into 2012: the Army rate stands at 29 suicides-per-100,000, nearly 60% higher than the civilian rate of 18.5 in 2009, the most recent available. Shahbaz, like most every Pentagon expert on suicide, encourages anyone thinking of taking his or her own life to call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255; press 1 if you are in the military or in a military family. “These folks do amazing work,” he says of those who pick up the phone at the other end. “They are angels when it comes to helping soldiers and families in crisis.” (READ: U.S. Military Suicide Rate Now Double or Triple Civil War’s) Suicides have spiked since 2005, even as the war in Iraq has ended, and the conflict in Afghanistan begins to wind down. The drip-drip-drip of statistics tells the story: mental-health problems were the top reason troops were hospitalized last year, according to a May Pentagon report. Nearly 22,000 troops were hospitalized with mental disorders last year, 54% more than in 2007. Suicides, the military’s medical command noted in June, have now eclipsed motor-vehicle accidents as the leading non-combat cause of death among U.S. troops. The specific triggers for suicide vary by individual. But for those in uniform, the stresses associated with a decade at war – and the frequent deployments and family separation they entail – play a role. Yet many troops who have never deployed also are killing themselves. The Pentagon is training troops in resiliency to weather dark moods, establishing suicide hotlines, bolstering its ranks of mental-health workers on the battlefield and at home. The Army has launched a 50 million investigation into the suicide surge and how to stop it. “Our people are our most valuable resource and we are very committed to taking care of them,” Jackie Garrick, who runs the new Defense Suicide Prevention Office, told Time recently. “We just need to make sure that we’re getting that word out, and the services and the service members at all levels are fully engaged in trying to address this issue.” But, Chiarelli insists, it can’t be done without more research and resources. “We have a crisis in the military,” he says, caused by a lack of money and knowledge to deal with the mental-health challenges created by 10 years of combat. “We just don’t know enough,” he says flatly. “And until we do, we will all remain frustrated.” MORE: Why Are There So Many Military Suicides? ||||| Summary:","completion":"In July, 38 soldiers took their own lives, making it the worst month for suicides in the Army since they started recording the numbers in 2009.

Write a title for this article: (WASHINGTON)— The Supreme Court seems deeply divided over the arrangement devised by the Obama administration to spare faith-based groups from having to pay for birth control for women covered under their health plans. The court’s conservative justices sounded supportive Wednesday of the groups’ complaint that the administration’s effort violates their religious rights. The four liberal justices seem likely to vote to uphold the accommodation offered to faith-based colleges, charities and advocacy groups. A 4-4 tie would uphold four appeals court rulings in favor of the administration. But different rules would apply in parts of the country in which another appeals court has sided with the challengers. Wednesday was the sixth anniversary of President Barack Obama’s health care overhaul; the case in front of the justices was the law’s fourth Supreme Court appearance in five years. The issue this time is the arrangement the administration devised to make sure that religiously oriented groups do not have to pay for or arrange the provision of contraceptives to which they object, while ensuring that women covered under their health plans still can obtain birth control. Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Samuel Alito and Anthony Kennedy voiced sympathy for the groups’ claim that they remain complicit in providing morally objectionable contraceptives under the government’s plan. “Hijacking. It seems to me that’s an accurate description of what the government wants to do,” Roberts said. Kennedy also used that word during 90 minutes of crisp arguments and frequent interruptions by the justices. Only Justice Clarence Thomas asked no questions, but he has repeatedly sided with the health law’s challengers. Justice Sonia Sotomayor said the administration’s arrangement takes into account women who are covered by the affected plans and “have a real need for contraception.” Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer and Elena Kagan also asked questions that signaled their support for the administration. Eight justices are hearing the case, following the death of Justice Antonin Scalia last month. The challengers could find it hard, without Scalia, to attract the five votes they need to prevail. Contraception is among a range of preventive services that must be provided at no extra charge under the health care law. The administration pointed to research showing that the high cost of some methods of contraception discourages women from using them. A very effective means of birth control, the intrauterine device, can cost up to 1,000. Houses of worship and other religious institutions whose primary purpose is to spread the faith are exempt from the birth control requirement. Other faith-affiliated groups that oppose some or all contraception have to tell the government or their insurers that they object. In 2014, the justices divided 5-4, with Scalia in the majority, to allow some “closely held” businesses with religious objections to refuse to pay for contraceptives for women. That case involved the Hobby Lobby chain of craft stores and other companies that said their rights were being violated under the 1993 Religious Freedom Restoration Act. The nonprofit groups are invoking the same law in asking that the government find a way that does not involve them or their insurers if it wishes to provide birth control to women covered by their health plans. Among the challengers are Bishop David Zubik, head of the Catholic Diocese in Pittsburgh; the Little Sisters of the Poor, nuns who run more than two dozen nursing homes for impoverished seniors; evangelical and Catholic colleges in Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Texas and Washington, D.C., and the anti-abortion advocacy group Priests for Life. The groups argue that the administration already has carved out exemptions and encourages people who can’t get contraceptives through their employers to use the health care exchanges that were created by the health care law and serve millions of people. The administration contends that tens of thousands of women would be disadvantaged by a ruling for the groups. The court will consider whether the accommodation offered by the administration violates the group’s rights under the religious freedom law. Even if it does, the administration still could show that it has a “compelling interest” in the provision of contraception and that its plan is the most reasonable way, or “least restrictive means” of getting birth control to women covered by the groups’ health plans. Nationwide, eight appeals courts, including four with decisions being challenged in the current case, have sided with the administration, and one has ruled for the groups. A 4-4 outcome would leave a mess, because different rules would apply in different parts of the country. The Supreme Court takes on cases in order to lay down uniform nationwide rules.

Given the question: What is the full name of the person in whose view the operatic scores of Saint-Saëns have, in general, the strengths and weaknesses of the rest of his music? Answer the above question based on the context below: Discounting his collaboration with Dukas in the completion of Guiraud's unfinished Frédégonde, Saint-Saëns wrote twelve operas, two of which are opéras comiques. During the composer's lifetime his Henry VIII became a repertory piece; since his death only Samson et Dalila has been regularly staged, although according to Schonberg, Ascanio (1890) is considered by experts to be a much finer work. The critic Ronald Crichton writes that for all his experience and musical skill, Saint-Saëns \\"lacked the 'nose' of the theatre animal granted, for example, to Massenet who in other forms of music was his inferior\\". In a 2005 study, the musical scholar Steven Huebner contrasts the two composers: \\"Saint-Saëns obviously had no time for Massenet's histrionics\\". Saint-Saëns's biographer James Harding comments that it is regrettable that the composer did not attempt more works of a light-hearted nature, on the lines of La princesse jaune, which Harding describes as like Sullivan \\"with a light French touch\\".Although most of Saint-Saëns's operas have remained neglected, Crichton rates them as important in the history of French opera, as \\"a bridge between Meyerbeer and the serious French operas of the early 1890s\\". In his view, the operatic scores of Saint-Saëns have, in general, the strengths and weaknesses of the rest of his music – \\"lucid Mozartian transparency, greater care for form than for content ... There is a certain emotional dryness; invention is sometimes thin, but the workmanship is impeccable.\\" Stylistically, Saint-Saëns drew on a range of models. From Meyerbeer he drew the effective use of the chorus in the action of a piece; for Henry VIII he included Tudor music he had researched in London; in La princesse jaune he used an oriental pentatonic scale; from Wagner he derived the use of leitmotifs, which, like Massenet, he used sparingly.

Please answer the following question: - Food is taken into the mouth - The food is chewed - Saliva mixes with the food and starts breaking it down - The chewed food travels down the esophagus to the stomach - The stomach secretes acid - Grinds and mixes the food - The food moves to the small intestine - The small intestine uses enzymes to further break down the food - The food passes into the colon What might be the last step of the process? Answer:","completion":"The last step of the digestion process, after the food has passed through the colon, is the elimination of indigestible solid waste from the body. This final stage involves the following sub-steps: 1. Absorption of water, electrolytes, and vitamins: As the remaining undigested food matter moves through the colon (also known as the large intestine), it primarily absorbs water, electrolytes, and vitamins produced by the bacteria residing in the colon. This process helps in converting the remaining food particles into a semi-solid state, called feces. 2. Formation of feces: The feces primarily consist of indigestible food components, such as dietary fiber, dead cells shed from the lining of the gastrointestinal tract, and bacteria from the colon. During its journey through the colon, the fecal matter continues to thicken as more water is absorbed. 3. Storage in the rectum: The thickened feces enter the rectum, which is the final section of the large intestine. Here, the feces are temporarily stored until they are ready to be expelled from the body. 4. Defecation: When the rectum is full and the body senses the need to eliminate the waste, the rectal muscles send a signal to the brain. In response, the brain triggers the defecation reflex, which involves the relaxation of the internal and external anal sphincters (circular muscles surrounding the anus). These sphincters gradually open, allowing the feces to exit the body through the anus. In conclusion, the final step of the digestion process is the elimination of indigestible solid waste, which occurs through the absorption of water and other components in the colon, formation and storage of feces in the rectum, and finally, the expulsion of the fecal matter from the body through defecation. This process helps to maintain the body's overall health and wellbeing, as it rids the system of waste materials resulting from the digestion of ingested food."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Yes, the statement \\"When unprocessed data is sent to the computer with the help of input devices, the data is processed and sent to output devices.\\" contains the correct answer to \\"Where is the data from input devices sent to after being processed?\\". To elaborate, input devices are hardware components that enable users to interact with a computer system by providing raw data that needs to be processed. Some examples of input devices include keyboards, mice, scanners, and microphones. When a user interacts with any of these devices, they generate unprocessed data (also called input data) that is then sent to the computer for further processing. The unprocessed data is directed through the appropriate ports and interfaces to reach the computer's central processing unit (CPU). The CPU serves as the core of the computer system and is responsible for processing the data received from input devices. The data is processed by the CPU based on the instructions provided by the operating system and various application software. The processed data is now considered to be in a form that is more usable and interpretable by the computer system and the user. Finally, the processed data is sent to output devices to be displayed, stored, or transmitted as needed. Output devices are hardware components that convert the processed data into a form that can be easily understood by the user. Some examples of output devices include monitors, printers, speakers, and external storage devices. The processed data can be presented as visual images, text, sound, or even stored on a hard drive or external storage media. In conclusion, the data from input devices is sent to output devices after being processed by the computer system."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The G-Star Raw presentation, which took place in Berlin yesterday, saw models with outfits specially moderated to carry large knives and machetes take to the runway. G-Star, which is headquartered in Amsterdam, used Kill Bill actor Michael Madsen as one of the models, and the veteran Danish-American thespian carried 10 knives and two machetes down the catwalk, all of which were tucked into special pockets on his G-Star denim jacket. Danish-","completion":"American actor Michael Madsen, well-known for his role in Kill Bill, participated in the controversial G-Star Raw fashion show in Berlin yesterday. The show features models stylishly outfitted with machetes and large knives as part of their ensemble. This provocative event follows just hours after a similar display by German designer Philipp Plein, who shocked attendees at Milan Fashion Week with his incorporation of automatic rifles in his catwalk. Public reaction to the G-Star Raw presentation has been mixed, with some praising the show for its edgy and creative approach, while others criticize it for promoting violence and glorifying weapons in the fashion industry. Critics, in particular, are concerned that such provocative displays could send the wrong message to impressionable young people who look up to these designers and models as role models. In response to the backlash, G-Star Raw has released a statement addressing the controversy surrounding their show. The company clarified that the use of machetes and knives was intended to symbolize strength, resilience, and the power of overcoming adversity. They maintain that their show was not meant to glorify violence, but rather to showcase a creative and artistic expression of these concepts. Fashion industry insiders are now speculating whether such bold and controversial statements will become a trend within the fashion world. Some believe that these shows may inspire other designers to experiment with equally daring and provocative displays, while others hope that this will be an isolated incident and not indicative of future designer choices. Only time will tell how the industry as a whole will respond to these recent events and what impact it may have on the direction of fashion in the years to come."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Love is a realization that no one is perfect, and allows you to love someone for his or her flaws and shortcomings. Love motivates you to look for the good in a person and to encourage improvement. When you expect too much and your expectations aren't met, you feel disappointed. Avoid such disappointments by being resilient and flexible with your loved ones. On the other hand, counterfeit love concentrates too much on flaws and failures, turning them into a reason to control, berate or be unkind toward another person. Counterfeit love is often conditional on a person behaving in a certain way. Seeking perfectionism in yourself and your relationships is like chasing the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow—it's never attainable. Healthy love is about setting boundaries to protect your relationships and yourself. Healthy love begins with self-love (not self-absorption) and radiates from loving yourself. Healthy love also learns to forgive and move forward, in the realization that harboring resentment is like holding a hot coal of anger—you are the only one who gets burned. Forgiveness is a big part of loving others, as is making it clear to people where your limits lay. It's not wrong or unloving to stand up to disrespect; it's a healthy sign of self-respect and setting boundaries for others to learn from. On the other hand, counterfeit love does keep score, with a person frequently returning to occasions when he or she felt you hurt or upset his or her feelings. This scorekeeping can reach back years in the relationships of some people, with bitterness and resentment the only thing keeping people close. Such unhealthy love never learns forgiveness and results in \\"lovers\\" with little to no self-esteem. Love never fails, even you feel like it has. Breakups (whether it's a romantic, workplace, business, friendship, etc.) can really hurt. Yet, love is worth the effort, even in those times when loss hurts you. For, as Alfred Lord Tennyson put it, Tis better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all. Love is therefore also about experience. You cannot shut yourself off from the rest of the world, no matter how afraid you are of loss. By opening yourself up to the amazing possibilities of love, you open yourself up to all the beauty and wonder of the world too. Sometimes it won't work but on the law of averages, you'll experience more love than loss, especially if you don't tie down your notion of love to simple romantic love but embrace love as a way of being and thinking in all walks of your life. What is a summary?","completion":"Love, often referred to as \\"blind,\\" represents acceptance of a person's imperfections while promoting growth. Healthy love is grounded in self-love, setting boundaries, and forgiveness, while counterfeit love is conditional and focuses on the negative aspects of a person. In order to truly appreciate love and its potential for growth, one must embrace it as an encompassing mindset for all aspects of life, understanding that experiencing love and loss is a part of the journey."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Information: - Christian democracy is a political ideology which emerged in nineteenth-century Europe under the influence of conservatism and Catholic social teaching, as well as Neo-Calvinism. It was originally conceived as a combination of traditional Catholic beliefs and modern democratic ideas, and it grew to incorporate the social teaching of other Christian denominations, such as the Lutheran Church and the Reformed Church. After World War II, the Protestant and Catholic movements of the Social Gospel and Neo-Thomism, respectively, played a role in shaping Christian democracy. Christian democracy continues to be influential in Europe and Latin America, although it is present in other parts of the world too. - The Centrist Democrat International is Christian Democrat political international. Until 2001 it was known as the Christian Democrat International (CDI) and before that the \\"Christian Democrat and People's Parties International\\" (until 1999) (this earlier name is, since October 2000, still sometimes used colloquially). It was formed in 1961 in Santiago, Chile as the \\"Christian Democrat World Union\\", building on the legacy of other Christian Democrat internationals who tried to create a Christian-inspired third way alternative to the socialist internationals; in 1982 it was renamed for the first time Christian Democrat International. The name officially changed due to the participation of groups of various faiths. It is the global international political group dedicated to the promotion of Christian democracy. Although it gathers parties from around the globe, its members are drawn principally from Europe and Latin America. Some of them are also members of the International Democrat Union (IDU), although the CDI is closer to the political centre and more communitarian than the IDU. - A European political party (formally, a political party at European level; informally a Europarty) is a type of political party organisation operating transnationally in Europe and in the institutions of the European Union. They are regulated and funded by the European Union and are usually made up of national parties, not individuals. Europarties have the exclusive right to campaign during the European elections and express themselves within the European Parliament by their affiliated political groups and their MEPs. Europarties, through coordination meetings with their affiliated heads of state and government, influence the decision-making process of the European Council. Europarties also work closely and co-ordinate with their affiliated members of the European Commission and, according to the Lisbon Treaty the Europarty that wins the European elections has the right to nominate to the European Council its candidate for President of the European Commission. - The Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) is a global inter-parliamentary institution established in 1889 by Frédéric Passy (France) and William Randal Cremer (United Kingdom). It was the first permanent forum for political multilateral negotiations. Initially, the organization was for individual parliamentarians, but has since transformed into an international organization of the parliaments of sovereign states. The national parliaments of 170 countries are members of the IPU, and 11 regional parliamentary assemblies are associate members. The IPU has permanent observer status at the United Nations General Assembly and general consultative status with the Economic and Social Council. - Santiago de Chile is the capital and largest city of Chile. It is also the center of its largest conurbation. Santiago is located in the country's central valley, at an elevation of above mean sea level. - The European People's Party (EPP) is a European political party. A transnational organisation, it is composed of other political parties, not individuals. Founded by primarily Christian democratic parties in 1976, it has since broadened its membership to include liberal-conservative parties and parties with other centre-right political perspectives. - Lorenzo Cesa (born 16 August 1951 in Arcinazzo Romano, Rome) is an Italian politician, and was elected to the Italian Chamber of Deputies in the 2006 General election representing the Union of Christian and Centre Democrats. He was elected on October 27, 2005 as new party leader, replacing resigning secretary Marco Follini. - The Union of the Centre ( Italian : Unione di Centro , UdC ) is a Christian democratic political party in Italy .

Since then , the party 's official name was neglected in favour of \`\` Union of the Centre '' and , since most of the UdC member parties have joined the UDC too , the UDC and the UdC started to overlap almost completely to the point that they are now undistinguishable . The UDC was part of the Pole / House of Freedoms from its establishment through 2008 . Later it has been affiliated neither to the centre - right nor the centre - left at the national level . Despite this , the party takes part in several regional , provincial and municipal governments with Forza Italia , the largest force of the Italian centre - right ( notably in Campania and Calabria ) , but recently formed alliances also with the centre - left Democratic Party in other regions ( notably in Marche ) and at the very local level . In the 2013 general election the UdC was part of With Monti for Italy , the coalition formed around Mario Monti 's Civic Choice .

Answer the following question: WASHINGTON — In 2004, Desmond Meade, while serving a 15-year prison sentence for a drug offense in Florida, got a break. An appeals court returned his conviction to the original trial bench, allowing him to plead guilty to a lesser charge and get out of prison in three years, most of which he had already served. But his freedom came with a price, something that didn’t quite register with him at the time: as part of his plea agreement with prosecutors, Meade agreed to give up his civil rights: the right to vote, to serve on a jury and to run for office. “At the time, when I first accepted the plea deal, I didn’t understand the consequences,” Meade says. Fourteen years and a pair of college and law degrees later, Meade, now 50, still can’t vote; his application to regain his civil rights was rejected in 2011. The reason: a new Florida law that requires felons like him to wait for seven years before they could apply for rights restoration. Home to nearly a quarter of the nation's disenfranchised felons, Florida has become a battleground in a national debate over felony disenfranchisement laws. With lawmakers deeply divided over the issue, Meade says he wants the state’s voters to change the system when they head to the polls on Nov. 6. He’s promoting a ballot initiative that would amend the state's constitution, restoring the voting rights of all felons in Florida (except those convicted of murder and sexual assault) after they’ve completed the terms of their sentence. The measure enjoys broad voter support. A Quinnipiac University poll conducted in February showed that 67 percent of Floridians were in favor of restoring the voting rights of felons other than those convicted of murder and sexual assault. Another poll showed support at 71 percent. “We’re going to change the system,” Meade says confidently. “What we’re doing is taking the power out of the hands of politicians and we’re allowing the citizens of the state of Florida to decide whether or not folks should have a second chance, to be able to vote.” Question: Why did Meade lose his civil rights? === The answer to the above question is Pick from: --politicians stripped him of his civil rights.; --he agreed to give them up to get out of prison earlier.; --not enough information; --he became a convicted felon.; Answer:","completion":"Meade lost his civil rights because he agreed to give them up as part of a plea agreement with prosecutors in order to get out of prison earlier.

The first sentence mentions that, since 1993, the PNP (People's National Party) has been in power under the leadership of Prime Minister Percival Patterson. The use of the phrase \\"once again\\" in the first sentence indicates that the PNP had been in power prior to 1993 with another leader or at a different time. The second sentence states that \\"The PNP has been in power many times throughout its long history,\\" which can be inferred from the information provided in the first sentence. The first sentence implies that the PNP has had a notable past, with multiple instances where they've held power in the government. This claim is supported by the fact that the PNP has once again gained power, suggesting a pattern of political influence in their history. In summary, the second sentence is entailed by the first sentence, as the first sentence provides information about the PNP's recurring role in power since 1993, indicating their significant presence in government throughout their history.

If not, let me know by writing \\"Not answerable\\". Plot title: Syriana Movie plot: U.S. energy giant Connex is losing control of key Middle East oil fields in a kingdom ruled by the al-Subaai family. The emirate's foreign minister, Prince Nasir (Alexander Siddig), has granted natural gas drilling rights to a Chinese company, greatly upsetting the U.S. oil industry and government. To compensate for its decreased production capacity, Connex initiates a shady merger with Killen, a smaller oil company that recently won the drilling rights to key petroleum fields in Kazakhstan. Connex-Killen ranks as the world's twenty-third largest economy, and antitrust regulators at the U.S. Justice Department (DOJ) have misgivings. A Washington, D.C.-based law firm headed by Dean Whiting (Christopher Plummer) is hired to smooth the way for the merger. Bennett Holiday (Jeffrey Wright) is assigned to promote the impression of due diligence to the DOJ, deflecting any allegations of corruption. Emir storyline[edit] Bryan Woodman (Matt Damon) is an energy analyst based in Geneva, Switzerland. Woodman's supervisor directs him to attend a private party hosted by the emir at his estate in Marbella, Spain, to offer his company's services. The emir's illness during the party prevents Woodman from speaking directly with him while, at the same time, the emir's younger son, Prince Meshal Al-Subaai (Akbar Kurtha), shows the estate's many rooms and areas to Chinese oil executives via remote-controlled cameras. No one notices that a crack in one of the swimming pool area's underwater lights has electrified the water. Just as Woodman and all the other guests are brought to the pool area, Woodman's son jumps into the pool and is electrocuted. In reparation and out of sympathy for the loss of his son, Prince Nasir, the emir's older son, grants Woodman's company oil interests worth US75 million, and Woodman, though initially insulted by the offer, gradually becomes his economic advisor. Prince Nasir is dedicated to the idea of progressive reform and understands that oil dependency is not sustainable in the long term; Nasir...

Read this and answer the question In addition to a spoken standard and a closely related written standard, Czech has several regional dialects primarily used in rural areas by speakers less proficient in other dialects or standard Czech. During the second half of the twentieth century, Czech dialect use began to weaken. By the early 1990s dialect use was stigmatized, associated with the shrinking lower class and used in literature or other media for comedic effect. Increased travel and media availability to dialect-speaking populations has encouraged them to shift to (or add to their own dialect) standard Czech. Although Czech has received considerable scholarly interest for a Slavic language, this interest has focused primarily on modern standard Czech and ancient texts rather than dialects.

The 59-year-old, who killed himself at his family's burial plot on Friday, won the Rochester-area district's GOP primary with a vote of around 58% to 41% for Honeoye Falls Mayor Richard Milne, Politico reports. It will now be up to party leaders in the district—who did not withdraw their endorsement after Nojay's death—to choose a candidate to be on the ballot, the Democrat & Chronicle reports. Before the primary, local Republican leaders said voting for Nojay was a good way to honor his memory. Milne said they just wanted to get their own candidate elected. Politico notes that Milne is unlikely to be the choice of the local GOP both because of his moderate positions and the fact that he just lost an election to a dead man. The Guardian reports that Nojay—who had been accused of embezzling 1.8 million from a legal client, among other things—is the latest in a long line of dead American politicians to win elections, including Hawaii's Rep. Patsy Mink, a Democrat who was re-elected to the House more than a month after she died of pneumonia in 2002.

By Tara Brady PUBLISHED: 13:19 EST, 28 February 2013 | UPDATED: 13:24 EST, 28 February 2013 A drug addict who beheaded a British grandmother in a frenzied knife attack on the holiday island of Tenerife has been sentenced to 20 years in a secure psychiatric unit. Homeless Bulgarian Deyan Deyanov, 29, was convicted of murder by a jury of nine at the Provincial Court in Santa Cruz de Tenerife on Friday. He repeatedly stabbed and beheaded Jennifer Mills-Westley, 60, while she was shopping in the popular resort of Los Cristianos in the Canary Islands, Spain, on May 13 2011. Paranoid: Deyanov is a paranoid schizophrenic who said he was an angel of","completion":"Jesus Christ sent to create a new Jerusalem. He previously had numerous encounters with mental health officials and law enforcement, both in his home country of Bulgaria and in Spain. He had been released from the hospital only days before the tragic incident on account of his increasingly erratic behavior. During his trial, jurors listened in horror as details of the gruesome attack were recounted. Deyanov had followed Mills-Westley into the store, attacking her suddenly and without provocation. It is believed his paranoid schizophrenia was untreated at the time, causing delusions and hallucinations that ultimately led him to commit this horrific crime. The jury was made aware of Deyanov's psychiatric history, his belief that he was an angel of Jesus Christ, and that voices in his head commanded him to carry out the brutal act. The defense argued that Deyanov was criminally insane and not responsible for his actions due to his severe mental illness. Psychiatric evaluations presented to the court confirmed the diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia. Forensic psychiatrists testified that Deyanov was suffering from a severe episode of psychosis at the time of the murder, and that his mental state had worsened after he had been released from hospital care, primarily due to lack of prescribed medication and continued drug abuse. Despite the defenses' arguments and revelations about Deyanov's mental health, the jury was unanimous in its decision, and the judge accepted their verdict. The Judge stated, \\"although it's apparent that Deyanov struggles with severe mental illness, it does not exempt him from the consequences of his actions. This case is as tragic as it is horrifying, and it is the court's duty to ensure such a heinous crime does not occur again.\\" Deyanov was thus sentenced to 20 years in a secure psychiatric unit. This outcome has not only been considered a prison sentence but also a means to provide Deyanov with the help and medication he evidently requires to manage his mental condition. Reaction to the sentencing varies among the public. Some were relieved and stated that justice had been served, while others expressed concern about the role of mental health in crime and punishment and the need for better resources to help those with severe mental illnesses. The family of Mills-Westley has expressed gratitude to the court for their decision. In the days following the verdict, they released a statement saying they hope this tragic event can lead to better understanding and treatment of serious mental health conditions. While the sentencing and public reaction bring some closure to this tragic case, they also highlight the ongoing debate about mental health and justice. Ongoing questions remain about how best to handle cases like this, where serious mental illness intertwines with horrific crime. This case is a harsh reminder of the vital importance of mental health services and the essential role society plays in supporting those most vulnerable."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Paragraph: Neighborhood Legal Services, which provides free legal services to the poor, has expanded into the San Gabriel and Pomona valleys, areas with large Asian populations, many of whom speak limited or no English. Language is their biggest obstacle, but the Asian communities' cultural isolation and service providers' lack of cultural expertise also play a part, said NLS executive director Neal Dubovitz. And with 13 percent to 15 percent of the Asian population in the U.S. living below the poverty line, NLS services are badly needed, Dubovitz said. \\"Although it is a significant part of the poverty population, Asians historically have not been able to participate in the services and programs available to the poor,\\" he said. From simple telephone advice to complete legal representation in court, the agency provides free consumer, health, family, immigration, housing, public benefits and labor legal services to people who earn under 1,380 per month. Legal service providers have long served large Latino populations, who have cultural diversity but share a common language. \\"I remember the days when there were only a handful of people in the legal offices who spoke Spanish,\\" Dudovitz said. \\"Now Spanish and English are interchangeable. Our goal is to have that for the major Asian languages as well.\\" Before the expansion, only a few NLS lawyers spoke Asian languages, said attorney Rebecca Yee, who was hired by NLS in April 2002 to design and head the project. \\"Now we have people speaking Cantonese, Mandarin, Thai, Khmer (from Cambodia), Korean, Vietnamese, Japanese and Tagalog,\\" Yee said. One of the 13 attorneys hired to work with the program is Irene Mak, a family law attorney who speaks Cantonese, Mandarin and Thai. Mak was a partner at a private law firm before she went to work for NLS two years ago, earning up to 20,000 less a year working on domestic violence cases. \\"The job is more satisfying than the money,\\" said Mak, who grew up in Hong Kong and Thailand before coming to the United States. \\"I could use my language skills and wanted to give back to the Asian community.\\" NLS expanded when Legal Services Corp., the federal agency that funds providers of free legal services nationwide, reduced the number of grantees in the Los Angeles area from five to three, Dudovitz said.

Amyntas III was forced to flee his kingdom in either 393 or 383 BC (based on conflicting accounts), owing to a massive invasion by the Illyrian Dardani led by Bardylis. The pretender to the throne Argaeus ruled in his absence, yet Amyntas III eventually returned to his kingdom with the aid of Thessalian allies. Amyntas III was also nearly overthrown by the forces of the Chalcidian city of Olynthos, but with the aid of Teleutias, brother of the Spartan king Agesilaus II, the Macedonians forced Olynthos to surrender and dissolve their Chalcidian League in 379 BC.Alexander II (r. 370 – 368 BC), son of Eurydice I and Amyntas III, succeeded his father and immediately invaded Thessaly to wage war against the tagus (supreme Thessalian military leader) Alexander of Pherae, capturing the city of Larissa. The Thessalians, desiring to remove both Alexander II and Alexander of Pherae as their overlords, appealed to Pelopidas of Thebes for aid; he succeeded in recapturing Larissa and, in the peace agreement arranged with Macedonia, received aristocratic hostages including Alexander II's brother and future king Philip II (r. 359–336 BC– ).

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer this question: If you have to associate one person with the 'Kuomintang Party' between 1929 and 1948, who would it be?","completion":"If one has to associate a single person with the Kuomintang Party (KMT) between 1929 and 1948, it would definitely be Chiang Kai-shek. Chiang Kai-shek, also known as Jiang Jieshi, was a prominent nationalist and military leader who played a significant role in the Chinese Revolution and later in the Chinese Civil War, as well as in the Republic of China (ROC) government. Chiang Kai-shek succeeded Sun Yat-sen, the founder of the KMT, after Sun's death in 1925. As the leader of the Kuomintang Party, Chiang Kai-shek played a critical role in the KMT's formation, development, and its strategies during this pivotal 1929-1948 period. Some of the significant events and aspects of his leadership during that time include: 1. Northern Expedition (1926-1928): Chiang Kai-shek led the Northern Expedition, a military campaign aimed at unifying China by defeating the regional warlords and the Beiyang government. This expedition increased the influence and control of the KMT across the vast majority of China. 2. Nanjing Decade (1927-1937): Chiang Kai-shek stabilized and consolidated the Nationalist government in Nanjing. This period marked an era of relative stability, as Chiang attempted to modernize China’s economy, infrastructure, and military by implementing socio-political reforms. 3. Anti-communist purges and the Chinese Civil War (1927-1936; 1945-1949): Chiang Kai-shek carried out a series of campaigns to suppress the Communist Party of China (CPC) and launched the bloody White Terror campaign. On multiple occasions, Chiang’s National Revolutionary Army clashed with the Red Army led by Mao Zedong, leading to the Chinese Civil War. 4. Warlord Pacification Campaigns (1927-1935): Parallel to the campaign against the communists, Chiang undertook expeditions to eliminate regional warlords who were still controlling parts of China and posing threats to the KMT's authority. These efforts further consolidated Chiang Kai-shek's grip on power. 5. Second Sino-Japanese War (1937-1945): Chiang Kai-shek led the Chinese resistance against the Japanese invasion during World War II. He formed the Second United Front, briefly joining forces with the communists to resist the common enemy. As the leader of the Republic of China and the KMT, he played a central role in securing international allies, including the United States. Chiang Kai-shek's adherence to the visionary Three Principles of the People – nationalism, democracy, and the people's livelihood – further underscores his importance within the Kuomintang Party during this period. Despite facing several challenges, Chiang Kai-shek's determination and leadership immensely shaped the KMT's political and military strategies between 1929 and 1948."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is a goal: How to introduce a fish to its aquarium How would you accomplish this goal?","completion":"To accomplish the goal of introducing a fish to its aquarium, I would follow these steps: Step 1: Prepare the aquarium Before introducing the fish, ensure the aquarium is properly set up. This includes placing the tank in a suitable location, adding the substrate, water, decorations, and filtering equipment. Ensure the environment is appropriate for the specific type of fish, including the water temperature, pH, and hardness. Allow the tank to cycle for at least a week to establish a healthy biological balance before introducing the fish. Step 2: Acclimate the fish to the tank temperature Place the closed bag or container with the fish and its original water in the aquarium, allowing it to float for about 20 minutes. This will allow the water temperature inside the bag to slowly equalize with the tank temperature, reducing the risk of temperature shock for the fish. Step 3: Acclimate the fish to the tank water chemistry Slowly introduce a small amount of aquarium water into the bag or container with the fish, every 5 minutes for at least 20-30 minutes. This will acclimate the fish to the new water chemistry, reducing the risk of osmotic shock or changes in pH, hardness and other chemical parameters affecting the fish. Step 4: Gently release the fish into the tank Using a net, carefully scoop the fish out of the bag or container and release it into the aquarium. Avoid pouring the water from the bag into the tank, as it may contain waste or contaminants that could harm the aquarium's ecosystem. Dispose of the water from the bag or container safely. Step 5: Observe and monitor the fish Once the fish has been released, observe it for any signs of stress or illness, such as rapid breathing, loss of color, or erratic swimming patterns. Ensure that it is adjusting well to its new environment, and monitor it daily. In case of any abnormal behavior, consult a professional or specialized fish forums for advice. Step 6: Allow the fish to acclimate to its new environment Allow the fish to explore its new environment without disturbance and minimize stress. Do not feed the fish for the first 24 hours, as it may not eat due to stress, and uneaten food can pollute the water. After 24 hours, start feeding the fish as per its dietary requirements, using high-quality fish food. By following these steps, I can introduce a fish to its aquarium in a safe and healthy manner, ensuring the fish adapts well to its new home."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please write a short summary for the following article: NICARAGUA'S ODD CELLMATES REFLECT BATTLE FOR MINDS MANAGUA, Nicaragua, Nov. 10— In a former industrial park outside Managua, where large warehouses have been turned into improvised prisons, three of Nicaragua's leading businessmen and a score of prominent Communists are sharing a clean but overcrowded cell. They are awakened at 5 A.M., given tortillas, rice and beans three times a day and allowed to wash in a fenced-in patio in the sun each morning. But they have many hours to discuss their philosophical differences and their common fate. The three businessmen have begun serving seven-month prison terms for signing a letter last month describing the country's Sandinist rulers as ''Marxist-Leninists,'' while the Communist leaders are facing three years' imprisonment for complaining that the regime has surrendered to capitalism. Both groups are accused of sabotaging Nicaragua's fragile economy through agitation, the businessmen in the private sector and the Communists among the workers. Yet both groups insist they still support the two-year-old revolution, though not as it is being carried out by the Sandinists. Businessmen Refuse to Invest At the heart of the political crisis here is the question of what ideological direction the revolution will eventually take. The private sector and conservative opposition parties are convinced that the Sandinists are Marxist-Leninists intent on importing a Cuban model of Communism. Even though 60 percent of the economy remains in private hands, businessmen refuse to invest for fear of losing all. The small but influential Nicaraguan Communist Party, on the other hand, argues that the Sandinist revolution is following a path of state capitalism instead of building ''popular power'' along strict Marxist-Leninist lines. And it has begun to mobilize industrial workers to protest against wage controls and the ban on strikes. The Sandinists insist that their goal is still to carry out a profound social revolution without eliminating political pluralism and a mixed economy, but their critics on the left and right doubt this will be possible. In practice, the guerrillas-turned-rulers have resisted the extreme left's demands for stronger measures against the private sector, but their radical pronouncements have nevertheless kept alive the fears of conservatives. Relations With U.S. Tense At a closed-door meeting in late August, for example, Defense Minister Humberto Ortega Saavedra told army officers that ''Marxist-Leninism is the scientific doctrine that guides our revolution.'' This and similar phrases were deleted before the text was distributed, but both versions of the speech circulated widely, further undermining the confidence of businessmen. In private, top Sandinists concede that their main instrument of analysis is Marxism, but they stress that they are not adopting Soviet, Chinese, Albanian or even Cuban models and they angrily denounce the ''irresponsibility of ultraleftists.'' The Sandinists' close ties with Cuba and their open solidarity with revolutionary movements in El Salvador and Guatemala have also brought tensions to their relations with the Reagan Administration, which earlier this year cut off economic aid after charges that Nicaragua had shipped arms to Salvadoran guerrillas. But independent analysts believe that the success or failure of the revolution will be determined at home, specifically by the Sandinists' ability to reverse the current trend toward polarization and rebuild something of the alliance of businessmen, democrats and revolutionaries that toppled Gen. Anstasio Somoza Debayle in July 1979. 'Final Effort' Is Urged Now, once again, conservatives and Sandinists are trying to work out their differences. But because of the growing social cost of the economic slump and the mounting hostility of the Reagan Administration, both sides also believe this may be their last chance to reach an understanding. ''We have to make a final effort to see if anything can be done,'' said Alfonso Robelo Callejas, Nicaragua's principal opposition leader, ''If we don't sort out this mess, both us and the Sandinists will be swept away and some third force will decide things.'' ''We're willing to make profound concessions to insure national unity for a long time,'' said Sergio Ramirez Mercado, a member of the three-man junta. ''But we're not going to do so from a position of weakness. They will also have to be flexible so we can get on with rebuilding the economy.'' The basic complaint of conservatives, consisting of the private sector, opposition parties, the Roman Catholic hierarchy and the daily newspaper La Prensa, is that the Sandinists have not lived up to their promise to hold early elections and have instead seized control of the army, the police and the Government. Conservatives also charge the regime with eroding political pluralism by limiting the opposition's right to hold rallies and with undermining the mixed economy by decreeing ''arbitrary'' confiscations of private factories and farms. The Sandinists, on the other hand, have argued that elections were postponed until 1985 to allow time for reconstruction after the ravages of the 1979 civil war and they insist that opposition parties are free to organize, though not campaign. But they also assert that the leaders of the business community are more interested in playing politics than reviving the economy, adding that while 80 percent of credit and foreign exchange has been channeled to the private sector, many businessmen have decapitalized their companies and sent money out of the country. Spending Cuts Ordered In declaring a one-year economic emergency last September, the Government acknowledged many of its own mistakes and ordered a cut in public expenditure. But it also tightened foreign exchange controls, banned strikes and seizures of farms and factories and made it a crime to publish ''false news'' damaging to the economy. Then, on Oct. 19, the Superior Council of Private Enterprise wrote a letter charging the regime with following ''a plan to transform this revolution into a Marxist-Leninist adventure that will only bring more bloodshed and suffering to our people.'' The following night, four council members were arrested, although one was released after 10 days because he had not signed the letter. Four other signers were either abroad or in hiding, but the president of the council, Enrique Dreyfus, and two directors, Gilberto Cuadra and Benjamin Lanza, were tried and sentenced. At the same time, Sandinist policemen began rounding up members of the Communist Party, including its secretary general, Eli Altamirano, whose agitation among trade unions was considered by the regime to be even more dangerous than the business group's protests. So far, about 100 Communists have been arrested. While the detention of the Communists was largely ignored outside Nicaragua, however, protests over the arrest of the businessmen poured in from abroad. ''It was the price we had to pay to reassert our authority,'' a Sandinist commander said, ''but we know that it helped our enemies and embarrassed our friends abroad.'' Not surprisingly, the release of the three council leaders is one of the main demands of the opposition in the coming negotiations with the regime. ''We won't free them as a prior condition for a dialogue,'' Mr. Ramirez, the junta member, said, ''but we don't mind showing our good will by ordering their release once the opposition has also shown its good will.'' Illustrations: photo of Pedro Joaquin Chamorro","completion":"In Nicaragua, an odd mix of cellmates in a former industrial park-turned-prison highlights the ideological struggle the younger nation went through during its revolution. Businessmen and communist leaders found themselves behind bars due to their opposition to the Sandinista government's approach to the revolution: the former were accused of trying to destabilize the country by labeling the ruling party as Marxist-Leninists; meanwhile, the latter were charged with the same for accusing the regime of leaning towards capitalism. The situation represented the cleavage in Nicaraguan society at the time, as suspicions about the Sandinistas' intentions extended across the political spectrum. The Nicaraguan Communist Party, backed by the private sector and conservative opposition, criticized the Sandinist revolution as sidelining Marxist-Leninist principles in favor of a state-capitalist structure, while at the same time, economic investments from the private sector were faltering due to concerns about the Sandinistas imposing a Cuban-style communist model without political pluralism. The nation's future, therefore, relied on the Sandinistas' ability to temper the polarization and reestablish some semblance of the alliance that brought down General Anstasio Somoza Debayle in 1979. The Sandinistas, however, insisted their social revolution sought to maintain political pluralism and a mixed economy, stressing that they were not adopting communist models from other nations. Tensions with the US further complicated matters, as close ties with Cuba and revolutionary movements in nearby El Salvador and Guatemala alarmed the Reagan Administration, ultimately leading to the cut-off of economic aid while the Sandinistas failed to ease the worries of conservatives domestically."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Information: - A mountain range (also mountain barrier, belt, or system) is a geographic area containing numerous geologically related mountains. A mountain system or system of mountain ranges, sometimes is used to combine several geological features that are geographically (regionally) related. On Earth, most significant mountain ranges are the result of plate tectonics, though mountain ranges are formed by a range of processes, are found on many planetary mass objects in the Solar System and are likely a feature of most terrestrial planets. - A steam locomotive is a railway locomotive that produces its pulling power through a steam engine. These locomotives are fueled by burning combustible materialusually coal/coke, wood, or oilto produce steam in a boiler. The steam moves reciprocating pistons which are mechanically connected to the locomotive's main wheels (drivers). Both fuel and water supplies are carried with the locomotive, either on the locomotive itself or in wagons (tenders) pulled behind. The first steam locomotive, made by Richard Trevithick, first operated on 21 February 1804, three years after the road locomotive he made in 1801. The first practical steam locomotive was built in 1812-13 by John Blenkinsop. - Mason is a city in southwestern Warren County, Ohio, United States, approximately from downtown Cincinnati. As of the 2010 census, Mason's population was 30,712. - Adventure Express is a Mine Train roller coaster located at Kings Island amusement park that opened in 1991 . The ride is located in the Oktoberfest section of Kings Island near Outer Hank 's and the SlingShot . The ride is considered a mine train and has the typical lap bar designed trains , abrupt turns and does not feature inversions . Adventure Express is dedicated to Robert Rinkel , a head of maintenance who died prior to the opening of the coaster . The park placed a plaque dedicating the ride to him on a stone by the entrance to the ride . - A roller coaster is an amusement ride developed for amusement parks and modern theme parks. LaMarcus Adna Thompson obtained a patent regarding roller coasters on January 20, 1885, which were made out of wood, but this patent is considerably later than the \\"Russian mountains\\" described below. In essence a specialized railroad system, a roller coaster consists of a track that rises in designed patterns, sometimes with one or more \\"inversions\\" (such as vertical loops) that briefly turn the rider upside down. The track does not necessarily have to be a complete circuit, as shuttle roller coasters demonstrate. Most roller coasters have multiple cars in which passengers sit and are restrained. Two or more cars hooked together are called a train. Some roller coasters, notably wild mouse roller coasters, run with single cars. - The Ohio River, which streams westward from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, to Cairo, Illinois, is the largest tributary, by volume, of the Mississippi River in the United States. At the confluence, the Ohio is considerably bigger than the Mississippi (Ohio at Cairo: 281,500 cu ft/s (7,960 m/s); Mississippi at Thebes: 208,200 cu ft/s (5,897 m/s)) and, thus, is hydrologically the main stream of the whole river system, including the Allegheny River further upstream. - Cedar Fair, L.P., doing business as the Cedar Fair Entertainment Company, is a publicly traded partnership headquartered at its Cedar Point amusement park in Sandusky, Ohio. The company owns and operates eleven amusement parks, two outdoor water parks, one indoor water park, and five hotels. Cedar Fair also manages Gilroy Gardens under contract with the city of Gilroy, California. - Kings Island is a amusement park located northeast of Cincinnati in Mason, Ohio. Owned and operated by Cedar Fair, the park first opened in 1972 by the Taft Broadcasting Company in an effort to move and expand Coney Island, a popular resort destination along the banks of the Ohio River that was prone to frequent flooding. After more than 275 million in capital investments, the park features over 80 rides, shows and attractions including fourteen roller coasters and a water park. - A water park or waterpark is an amusement park that features water play areas, such as swimming pools, water slides, splash pads, spraygrounds (water playgrounds), lazy rivers, or other recreational bathing, swimming, and barefooting environments. Water parks in more current states of development may also be equipped with some type of artificial surfing or bodyboarding environment such as a wave pool or FlowRider. - A mine train roller coaster is a steel roller coaster whose trains often depict a set of mine carts, with the forward-most car or portions of it sometimes resembling a small steam locomotive. Most mine train roller coasters are themed in the style of a mine, a Western scene, or simply a mountain range. - An amusement park (sometimes referred to as a funfair) or theme park is a group of entertainment attractions, rides, and other events in a location for the enjoyment of large numbers of people. Amusement parks have a fixed location, as opposed to travelling funfairs and traveling carnivals, and are more elaborate than simple city parks or playgrounds, usually providing attractions meant to cater specifically to certain age groups, as well as some that are aimed towards all ages. Theme parks, a specific type of amusement park, are usually much more intricately themed to a certain subject or group of subjects than normal amusement parks. - Cincinnati is a city in the U.S. state of Ohio that serves as county seat of Hamilton County. Settled in 1788, the city is located on the north side of the confluence of the Licking with the Ohio River.

Build a movie plot around this: In the movie, the Longnecks believe they have stopped the sun from falling, what actually happened? Eclipse A:","completion":"Title: Shadows of the Longnecks Genre: Adventure, Fantasy, Drama Plot: In the mystical land of Longneck, a small community of creatures called the Longnecks lived peacefully for centuries. They worshipped the Sun, which they believed was the source of their strength, prosperity, and happiness. The Longnecks possessed long necks, enabling them to reach the highest branches for food, and their world revolved around the balance between the Sun and the Moon, the eternal dance of light and darkness. The Longnecks were led by their wise and compassionate elder, Atena, who passed down generations of wisdom and the sacred duty of maintaining the harmonious relationship between the Sun and Moon. The Longneck's false belief that the sun is about to fall and extinguish life as they know it has affected their very lives and abilities, and they prepare for an uncertain future. One day, Eli, a young, inquisitive Longneck, stumbles upon an ancient prophecy that mentions a rare phenomenon called an 'eclipse,' where the Moon temporarily covers the Sun, causing the sky to darken for a short period. Eli learns that the prophecy foretells the arrival of this event in the near future, following which the balance in Longneck will be disrupted. With the possibility of darkness looming, Eli embarks on a journey to decipher the prophecy's meaning and save Longneck from potential doom. Filled with curiosity and determination, Eli is accompanied by his friends Doran, a timid but resourceful Longneck, and Cora, a brave and fiercely loyal character who always stands up for her friends. Together, the trio explores the mysteries of their land and its legends as they seek to understand the eclipse and its implications. As they venture further into the unknown, the trio encounters various challenges, from treacherous landscapes reminiscent of the perils of their darkening world to mysterious, possibly malevolent creatures who have been influenced by the imbalance of the Sun and the Moon. They decipher clues from the ancient prophecy and discover vital information about the eclipse, such as the critical alignment of the celestial bodies and the importance of balance and unity in restoring their world to its natural state. Upon reaching the Temple of the Moon, the group finds an artifact called the Sunstone, which is said to have the power to control and manipulate the movements of celestial bodies and the balance of light and darkness. However, the artifact is guarded by a serpentine, shadow-like creature named Erebus, who attempts to use the stone to bring eternal darkness to Longneck. In a thrilling climax, Eli, Doran, and Cora band together and use their knowledge of the eclipse to outsmart and defeat Erebus, saving their world from the encroaching darkness. As the prophecy's fulfillment becomes imminent, the Longnecks gather to witness the eclipse, and with the help of the Sunstone, they restore the balance between the Sun and the Moon, thus preventing the Sun from falling. As the world returns to its vibrant colors and harmonious state, Eli becomes a hero in the eyes of the Longnecks and begins a new era of prosperity, unity, and understanding. The Longnecks finally recognize the value of their connection to the Moon and its synergy with the Sun, setting the foundation for a harmonious and peaceful coexistence with the natural forces. The eclipse, once a harbinger of doom, now symbolizes the celebration of life, light, and balance as Longneck continues to thrive.

Would \\"By contrast, for a thermodynamically closed system (i.e., one which is closed to exchanges of matter, but open to exchanges of non-material energy, such as heat and work, with the surroundings) mass is (usually) only approximately conserved.\\" be a reasonable answer?","completion":"The law of conservation of matter has a few important implications for humans: 1. It helps us understand chemical reactions: Since matter is neither created nor destroyed, we can predict the outcome of chemical reactions by balancing the input reactants with the output products. 2. It influences our understanding of the environment and ecosystem: The conservation of matter reminds us that waste materials we produce do not disappear; they transform into different substances, which may have negative environmental effects. Examples include pollution, resource management, and recycling. 3. It impacts human energy consumption: The conservation of matter affects the way we harness, convert or store energy, such as in power plants and batteries. Energy changes from one form to another, while matter remains constant. Your provided statement: \\"By contrast, for a thermodynamically closed system (i.e., one which is closed to exchanges of matter, but open to exchanges of non-material energy, such as heat and work, with the surroundings) mass is (usually) only approximately conserved\\" is partially correct. The principle of mass conservation generally holds true for closed systems. However, certain nuclear reactions can convert mass into energy, causing a minor decrease in mass. This is explained by the famous equation E=mc², which states that mass can be converted into energy and vice versa. Nonetheless, for most practical situations that humans encounter, the law of conservation of matter holds true even in closed systems where energy exchange is allowed."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: how many wives did henry the 8th have I found the following answer on Google: Yet he remained a believer in core Catholic theological teachings, even after his excommunication from the Roman Catholic Church. Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. A:","completion":"No, the information given does not correctly answer the question asked. The question asked is about the number of wives King Henry VIII had, but the response given is related to his religious beliefs and his relationship with the Roman Catholic Church, not his marital history. To provide the correct answer: King Henry VIII had six wives over the course of his life. These wives, in order of their marriage to Henry, were Catherine of Aragon, Anne Boleyn, Jane Seymour, Anne of Cleves, Catherine Howard, and Catherine Parr. Henry VIII's marriages and his annulment from his first wife, Catherine of Aragon, caused political and religious upheaval at the time, leading Henry to sever ties with the Roman Catholic Church and declare himself the head of the Church of England. But the number of wives he had - six - is separate from his excommunication from the Roman Catholic Church. 1) Catherine of Aragon was married to Henry VIII for almost 24 years. Katherine was formerly married to Henry's elder brother, Prince Arthur who died aged 15, leaving Katherine a widow. When Arthur died, Henry married Catherine to maintain the alliance with Spain. 2) Anne Boleyn caught Henry's eye while he was married to Catherine. He pursued her while trying to get his marriage to Catherine annulled. Once free, he wed Anne, who was soon beheaded for treason and adultery. 3) Jane Seymour was the third wife of Henry VIII and the mother of his heir, Edward VI. Jane married Henry just days after the execution of his second wife, Anne Boleyn. She died shortly after giving birth. 4) Anne of Cleves was the fourth wife whom Henry married for political alliance. However, he found her unattractive and the marriage was annulled. 5) Catherine Howard was the fifth wife of Henry VIII. She was executed for adultery. 6) Catherine Parr was the sixth and final wife of Henry VIII. She outlived him. After his death, she got remarried but died shortly after due to complications in childbirth. So, in conclusion, King Henry VIII had six wives."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In anticipation of this economic boon, the city and a private developer spent 13 million to renovate the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad (DL&W) station and transform it into a Hilton hotel, at a time when the unemployment rate in the city was 13 percent. Only 60,000 visitors showed up at Steamtown in 1987, and the 1988 excursions were canceled. After only three years, it was 2.2 million in debt and facing bankruptcy. Part of the problem was the cost of restoration of the new property and the deteriorating equipment. In addition, while the tourists in Vermont had enjoyed the sights of cornfields, farms, covered bridges, a waterfall and a gorge on a Steamtown excursion, the Scranton trip to Moscow, Pennsylvania, cut through one of the nation's largest junkyards, an eyesore described by Ralph Nader as \\"the eighth wonder of the world\\".In 1986, the U.S. House of Representatives, under the urging of Scranton native, Representative Joseph M.

By 1995, Steamtown was acquired and developed by the National Park Service (NPS) at a total cost of 66 million, and opened as Steamtown National Historic Site the same year. In preparation for its acquisition of the collection, the NPS had conducted historical research during 1987 and 1988 on the equipment that still remained in the foundation's possession.

Sentence 1: The speaker states that they have no knowledge about Houston, but they assume it's a calm city. Step 1: Identify speaker's assumption - Houston is a calm city. Sentence 2: The speaker says they've never heard of anything terrible happening in Houston. Step 2: Identify speaker's claim - They've not heard of terrible events in Houston. Now, let's examine the possible answers: a) yes - This would mean that if Sentence 1 is true, Sentence 2 must also be true. However, just because the speaker assumes that Houston is a calm city (Sentence 1) doesn't necessarily mean they haven't heard of terrible events happening there (Sentence 2). There's no direct logical connection between the two statements. b) it is not possible to tell - This answer suggests that based on Sentence 1, we cannot determine the validity of Sentence 2. Sentence 1 only provides information about the speaker's assumption, but it doesn't give any concrete information about the actual events in Houston. This choice acknowledges the uncertainty in making a conclusion based on an assumption. c) no - This would mean that if Sentence 1 is true, Sentence 2 must be false. There's no direct logical connection between the two statements that would lead us to this conclusion. After considering the steps and analyzing the connections between the sentences and possible answers, the most accurate answer is: b) it is not possible to tell"},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Based on this information, the most logical next event would be the dentist discussing the examination results and recommending a course of action to address any potential dental-related issues that the woman may have. This may involve several steps, which are outlined as follows: 1. Dental health assessment: After the thorough examination, the dentist would likely ask the woman about her dental health habits, such as how often she brushes her teeth, uses mouthwash, flosses, and whether she experiences any pain or discomfort while doing so. This information will help the dentist understand her overall dental health situation. 2. Sharing examination results: The dentist would then explain the results of the examination, detailing any signs of cavities, gum disease, or other oral health issues that were found during the inspection. The dentist will also assess whether the woman requires any immediate treatment or emergency intervention. 3. Recommendations and treatment planning: Based on the woman's dental health, the dentist will make recommendations for maintaining a healthy oral care routine, addressing any dental issues observed, and establishing a dental health plan. This plan may include scheduling regular dental check-ups, cleanings, and any necessary treatments, such as fillings, root canals, or extractions. 4. Discussing preventive measures: To prevent the recurrence or the worsening of any dental issues, the dentist may suggest lifestyle or oral hygiene changes. These recommendations might include using specific dental care products, adjusting brushing and flossing techniques, or reducing the consumption of sugary foods and drinks. 5. Addressing any questions or concerns: The dentist would also provide an opportunity for the woman to voice any concerns or ask questions about her dental health. This dialogue is essential to ensure that the woman understands her oral care needs, what steps to take, and how to maintain good dental hygiene. 6. Scheduling follow-up appointments: Depending on the dental treatment plan and the woman's needs, the dentist would schedule a follow-up appointment to check her progress, monitor her dental health, or carry out any necessary dental treatments. This can help ensure that she stays on track with her dental care and that any issues are addressed promptly. In conclusion, the most logical next event after the woman's dental examination would be a discussion between the dentist and the woman regarding her oral health, examination findings, recommendations for treatment or preventive measures, and scheduling any necessary follow-up appointments.

Please answer the following question: When there are group projects, how do people normally work on them? Choose the most suitable option to answer the above question. Options： A. believe in god B. work in teams C. kiss each other D. receive gifts E. argue Answer:","completion":"B. Work in Teams Group projects are generally meant to simulate real-world team dynamics and are a formative experience for students and professionals alike. Here is a general idea about how people usually participate in group projects: 1. Divide Tasks: The first step typically involves dividing the project up into various tasks. Each team member is assigned a role or tasks based on their strengths, skills, and the needs of the project. Decisions about who will do what usually derive from discussion but could also be decided by a team leader or project manager if one exists. 2. Collaboration: Group projects usually require considerable collaboration among team members. Different collaborators bring their unique perspectives and insights, hence enriching the overall output. Members interact and communicate regularly to discuss progress, obstacles, and any changes that might be needed. 3. Research: Most projects involve some level of research. Each team member, consequently, becomes responsible for digging into their part of the topic and sharing their findings with the rest of the group, providing a broader understanding of the subject matter. 4. Regular Meetings: Team meetings, either virtually or in-person, are a common aspect of group projects. These regular check-ins serve as opportunity to provide updates, discuss challenges, brainstorm solutions, make decisions, and ensure that the team is syncing according to the project timeline. 5. Use of Tools: Today, various project management and collaborative tools (like Google Suite, Asana, Trello, or Slack) are used to share resources, tasks, deadlines, and communicate effectively. 6. Drafts and Revisions: In most cases, an initial draft or version of the project is created which is then reviewed and revised based on feedback from team members. This iterative process leads to the final product. 7. Presentation: In the end, the project or findings are often presented in some form. In a student setting, this may be a class presentation or a report submitted to a professor. In a professional setting, it could be a presentation to higher-ups, clients, or stakeholders. 8. Evaluation: Finally, either the project receives a grade, or some sort of review takes place assessing its success or effectiveness. Team members often evaluate each other's performance as well, providing feedback that can be utilized for personal development and improved teamwork in the future. In conclusion, the process of working on a group project involves a series of interconnected steps that require collaboration, communication, division of labour, use of relevant tools, and patience to handle the differences in opinion that may arise.

Mr. Wen set an 8 percent target for gross domestic product growth this year, implying slower growth in succeeding years. But many economists believe the economy will grow faster, just as growth in 2010 exceeded the government’s target. Soaring land and home prices have also proved difficult to curb. But the report claimed impressive gains on other important fronts that are at the head of plans for the next five years, including a 19.1 percent cut in the amount of energy used per unit of economic growth, a rapidly expanding service economy and a boom in the high-technology sector. The government opened a national nanotechnology research center and is building 50 engineering centers, 32 national engineering laboratories and 56 other labs focusing on technologies like digital television and high-speed Internet, the report said. Software sales, integrated circuit production and other advanced products like microcomputers all logged double-digit increases last year. In the next five years, raising standards of living appears to be perhaps the government’s main priority. The government pledged to keep prices “basically stable” through 2015, limiting inflation to 4 percent this year, and to raise household income by an annual average of 7 percent, roughly in line with economic growth. That would break from the past 20 years, in which the growth of ordinary workers’ income has regularly lagged behind the growth in gross domestic product, and consumer spending as a share of the economy has dropped to a record low. The report called expanding domestic demand “a long-term strategic principle” and pledged to increase subsidies to low-income households, extend broadband Internet to rural areas and smaller cities, and expand retail sectors like chain stores and online commerce. Retail sales of consumer goods should grow 16 percent in 2011 alone, it stated. Environmental protection, energy conservation and technology also are allotted ambitious goals: in technology, for example, laying a million kilometers, or 621,000 miles, of new fiber optic cable; and adding 35 million new broadband internet ports, to a total of 223 million; and drafting a plan to support emerging high-technology industries. The report pledges to further reduce energy consumption per unit of G.D.P. by 16 percent, and carbon dioxide emissions per unit by 17 percent. And for the first time, the state-run Xinhua news agency reported, the government will place a cap on total energy use, limiting consumption to the equivalent of four billion tons of coal by 2015. The government also promised to build “well-equipped statistical and monitoring systems” to gauge greenhouse gas emissions, accelerate construction of sewage treatment plants, retrofit coal-fired power plants with pollution controls and continue a pilot program to develop low-carbon cities. China’s military spending will rise 12.6 percent in 2011 to 583.6 billion renminbi, or about 88.6 billion, a separate Finance Ministry report stated on Saturday, slightly less than the 12.7 percent increase announced on Friday by a legislative spokesman. That resumes a long string of double-digit annual increases in military spending that was interrupted in 2010, when spending rose only 7.5 percent, perhaps, analysts said, because money was diverted to address the global economic crisis. Since 1989, the budget has risen by an average of 12.9 percent per year, according to GlobalSecurity.org, a private organization that maintains an online database of military-related information. Many analysts, including those in the Pentagon, say that China’s actual military spending is probably considerably greater than the reported sums. The resumption of rapid growth follows a year in which China’s neighbors have expressed concern about the military’s increasingly muscular behavior in waters off its Pacific coast and along the tense border with India. But the spokesman, Li Zhaoxing, repeated China’s longstanding position that the military is a defensive force and that it “will not pose a threat to any country.” Mr. Wen’s annual report, like those before it, offered a sheaf of paeans to the Communist Party’s stewardship of the nation, with staggering statistics to support them. China’s international prestige “grew significantly”; its “brilliant achievements” in economics “clearly show the advantages of socialism with Chinese characteristics.” The state opened 4,986 kilometers, or 3,100 miles, or new railroads and 120,000 kilometers, or nearly 74,600 miles, of highways; completed 230,000 sports and fitness projects for rural residents; built or renovated 891 hospitals and 1,228 health clinics. And while Western economies still struggle to recover from the 2008 global economic collapse, China has moved on. “All the measures we took,” Mr. Wen’s report said, “have proven to be entirely correct.” A version of this article appears in print on March 5, 2011, on Page A9 of the New York edition with the headline: China Unveils Economic Plan With Focus on Raising Incomes and Reining In Pollution.

There are confusing legal terms to learn, strict procedures to follow and volumes of case law that often need to be understood to prepare a case. Lake County officials and a private agency that assists indigent litigants in Illinois want to make the practice easier by creating a self-help center for people who choose to represent themselves in legal matters. The center, which will be housed in the law library at the main courthouse in Waukegan, could open later this summer. \\"I think it's going to be extremely helpful,\\" Court Administrator Bob Zastany said. \\"There is a population out there that will take advantage of this resource.\\" The self-help center will be the only one of its kind in the county. Only a few operate nationwide, officials said. The project is the work of Lake County circuit court officials and Prairie State Legal Services, a statewide agency with an office in Waukegan that provides information and legal assistance to poor and elderly Illinois residents. The organization has received a 25,000 grant from the Illinois Equal Justice Foundation, a nonprofit group that funds programs designed to increase access to legal information and assistance, to help pay for the effort. Prairie State will share the money with the county. The county's law library is on the first floor of the governmental center at 18 N. County St. The new self-help center will be designed to help litigants find the information they need to properly represent themselves in court, an undertaking that can be complicated and confusing. \\"Some people can do OK on their own, and some people can do OK with some help,\\" said Linda Rothnagel, the managing attorney for Prairie State Legal Services. \\"But other people can't do it. It's not always easy.\\" Self-representation is a right affirmed by the U.S. Supreme Court. The practice is far more common in civil matters than in criminal cases.

Luckily, he did it in","completion":"the toilet, which was undoubtedly the best option for several reasons. First and foremost, by making the wise decision to vomit in the toilet, he prevented an unsightly and unsanitary mess on the floor. This helped maintain the cleanliness of the detox facility and saved the staff from having to deal with a more difficult cleanup situation. The psychological impact of cleanliness in such an environment is crucial, as it instills a sense of responsibility, discipline, and promotes the idea of maintaining a more organized and hygienic lifestyle. Secondly, vomiting in the toilet reduced the risk of spreading germs and infections to other individuals who may be present in the detox facility. It is essential to maintain a clean and hygienic environment in a place where people are trying to overcome addictions and recover from the physical and emotional tolls that substance abuse inflicts on their bodies and minds. Moreover, by choosing the appropriate place to vomit, the man sent an unspoken message to other people in the detox center, demonstrating his ability to think clearly and make responsible choices despite being in a challenging situation. His actions set a positive example for other individuals who may be struggling with addiction, serving as a reminder that even under stressful conditions, it is possible to make responsible choices. Additionally, acting in a considerate and respectful manner by not creating an unnecessary mess can contribute to improved self-esteem and personal dignity. As the man moves forward in his journey to recovery, adhering to basic societal norms and demonstrating respect for his environment and the people around him can instill a sense of pride and increased self-worth. These positive feelings can aid in overall mental and emotional well-being, which are crucial components to successful rehabilitation and long-term recovery. In conclusion, the man in detox wisely chose to vomit in the toilet instead of on the floor, contributing to the cleanliness of the facility, reducing the risk of spreading germs and infections, setting a positive example for others, and promoting his own sense of dignity and self-worth. By making this responsible decision amidst challenging circumstances, he demonstrated his capacity for rational thinking and the ability to prioritize the well-being of both himself and his fellow patients in the detox center."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the name of the contemporary style that descended from the one recorded in a journal in 1849? Hachijō-daiko (八丈太鼓, trans. \\"Hachijō-style taiko\\") is a taiko tradition originating on the island of Hachijō-jima. Two styles of Hachijō-daiko emerged and have been popularized among residents: an older tradition based on a historical account, and a newer tradition influenced by mainland groups and practiced by the majority of the islanders.The Hachijō-daiko tradition was documented as early as 1849 based on a journal kept by an exile named Kakuso Kizan. He mentioned some of its unique features, such as \\"a taiko is suspended from a tree while women and children gathered around\\", and observed that a player used either side of the drum while performing. Illustrations from Kizan's journal show features of Hachijō-daiko. These illustrations also featured women performing, which is unusual as taiko performance elsewhere during this period was typically reserved for men. Teachers of the tradition have noted that the majority of its performers were women; one estimate asserts that female performers outnumbered males by three to one. The first style of Hachijō-daiko is thought to descend directly from the style reported by Kizan. This style is called Kumaoji-daiko, named after its creator Okuyama Kumaoji, a central performer of the style. Kumaoji-daiko has two players on a single drum, one of whom, called the shita-byōshi (下拍子, \\"lower beat\\"), provides the underlying beat. The other player, called the uwa-byōshi (上拍子, \\"upper beat\\"), builds on this rhythmical foundation with unique and typically improvised rhythms. While there are specific types of underlying rhythms, the accompanying player is free to express an original musical beat. Kumaoji-daiko also features an unusual positioning for taiko: the drums are sometimes suspended from ropes, and historically, sometimes drums were suspended from trees.The contemporary style of Hachijō-daiko is called shin-daiko (新太鼓, \\"new taiko\\"), which differs from Kumaoji-daiko in multiple ways. For instance, while the lead and accompanying roles are still present, shin-daiko... Answer:","completion":"The contemporary style that descended from the one recorded in a journal in 1849 is called Shin-daiko (新太鼓, \\"new taiko\\"). Shin-daiko is a variation of the Hachijō-daiko tradition and differs from the older style known as Kumaoji-daiko in several ways. While both styles share the concept of lead and accompanying roles, there are key differences in how the performances are executed. Shin-daiko was influenced by mainland taiko groups and is practiced by the majority of the islanders on Hachijō-jima. In comparison to Kumaoji-daiko, which has two players playing on a single drum in complementary roles, Shin-daiko performances often feature more than one drum, and modern taiko ensembles mimic the patterns used in the Hachijō-daiko tradition, allowing for more dynamic and complex performances. Furthermore, the drums' positioning differs in both styles, as the older Kumaoji-daiko is known for suspending drums from ropes and even trees, whereas shin-daiko setups may more closely resemble those of mainland Japanese taiko groups. The evolving nature of shin-daiko has resulted in increased diversity in the rhythms, choreography, and arrangements performed, showcasing the performers' creativity and innovation as they reinterpret and preserve the rich history of Hachijō-daiko while still assimilating elements of other regional styles. Skilled practitioners of shin-daiko, as well as Kumaoji-daiko, continue to evolve the art form through improvisation, ensuring that each performance remains unique and distinctive. In summary, the name of the contemporary style that descended from the one recorded in a journal in 1849 is Shin-daiko (新太鼓, \\"new taiko\\"). Shin-daiko is an adaptation of the Hachijō-daiko tradition and features many differences from the older Kumaoji-daiko style in terms of drum positioning, number of drums used, and the complexity of the performances."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Flipboard CEO: We’ll never make original content The way Mike McCue tells it, Flipboard isn’t in the business of competing with the very same publishers whose content flow through his popular news-reading app. Which is why Flipboard’s 100 million readers will never find it generating original content the way media companies like Netflix NFLX , Amazon AMZN , or LinkedIn LNKD do. “We don’t want to compete,” McCue told the technology editor Owen Thomas during an industry event in San Francisco on Wednesday. “That’s not a line we want to cross.” McCue originally founded the Palo Alto, Calif.-based Flipboard in 2010 as an app for tablet users that pulls content from publishers including The New York Times, Vanity Fair, and yes, Fortune, among others, and presents it in a magazine-like layout. (“Your personal magazine,” as Flipboard continues to describe itself.) The company, which has raised nearly 160 million from backers including Jack Dorsey, Ron Conway, and Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, says it has more than 100 million users. Startup founders are often pressured to explore multiple ways to make money, but McCue remains firm in the idea that Flipboard’s revenue generator can and should be advertising. Already, the company displays full-page ads from brands such as Gucci, Hugo Boss, Toyota, and Starbucks. In April, Flipboard launched its Small Publishers Program, an advertising experiment aimed at, well, small publishers. The company peppers ads throughout the content imported from publishers; the publishers are paid a small amount for every story a user reads, and see Flipboard as a source of (modest) incremental revenue. Flipboard has paid publishers 1 million to date and expects this year to accelerate the rate in which it generates revenue. The startup plans to begin supporting video ad formats in September. The media industry is a 600 billion business, McCue said. Many publishers have digital operations or are in the process of transitioning to them, but just 20% of all ads are currently digital, he says. This in theory leaves a huge, untapped market opportunity for a company like Flipboard to facilitate the switch. “We’re literally in early innings,” McCue said. “If you have a long view and have good principles about what you’re doing for your audience, you’ll create something great.” What are the most important parts of this text?","completion":"The central theme in this text revolves around the strategic direction of Flipboard. The company's CEO, Mike McCue, has firmly stated that Flipboard will not venture into generating original content, unlike media companies like Netflix, Amazon, or LinkedIn. He emphasized that the company does not wish to compete with publishers, whose content its app already curates and presents to its user base in a unique magazine-like layout. Founded in 2010, the Palo-Alto based Flipboard has been efficient in its chosen business model, successfully amassing over 100 million users and nearly 160 million in funding. It aggregates content from reputed publishers which include The New York Times, Vanity Fair, and Fortune amongst others. By opting not to produce original content, McCue signals Flipboard's commitment to work alongside these publishing partners, rather than against them. Also noteworthy in this text is McCue's conviction in advertising as Flipboard's primary revenue driver. He expresses firm belief in the profitability of this strategy. The company currently showcases full-page ads from major brands and has launched its Small Publishers Program—an advertising experiment enabling smaller publishers to generate modest, incremental revenue. By the end of the year, Flipboard plans to support video ad formats, with aims to accelerate and increase revenue. The text ends with McCue looking optimistically at the future and the substantial opportunities for Flipboard. He points out that just 20% of all ads are presently digital, despite the media industry being a 600 billion business. McCue perceives this as a vast, untapped market potential and an opportunity for Flipboard to facilitate the industry's digital shift, which is still in its early stages. To summarize, the most important parts of the text revolve around Flipboard's strategic decision of not creating original content, the role of advertising in its revenue model, its partnerships with publishers, and the huge potential for growth in the digital advertising industry."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Pick from: (a). negative (b). positive","completion":"The sentiment of the given sentence is (a). negative. Here's an explanation to support this conclusion: The sentence describes an event or activity as \\"an instantly forgettable snow-and-stuntwork extravaganza\\" which clearly portrays a negative connotation. By using phrases like \\"instantly forgettable,\\" it suggests that the event is not memorable or remarkable. The term \\"extravaganza\\" could often be viewed as positive, but in this case, it is overshadowed by the negativity implied by the other words in the statement. Further analysis of the sentence indicates that the event \\"likely will be upstaged\\" by other options or alternatives during the holiday season. The term \\"upstaged\\" implies that the event is not the most ideal choice and is expected to be overshadowed by other, more appealing options. Consequently, this part of the sentence also suggests a negative sentiment. The phrase \\"avalanche of more appealing holiday-season product\\" just reinforces the idea that this particular event may not be worth the attention as there will be plenty of other, more appealing options available. The use of \\"avalanche\\" helps emphasize the significant number of more attractive alternatives expected during the holiday season. This also contributes to the overall negative sentiment of the sentence.

This is a review of the happy hour. The Skinny: poor execution of American Classics but still edible... I guess (3) service: it's okay at the bar - we had to get our bartender's attention quite a few times though (2.5) value: for the price we paid, you'd do a lot better elsewhere (2.5) The hubs and I had to schlep it down to Forum Shops because of a shopping errand for my mom. While we were at it, we decided to hit P.J. Clarke's for their happy hour. Just to preface, we don't indulge in oysters so if you're interested in the 1 oyster thing, this review might not apply to you. We ordered the buffalo chicken lettuce wraps (7.90), crispy cod pieces (9.50), a slider (1.50), and the baked macaroni and cheese (6.10). I'd say definitely pass on the slider. Too little meat in the burger and of what was there, it was under seasoned. The bun, unfortunately, was hard and had an unpleasant texture. After one bite, we left the remaining bread alone. The buffalo chicken lettuce wraps were odd. I guess if you are looking for a lighter alternative to buffalo chicken wings then perhaps this might appeal. However if you throw in the blue cheese dressing , it might be a wash. The buffalo chicken wraps were essentially diced up pieces of chicken breast - either grilled or sauteed - drenched in buffalo wing sauce and then served with lettuce and pickled cucumber and some carrot curls. Decidedly meh... if you're craving buffalo chicken wings, these are a poor substitute. The texture of the chicken was overly firm despite the dicing. Although the pickled cucumbers were okay, the whole plate needed more of the carrot and the addition of celery to cut through the heat. The blue cheese dressing was not overly \\"blue cheesy\\" and was solid. Baked macaroni and cheese with bacon and peas was okay. The cheese sauce was overly thick, gumming the pasta shells together to make an unpleasant texture. The flavor balance of the dish wasn't quite right either - there was a little too much bacon and not enough cheese. For the serving size and the cost, I'd skip this one too. The best thing was definitely the fried cod pieces. The batter was light and held well together with the fish. The tartar sauce was good but not spectacular - requiring perhaps a little more acidity to make it more interesting. That being said, you could probably get something like this at a much better price elsewhere. Of note, we did sit next a couple who ordered the chef's happy hour special of the day which were the ahi tuna tacos. I have to say, it was embarrassing. The tuna tacos were about the size of a taco made for a Smurf (FYI - smurfs are 3 apples tall). I think I could have fit all six tacos in the palm of my hand and consumed it in one bite. Although I did not try this item myself, given the portion size, I would highly recommend against ordering this. (Unless you are a high roller Smurf with money to burn in.) All in all, this meal set us back about 30 which is expensive for happy hour specials. Although the food is indeed edible - probably between a level of 2.5 to a 3 star - the value for your money just isn't there. So overall, I'd say 2.5 stars rounded down to a 2 when you factor in the cost. Avoid if you're not interested in oysters or drink specials. 2 starred review.

Process: - Forest fires burn forests - The animals living in the forest have fewer places to hide - Predators can now find their prey eaiser - Birds will fly away from the area - Waters warm up which hurts the fish swimming in them. Question: suppose lack of rain leaves the forest dry and a campfire is not extinguished correctly happens, how will it affect less birds will fly away. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect The answer to this question is:","completion":"A: more When a forest dries up due to lack of rain, it becomes more vulnerable to forest fires. If a campfire is not extinguished correctly, it can lead to a wildfire that spreads quickly and destroys large areas of the forest ecosystem. This destruction has numerous effects on the local wildlife, including birds. When forest fires burn forests, they destroy trees, plants, and other natural habitats that birds and other animals rely on for shelter, food, and nesting. This causes the affected species to flee the area in search of safer spaces. Therefore, in this scenario, more birds will fly away instead of less. Even if the fire does not directly reach the entire area, the smoke, heat, and changes in the vegetation structure can still lead to increased bird migration from the affected forest. Furthermore, forest fires can cause a decline in insect and plant populations on which the birds depend as a food source. As the primary resources for survival are adversely affected, the birds will have no choice but to leave in search of adequate sustenance. Additionally, the disruption of the forest's ecosystem indirectly affects other species living within it. For example, fires decimating forest areas could cause a reduction in hiding spots for smaller animals, making them easier targets for predators. As a result of this food chain disruption, the balance of predator and prey populations could be significantly altered. This change could impact the birds' overall population, as well, leading to them moving to other areas. Besides the loss of habitat and food sources, forest fires can also affect the water sources within the area. The warming of these waters can hurt fish populations and make the water resources unsuitable for birds to rely on for consumption or hygiene purposes. Considering these factors, natural disasters like forest fires triggered by human activities, such as improper campfire management, will cause more birds to fly away from the affected area rather than less."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The answer to the question: Who said they used to be cruel to women? is inside the article: Lennon met Cynthia Powell (1939–2015) in 1957, when they were fellow students at the Liverpool College of Art. Although Powell was intimidated by Lennon's attitude and appearance, she heard that he was obsessed with the French actress Brigitte Bardot, so she dyed her hair blonde. Lennon asked her out, but when she said that she was engaged, he screamed out, \\"I didn't ask you to fuckin' marry me, did I?\\" She often accompanied him to Quarrymen gigs and travelled to Hamburg with McCartney's girlfriend to visit him. Lennon was jealous by nature and eventually grew possessive, often terrifying Powell with his anger and physical violence. Lennon later said that until he met Ono, he had never questioned his chauvinistic attitude toward women. He said that the Beatles song \\"Getting Better\\" told his own story, \\"I used to be cruel to my woman, and physically – any woman. I was a hitter. I couldn't express myself and I hit. I fought men and I hit women. That is why I am always on about peace.\\"Recalling his July 1962 reaction when he learned that Cynthia was pregnant, Lennon said, \\"There's only one thing for it Cyn. We'll have to get married.\\" The couple wed on 23 August at the Mount Pleasant Register Office in Liverpool, with Brian Epstein serving as best man. His marriage began just as Beatlemania was taking off across the UK. He performed on the evening of his wedding day and would continue to do so almost daily from then on. Epstein feared that fans would be alienated by the idea of a married Beatle, and he asked the Lennons to keep their marriage secret. Julian was born on 8 April 1963; Lennon was on tour at the time and did not see his infant son until three days later.Cynthia attributed the start of the marriage breakdown to Lennon's use of LSD, and she felt that he slowly lost interest in her as a result of his use of the drug.

Whether you're a dedicated professional or an amateur enthusiast, it's crucial to keep adapting and improving your photography skills. Becoming a better photographer isn't just about having the latest equipment—it's about understanding how to use what you have and applying your knowledge and creativity to each shot. Here are some essential steps to help you unleash your inner photographer and take your photography skills to new heights. Step 1: Read Your Camera's Manual The first step towards improving your photography abilities is understanding the inner workings of your camera. While it's easy to get wrapped up in the excitement of your new equipment, taking the time to read the manual will provide valuable insights into the various controls, capabilities, and settings of your camera. Familiarize yourself with each function and learn how to adjust settings to suit your specific needs. This knowledge will serve as a foundation for your photography journey, enabling you to produce better images right from the start. Step 2: Play Around with the Settings Once you've read your camera's manual, it's time to get hands-on and explore. Play around with the various settings, modes, and adjustments available on your camera. Test out different combinations to see how they affect your images. For example, experiment with the aperture, shutter speed, and ISO settings to learn how they influence exposure, depth of field, and motion blur. As you tinker with your camera, take note of what works and what doesn't—this will help you form your unique photography style. Step 3: Pay Attention to Exposure Exposure is a fundamental aspect of photography that plays a significant role in the final appearance of your images. Overexposure or underexposure can result in washed-out or overly dark images, respectively. Learn how to control your camera's exposure settings, such as aperture, shutter speed, and ISO, to achieve the desired balance of light and shadow. Proper exposure will help you capture the true essence of your subject while preserving highlights and details. Step 4: Learn Composition Strong composition is the backbone of compelling photography. It's the art of arranging various elements within your frame to guide the viewer's eye and tell a story. Some fundamental composition techniques to consider include the Rule of Thirds, leading lines, framing, and the use of negative space. Begin by practicing these techniques and then combine them to achieve a visually dynamic and engaging composition. As you become more comfortable with composition, bend the rules and experiment with your unique photographic voice. Step 5: Take a Photography Class While self-learning is an important component of improving your photography skills, taking a photography class—or several—can provide a more structured and comprehensive learning experience. Classes, whether in-person or online, often cover a range of photography topics, from camera operation and exposure settings to composition and post-processing techniques. Expert instructors provide guidance and feedback, and your fellow students can offer support and inspiration. A photography class also offers the opportunity to network and build connections with other photographers in your community or industry. Step 6: Join a Photography Forum Online To continue your growth as a photographer, consider joining an online photography forum or social media group. These communities offer valuable resources, discussions, and feedback that can help expand your knowledge and skills. Share your work and ask for constructive criticism or swap tips and tricks with fellow photographers. Not only will these forums help you improve, but they'll also keep you motivated and inspired to continue honing your craft. Conclusion Improving your photography skills isn't an overnight process; it requires commitment, practice, and a willingness to learn from your experiences and mistakes. By following these essential steps—reading your camera's manual, experimenting with settings, paying attention to exposure, learning composition, taking a photography class, and joining an online photography forum—you'll be well on your way to unleashing your inner photographer and capturing incredible images. Embrace the journey and let your passion for photography fuel your continuous growth and development as an artist."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

An army of men and elves battle Sauronâs forces in Mordor, where Prince Isildur of Gondor cuts the One Ring off of Sauron's finger, thereby temporarily destroying his physical shape, and decides to take care of the Ring himself, but the evil influence of the Ring corrupts Isildur, preventing him from destroying it in Mount Doom. Isildur is later killed by Orcs, and the Ring is lost for 2,500 years, found and owned by Gollum for five centuries. The Ring is then found by a Hobbit named Bilbo Baggins. Sixty years on, Bilbo celebrates his 111th birthday in the Shire, reuniting with his old friend Gandalf the Grey. Bilbo reveals he intends on leaving the Shire for one last adventure and leaves his inheritance to his nephew Frodo, including the Ring. Gandalf investigates the Ring, discovering its true identity and warns Frodo. Learning Gollum was tortured by Orcs and told them that Bilbo took the Ring, Gandalf instructs Frodo to leave the Shire, accompanied by his gardener Samwise Gamgee. Gandalf rides to Isengard, meeting fellow wizard Saruman the White, but learns he is in league with Sauron, who has unleashed the Ringwraiths to find Frodo.
