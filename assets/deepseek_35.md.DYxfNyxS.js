A chilled cheesecake is firmer and easier to slice cleanly. Step 2: Prepare the tools Gather a long, sharp, non-serrated knife and a tall container filled with hot water. The hot water will help warm the knife, making it easier to slice through the cheesecake. Alternatively, you can use a piece of unflavored dental floss or a cheese wire to avoid dragging the knife through the cheesecake. Step 3: Warm the knife Dip the knife into the hot water for a few seconds to heat it up. This will help the knife glide smoothly through the cheesecake. Wipe the blade clean using a kitchen towel or paper towel before making each cut. Step 4: Make the first cut Position the knife at the center of the cheesecake and press down firmly but gently, using the full length of the knife. Avoid sawing or dragging the knife, as this can cause the cheesecake to become misshapen. Step 5: Clean the knife After each cut, dip the knife back into the hot water and wipe it clean with a towel. This ensures clean, precise cuts for each slice. Step 6: Make additional cuts Now that your first cut is complete, estimate the size of the slice you want, and make another cut to form the next slice. Repeat this process, cleaning the knife between each cut, until the entire cheesecake is sliced. Step 7: Serve the slices Use a cake server or offset spatula to carefully lift the slices from the base of the pan or plate. This helps maintain the shape of the slice and prevents any cracks or breakages. By following these steps, you will have perfectly sliced cheesecake to serve and enjoy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

In battle day two group A territory had 22 °C temperature. In battle day three group A territory had low air humidity. In battle day four group A territory had high air humidity. In battle day one would group A have less openings or more openings in their nest thatch? The answer is:","completion":"In battle day one, group A would likely have more openings in their nest thatch. The reason for this answer is based on the assumption that Acromyrmex heyeri ants would tend to maintain more openings in their nest thatch during colder temperatures to increase ventilation and improve heat exchange. In colder temperatures (5 °C), ants may have more difficulty maintaining their nest temperature, so they would open more entrances for better air circulation and to optimize the nest's climate."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Despite M's insistence to let 007 finish his reconnaissance, British Admiral Roebuck orders the frigate HMS Chester to launch a missile attack on the arms bazaar. Bond then discovers two nuclear torpedoes mounted on an L-39 Albatros, and as the missile is too far along to be aborted, 007 hijacks the L-39 and flies away seconds before the bazaar is destroyed. The media baron Elliot Carver soon begins his plans to use an encoder stolen from the bazaar by his henchman, cyberterrorist Henry Gupta, to provoke war between China and the United Kingdom; he hopes to replace the Chinese government with one that will give him exclusive broadcasting rights. Meaconing the GPS signal using the encoder, Gupta sends the British frigate HMS Devonshire off-course into Chinese-held waters in the South China Sea, where Carver's stealth ship, commanded by Mr. Stamper, sinks it and steals one of its missiles, while shooting down a Chinese J-7 fighter jet and killing off the Devonshire's survivors with Chinese weaponry. The British Minister of Defence orders Roebuck to deploy the British Fleet to recover the frigate, and possibly retaliate, while leaving M only 48 hours to investigate its sinking and avert a war. M sends Bond to investigate Carver after he releases news articles about the crisis hours before MI6 had learned of it. Bond travels to Hamburg and seduces Carver's wife, Paris, who is also Bond's ex-girlfriend, to get information that would help him enter Carver's newspaper headquarters.

He is having an affair with the university chancellor, Sara Gaskell (Frances McDormand), whose husband, Walter, is the chairman of the English department and thus Grady's boss. Grady's third wife, Emily, has just left him, and he has failed to repeat the grand success of his first novel, published years earlier. He continues to labor on a second novel, but the more he tries to finish it the less able he finds himself to invent a satisfactory ending - the book runs to over two and a half thousand pages and is still far from finished. He spends his free time smoking marijuana.His students include James Leer (Tobey Maguire) and Hannah Green (Katie Holmes). Hannah and James are friends and both very good writers.

James is enigmatic, quiet, dark and enjoys writing fiction more than he first lets on.During a party at the Gaskells' house, Sara reveals to Grady that she is pregnant with his child. Grady finds James standing outside holding what he claims to be a replica gun, won by his mother at a fairground during her schooldays.

Answer the following question: Information: - William Bouch ( / bat / ; 1813 -- 1876 ) is famous for the steam locomotives he designed for the Stockton and Darlington Railway . In 1860 , Bouch designed the first British standard gauge locomotives to use a 4 - 4 - 0 wheel layout which had earlier become popular in the United States . - On a steam locomotive, a trailing wheel or trailing axle is generally an unpowered wheel or axle (wheelset) located behind the driving wheels. The axle of the trailing wheels is usually located in a trailing truck. On some large locomotives, a booster engine was mounted on the trailing truck to provide extra tractive effort when starting a heavy train and at low speeds on gradients. - George Stephenson (9 June 1781 12 August 1848) was an English civil engineer and mechanical engineer who built the first public inter-city railway line in the world to use steam locomotives, the Liverpool and Manchester Railway which opened in 1830. Renowned as the \\"Father of Railways\\", the Victorians considered him a great example of diligent application and thirst for improvement, with self-help advocate Samuel Smiles particularly praising his achievements. His rail gauge of , sometimes called \\"Stephenson gauge\\", is the standard gauge by name and by convention for most of the world's railways. - Under the Whyte notation for the classification of steam locomotives, represents the wheel arrangement of four leading wheels on two axles, two powered driving wheels on one axle and no trailing wheels. This type of locomotive is often called a Jervis type, the name of the original designer. Overview. The wheel arrangement type was common on United States railroads from the 1830s through the 1850s. The first to be built was the \\"Experiment\\", later named \\"Brother Jonathan\\", for the Mohawk and Hudson Railroad in 1832. It was built by the West Point Foundry based on a design by John B. Jervis. Having little else to reference, the manufacturers patterned the boiler and valve gear after locomotives built by Robert Stephenson of England. A few examples of Stephenson locomotives were already in operation in America, so engineers did not have to travel too far to get their initial ideas. - Shildon is a town in County Durham, in England. The population taken at the 2011 Census was 9,976. It is situated south east of Bishop Auckland, north of Darlington, from Durham, from Sunderland and from Newcastle upon Tyne. Shildon is part of the Bishop Auckland parliamentary constituency, which has been represented since 2005 by Helen Goodman MP for the Labour Party. - The Whyte notation for classifying steam locomotives by wheel arrangement was devised by Frederick Methvan Whyte, and came into use in the early twentieth century following a December 1900 editorial in \\"American Engineer and Railroad Journal\\". The notation counts the number of leading wheels, then the number of driving wheels, and finally the number of trailing wheels, groups of numbers being separated by dashes. Other classification schemes, like UIC classification and the French, Turkish and Swiss systems for steam locomotives, count axles rather than wheels. - Middlesbrough is a large industrial town on the south bank of the River Tees in North East England, founded in 1830. The local council, a unitary authority, is Middlesbrough Borough Council. In 2011 it had a total resident population of 138,400 for the borough and 174,700 for the wider Middlesbrough built-up area subdivision, which itself is part of the larger built-up area of Teesside and had an overall population of 376,333 at the 2011 census. - The standard gauge (also Stephenson gauge after George Stephenson, International gauge, or normal gauge) is a widely used railway track gauge. Approximately 55% of the lines in the world are this gauge. All high-speed rail lines (except those in Russia, Uzbekistan, and Finland) are standard gauge. The distance between the inside edges of the rails is defined to be (except in the United States, where it is still defined in Imperial and US customary units as ). It is also called the UIC gauge or UIC track gauge, the European gauge in the EU and Russia, or uniform gauge in Queensland, Australia. - Stockton-on-Tees is a market town in the ceremonial county of County Durham, North East England. It is the major settlement in the borough of Stockton-on-Tees. The town sits within the Tees Valley region of the North East of England, and the wider borough had a population of 191,000 in 2011 estimates. - Under the Whyte notation for the classification of steam locomotives, represents the wheel arrangement of two leading wheels on one axle, four powered and coupled driving wheels on two axles and no trailing wheels. The wheel arrangement is known as a Porter. - Under the Whyte notation for the classification of steam locomotives by wheel arrangement, represents the arrangement of four leading wheels on two axles, usually in a leading bogie, four powered and coupled driving wheels on two axles, and no trailing wheels. Almost every major railroad that operated in North America in the first half of the 19th century owned and operated locomotives of this type. Due to the large number of the type that were produced and used in the United States, the is most commonly known as the American type, but the type subsequently also became popular in the United Kingdom, where large numbers were produced. Overview. The first use of the name \\"American\\" to describe locomotives of this wheel arrangement was made by \\"Railroad Gazette\\" in April 1872. Prior to that, this wheel arrangement was known as a \\"standard\\" or \\"eight-wheeler\\". This locomotive type was so successful on railroads in the United States of America that many earlier 4-2-0 and 2-4-0 locomotives were rebuilt as 4-4-0s by the middle of the 19th century. - The Stockton and Darlington Railway (S&DR) was a railway company that operated in north-east England from 1825 to 1863. The world's first public railway to use steam locomotives, its first line connected collieries near Shildon with Stockton-on-Tees and Darlington, and was officially opened on 27 September 1825. The movement of coal to ships rapidly became a lucrative business, and the line was soon extended to a new port and town at Middlesbrough. While coal waggons were hauled by steam locomotives from the start, passengers were carried in coaches drawn by horses until carriages hauled by steam locomotives were introduced in 1833.

However, we can try to come up with a star-rating based on our interpretation of the words. Since the word \\"Good\\" is mentioned, we assume the reviewer had a positive experience. Therefore, it is safe to eliminate the possibility of it being a 1-star or 2-star review since those ratings generally indicate negative experiences. Now, let's consider the other part of the review - \\"Phukan Phukan.\\" It is unclear whether the repetition of the word \\"Phukan\\" is meant to emphasize the goodness or to express dissatisfaction. Without more information, we can only guess its meaning. However, since the word \\"good\\" is also in the review, we can lean towards it being a positive emphasis. With this understanding, we now have three possible rating options: 3 stars, 4 stars, or 5 stars. A 3-star rating generally indicates a satisfactory experience, which could match the \\"Good\\" statement. However, it could also imply that there were some shortcomings, which may not be evident in the review. A 4-star rating would suggest a higher level of satisfaction, which may align better with the combination of the words \\"Phukan Phukan Good,\\" potentially indicating a positive emphasis on the experience. Lastly, a 5-star rating represents an excellent or outstanding experience. While the review is positive, it does not provide enough details to suggest it was an extraordinary encounter deserving of a full 5-star rating.

Article: You'll need to follow your doctor's recommendations following treatment. Be prompt and consistent when checking in with your primary physician. You'll need to work together to create target goals for your blood pressure. Usually, you're goal will be to get your blood pressure to less than 140/90. Make sure you consume no more than 2,000mg of sodium a day. Too much sodium can increase your blood pressure and put you at risk for heart attack and stroke. Make sure you're eating fresh fruits and vegetables and avoiding processed foods. These items can high high sodium contents. Refrain from buying canned goods, since they contain salt in order to preserve the color and to keep the food fresh. If you do purchase canned goods, look for low-sodium or no-salt options. Although activity will be limited until you are out of the hospital, you can resume normal activities and exercise once your blood pressure has stabilized. You can do aerobic (cardio), resistance or weight training, and isometric resistance training. These all work to decrease diastolic and systolic blood pressure. Systolic blood pressure is pressure measuring when your heart contracts while diastolic blood pressure measures the pressure when your heart rests between beats. Adults should exercise a total of 2 hours and 30 minutes a week, according to the Surgeon General. Try to do a moderate-intensity exercise like walking, biking or swimming. If you're obese, your arteries have to work harder to supply your body with blood which raises your blood pressure. Determine your Body Mass Index (BMI) using an online calculator.

We also discussed any specific needs or preferences, like accessibility. Step 4: Make a decision After thoroughly considering all aspects, we decided that carpooling with friends was the best option for us.

The national census is supposed to be conducted every ten years, however, the 2012 census was late because of \\"climatic factors and the financing.\\" The 2012 census data was conducted on 21 November 2012, in which 10,027,254 inhabitants were in the country.

Please note that the last organizer, Francisco Gil de Taboada, is included in this list because his efforts resulted in the first true estimate of the Bolivian population in 1826. However, it should be acknowledged that the modern Bolivian census started with Andrés de Santa Cruz in 1831, which makes him the first modern census organizer."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

What are the most important words in the following sentence: a ray of sunshine penetrates the gloomy skies","completion":"The most important words in the given sentence are \\"ray,\\" \\"sunshine,\\" \\"penetrates,\\" \\"gloomy,\\" and \\"skies.\\" Each word holds significance in creating a vivid image and conveying the intended meaning of the sentence. 1. Ray: \\"Ray\\" in this context refers to a beam of sunlight. It is essential to the meaning of the sentence as it implies a specific aspect or portion of sunlight rather than sunlight in its entirety. In addition, it creates a sharper visual image of a focused, singular beam of light. 2. Sunshine: \\"Sunshine\\" refers to the light emitted by the sun. In this sentence, it represents warmth, brightness, and natural light in contrast to the darkness and gloominess of the skies described. The word emphasizes the source of the ray of light and symbolizes hope or positivity. 3. Penetrates: This action word is crucial to the sentence because it describes how the ray of sunshine passes through the gloomy skies. \\"Penetrates\\" has a strong connotation, suggesting that the ray is powerful enough to break through the barrier of darkness and bring light to the environment. It creates a sense of movement and illustrates the relationship between the ray of sunshine and the gloomy skies. 4. Gloomy: \\"Gloomy\\" characterizes the state of the skies in the sentence. It paints a picture of an overcast, dark, and potentially depressing or bleak atmosphere. This adjective sets the mood of the sentence and contrasts with the bright, positive nature of sunshine. It also highlights the effect of the ray of sunshine in changing the surroundings. 5. Skies: \\"Skies\\" signifies the vast expanse above, which is the backdrop of the scene being described. The skies act as a canvas where the ray of sunshine and the gloominess play out their interaction. Furthermore, the word 'skies' often evokes feelings of grandness and openness, making the penetration of the ray more impactful. These words work together to create an evocative image of a singular beam of light breaking through darkness and despair, highlighting the beauty and power of nature. The contrast between the words and the action of 'penetrating' contributes to the overall significance and impact of the sentence."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It extends between Finland (to the north) and Estonia (to the south) all the way to Saint Petersburg in Russia, where the river Neva drains into it. Other major cities around the gulf include Helsinki and Tallinn. The eastern parts of the Gulf of Finland belong to Russia, and some of Russia's most important oil harbours are located farthest in, near Saint Petersburg (including Primorsk). As the seaway to Saint Petersburg, the Gulf of Finland has been and continues to be of considerable strategic importance to Russia. Some of the environmental problems affecting the Baltic Sea are at their most pronounced in the shallow gulf. - An academician is a full member of an artistic, literary, or scientific academy. In many countries, it is an honorific title used to denote a full member of an academy that has a strong influence on national scientific life. In systems such as the Academy of Sciences of the USSR, the title grants privileges and administrative responsibilities for funding allocation and research priorities. - Dmitri Vladimirovich Skobeltsyn ( Russian : ) ( November 24 , 1892 in Saint Petersburg -- November 16 , 1990 ) was a Soviet physicist , academician of the Soviet Academy of Sciences ( 1946 ) , Hero of Socialist Labor ( 1969 ) . Dmitri Skobeltsyn was awarded the Stalin Prize ( 1950 ) , six Orders of Lenin , two other orders , and numerous medals . In 1923 , while using a cloud chamber to try to detect gamma radiation in cosmic rays , Skobeltsyn detected particles that acted like electrons but curved in the opposite direction in an applied magnetic field . He was puzzled by these results , and they remained unexplained until the discovery of the positron in 1931 . - The Neva is a river in northwestern Russia flowing from Lake Ladoga through the western part of Leningrad Oblast (historical region of Ingria) to the Neva Bay of the Gulf of Finland. Despite its modest length of , it is the fourth largest river in Europe in terms of average discharge (after the Volga, the Danube and the Rhine). - Peter the Great, Peter I or Peter Alexeyevich ( ) ruled the Tsardom of Russia and later the Russian Empire from 7 May (O.S. 27 April) 1682 until his death, jointly ruling before 1696 with his elder half-brother, Ivan V. Through a number of successful wars he expanded the Tsardom into a much larger empire that became a major European power. He led a cultural revolution that replaced some of the traditionalist and medieval social and political systems with ones that were modern, scientific, westernized, and based on The Enlightenment. Peter's reforms made a lasting impact on Russia and many institutions of Russian government trace their origins to his reign. - A saint, also historically known as a hallow, is a term used for a person who is recognized as having an exceptional degree of holiness or likeness to God. Depending on the context and denomination, the term also retains its original Christian meaning, as any believer who is \\"in Christ\\" and in whom Christ dwells, whether in Heaven or on Earth. In Anglican, Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Lutheran, and Oriental Orthodox doctrine, all of their faithful deceased in Heaven are considered to be saints, but some are considered worthy of greater honor or emulation; official ecclesiastical recognition, and consequently veneration, is given to some saints through the process of canonization in the Catholic Church or glorification in the Eastern Orthodox Church. - Russia (from the Rus'), also officially known as the Russian Federation, is a country in Eurasia. At , Russia is the largest country in the world by surface area, covering more than one-eighth of the Earth's inhabited land area, and the ninth most populous, with over 140 million people at the end of March 2016. The European western part of the country is much more populated and urbanised than the eastern, about 77% of the population live in European Russia. Russia's capital Moscow is one of the largest cities in the world, other major urban centers include Saint Petersburg, Novosibirsk, Yekaterinburg, Nizhny Novgorod and Samara. - Saint Petersburg is Russia's second-largest city after Moscow, with five million inhabitants in 2012, and an important Russian port on the Baltic Sea. It is politically incorporated as a federal subject (a federal city). Situated on the Neva River, at the head of the Gulf of Finland on the Baltic Sea, it was founded by Tsar Peter the Great on May . In 1914, the name was changed from Saint Petersburg to Petrograd, in 1924 to Leningrad, and in 1991 back to Saint Petersburg.

Military expenses increased steadily during the 3rd century, mainly in response to the war with Sassanid Persia, which revived in the middle of the 3rd century.

Article: What would you do if you were lost in the dark forest at night? The first sensible lesson is that you shouldn't bother trying to find your way in the dark at all, but just stay put until dawn. Because then you won't trip over things? No, mainly because you'll have an idea of direction. The sun rises in the east. But you will be amazed at how many people forget they know that. Apparently, the area underneath a holly bush provides a good makeshift shelter -- they are thick, and evergreen. The next thing to do -- or rather not to do -- is panic, for the obvious reason that unless there is someone there to hear you scream, it will get you nowhere. Just try to think of nice, happy things. There is always a point in films when a person who is lost in the desert or the snow, dehydrated and exhausted, comes across a set of their own footprints and realizes they have just walked in a huge, round circle. It is wrong to owe it to the unequal strengths or different lengths of your legs. Experiments prove that, without the sun or the moon (or landmarks) as a fixed guide, lots of small errors add up over time so the brain can't correctly identify the \\"straight ahead\\" direction. To just get out of somewhere, pick a spot on the horizon and just head for it. There are several ways to find directions in the dark, and by far the best is to establish north using the stars. Most people can identify the Plough, which is part of Ursa Major. It looks a lot like a saucepan. The Plough rotates through the sky, but let's imagine the saucepan lying horizontally , with its handle on the left. You need to trace a line from the star at the right-hand base of the pan, through the star at the right-hand rim , and follow it upwards; the north star is roughly five times the distance between those two \\"pointer\\" stars. Then drop a vertical line from the North Star to the horizon and that's north. \\"Tonight is very cloudy and I can't see the Plough.\\" Maybe luckily, it is quite windy. Keep in mind that almost all of our weather comes from a... Question: Why will people often walk in a circle if they are lost in the desert or the snow? - Because without anything to refer to for directions, the brain will be confused by errors. - Because one of the legs is longer and stronger than the other. - Because the desert or the snow usually covers a large area for people to get across. - Because people usually feel dehydrated and exhausted in the desert or the snow.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: When we can see well, we do not think about our eyes often: It is only when we cannot see perfectly that we come to see how important our eyes are. People who are nearsighted can only see things that are very close to their eyes. Many people who do a lot of close work, such as writing and reading, become nearsighted. Then they have to wear glasses in order to see distant things clearly. People who are farsighted face just the opposite problem. They can see things that are far away, but they have difficulty reading a book if they don't hold it at arm's length. If they want to do much reading, they must get glasses too. Other people do not see clearly because their eyes are not exactly the right shape. This, too, can be corrected by glasses. Some people's eyes become cloudy because of cataracts . Long ago these people often became blind. Now, however, it is possible to operate on the cataracts and remove them. When night falls, colors become fainter to the eyes and finally disappear. After your eyes have grown used to the dark, you can see better if you use the side of your eyes rather than the centers. Sometimes, after dark, you see a small thing to one side of you. It seems to disappear if you turn your head in its direction. This is because when you turn your head, you are looking at the thing too directly. Men on guard duty sometimes think they see something moving to one side of them. When they turn to look straight at it, they cannot see it anymore, and they believe they were mistaken. However, this mistake happens because the center of the eye, which is very sensitive in daylight, is not as sensitive as the sides of the eye after dark, Options: A cannot do a lot of close work without glasses B can only see things that are very close to their eyes C have the same problem as the nearsighted people D have difficulty reading a book if they hold it at arm's length Answer: A cannot do a lot of close work without glasses Question: The answer to this question is:","completion":"Which of the following best describes the problem faced by farsighted people?

First, let's add the terms with \\"a\\" in them: -7572*a + 7551*a = (-7572 + 7551) * a = -21*a. Now our equation looks like this: 0 = -21*a + 126. Next, let's move the -21*a to the other side of the equation by adding 21*a to both sides: 0 + 21*a = -21*a + 21*a + 126. This simplifies to: 21*a = 126. Now, we'll solve for \\"a\\" by dividing both sides of the equation by 21: 21*a / 21 = 126 / 21. This gives us: a = 6. So, the solution to the math problem is a = 6."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Q: What might Neptune's rings consist of? A: The rings may consist of ice particles coated with silicates or carbon-based material, which most likely gives them a reddish hue. Does the answer correctly answer the question OPT: A). yes; B). no;","completion":"A). yes; Neptune's rings consist of various materials that contribute to their composition and appearance. Primarily, these rings are made up of ice particles, which are believed to be a combination of water, ammonia, and methane ices. These ice particles are thought to be coated with silicates or carbon-based materials, such as organic compounds called tholins. The presence of silicates or carbon-based material is most likely responsible for giving Neptune's rings their reddish hue. These rings are also believed to contain rocky debris and dust particles, resulting from collisions between moonlets and other small celestial bodies in the Neptunian system. It is possible that some of Neptune's smaller moons, like its shepherd moons, which are Galatea and Despina, have played a role in the formation and maintenance of the rings by helping to contain and shape the ring particles through their gravitational influence. Furthermore, the intricate structure and distribution of Neptune's rings can be associated with resonances caused by the interaction between the orbital motion of the ring particles and the Neptunian moons. These interactions lead to the confinement of these particles in specific regions, creating the distinct ring systems Neptune is known for. In summary, Neptune's rings most likely consist of ice particles coated with silicates or carbon-based materials, giving them their reddish hue. Other contributing factors include rocky debris, dust particles, and the gravitational influence of Neptune's moons, as well as orbital resonances between the moons and the ring particles."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Process: - Electromagnet creates magnetic field with electricity - Conductive copper wire is wrapped around a piece of metal - An electric current gets introduced from power source - Flows through the wire - Magnetic field gets created in the wire - And the metal gets magnetized - When turned off it is no longer magnetic. Question: suppose more copper wire is wound happens, how will it affect a STRONGER electromagnet. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect","completion":"When more copper wire is wound around a piece of metal to create an electromagnet, it results in a STRONGER electromagnet. This occurs primarily due to the increased number of wire turns called \\"coil windings\\" around the metal core. The main factors that influence the strength of an electromagnet are the number of wire turns, the current flowing through the wire, and the type of the core material. In this case, when you increase the number of wire turns around the core, it boosts the magnetic field produced by the electromagnet. To be more specific, the magnetic field generated by the electromagnet is directly proportional to the number of turns in the coil. The more turns there are in the wire coil, the stronger the magnetic field will be. So, adding more wire turns around the core increases the strength of the electromagnet. In the context of the second effect, which is the metal getting magnetized, more turns of copper wire will have a direct impact on this effect. With more turns of the copper wire, the stronger magnetic field will lead to increased magnetization of the core. As a result, when the electric current flows through the wire, the metal will get more magnetized than it would with fewer turns of the wire. In conclusion, adding more copper wire turns around the core of an electromagnet will result in a stronger electromagnet and a stronger magnetization of the metal core."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A:","completion":"The answer to the question \\"How do the trials occur?\\" based on the information given is: In the United States, trials for new pharmaceutical products occur through a process regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Initially, an Investigational New Drug filing is submitted with sufficient pre-clinical data to support proceeding with trials involving humans. After approval, the initial step, known as Phase I, studies toxicity using healthy volunteers. This is to ensure the drug is safe for human use. The next step, Phase II, includes study of pharmacokinetics and dosing in patients. Pharmacokinetics refers to how the body absorbs, distributes, metabolises and excretes the drug. This phase ensures that correct dosing parameters are identified for the intended patient population. The third and final phase, Phase III, involves a very large study of the drug's efficacy in the intended patient population. The goal of this phase is to confirm that the drug is effective in treating the condition for which it was developed. Once phase III testing has been successfully completed, a New Drug Application is submitted to the FDA. The FDA reviews the data and if the product is seen as having a positive benefit-risk assessment, approval to market the product in the US is granted. This systematic progression through multiple phases ensures that the drug is both safe and effective for the intended patient population before it is released into the market."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Explanation: The correct answer is a \\"German official,\\" as the passage is describing the spying scandal from the perspective of the US spying on German Chancellor Angela Merkel. The other options are incorrect because they don't align with the focus of the passage, which is about the fallout from spying on Merkel and the tensions between the US and their allies. The options mentioning the Associated Press, Obama, National Security Agency, and White House are all closely related to the U.S. side, while this passage focuses more on the reactions and beliefs of the allies being spied on. Additionally, while Dianne Feinstein is a U.S. politician, she does not have a direct connection to this specific topic."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: Is this product review positive?

Poland has potential that Europe needs to recognize Before the recession, Poland's gross domestic product was around 6 percent. In 2009, at the height of the market malaise, while EU GDP contracted by 4.9 percent, Poland was the only country in Europe to see a GDP increase of 1.6 percent. Current expectations are for growth of up to 3.5 percent this year and next. Surely growth like this should be reflected in stocks then, right? Well, it kind of isn't. At least not yet. First, one third of stocks on Poland's main WIG20 index are commodity-based, and sensitive to recent fluctuations in oil and basic resources. Second, financials PKO Bank, Pekao, and PZU make up 40 percent of the index, and last, but perhaps most important at the moment, a recent big overhaul of the Polish pension system allowed the state to legally take over 51.5 percent of assets, and led to fears that the money pension funds traditionally invested in domestic equities would be scaled back drastically.

Please answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: Once again, a mutation is the change in the DNA or RNA sequence. In multicellular organisms, mutations can be subdivided into germline mutations and somatic mutations. Germline mutations occur in the DNA of sex cells, or gametes, and are therefore potentially very serious. These mutations can be passed to the next generation. If the zygote contains the mutation, every cell in the resulting organism will have that mutation. If the mutation results in a disease phenotype, the mutation causes what is called a hereditary disease. Somatic mutations , which occur in somatic, or body, cells, cannot be passed to the next generation (offspring). Mutations present in a somatic cell of an organism will be present (by DNA replication and mitosis) in all descendants of that cell. If the mutation is present in a gene that is not used in that cell type, the mutation may have no effect. On the other hand, the mutation may lead to a serious medical condition such as cancer. I am facing a new situation today: Dan studied multicellular organisms that presented mutations. Group A presented gemline mutations, while group B presented somatic mutations. He was fascinated by these organisms.

In contrast, somatic mutations occur in body cells and cannot be passed to the next generation (offspring).

If you liked the Family Guy episodes, this DVD is for you. It is crude and brash, but well written(contrary to what a few people said here) and a lot of fun to watch. Answer:","completion":"After analyzing the given review, it seems that the chances of buying this product – a Family Guy DVD – would likely increase, specifically for individuals who are fans of the show. This conclusion is based on various factors discussed in the review, which will be examined in more detail below. First, the review title mentions that those who liked the show would love this DVD. This statement is a strong endorsement of the product, drawing a direct connection between the enjoyment of the Family Guy episodes and the content of this DVD.

Let's break this down further to provide a thorough understanding of the sentiment: 1. The word \\"crapulence\\" is derived from the Latin term \\"crapula,\\" which originally referred to excessive indulgence in food or drink. In modern usage, \\"crapulence\\" has evolved and is often used to describe a state of being significantly impaired, of poor quality, or inferior. It can also be used metaphorically to describe a situation, an object, or a person in a vehemently disapproving manner. 2. As an adjective, the word \\"crapulent\\" holds similar connotations, denoting an excessive level of indulgence, gluttony, or debauchery. However, it's important to note that this word has a distinct negative connotation and is considered vulgar or offensive by some individuals. 3. The phrase \\"in its crapulence\\" implies that the subject in question is in a state of extreme deterioration, degradation, or degeneration. It criticizes the subject as being excessively indulgent or of inferior quality, often implying a level of moral decay or a lack of integrity. 4. When used in a sentence, the phrase \\"in its crapulence\\" suggests that the speaker strongly disapproves of the subject or situation being described. The overall sentiment is one of disdain or reproach and indicates that the speaker is not sympathetic towards the subject matter. Considering these factors, the sentiment of a sentence containing the phrase \\"in its crapulence\\" would likely be perceived as negative, scathing, and disapproving. Furthermore, the choice of words could potentially provoke strong emotional reactions from some readers or listeners, which should be taken into account when using such a phrase in communication."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

John designed a hypothetical lever that would have ideal mechanical advantage. He labeled the lever as lever A. He then wanted to compare this lever with a real world lever, which he labeled as lever B. He intended to use these levers to increase force. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which lever would have smaller mechanical advantage, lever A or lever B? Hint: The Table above includes the ideal mechanical advantage of each class of lever. The mechanical advantage is the factor by which a machine changes the input force. The ideal mechanical advantage is the increase or decrease in force that would occur if there were no friction to overcome in the use of the machine. Because all machines must overcome some friction, the ideal mechanical advantage is always somewhat greater than the actual mechanical advantage of the machine as it is used in the real world.","completion":"Based on the information provided, lever B, which represents a real-world lever would have a smaller mechanical advantage. The steps to derive this conclusion would be: 1. Understanding the concept of mechanical advantage: Mechanical advantage is the factor by which a machine changes the input force. 2. Noticing that there are two kinds of mechanical advantage mentioned in the paragraph - ideal mechanical advantage and actual mechanical advantage. 3. According to the paragraph, ideal mechanical advantage refers to the force change that a machine could achieve if it did not have to overcome any friction. 4. Actual mechanical advantage, on the other hand, is what the machine achieves in the real world, where it has to overcome friction. 5. Since all machines must face and overcome friction in the real-world scenario, the actual mechanical advantage is always somewhat less than the ideal mechanical advantage. 6. Lever A is described as being hypothetical and having an ideal mechanical advantage, suggesting it does not face real-world constraints like friction. 7. Lever B is described as a real-world lever, which means it has to deal with friction and hence its mechanical advantage cannot be ideal. 8. Hence, it can be concluded that Lever B would have a smaller mechanical advantage when compared to Lever A. This conclusion follows from understanding the differences between ideal and actual mechanical advantage and applying these concepts to the levers A and B."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Zenzile Miriam Makeba (4 March 1932 – 9 November 2008), nicknamed Mama Africa, was a South African singer, songwriter, actress, United Nations goodwill ambassador, and civil rights activist. Associated with musical genres including Afropop, jazz, and world music, she was an advocate against apartheid and white-minority government in South Africa. Born in Johannesburg to Swazi and Xhosa parents, Makeba was forced to find employment as a child after the death of her father. She had a brief and allegedly abusive first marriage at the age of 17, gave birth to her only child in 1950, and survived breast cancer. Her vocal talent had been recognized when she was a child, and she began singing professionally in the 1950s, with the Cuban Brothers, the Manhattan Brothers, and an all-woman group, the Skylarks, performing a mixture of jazz, traditional African melodies, and Western popular music. In 1959, Makeba had a brief role in the anti-apartheid film Come Back, Africa, which brought her international attention, and led to her performing in Venice, London, and New York City. In London, she met the American singer Harry Belafonte, who became a mentor and colleague. She moved to New York City, where she became immediately popular, and recorded her first solo album in 1960. Her attempt to return to South Africa that year for her mother's funeral was prevented by the country's government. Makeba's career flourished in the United States, and she released several albums and songs, her most popular being \\"Pata Pata\\" (1967). Along with Belafonte she received a Grammy Award for her 1965 album An Evening with Belafonte/Makeba. She testified against the South African government at the United Nations and became involved in the civil rights movement. She married Stokely Carmichael, a leader of the Black Panther Party, in 1968. As a result, she lost support among white Americans and faced hostility from the US government, leading her and Carmichael to move to Guinea.

Profit funds research into improved drugs What evidence supports this claim?","completion":"The claim that adverts generate profit, which in turn funds research into improved drugs, is supported by several pieces of evidence. Advertising plays a crucial role in promoting pharmaceutical products and engaging consumers, healthcare professionals, and other players in the industry. The generated revenue helps drive innovation and improvement in medicines, leading to better healthcare outcomes. Here's a detailed analysis of the evidence supporting this claim. 1. Increased awareness and demand for drugs: Advertising helps increase awareness of new and existing drugs among patients, healthcare providers, and pharmacists. This heightened awareness leads to increased demand for these medications, resulting in higher sales and profits for pharmaceutical companies. The revenue earned can then be invested back into research and development (R&D) to discover new drugs or improve existing ones. 2. Funding for research and development: Advertising profits contribute substantially to the funding of pharmaceutical R&D. For instance, pharmaceutical companies in the United States spent 83 billion on R&D in 2019, a figure that continues to grow each year. The revenue generated through advertising plays a crucial role in sustaining this level of investment. Continued investment in R&D helps create better medicines and treatment options for future generations. 3. Attracting investors and partnerships: Advertising can create positive impressions for pharmaceutical companies, attracting investors and fostering partnerships. A company that successfully advertises its drugs and showcases its R&D successes can woo investors, leading to an influx of capital. Additional financial support bolsters research efforts, accelerating the discovery of innovative drugs and therapies. 4. Enhanced competitiveness and innovation: Advertising generates a competitive environment within the pharmaceutical industry, pushing companies to differentiate themselves through research and innovation. Companies are incentivized to create better, more effective drugs or risk losing market share. Thus, the desire to stay ahead forces the industry to continuously invest in R&D. 5. Access to global markets: Advertising helps pharmaceutical companies reach more patients through targeted campaigns, which can be crucial in breaking into emerging markets. As a company increases its market share in new regions, it can further expand its R&D initiatives, resulting in improved drugs for a wider audience. 6. Public-private partnerships: Advertising can facilitate public-private partnerships, where companies collaborate with public entities such as government agencies or research institutions. These partnerships can result in shared knowledge, resources, and funding for drug research and development, ultimately leading to advancements in medicine more quickly and efficiently than through individual efforts. 7. Patient advocacy and support groups: Advertising can create relationships between pharmaceutical companies, patients, and patient advocacy groups. These relationships can encourage the sharing of experiences and expectations about medications, leading to a better understanding of patient needs and preferences that can inform the research and development of new drugs. In conclusion, there is substantial evidence to support the claim that advertising in the pharmaceutical industry generates profit, which funds research into improved drugs. Advertising leads to increased drug demand, higher revenues, and more investment in R&D. The competitive landscape that advertising fosters and the collaboration facilitated through public-private partnerships further contribute to advancements in medicine. Lastly, advertising enables valuable relationships with patients and advocacy groups, driving better understanding of patient needs and preferences that drive innovation in drug development."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In 2001, M.I.A. (Mathangi \\"Maya\\" Arulpragasam) had worked exclusively in the visual arts. While filming a documentary on Elastica's 2001 tour of the US, she was introduced to the Roland MC-505 sequencer/drum machine by electroclash artist Peaches, whose minimalistic approach to music inspired her. She found Peaches' decision to perform without additional instrumentation to be brave and liberating and felt that it emphasised the artist. Returning to London, she unexpectedly gained access to a 505 owned by her friend, former Elastica singer Justine Frischmann. M.I.A. used the 505 to make demo recordings in her bedroom. She initially planned to work as a producer. To this end, she approached Caribbean girls in clubs to see if they would provide vocals for the songs, but without success. M.I.A. secured a record deal with XL Recordings after Frischmann's manager overheard the demo. M.I.A. began work on the album by composing lyrics and melodies, and she programmed drum beats at home on the drum machine. Having produced rough tracks via trial and error, she honed the finished songs in collaboration with other writer-producers. Through these collaborations, she sought to produce a diverse style and \\"drag [her collaborators] out of their boxes, musically\\".DJ Diplo introduced elements of Brazilian baile funk to \\"Bucky Done Gun\\".

Steve Mackey and Ross Orton, known professionally as Cavemen, worked on \\"Galang\\", which M.I.A. had initially produced with her 505 and a basic four-track tape recorder. Working with Cavemen in a professional studio, she added a bass line and new vocals to give the song \\"a more analogue sound\\" than was possible with the 505. The track was co-written by Frischmann, whose input M.I.A. described as \\"refreshing\\". She initially hoped to feature guest vocalists on...

Teacher:Given a premise, an initial context, an original ending, and a counterfactual context, the task is to generate a new story ending aligned with the counterfactual context and as close to the original ending as possible. Each instance consists of a five-sentence story. The premise is the first sentence of a story, and the second sentence, which is the initial context, provides more information about the story's context and the story's general plot. The original ending is the last three sentences of the story. Also, a counterfactual context is a slight modification to the initial context. You should write a new story ending that edits the original story ending as little as possible to regain coherence with the counterfactual context. To sum up, you should write the last three sentences of a story based on the premise(first sentence) and the counterfactual context(second sentence) of the story. Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: Premise: Camilla was at the park with friends. Initial Context: They discovered a nice smelling bush of flowers.

Part #2: Retain coherence with the counterfactual context. Usage: Make sure the new story ending logically connects to the counterfactual context. Example: Using the previous example, the new story ending should be related to \\"They found a flowers.\\" to meet this criteria, for instance, \\"Camilla picked one of the flowers and smelled it, discovering that it had a pleasant fragrance. Curious, she asked her friends if they knew the name of the flower. They all looked at each other, unsure, and decided to take one home to research its name.\\" Part #3: Editing the original story ending as little as possible.

Example: Original Ending: \\"One of the kids said that it was honeysuckle and tasted it. Camilla thought it was a trick but she tried a taste. To her surprise, it was sweet like honey.\\" A possible minimal editing to meet this criteria could be: \\"One of the kids said that it was a unique flower and smelled it. Camilla thought they were exaggerating, but she tried smelling it, too. To her surprise, it had a delightful scent.\\" This example meets the criteria as it contains minimum edits while incorporating the counterfactual context."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Carrie was better at public speaking..","completion":"Because Elena was on the debate team and Carrie was not, one might assume that Elena was better at public speaking. However, it is essential not to jump to conclusions and truly analyze each individual's skills, strengths, and experiences to make a fair assessment. Option 1: Elena was better at public speaking. Elena's involvement in the debate team allowed her to acquire and practice valuable skills for public speaking. Debate team members regularly engage in exercises and competitions that involve researching various topics, formulating arguments, and delivering those arguments in a clear and persuasive manner. In doing so, participants learn to think critically, articulate their points effectively, and respond promptly to opposing arguments. Elena's experience on the debate team would have likely given her the ability to structure her thoughts logically and persuasively. She would be comfortable speaking in front of an audience as she has been through several debates and practice sessions. Additionally, she would be familiar with active listening and responding quickly to counterarguments, which are crucial skills for public speaking. Option 2: Carrie was better at public speaking. Despite not being on the debate team, Carrie might have had other experiences or natural abilities that made her a better public speaker than Elena. For example, she could have been involved in theater or other extracurricular activities that required effective communication and presentation skills. Carrie might also have experienced unique personal situations where she had to master the art of public speaking. Furthermore, some individuals possess innate talents that make them excellent communicators, even without any experience in debate or public speaking. Carrie could have been gifted with an influential tone or a charismatic presence that made her a highly compelling speaker. In summary, while it might seem intuitive to assume that Elena, as a debate team member, would be a better public speaker than Carrie, who was not, one must consider various factors, experiences, and innate talents before making a final judgment. Both Elena and Carrie could have developed their public speaking skills through different experiences and potentially excelled in their own unique ways based on their individual strengths."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In the early morning of 10 April, leading elements of the Austrian army crossed the Inn River and invaded Bavaria. The early Austrian attack surprised the French; Napoleon himself was still in Paris when he heard about the invasion. He arrived at Donauwörth on the 17th to find the Grande Armée in a dangerous position, with its two wings separated by 75 miles (121 km) and joined together by a thin cordon of Bavarian troops. Charles pressed the left wing of the French army and hurled his men towards the III Corps of Marshal Davout. In response, Napoleon came up with a plan to cut off the Austrians in the celebrated Landshut Maneuver. He realigned the axis of his army and marched his soldiers towards the town of Eckmühl. The French scored a convincing win in the resulting Battle of Eckmühl, forcing Charles to withdraw his forces over the Danube and into Bohemia.

The AA said it was an ambitious timetable and that the practical and economic impacts needed to be examined. Clean Air In London said it was a wish list Mr Johnson wants others to do as he would only be mayor until 2016. London is among the worst in Europe for air pollution. Environmental Organisation ClientEarth has warned that in terms of European Union rules, London will have \\"illegal levels of air pollution until 2025\\". A London Assembly report last December found that 9% of deaths in the city were down to air pollution. In a speech to City Hall, Mr Johnson said: \\"Creating the world's first big city ultra low emission zone has the potential to be a game changing moment in the quality of life of our great capital. By Tom EdwardsTransport correspondent, London Poor air quality kills over 4,000 Londoners a year prematurely and many believe it is one of the largest public health crises facing the capital. The mayor has tried to cut pollution with cleaner buses, dust suppressors and green walls but London still breaches European limits. And that means large EU fines loom. There are also court cases ongoing with the government under pressure to show it's cleaning up our air. The authorities here are trying to show they are taking action. The question is will this idea of an ultra low emission zone in 2020 be enough? Legislation is already to an extent cleaning up cars and HGVs. Hauliers have welcomed dropping stricter Euro V limits on HGVs. But campaigners are really angry saying that is a backwards step. What is really striking is the lack of any detail. Transport for London has not even a timeline on a consultation and has not appointed any staff to look at this yet - so this is very early days. Environmental lawyers currently taking the government to court over air quality say this is nothing more than a PR stunt. Without details it's difficult to know. \\"My vision is a central zone where almost all the vehicles running during working hours are either zero or low emission. \\"This would deliver incredible benefits in air quality and stimulate the delivery and mass use of low emission technology.\\" City Hall said the mayor recognised that more work was required and believes his proposal would act as a challenge for vehicle manufacturers to ensure more affordable and low-emission technologies were in place. Simon Birkett from Clean Air In London said the timescale was far too long and that it would only cover the central Congestion Zone. \\"It's the biggest public health risk after smoking and we need bold action - he should have been starting on this in 2008 need bold action in two or three years, not seven or eight,\\" he added. Jenny Jones, the Green Party's London Assembly member, said the scheme was first put to the mayor by the Assembly in 2009. She added that London had been in breach of European guidelines for pollutant nitrogen dioxide since 2010. \\"This is excellent news for Londoners' health, but leaving it as a project for the next mayor to deliver is a way of ducking responsibility for the problems we're facing now,\\" she said. A spokesman for the AA said it was a tight timetable and questioned what impact this would have on police cars, ambulances, fire engines and vehicles used for essential deliveries. He added that decisions made now would be affected by this change such as companies buying a fleet of taxis would need to know if the vehicles would not be allowed in the zone in seven years. The mayor also announced that phase five of the Low Emission Zone would now only apply to TfL buses, which would save Â£350m in costs for businesses. Mr Birkett said this was a backward step, especially as the low emission zone was the mayor's own policy. The mayor also plans to introduce 1,600 hybrid buses by 2016 and a further Â£20m fund to help boroughs tackle local air quality hotspots.","completion":"Mr. Johnson, who was the mayor of London, said that by 2020, only cars that don't make much pollution could drive in central London. The AA said this was a big plan and they needed to think about how it would really work and how much it would cost. London has very bad air pollution and it can make people sick. Mr. Johnson wanted to make the air cleaner with things like cleaner buses and special walls that help make the air better. But, some people think his plan is not enough and it should be done sooner. The mayor also wanted to add more buses that make less pollution by 2016 and give more money to help fix the air pollution problem in some areas."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It warms the engine and oil and eases start-up. Engine block heaters are not expensive, but they must be installed properly by a mechanic. Your car's battery can deliver much more power when it's warm. You can do this using a battery wrap. A battery wrap or blanket is usually a fixed installation of insulation and heating element around the battery. They require about an hour to sufficiently warm the battery. Parking indoors, in a garage, helps to shelter a car's engine from icy winds and freezing temperatures. Heat the garage, if possible, to keep the temperature warmer. In the extreme cold, oil thickens and doesn't flow quickly to vital engine parts that need lubrication. A lightweight, winter-grade oil flows easier in cold weather and increases fuel economy. Your owner's manual should tell you the ideal type of oil you should use. Gas line antifreeze, also known as dry gas, is a chemical (essentially Methyl Hydrate) that is added to your gas tank to inhibit your gas line freezing. If your gas line freezes, your car will not be able to start until it thaws. Many gas stations already add an anti-freeze agent into their gas during colder weather months. Check with your station of choice and see if this is their practice. Add dry gas to your petrol or gas fill-up before filling the tank (if possible) to ensure it mixes completely in the tank. A fuel conditioner is a multi-functional diesel fuel additive. A diesel engine will start better in the cold if you use fuel conditioner, which prevents the fuel from \\"gelling\\" and ensures reliable fuel performance in severe winter conditions. Condensation on the walls of a gas tank will form and will eventually sink to the bottom and cause freezing problems in your fuel lines.

Mexico’s president: Still no way we’ll build Trump’s wall Mexico’s president insisted Sunday there’s no way his country will pony up to build the border wall being touted by Donald Trump — but vowed to work with the tycoon if he becomes commander in chief. “I believe that any of the candidates, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Trump, I’m sure that both of them would like to build good conditions and better wellness for their people. So my position is very clear. We are very respectful to whomever is elected. We want to build a positive and constructive relation among Mexico and to whomever becomes president of United States,” Enrique Peña Nieto said on CNN’s “Fareed Zakaria GPS.” A cornerstone of Trump’s platform in the presidential race is a pledge to build a wall between the US and Mexico – and to make the Mexicans pay for it. Nieto, reiterating comments he made last March, said there “is no way that Mexico can pay a wall like that.” Asked about Trump’s claims that Mexico is sending criminals, rapists, drug dealers — to the U.S., Nieto denied it. “That is not true. I categorically — categorically deny it,” he said. “What is true is that both governments are working together, have a close coordination in order to battle these kind of guys. I mean, there are drug leaders which have a place to work, Mexico and United States. And both governments are giving the battle to them,” the Mexican president added. Nieto spoke in English in order “to have a very clear statement,” he said, though he reverted to his native Spanish later in the interview in order to be more precise. Nieto, however, was careful not to meddle in his neighboring country’s election. “I am very respectful on the democratic process that is being taken place in U.S. We are not part of that decision that has to be made by the American society.” In March, Nieto said “there is no scenario” under which Mexico would pay for a wall. “I have to say that I regret (the plan), and of course, I can’t agree with this American politician’s position.” What are the most important parts of this text?","completion":"The most important parts of this text are as follows: 1.

Rose Bengal was first used in the early 1900s as a dye for food, textiles and cosmetics. But now it is proving to be a useful weapon in the fight against skin cancer. Television advertisements constantly warn of the dangers of overexposure to the fierce sun. Among them is the possibility of the disease melanoma , a type of skin cancer. More than 1,200 Australians die every year from the disease. Initial trials of a solution of Rose Bengal injected into some melanoma cells have had a 75 percent success rate in controlling the disease. Professor John Thompson, the director of the Melanoma Unit at the University of Sydney, says this organic dye could become a powerful cancer-fighting treatment. \\"We believe it works by getting into the tumor cells and causing them to self-destruct. But the exact mechanism by which it works is not totally clear. It's not useful for people who have a primary melanoma.

Read this article and answer this question Julian Scherner was born on September 23, 1895 in the town of Bagamoyo in German East Africa, where he lived until the age of two. Scherner attended the cadet schools, Kadettenanstalt, Karlsruhe between October 1, 1905 and 1911 and Berlin-Lichterfield between 1911 and 1914. Scherner was enlisted in the infantrie rgt. 114 between March 15, 1912 and August 10, 1914. During this time, Scherner earned the rank of Fähnrich in April 1914 and received officer rank on August 5, 1914. In 1914, he joined the Reichsheer or Imperial army. Scherner served in World War 1 as a Zugführer (military), Kompanieführer, company commander and platoon leader. Scherner was injured by shell splinters and rifle fire in the ankle and head respectively and was hospitalized between 1914-1915. After Scherner was released from the hospital, in 1915, he returned to his military unit but was captured by the French in May 1915. Scherner was honored with the Iron Cross second class and the Wound Badge in black and subsequently discharged from the military on March 30, 1920 with the rank of Oberleutnant.

Instructions: Generate an explanation for the given claim using the provided supporting material from the paragraph. Please consider the following points while generating an output. 1) The claim will always have supporting proof in the paragraph, and the paragraph will have a clear point of view supporting the claim. 2) There can be instances where direct correlation to the claim is not available. Make use of the sentences in the paragraph to provide a corresponding output supporting the claim. 3) The explanation should be at least one and at most twelve sentences long. Input: Paragraph: There is also the revival of the humble foam roller, which experts say, like old-time push-ups, squats and planks, has never been more popular. Anita Golden, fitness manager at a Crunch gym in New York City, said she’ll be giving clients a foam roller called the GRID. “We’ve always had foam rollers in the club but now more people are using them as a way to ease post-workout muscles, prevent injuries and exercise the core,” Golden said. When it comes to big-ticket items, Colleen Logan of Icon Health and Fitness, which manufactures a number of fitness brands, said the treadmill remains the most popular gift. “Treadmills continue to lead the industry in terms of home fitness purchases,” said Logan. They account for about 57 percent of fitness purchases, while elliptical trainers and stationary bicycles are a distant second and third place at about 8 percent each. The average home treadmill costs about 700, said Logan, but the technology revolution has transformed even this stalwart at the high end. The ultimate splurge, at 4,000, she said, is the Boston Marathon Treadmill, which allows users to adjust speed in 1/10 of a mile per hour increments without touching the console. It also lets users run a virtual Boston Marathon. For people on a smaller budget, there is the iFit app that lets the iPhone capture a favorite vacation run or bike ride in Hawaii, store it in data centers all over the world which collectively are referred to as the “cloud,” and download it to an iFit-enabled treadmill at home. “You’ll view the exact route and experience the same terrain again,” Logan explained. Devices, gadgets and apps proliferate as tech-savvy fitness becomes more accessible, according to Jessica Matthews of the American Council on Exercise (ACE). “There’s a lot of interest in on-body monitoring devices as ways to motivate and track progress,” she said. “They run the gamut from basic devices to track hours, steps, and caloric expenditure to full-body tracking.” Nike+ Sportsband has a series of small lights on the wrist band that change from red to green as the runner nears his goal, while the BodyMedia FIT Armband tracks everything from the number of calories burned to the quality and quantity of sleep. ACE also studied fitness DVDs released for the holidays. “We evaluated them for quality of instruction, safety, effectiveness and design of workout,” Matthews said. Among the best were “Amy Dixon’s Breathless Body Vol.2: The Edge.” Matthews called it a challenging cardio workout best suited to those on your list with “an established base of fitness.” “Jessica Smith’s 10 Pounds Down Better Body Blast” also got a thumbs up for its well-rounded routine and clarity of instruction. For people seeking a mind-body approach, Matthews praised “STOTT Pilates Intense Body Blast: Pilates Interval Training: Level I,” which she said is accessible for someone new to fitness. “They do a great job queuing movements and creating flow,” she said. Richard Cotton of the American College of Sports Medicine suggests giving the fitness novice the gift of a personal trainer. “The best is human assistance,” he said. “Another way is a beginner group exercise class.” He also suggests a gift certificate for shoes at a running store equipped with a treadmill. “You need shoes that fit your gait,” he said. “People should always get their gait analyzed.” Golden likes to cite the law of reciprocity to the personal trainers she manages. “I always tell them to get their clients something,” she said. And what does the personal trainer want for Christmas? “I like the roller, or a new jump rope,” she said. “Fitness people aren’t hard to please. Get me a new yoga mat and I’m happy.” Claim: Holiday fitness gifts trend from high-tech to basic. Output:","completion":"The holiday fitness gifts trend from high-tech to basic can be supported by the various products mentioned in the paragraph.

And that led it to be adopted by a much larger tribe--the business tribe. You cannot wear a tie if you work with machinery. So wearing a tie became a sign that you were a man who used your brain to make a living, rather than your hands. It showed you were serious. It showed you were a professional. It meant that everyone who wanted a job in business had to wear one. It was just impossible to take seriously a man who didn't wear a piece of color1ed silk around his neck. This is how millions of people came to be wearing ties across the world. They are part of the uniform of business. \\"Ties offer a point of indifference,\\" says John Milne, head of the British Guide of Tie Makers. \\"They give a chance to say something about their own personality.\\" So if you happen to meet a man with a very brightly color1ed tie, there is a good chance that he is the office joker. There is also a good chance that he will be wearing brightly color1ed socks. Is there a future for ties? The signs are not promising. Tie wearing seems to be rare among the new bread of entrepreneurs in the Internet and new technology industries. Many political leaders,including British Prime Minister Tony Blair, now go without ties. This shows they are men of the people--but not the people wearing ties. Up until around 1960, it was common for men across the Western world to wear hats as part of their business uniform. That changed with the election of John F. Kennedy to the presidency of the United States. Kennedy never wore a hat in fact his nickname was\\"hatless Jack\\". Seeing that the most powerful man in the world did not have to wear a hat, millions of other men decided that they did not have to, either. Hats simply vanished across the Western world.

It may have minor direct or indirect effects on the process, but it won't halt the recycling of aluminum cans. Let's analyze each step to understand the implications of the delay: 1. The consumer throws aluminum cans and foil into a recycle bin - No effect, as the consumer has done their part by properly disposing of the items. 2. The aluminum is collected - Minor direct effect, as the collection will be delayed because the recycling truck is late. However, the collection will still happen once the truck arrives. 3. Taken to a treatment plant - Minor indirect effect, as the transportation of aluminum to the treatment plant will also be delayed due to the recycling truck's delay. The aluminum will still reach the plant, just a bit later than scheduled. 4. The aluminum is sorted and cleaned ready for reprocessing - No direct effect, as this step will proceed as usual once the aluminum arrives at the treatment plant. 5. The aluminum is re-melted - No direct effect, as the re-melting process will not be affected by the previous delay. It will happen normally once the aluminum has been sorted and cleaned. 6. Turned into molten aluminum - No direct effect, as this step is also independent of the recycling truck's delay. 7. The aluminum is made into large blocks called ingots - No direct effect, as the delay in collecting aluminum has no impact on the process of making ingots. 8. The ingots are sent to mills to be rolled out - No direct effect, as the rolling process will continue as planned once the ingots are available. 9. The rolled out product is made into new aluminum products - No direct effect, as the final production of new aluminum products will not be affected by the recycling truck's delay. In summary, the perturbation hypothesis of the recycling truck being late has only minor direct and indirect effects on the process of recycling aluminum cans. The cans will still be recycled, just with a slight delay in collection and transportation to the treatment plant.

Werner Forssmann (Nobel prize winner in 1956) Forssmann was a German scientist. He studied how to put a pipe inside the heart to measure the pressure inside and decide whether a patient needs surgery. Experiments had been done on horses before, so he wanted to try with human patients. But it was not permitted because the experiment was considered too dangerous. Not giving up, Forssmann decided to experiment on himself. He anaesthetized his own arm and made a cut, putting the pipe 30 centimeters into his vein. He then climbed two floors to the X-ray room before pushing the pipe all the way into his heart. 2. Barry Marshall (Nobel prize winner in 2005) Most doctors in the mid-20th century believed that _ was down to stress, spicy food or an unusually large amount of stomach acid. But in 1979 an Australian scientist named Robin Warren found that the disease might be related to a bacteria called Helicobacter pylori. So he teamed up with his colleague, Barry Marshall, to continue the study. When their request to experiment on patients was denied, Marshall bravely drank some of the bacteria. Five days later, he lost his appetite and soon was vomiting each morning - he indeed had gastritis. 3. Ralph Steinman (Nobel prize winner in 2011) This Canadian scientist discovered a new type of immune system cell called the dendritic cell. He believed that it had the ability to fight against cancer. Steinman knew he couldn't yet use his method to treat patients. So in 2007, when doctors told him that he had cancer and that it was unlikely for him to live longer than a year, he saw an opportunity. With the help of his colleagues, he gave himself three different vaccines based on his research and a total of eight experimental therapies. Even though Steinman eventually died from his cancer, he lived four and a half years, much longer than doctors had said he would. 1. Do chemists usually use rats for their testing? 2.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: Information: - Claudio Merulo (8 April 1533 4 May 1604) was an Italian composer, publisher and organist of the late Renaissance period, most famous for his innovative keyboard music and his ensemble music composed in the Venetian polychoral style. He was born in Correggio and died in Parma. Born Claudio Merlotti, he Latinised his surname (meaning little blackbird) when he became famous in Venetian cultural clubs. - Anna Guarini, Contessa Trotti (1563 3 May 1598) was an Italian virtuoso singer of the late Renaissance. She was one of the most renowned singers of the age, and was one of the four \\"concerto di donne\\" at the Ferrara court of the d'Este family, for whom many composers wrote in a progressive style. - Luigi d'Este (21 December 1538 30 December 1586) was an Italian Catholic cardinal, the second of the five children of Ercole II d'Este, Duke of Modena and Ferrara, and Renée, daughter of Louis XII of France. Biography. Luigi, a member of the House of Este, was born in Ferrara. A man of the world whose personal emblem was Prometheus bearing fire in the stalk of fennel, he was made a Cardinal of the Roman Catholic Church in Pius IV's consistory of 26 February 1561 and served as Cardinal Protector of the kingdom of France, which made him one of the most powerful and influential members of the College of Cardinals; he kept as his secretary Arnaud d'Ossat, a skillful French diplomat who was eventually made a cardinal himself. - Luzzasco Luzzaschi (c. 1545 10 September 1607) was an Italian composer, organist, and teacher of the late Renaissance. He was born and died in Ferrara, and despite evidence of travels to Rome it is assumed that Luzzaschi spent the majority of his life in his native city. He was a skilled representative of the late Italian madrigal style, along with Palestrina, Wert, Monte, Lassus, Marenzio, Gesualdo and others. - Girolamo Alessandro Frescobaldi (also Gerolamo, Girolimo, and Geronimo Alissandro; September, 15831 March 1643) was a musician from Ferrara, one of the most important composers of keyboard music in the late Renaissance and early Baroque periods. A child prodigy, Frescobaldi studied under Luzzasco Luzzaschi in Ferrara, but was influenced by a large number of composers, including Ascanio Mayone, Giovanni Maria Trabaci, and Claudio Merulo. Girolamo Frescobaldi was appointed organist of St. Peter's Basilica, a focal point of power for the Capella Giulia (a musical organisation) from 21 July 1608 until 1628 and again from 1634 until his death. - An aria (plural: \\"arie\\" , or \\"arias\\" in common usage, diminutive form arietta or ariette) in music was originally any expressive melody, usually, but not always, performed by a singer. The term became used almost exclusively to describe a self-contained piece for one voice, with or without orchestral accompaniment, normally part of a larger work. The typical context for arias is opera, but vocal arias also feature in oratorios and cantatas, sharing features of the operatic arias of their periods. - Giovanni Maria Trabaci (ca. 1575 31 December 1647) was an Italian composer and organist. He was a prolific composer, with some 300 surviving works preserved in more than 10 publications; he was especially important for his keyboard music. - Torquato Tasso (11 March 1544 25 April 1595) was an Italian poet of the 16th century, best known for his poem \\"Gerusalemme liberata\\" (\\"Jerusalem Delivered\\", 1581), in which he depicts a highly imaginative version of the combats between Christians and Muslims at the end of the First Crusade, during the Siege of Jerusalem. He suffered from mental illness and died a few days before he was due to be crowned as the king of poets by the Pope. Until the beginning of the 20th century, Tasso remained one of the most widely read poets in Europe. - The concerto delle donne (\\"lit.\\" consort of ladies) was a group of professional female singers in the late Renaissance court of Ferrara, Italy, renowned for their technical and artistic virtuosity. The ensemble was founded by Alfonso II, Duke of Ferrara, in 1580 and was active until the court was dissolved in 1597. Giacomo Vincenti, a music publisher, praised the women as \\"\\"virtuose giovani\\"\\" (young virtuosas), echoing the sentiments of contemporaneous diarists and commentators. - Ascanio Mayone (ca. 1565 1627) was a Neapolitan composer and harpist. He trained as a pupil of Giovanni de Macque in Naples, and worked at Santissima Annunziata Maggiore there as organist from 1593 and \\"maestro di cappella\\" from 1621; he was also organist at the royal chapel from 1602. He published madrigals, but his main work is his two volumes of keyboard music, \\"Capricci per sonar\\" (1603, 1609). These contain canzonas, toccatas, variations, and arrangements of vocal pieces, many of which are distinctively Baroque rather than Renaissance in style. - Isabella Bendidio ( Marchesa Bentivoglio ) ( 13 September 1546 -- after 1610 ) was a Ferrarese noblewoman who , along with her sister Lucrezia Bendidio , sang in the first incarnation of the concerto delle donne as part of the court 's musica secreta . She married Cornelio Bentivoglio , a powerful nobleman and member of the Bentivoglio family , in 1573 , at which point she may have stopped singing at court . She was the mother of Guido and Enzo Bentivoglio , who were the earliest patrons of Girolamo Frescobaldi . She was also the aunt of Anna Guarini , who later replaced her in the concerto delle donne . - Aminta is a play written by Torquato Tasso in 1573, represented during a garden party at the court of Ferrara. Both the actors and the public were noble persons living at the Court, who could understand subtle allusions the poet made to that style of life, in contrast with the life of shepherds, represented in an idyllic way. - The Papal Basilica of St. Peter in the Vatican, or simply St. Peter's Basilica, is an Italian Renaissance church in Vatican City, the papal enclave within the city of Rome. - Giacomo Vincenti (died 1619) was an Italian bookseller and music printer from Venice. He also spelled his name Vincenci and Vincenzi. He started printing in 1583. His partner was Ricciardo Amadino, and between 1583 and 1586 they printed about twenty books a year, mostly editions of music. Although their official partnership ended in 1586 they continued to use the same typefaces, collaborated on some editions, and held joint copyrights in others. In 1587, Vincenti published Luca Marenzio's Fourth Book of Madrigals, with the composer's dedication. - Lucrezia Bendidio (Signora or Contessa Machiavella) (April 8, 1547 \\" after\\" 1584) was an Italian singer and noblewoman from Ferrara. She started as a lady-in-waiting for Leonora d'Este in 1561. Many poets wrote of her great skill as a singer, including Torquato Tasso and Giovanni Battista Pigna. She was in fact an early love of Tasso's in 1561, as well as of Cardinal Luigi d'Este and Pigna. Tasso's character \\"Licori\\" in his play \\"Aminta\\" was based on her. She was part of the famous \\"Concerto delle donne\\" during its early period. She was later married to Count Baldassare Macchiavelli of Ferrara. With her sister Isabella Bendidio she sang for private court evenings as part of the \\"musica secreta\\" of the court. Another sister, Taddea, married Giovanni Battista Guarini; their daughter Anna Guarini was a singer in the \\"concerto delle donne\\" during the second period. - A composer (Latin \\"compn\\"; literally \\"one who puts together\\") is a person who creates or writes music, which can be vocal music (for a singer or choir), instrumental music (e.g., for solo piano, string quartet, wind quintet or orchestra) or music which combines both instruments and voices (e.g., opera or art song, which is a singer accompanied by a pianist). The core meaning of the term refers to individuals who have contributed to the tradition of Western classical music through creation of works expressed in written musical notation (e.g., sheet music scores). - Ferrara is a city and \\"comune\\" in Emilia-Romagna, northern Italy, capital city of the Province of Ferrara. It is situated north-northeast of Bologna, on the Po di Volano, a branch channel of the main stream of the Po River, located north. The town has broad streets and numerous palaces dating from the 14th and 15th centuries, when it hosted the court of the House of Este. For its beauty and cultural importance it has been qualified by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site. Modern times have brought a renewal of industrial activity. Ferrara is on the main rail line from Bologna to Padua and Venice, and has branches to Ravenna, Poggio Rusco (for Suzzara) and Codigoro. - Cornelio Bentivoglio (27 March 166830 December 1732) was an Italian nobleman and cardinal.

Please answer the following question: Given the below context: During a Fitzroy Football Club benefit concert with other Neighbours cast members, Minogue performed \\"I Got You Babe\\" as a duet with actor John Waters, and \\"The Loco-Motion\\" as an encore. She was subsequently signed to a recording contract with Mushroom Records in 1987. Her first single, \\"The Locomotion\\", spent seven weeks at number one on the Australian singles charts and became the country's highest-selling single in the 1980s. She received the ARIA Award for the year's highest-selling single. Its success resulted in Minogue travelling to England with Mushroom Records executive Gary Ashley to work with producers Stock, Aitken & Waterman. They knew little of Minogue and had forgotten that she was arriving; as a result, they wrote \\"I Should Be So Lucky\\" while she waited outside the studio. The song reached number one in the United Kingdom, Australia, Germany, Finland, Switzerland, Israel and Hong Kong. Minogue won her second consecutive ARIA Award for the year's highest-selling single, and received a \\"Special Achievement Award\\". Minogue's debut album, Kylie was released in July 1988. The album was a collection of dance-oriented pop tunes and spent more than a year on the UK Albums Chart, including several weeks at number one. The album went gold in the United States, and the single, \\"The Locomotion\\", reached number three on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart, and number one on the Canadian Singles Chart. The single \\"Got to Be Certain\\" became her third consecutive number one single on the Australian music charts. Later in the year, she left Neighbours to focus on her music career. Minogue also collaborated with Jason Donovan for the song \\"Especially for You\\", which peaked at number-one in the United Kingdom and in December 2014 sold its one millionth copy in the UK. Minogue was sometimes referred to as \\"the Singing Budgie\\" by her detractors over the coming years.

Oil company Royal Dutch Shell will pay 15.5 million to settle a lawsuit against its Nigerian subsidiary by the family of executed Nigerian environmental activist Ken Saro-Wiwa and other dissidents, the plaintiffs announced Monday. A team from Royal Dutch Shell works amid spilled oil in Atali, Nigeria. The lawsuit accuses Shell of complicity in the 1995 hanging of Saro-Wiwa and the killings or persecution of other environmental activists by the military government that ruled the country at the time. Roughly half of the settlement will go into a trust fund to help the people of Nigeria's Ogoni region, according to court papers. \\"In reaching this settlement, we were very much aware that we are not the only Ogonis who have suffered in our struggle with Shell, which is why we insisted on creating the Kiisi Trust,\\" Saro-Wiwa's son, Ken Saro-Wiwa Jr., said in a statement accompanying the settlement. Nigeria's Ogoni people have complained for years that Shell was allowed to pollute its land without consequences. Saro-Wiwa's death sparked a worldwide outcry, and his movement ultimately forced Shell out of the oil- and gas-rich Ogoniland region. There was no immediate response from Shell to Monday's settlement. The New York-based Center for Constitutional Rights went to court on behalf of Saro-Wiwa's family and others in 1996. Shell fought the lawsuit until last week, when a federal appellate court ruled that the plaintiffs could sue the company's Nigerian subsidiary in American courts, overturning a March decision in the company's favor. \\"This was one of the first cases to charge a multinational corporation with human-rights violations, and this settlement confirms that multinational corporations can no longer act with the impunity they once enjoyed,\\" plaintiff's lawyer Jennie Green said in a statement released with the settlement.

Passage:The medicinal use of wine was frequently studied by the Greeks, including Hippocrates, who did extensive research on the topic. He used wine as a cure for fevers, to ease convalescence and as an antiseptic. He also studied the effect of wine on his patients' stool. Various types of wine were prescribed by Greek doctors for use as an analgesic, diuretic, tonic and digestive aid. The Greeks were also aware of some negative health effects, especially those arising from the consumption of wine beyond moderation. Athenaeus made frequent mention of wine's ability to induce hangover and suggested various remedies for it. The poet Eubulus noted that three bowls (kylikes) were the ideal amount of wine to consume. The quantity of three bowls to represent moderation is a recurring theme throughout Greek writing (today, the standard 750 ml bottle contains roughly three to six glasses of wine, depending on serving size).

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which city had less child mortality? Hint: One of the most adverse impacts of poor waste management, especially municipal waste, is the incidence and prevalence of diseases such as malaria and respiratory problems, as well as other illnesses through the contamination of ground water. Biomedical wastes pose great danger in Bangladesh too as a report estimated that 20% of the biomedical waste is \\"highly infectious\\" and is a hazard since it is often disposed of into the sewage system or drains.[6] Such poor sanitation has serious consequences for the health of the residents and a report suggests that \\"most of the child mortality could be related with this problem\\".[7] With regards to the living standards, solid waste leads to blockage in the drainage system which leads to flooding in the streets. Consequently, mosquitoes and bad odour are among the negative impacts resulted.[7] The answer to this question is:","completion":"City Y had less child mortality. Based on the given information, City Y had a good disposal site for biomedical waste management, which significantly reduces the risk of contamination, diseases, and health hazards. On the other hand, City X faced issues with poor waste management, as the biomedical waste contaminated the groundwater and affected the population. The hint provided states that poor sanitation has serious consequences for the health of residents, and a report suggests that \\"most of the child mortality could be related to this problem.\\" Given that City Y had an effective biomedical waste management system in place, it is reasonable to assume that the city had a lower incidence and prevalence of diseases such as malaria and respiratory problems, along with other illnesses caused by contamination of groundwater. This would be due to a reduced risk of exposure to hazardous materials for the population living in City Y. As a result, City Y would be expected to have a lower child mortality rate compared to City X, where poor waste management has negatively impacted the population's health. Moreover, the living standards in City Y are likely to be better than those in City X, as the well-managed waste disposal system would minimize the occurrence of issues such as flooding, mosquitoes, and bad odors."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

They're trying to keep us in the dark.\\" Following the Oct. 8 incident, Correctional Service Canada issued a bare-bones statement saying a Millhaven inmate had been sent to hospital following an assault, and both the prison and provincial police had been called in to investigate. Fontenelle's family said they only discovered what had happened because another inmate alerted a friend, who told Brown. Millhaven Institution near Kingston, Ont., is a maximum-security prison that has seen inmate violence before. (Lars Hagberg/Canadian Press) From what they have been able to piece together, several men assaulted Fontenelle, 34, of Toronto, who was serving a three-year sentence for gun possession and was soon to be paroled. He spent a week in intensive care at a hospital in Kingston, Ont., before being transferred to the prison hospital. On Friday, his parole officer said he had been moved to a rehab hospital, where he was expected to spend at least a month, said Fontenelle's father, James Fontenelle Sr., 74, of Brampton, Ont. However, the hospital told him their son was not there, the distraught father said. \\"We have to go through so many people to get any information,\\" he said. \\"People have been hanging up phones on us. Telling us we can't call. It's very disturbing.\\" Fontenelle Sr. said two guards were stationed at the intensive care unit yet no one was able to prevent the beating that left his son unable to walk, sit up or barely speak. Both he and Brown said they were given the runaround trying to arrange to see Fontenelle -- and when they were allowed to see him, it was under severely restricted circumstances. The hospital directed calls for information to the prison, which said they could not provide any, he said. \\"It's traumatic for us just him being in jail much less to be going through this,\\" the father said. Provincial police confirmed Fontenelle was taken to hospital in critical condition following an assault that occurred when three inmates entered his cell. Three inmates faced charges of assault causing bodily harm and were to appear in court in Napanee, Ont., on Dec. 3, police said. Fontenelle was one of the last inmates to be moved from Kingston penitentiary, which closed Sept. 30, prompting questions about whether overcrowding at Millhaven played a role in what happened. \\"I would surmise that the closure has resulted in more than one issue thus far,\\" said prisoner advocate Lee Chapelle. A few weeks before the beating, a parole officer visited the Fontenelles to discuss their son's pending release, his father said. The family was anxiously looking forward to having him home but that has been thrown into doubt now. \\"We were making plans to have him and making plans to be with Andrew to turn his life around,\\" his father said. \\"He was looking forward to it, too.\\" While the inmate has made progress as swelling on his brain diminishes, his prognosis remains unclear to his family. \\"My sadness lies with how worn the parents have grown throughout this,\\" Chapelle said. Assistant warden Vicki Willis refused to return calls seeking comment. In a statement, Correctional Service Canada said it adheres to protocols and could not discuss the situation due to privacy rules and because the matter was under investigation. What was this article about?","completion":"This article is about an inmate, James (Andrew) Fontenelle, who was brutally beaten at Millhaven penitentiary in Ontario, leaving him with severe brain injuries and on life support. His family accuses the prison authorities of deliberately withholding information about the incident and treating them disrespectfully. They say that the prison did not notify them about Fontenelle's condition and are not providing any information due to privacy policies. The incident is under investigation, with three inmates facing charges of assault causing bodily harm. The family is also questioning if overcrowding at Millhaven played a role in the incident, as Fontenelle was one of the last inmates to be moved from Kingston penitentiary, which closed recently."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Justin and Thomas are two college students conducting an experiment in their chemistry laboratory course. They are mixing together acids and bases to produce sodium based compounds. Justin conducts his reactions at a high temperature, while Thomas conducts his reactions at a lower temperature. If Thomas wanted the rate of his reactions to be similar to Justin's, should he increase or decrease the temperature of his reactions?","completion":"If Thomas wants the rate of his reactions to be similar to Justin's, he should increase the temperature of his reactions. In chemistry, the rate of a reaction depends on the temperature at which the reaction occurs. Higher temperatures generally result in faster reaction rates because the particles have more kinetic energy, leading to more frequent and effective collisions between reactant molecules. Since Justin is conducting his reactions at a high temperature, his reaction rates will be faster than Thomas's, who is working at a lower temperature. For Thomas to achieve a similar reaction rate as Justin, he must increase the temperature of his reactions. However, it is important to mention that increasing the temperature might have different effects on yield or product formation depending on the specific reaction being studied. If a specific product is desired, the temperature might need to be optimized carefully."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You would really need several tools to do justice to these various types of wood to cut Please fix the punctuation.","completion":"To adequately address the task of cutting various types of wood, it is essential to utilize several tools to accomplish this job effectively. With a diverse range of woods, each with its unique hardness, grain pattern, and general workability, choosing the appropriate tools becomes a crucial step in guaranteeing precise and efficient cuts. First and foremost, a versatile and robust table saw should be part of your arsenal. This power tool allows for accurate straight cuts and can handle a wide range of wood thicknesses. A table saw can also be fitted with different blades, such as a crosscut blade for finer cuts and a rip blade for cutting along the wood's grain. Another indispensable tool is a miter saw, which enables precise angled cuts, making it ideal for creating frames, molding, and other woodworking projects that require exact angles. Additionally, a miter saw can be equipped with a compound feature, allowing for both angled and beveled cuts simultaneously. A bandsaw is yet another essential tool for cutting wood, particularly when it comes to making curved or irregular cuts. Its versatility stems from the ability to adjust the blade and table to accommodate different cutting angles and shapes. Furthermore, a bandsaw's thin blade produces a narrower kerf, ultimately reducing waste. Jigsaws provide more flexibility and freedom when it comes to cutting intricate and complex shapes in wood. With various blades available, they can be tailored to meet the specific needs of different applications. This handheld power tool is particularly useful for cutting patterns and shapes that a bandsaw cannot handle. For carving finer details and creating intricate patterns, a high-quality set of wood chisels is essential. These hand tools are invaluable for woodworking projects that demand precision and finesse. Lastly, a circular saw should not be overlooked in the cutting of various types of wood. Despite being primarily used for cutting large sheets of material, a circular saw is a handy tool for making quick, straight cuts in smaller pieces of wood. In summary, when it comes to cutting different types of wood, having a diverse array of tools at your disposal is critical. A well-stocked workshop should include a table saw, miter saw, bandsaw, jigsaw, wood chisels, and a circular saw, which collectively offer the precision, versatility, and efficiency required when working with such a wide variety of materials."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given a command in a limited form of natural language, provide the correct sequence of actions that executes the command to thus navigate an agent in its environment. A command can be broken down into many different actions. Actions are uppercase and are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. The word 'opposite' turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively. There are only six actions: 'I_LOOK', 'I_WALK', 'I_RUN', 'I_JUMP', 'I_TURN_LEFT', and 'I_TURN_RIGHT'.

Question: Given the below context: Nichols comments that, although as a famous pianist Saint-Saëns wrote for the piano throughout his life, \\"this part of his oeuvre has made curiously little mark\\". Nichols excepts the Étude en forme de valse (1912), which he observes still attracts pianists eager to display their left-hand technique. Although Saint-Saëns was dubbed \\"the French Beethoven\\", and his Variations on a Theme of Beethoven in E♭ (1874) is his most extended work for unaccompanied piano, he did not emulate his predecessor in composing piano sonatas. He is not known even to have contemplated writing one. There are sets of bagatelles (1855), études (two sets – 1899 and 1912) and fugues (1920), but in general Saint-Saëns's works for the piano are single short pieces. In addition to established forms such as the song without words (1871) and the mazurka (1862, 1871 and 1882) popularised by Mendelssohn and Chopin, respectively, he wrote descriptive pieces such as \\"Souvenir d'Italie\\" (1887), \\"Les cloches du soir\\" (\\"Evening bells\\", 1889) and \\"Souvenir d'Ismaïlia\\" (1895). Unlike his pupil, Fauré, whose long career as a reluctant organist left no legacy of works for the instrument, Saint-Saëns published a modest number of pieces for organ solo. Some of them were written for use in church services – \\"Offertoire\\" (1853), \\"Bénédiction nuptiale\\" (1859), \\"Communion\\" (1859) and others. After he left the Madeleine in 1877 Saint-Saëns wrote ten more pieces for organ, mostly for concert use, including two sets of preludes and fugues (1894 and 1898). Some of the earlier works were written to be played on either the harmonium or the organ, and a few were primarily intended for the former. Guess a valid title for it!

Like a carefully crafted plan, the Satanists plotted to raise the girl under their watchful eyes, in anticipation of a prophecy that would eventually be fulfilled. Elsewhere in the city, a former police detective, Jericho Cane, struggled with his demons. Plagued by the memories of his wife and daughter’s gruesome murders orchestrated by a contract killer, Jericho found solace in alcohol and sought a way out in a flurry of suicidal thoughts. The once commendable detective was a shell of his former self, and work became a distant priority. To make a living, he joined a private security company, hoping to find purpose in his life once more. As fate would have it, Jericho, along with his co-worker and close friend, Bobby Chicago, received a new assignment that would change the course of their lives. Their directive was to protect a possessed banker, who was plagued by forces not from this world. Although they were skeptical at first, the cloak of darkness that seemed to surround their new client unnerved even the most stoic of hearts. Unbeknownst to Jericho and Bobby, another man named Aquinas had been sent to New York before suddenly disappearing. Driven by a desperate need to uncover the truth about the prophecy, Aquinas had ventured into the city's seedy underworld, searching for answers to the mysterious events unfolding around him. As his trail went cold, the only indication of his existence was a single message he left for Jericho to find – a clue that propelled him into a supernatural battle against time. As the story unraveled, Jericho and Bobby discovered the horrifying truth behind the prophecy. The Satanists planned to bring about the end of days – the apocalypse – by impregnating the child they identified years ago. That innocent girl, now a young woman, was to serve as a vessel for the birth of Satan's progeny. If the prophecy were to unfold, the Satanists would usher in a catastrophic, world-ending event, and their reign of terror would last for eternity. Determined to save the woman and thwart the Satanists' plans, Jericho and Bobby embarked on a treacherous journey through the dark and hidden recesses of New York City. As they uncovered the clandestine network of Satanists operating under the shadows, they fought tooth and nail to preserve the life of an innocent woman caught in the middle of an unholy war. Along the way, Jericho found solidarity with Bobby, healing from the devastating loss of his wife and daughter. United by their mission, they bonded as brothers in arms, and together, they faced insurmountable odds. Driven by the purpose he was once desperately searching for, Jericho discarded the weight of his demons and embraced a renewed sense of determination. As the battle reached its climax, the clock struck midnight on the eve of the prophesied day. In a desperate bid to stop the ritual that would impregnate the woman, Jericho and Bobby confronted the Satanists, including their leader, Abel, and the nurse who had been the woman's guardian. A fierce showdown ensued, as lives were lost and sacrifices were made. Ultimately, Jericho and Bobby succeeded in stopping the prophecy's fulfillment. Through their relentless pursuit and relentless courage, they prevented the devil's spawn from ever coming to fruition and saved the woman who, unknowingly, held the world's fate in her hands. As they stood among the remnants of the defeated Satanists, Jericho and Bobby gazed at the horizon, knowing that their actions had saved the world from a cataclysmic fate. For the first time in years, the city of New York and Jericho Cane's heart were free from the shadow of darkness that had once consumed them. Eternally bound by their efforts, they forged ahead, forever vigilant in protecting humanity from the forces of evil that lurked in the shadows of the world."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I found myself wishing it would transform into a Shakespearean tragedy where everybody kills each other violently in the end--but no such luck.I give it two stars rather than one because the writing is competent, although the story is deliberately and unceasingly vulgar. Ms. Martin is a talented craftsman and I can only assume that she did what she set out to do with this book. I only wonder why she set her aspirations so low. Answer: Answer:","completion":"The tone of this product review is negative. The reviewer expresses their disappointment and distress towards the novel and its content, using phrases like \\"unpleasant,\\" \\"tawdry,\\" \\"repulsive and loathsome,\\" and \\"unceasingly vulgar.\\" The reviewer does acknowledge that the writing is competent and recognizes the author's talent but questions the author's intentions and the low aspirations for the book.

Please answer the following question: I can use this background: Generally, nearsightedness first occurs in school-age children. There is some evidence that myopia is inherited. If one or both of your parents need glasses, there is an increased chance that you will too. Individuals who spend a lot of time reading, working or playing at a computer, or doing other close visual work may also be more likely to develop nearsightedness. Because the eye continues to grow during childhood, myopia typically progresses until about age 20. However, nearsightedness may also develop in adults due to visual stress or health conditions such as diabetes. A common sign of nearsightedness is difficulty seeing distant objects like a movie screen or the TV, or the whiteboard or chalkboard in school. Now, I have a new situation: Two elementary school classmates, Clarence and Molly, are sitting in the back row of the classroom while the teacher lectures. They are both paying attention and reading what the teacher is writing on the board, but Molly is finding it difficult to read what is on the board since it appears blurry. She asks Clarence if the chalkboard looks blurry and he says that it looks clear to him. Molly will ask her mom about it when she gets home from school today.

Write the next sentence in this paragraph: How to be productive at work during a slow week Start on projects or other work scheduled for the following week. One of the best ways to deal with a slow week is to try to get ahead on future work. By getting ahead on future work, you'll use your down time to take the pressure off you at a later date. Options are: *Restrict amount of your time in the morning. Most people are 90% less productive at noon and 9% less at lunch.; *For example, if you would like to do some state-of-the-art new projects, get a short week off to get outside work. Play some board games or meet up for a weekly game night while you wait for a break.; *If you're scheduled to start on a project the following week, begin working on it. While you may not be completely ready to start on this project (based on information or collaboration with other workers), you can begin to lay the foundations of the project.; *Taking this step gives you things to concentrate on and you're less likely to follow through on the tasks or assignments you put off. Put off work and other other projects in your social calendar until the first week.;","completion":"To make the most of a slow week at work, there are several strategies you can employ. One option is to restrict the amount of time you spend on tasks during the morning, as research has shown that most people are 90% less productive at noon and 9% less around lunchtime. By focusing on accomplishing as much as possible early in the day, you can optimize your productivity throughout the week. Alternatively, you might want to take a short break from work to engage in creative activities or socializing, such as playing board games or participating in a weekly game night. This can help recharge your batteries and stimulate innovative thinking for when you return to work. Another option is to dive right into the projects that are scheduled for the following week, even if you don't have all the necessary details or collaborations in place yet. By laying the foundations for these upcoming projects, you'll be better prepared to tackle them head-on when they officially commence, and you'll be less likely to become overwhelmed by the workload. This approach also prevents you from procrastinating on important tasks and helps maintain continuity in your work. Moreover, you can utilize your slow week to rearrange your social calendar and postpone non-urgent tasks and projects until the first week of the following month. By doing so, you ensure that your attention remains focused on what truly matters during the slow week, while also making time for critical assignments during busier periods. In summary, utilizing strategies such as optimizing your morning productivity, engaging in creative breaks, starting on upcoming projects, and reorganizing your social calendar can help make the most of a slow week at work. By staying proactive and focused during these periods, you'll be better prepared to handle future busier weeks with ease and efficiency."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: Sherman McCoy (Tom Hanks) is a Wall Street investor who makes millions while enjoying the good life and the sexual favors of Maria Ruskin (Melanie Griffith), a Southern belle gold digger. Sherman and Maria are driving back to Maria's apartment from JFK Airport when they take a wrong turn on the expressway and the two find themselves in the \\"war-zone\\" of the South Bronx. They are approached by two suspicious black youths after Sherman gets out of the car to move a tire placed purposely in the middle of the road. Sherman jumps back into the car and Maria guns the engine in reverse, running over one of the teenagers and putting him in a coma. The two drive away and decide not to report the accident to the police. Meanwhile, indigent alcoholic journalist Peter Fallow (Bruce Willis), anxious for a story to make good with his editor, comes upon the hit-and-run case as a rallying point for the black community calling upon Jewish district attorney Abe Weiss (F. Murray Abraham), who is the Bronx District Attorney seeking re-election. According to Judge Leonard White (Morgan Freeman), almost all of DA Weiss' prosecutions end up with black and Puerto Rican defendants going to prison and Weiss is seeking a white defendant for purposes of convincing the minority-majority community that he is worth re-electing. Weiss recognizes the press coverage inherent in prosecuting the callow Sherman, who has been discovered as the hit-and-run driver, in order to cultivate the image as an avenger for the minorities and be propelled to the mayorship of New York City. As Sherman is brought to his knees, New York City fragments into different factions who use the case to suit their own cynical purposes. Finally, Sherman is left without any allies to support him except for the sympathetic Judge Leonard White and the remorseful Fallow. Fallow gains a tremendous advantage and insight into the case when he is dating a woman who is the sub-letting landlady of Maria's apartment, and knows of secret recordings of conversations in the apartment... Answer:","completion":"In the movie plot involving Sherman McCoy, Maria Ruskin, and the various individuals tied to the hit-and-run case, several provocative and complex themes are presented, such as greed, corruption, racial tension, and media manipulation.

Guy Carleton, 1st Baron Dorchester, KB (3 September 1724 - 10 November 1808), known between 1776 and 1786 as Sir Guy Carleton, was an Anglo-Irish soldier and administrator. He twice served as Governor of the Province of Quebec, from 1768 to 1778, concurrently serving as Governor General of British North America in that time, and again from 1785 to 1795. The title Baron Dorchester was created on 21 August 1786. He commanded British troops in the American War of Independence, first leading the defence of Quebec during the 1775 rebel invasion and the 1776 counteroffensive that drove the rebels from the province. Upon his return to England Carleton recommended the creation of a position of Governor General of all the provinces in British North America. Instead he was appointed \\"Governor-in-chief\\", with simultaneous appointments as governor of Quebec, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and St. John's Island (present-day Prince Edward Island). He arrived in Quebec on 23 October 1786. His position as Governor-in-chief was mostly ignored. He found quickly that his authority in any of the provinces other than Quebec was effective only while he was present in person. He was raised to the Peerage in August 1786 as Lord Dorchester, Baron of Dorchester in the County of Oxford. The Constitutional Act of 1791 split the large territory of Quebec into Upper and Lower Canada, corresponding roughly to areas settled by ethnic British and ethnic French, respectively. Sir Alured Clarke was named as the lieutenant governor of Lower Canada and John Graves Simcoe the lieutenant governor of Upper Canada. In August 1791 Carleton left for Britain and on 7 February 1792 took his seat in the House of Lords. He left for Canada again on 18 August 1793 to resume his duties there. His replacement, Robert Prescott, arrived in May 1796. On 9 July 1796 Carleton sailed from Canada to Britain, never to return. In retirement Carleton lived mostly at Greywell Hill, adjoining Nately Scures, in Hampshire. After about 1805 he moved to Stubbings House at Burchett's Green, near Maidenhead, in Berkshire. On 10 November 1808, he died suddenly at Stubbings. He was buried in the parish church of St Swithun's, Nately Scures.

Hint: During May, June, and July, the Northern Hemisphere is exposed to more direct sunlight because the hemisphere faces the Sun. The same is true of the Southern Hemisphere in November, December, and January. It is Earth's axial tilt that causes the Sun to be higher in the sky during the summer months, which increases the solar flux.

Due to his disability, he has always been an outcast, often subjected to discrimination and isolation within his community. Despite his inability to hear or speak, Ryu has always held a deep love and appreciation for art, particularly painting. One day, as Ryu leaves the factory, he comes across an old, abandoned warehouse. Intrigued, he enters and discovers a trove of discarded paintings. Among the canvases, he finds one that catches his eye – a breathtaking landscape that seems to take him on a journey to a different world. Feeling a deep connection to the painting, Ryu spends his evenings at the warehouse, losing himself in the art and the silent world that surrounds him. Unbeknownst to Ryu, the artist who created the painting, a reclusive old man named Kazuo, catches him admiring his work. Kazuo is dying and realizes that he wants to pass on his knowledge and passion for painting to someone who will truly appreciate it. He decides to approach Ryu and begins teaching him how to paint through a series of written instructions and gestures. As Ryu's artistic skills improve, news about his work slowly spreads through the town. The townspeople, who once shunned him, become captivated by his paintings, which seem to embody the soundless world that Ryu inhabits. Much to Ryu's surprise, the art becomes a bridge connecting him to his community. Meanwhile, Kazuo's health deteriorates rapidly. He confesses to Ryu that the landscape painting that originally drew him in was a depiction of a now-forgotten village that, due to rampant urbanization, disappeared many years ago. Kazuo's last wish is for Ryu to help immortalize the village through art and ensure that it isn't lost forever. In a race against time, Ryu sets off on a journey to seek out any remnants of the village, accompanied by Yumi, a vibrant young woman who is fascinated by Ryu's unique perspective of the world. Together, they explore the abandoned corners of the landscapes that once made up Kazuo's childhood home. As Ryu and Yumi's bond deepens and they uncover the story of Kazuo's village, they decide to launch an art exhibition showcasing Ryu's paintings. The event draws a large crowd, including investors and wealthy art collectors, who want to buy Ryu's art. However, Ryu remains focused on his mission, turning down lucrative offers to preserve the art and the memory of Kazuo's village.

Laura thrives on conflict while Christine avoids it, so","completion":"Laura thrives on conflict while Christine avoids it, so when faced with challenging situations, their individual approaches to problem-solving can lead to either highly productive collaboration or unintended friction between the two. Laura's penchant for conflict means she will actively seek out opportunities to engage in debates and discussions as a means to better understand a given situation or issue. She is not afraid to confront others in order to ensure both her viewpoint and the viewpoints of those she represents are clearly articulated and considered. This unyielding determination can foster an atmosphere of healthy debate that can lead to creative problem-solving, ultimately benefiting the team or organization as a whole. Christine, on the other hand, prefers to avoid conflict at all costs, choosing instead to seek out solutions through collaboration and working together with others. She believes that finding common ground and discovering the most effective means of accomplishing a goal can be achieved through positive interactions and open communication, without the need for a combative approach. Christine's preference is to remove the adversarial aspect of conflict in favor of fostering an environment of support and understanding, which she feels is a more effective means of achieving meaningful results. Despite their contrasting problem-solving styles, both Laura and Christine can find a way to make their unique approaches work for the benefit of their team or organization, if they are willing to take the time to understand and appreciate the value each of them brings. By recognizing the importance of both perspectives, and learning how to effectively harness their individual strengths while mitigating potential areas of discord, Laura and Christine can create a powerful dynamic that may initially appear counterintuitive, but has the potential to yield highly successful outcomes. In order to build a successful working relationship, both Laura and Christine will need to be open to embracing the diversity of their approaches in addressing challenges and problem-solving. It may involve committing to a series of candid conversations and self-reflective exercises that allow them to delve into the root causes of their individual preferences, and determine opportunities for compromise. For example, they can agree upon certain ground rules when faced with a pressing issue or complex project, wherein Laura is allowed the opportunity to express her thoughts and opinions through a more confrontational format, while Christine is given the chance to create a separate space for collaborative discussions and brainstorming sessions. By respecting each other's boundaries, they can create a healthy balance between engaging in conflict when necessary while still maintaining an environment that fosters cooperation and teamwork. Ultimately, it is through acknowledging and respecting the differences between their individual conflict management styles, that Laura and Christine can truly leverage their unique strengths and achieve a level of successful collaboration that both satisfies their individual needs and promotes the success of their team or organization as a whole."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: WASHINGTON — U.S. President Barack Obama has shortened the sentences of 214 inmates of U.S. federal prisons, in what the White House called the largest batch of commutations on a single day in more than a century. The early release is part of Obama's effort to correct what he views as unreasonably long mandatory minimum sentences. The president's push to lessen the burden on nonviolent drug offenders reflects his long-stated view that the nation should remedy the consequences of decades of onerous sentencing rules, which have put tens of thousands of Americans behind bars for far too long. Among those affected by Wednesday's presidential order were 67 individuals serving life sentences - almost all for nonviolent drug crimes, although a few also were charged with firearms violations related to their drug activities. To date, Obama has granted 562 commutations, more than the previous nine presidents combined, and more clemency actions that by any other president in nearly a century. White House counsel Neil Eggleston said in the White House blog that Obama examines each clemency application on its specific merits to identify the appropriate relief, including whether the prisoner would be helped by additional drug treatment, educational programs or counseling. Presidents tend to use their powers to commute sentences or issue pardons more frequently near the end of their terms of office. Administration officials said the rapid pace will continue before Obama's leaves the White House in January 2017. \\"We are not done yet,\\" Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates said. \\"We expect that many more men and women will be given a second chance through the clemency initiative.\\" Obama has long called for phasing out strict sentences for drug offenses, arguing they lead to excessive punishment and incarceration rates unseen in other developed countries.

Rowling, who created the Harry Potter series, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is inspired by a book of the same name.

Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, Bacharach was featured in a dozen television musical and variety specials videotaped in the UK for ITC; several were nominated for Emmy Awards for direction (by Dwight Hemion). The guests included artists such as Joel Grey, Dusty Springfield, Dionne Warwick, and Barbra Streisand. Bacharach and David did the score for an original musical for ABC-TV titled On the Flip Side, broadcast on ABC Stage 67, starring Ricky Nelson as a faded pop star trying for a comeback. While the ratings were dismal, the soundtrack showcased Bacharach's abilities to try different kinds of musical styles, ranging from (almost) 1960s rock, to pop, ballads, and Latin-tinged dance numbers. In 1969, Harry Betts arranged Bacharach's instrumental composition \\"Nikki\\" (named for Bacharach's daughter) into a new theme for the ABC Movie of the Week, a television series that ran on the U.S. network until 1976. During the 1970s, Bacharach and then-wife Angie Dickinson appeared in several television commercials for Martini & Rossi beverages, and even penned a short jingle (\\"Say Yes\\") for the spots. Bacharach also occasionally appeared on television/variety shows, such as The Merv Griffin Show, The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson, and many others. In the 1990s and 2000s, Bacharach had cameo roles in Hollywood movies, including all three Austin Powers movies, inspired by his score for the 1967 James Bond parody film Casino Royale. Bacharach appeared as a celebrity performer and guest vocal coach for contestants on the television show, \\"American Idol\\" during the 2006 season, during which an entire episode was dedicated to his music. In 2008, Bacharach featured in the BBC Electric Proms at The Roundhouse with the BBC Concert Orchestra. He performed similar shows in the same year at the Walt Disney Concert Hall and with the Sydney Symphony. Did he do live performances?","completion":"Yes, Burt Bacharach did live performances.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. I know that the answer to the question \\"What protects the online intermediaries from copyright infringement in the U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act?\\" is in \\"The U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act (1998) and the European E-Commerce Directive (2000) provide online intermediaries with limited statutory immunity from liability for copyright infringement. Online intermediaries hosting content that infringes copyright are not liable, so long as they do not know about it and take actions once the infringing content is brought to their attention. In U.S. law this is characterized as \\"safe harbor\\" provisions. Under European law, the governing principles for Internet Service Providers are \\"mere conduit\\", meaning that they are neutral 'pipes' with no knowledge of what they are carrying; and 'no obligation to monitor' meaning that they cannot be given a general mandate by governments to monitor content. These two principles are a barrier for certain forms of online copyright enforcement and they were the reason behind an attempt to amend the European Telecoms Package in 2009 to support new measures against copyright infringement.\\". Can you tell me what it is? Answer:","completion":"The protection provided to online intermediaries from copyright infringement in the U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) lies in the \\"safe harbor\\" provisions. These provisions, under Title II of the DMCA, are also known as the \\"Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act\\" (OCILLA). They grant limited statutory immunity to online intermediaries, such as Internet Service Providers (ISPs), online platforms, and web hosts, from liability for copyright infringement under certain conditions. According to the safe harbor provisions, online intermediaries are not held liable for hosting or transmitting content that infringes copyright so long as they meet specific requirements: 1. They must not have actual knowledge of the infringing content or be aware of facts or circumstances from which the infringing activity is apparent. 2. They must not receive any financial benefit directly attributable to the infringing activity if they have the right and ability to control such activity. 3. Upon receiving proper notification from the copyright holder or their agent, they must act expeditiously to remove or disable access to the allegedly infringing content. Additionally, the DMCA requires online intermediaries to designate an agent to receive notifications of claimed copyright infringements and to provide the designated agent's contact information to the U.S. Copyright Office. The safe harbor provisions work in tandem with the principles established under European law, namely the \\"mere conduit\\" and \\"no obligation to monitor\\" principles found within the European E-Commerce Directive (2000). The mere conduit principle states that ISPs are considered neutral 'pipes' and have no knowledge of the content they are carrying, while the no obligation to monitor principle entails that ISPs cannot be given a general mandate by governments to monitor content. These safeguards for online intermediaries serve as a barrier against certain forms of online copyright enforcement, and they were the primary reason behind attempts to amend the European Telecoms Package in 2009 to introduce new measures against copyright infringement. Nevertheless, these principles remain critical in maintaining the delicate balance between protecting the rights of copyright holders and preserving the essential functions of online intermediaries in the digital era."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Prefectural level cities form the second level of the administrative structure (alongside prefectures, leagues and autonomous prefectures). Administrative chiefs (mayors) of prefectural level cities generally have the same rank as a division chief of a national ministry. Since the 1980s, most former prefectures have been renamed into prefectural level cities. - In geometric measurements, length is the most extended dimension of an object. In the International System of Quantities, length is any quantity with dimension distance. In other contexts \\"length\\" is the measured dimension of an object. For example, it is possible to cut a length of a wire which is shorter than wire thickness. - Ili or Yili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture in northernmost Xinjiang is the only Kazakh autonomous prefecture in China. - A shape is the form of an object or its external boundary, outline, or external surface, as opposed to other properties such as color, texture, or material composition. - An \\"oil field\\" or \\"oilfield\\" is a region with an abundance of oil wells extracting petroleum (crude oil) from below ground. Because the oil reservoirs typically extend over a large area, possibly several hundred kilometres across, full exploitation entails multiple wells scattered across the area. In addition, there may be exploratory wells probing the edges, pipelines to transport the oil elsewhere, and support facilities. - The surface area of a solid object is a measure of the total area that the surface of the object occupies. The mathematical definition of surface area in the presence of curved surfaces is considerably more involved than the definition of arc length of one-dimensional curves, or of the surface area for polyhedra (i.e., objects with flat polygonal faces), for which the surface area is the sum of the areas of its faces. Smooth surfaces, such as a sphere, are assigned surface area using their representation as parametric surfaces. This definition of surface area is based on methods of infinitesimal calculus and involves partial derivatives and double integration. - China, officially the People's Republic of China (PRC), is a unitary sovereign state in East Asia. With a population of over 1.381 billion, it is the world's most populous country. The state is governed by the Communist Party of China, and its capital is Beijing. It exercises jurisdiction over 22 provinces, five autonomous regions, four direct-controlled municipalities (Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Chongqing), and two mostly self-governing special administrative regions (Hong Kong and Macau), and claims sovereignty over Taiwan. The country's major urban areas include Shanghai, Guangzhou, Beijing, Chongqing, Shenzhen, Tianjin and Hong Kong. China is a great power and a major regional power within Asia, and has been characterized as a potential superpower. - Quantity is a property that can exist as a magnitude or multitude. Quantities can be compared in terms of \\"more\\", \\"less\\", or \\"equal\\", or by assigning a numerical value in terms of a unit of measurement. Quantity is among the basic classes of things along with quality, substance, change, and relation. Some quantities are such by their inner nature (as number), while others are functioning as states (properties, dimensions, attributes) of things such as heavy and light, long and short, broad and narrow, small and great, or much and little. A small quantity is sometimes referred to as a quantulum. - Volume is the quantity of three-dimensional space enclosed by a closed surface, for example, the space that a substance (solid, liquid, gas, or plasma) or shape occupies or contains. Volume is often quantified numerically using the SI derived unit, the cubic metre. The volume of a container is generally understood to be the capacity of the container, i. e. the amount of fluid (gas or liquid) that the container could hold, rather than the amount of space the container itself displaces. - Area is the quantity that expresses the extent of a two-dimensional figure or shape, or planar lamina, in the plane. Surface area is its analog on the two-dimensional surface of a three-dimensional object. Area can be understood as the amount of material with a given thickness that would be necessary to fashion a model of the shape, or the amount of paint necessary to cover the surface with a single coat. It is the two-dimensional analog of the length of a curve (a one-dimensional concept) or the volume of a solid (a three-dimensional concept). - Karamay or Kelamayi is a prefecture-level city in the north of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, People's Republic of China. The name of the city comes from the Uyghur language, and means \\"black oil\\", referring to the oil fields near the city. - Paint is any liquid, liquefiable, or mastic composition that, after application to a substrate in a thin layer, converts to a solid film. It is most commonly used to protect, color, or provide texture to objects. Paint can be made or purchased in many colorsand in many different types, such as watercolor, synthetic, etc. Paint is typically stored, sold, and applied as a liquid, but most types dry into a solid. - The Uyghur or Uighur language (Uyghur: ), formerly known as Eastern Turki, is a Turkic language with 10 to 25 million speakers, spoken primarily by the Uyghur people in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region of Western China. Significant communities of Uyghur-speakers are located in Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, and various other countries have Uyghur-speaking expatriate communities. Uyghur is an official language of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, and is widely used in both social and official spheres, as well as in print, radio, and television, and is used as a lingua franca by other ethnic minorities in Xinjiang. - Tacheng ( Tarbagatay ) Prefecture is located in northern Xinjiang , People 's Republic of China .

You might need to use additional knowledge to answer the question. The inhabited history of the Las Vegas Valley stretches to 23,000 b.c. , when much of the area was covered by a prehistoric lake. During this period, the indigenous people lived in caves, hunting the mammals that gathered at the shoreline. The landscape of the valley changed dramatically over the next 200 centuries. The glaciers feeding the lake melted away and the lake evaporated. Fossils tell an obscure story of man's slow and sporadic development. Around 3000 b.c. , native Archaic Indians began to develop a lasting hunting and gathering culture. By this time, the valley was in much the same geographic state as it exists in today, with one exception — the presence of artesian springs that bubbled to the surface in several areas. These springs fed a network of streams draining through the Las Vegas Wash to the Colorado River. The areas surrounding the springs were desert oases: sprawling collections of grasses, trees, and wildlife. Many springs lay in areas that would eventually become the center of the modern Las Vegas metropolis. For about 4000 years, the Archaics thrived in a culture that included many signs of early civilization. Signs of even more advancement appeared halfway through the first millennium a.d. , when the Anasazi Indians inhabited the valley. Far more progressive than the Archaics, the Anasazi utilized such formal agricultural techniques as irrigation to assist their harvest. This permitted the Anasazi to achieve a benchmark of advanced society — the ability to live in permanent shelters year-round without need to follow wildlife. Mysteriously, the Anasazi vanished from the valley around a.d.

This gives us: -120*t + 261 - 261 = 861 - 261 Now the equation looks like this: -120*t = 600 Finally, we need to divide both sides of the equation by -120 to find the value of \\"t\\": (-120*t) / -120 = 600 / -120 This simplifies to: t = -5 So, the value of \\"t\\" that solves the equation is -5."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What are the full names of the two people who begin a duel on a forest planet? The film begins with the opening credits of a typical Star Wars fanfilm entitled \\"Bond of the Force\\". Gregory plays Jacen Solo, and Jennifer plays the offscreen voice of Jaina Solo. Jacen is on a forest planet searching for Anakin Solo, but only encountering a Sith Lord named Darth Katai, played by Zarth. The two begin to duel, and it is an intense battle...until Greg misses his cue, incurring the wrath of writer-director Tom \\"Servo\\" Harrison. Tom gets into a fight with his friends, and they walk out on him. After a monologue based on High Fidelity, with Star Wars in the place of rock music, Tom reflects back a few months to the genesis of the fanfilm project. Tom, Greg, Jenny, and Zarth are seen hanging out at Excalibur Games, a hobby shop, playing the Star Wars pants game. Tom is revealed to be an employee at the store, working for store credit while he has his money saved up for film school. He claims the only downside to the job is the trekkies—specifically, two irate, Star Wars-hating ones named James and Stewart. The two enter the store, arguing over a discrepancy between the film Star Trek Generations and the Technical Manual. While waiting for Tom to get their new Star Trek cards, Stewart accidentally spills soda on a set of comics that Greg's boss ordered. Tom demands they pay for the damaged goods, and the Trekkies overpay him before leaving the store in a rush. Tom realizes that they can sell the undamaged books to Greg's boss for full price and pocket the money from the Trekkies. At Greg's suggestion, Tom combines the money with his remaining store credit and buys model lightsabers, which prompts the idea in his mind of making a Star Wars fanfilm.","completion":"The two people who begin a duel on a forest planet are Gregory, who plays Jacen Solo, and Zarth, who plays Darth Katai."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: Called the PURE (Prospective Urban Rural Epidemiology) study, this was a very large observational study looking at the link between fat and carbohydrate consumption and longevity in 18 countries across 5 continents. Running for 7 years and involving over 135,000 people, this was a very big study so its conclusions are right to take notice of. The key finding from the work that attracted the most media attention was that a high carbohydrate diet was linked with a higher risk of earlier mortality, whereas total fat and individual types of fat were related to a lower risk of earlier mortality. Digging deeper into the study, the research team found that global diets consisted of 61 percent energy coming from carbohydrates and 24 percent energy from fats. And while those in the highest carbohydrate consumption group (a whopping 77 percent of energy) had a higher risk of earlier death, it wasn’t cardiovascular disease they were dying from. What those other causes of death were exactly is unclear. Perhaps getting hit by a car running for a Mars Bar was one of them as a recent commenter on my Facebook page theorised. A paradigm shift? Not quite Does this study turn on its head ‘everything we knew about nutrition?’ Not quite. And here’s why. Before the PURE study, there were many studies showing the opposite link between carbohydrates and longevity. So, when a conflicting study comes along, this grabs the media spotlight for the day. Here is just one example – a major systematic review and meta-analysis from 2013 involving 17 individual studies and over 242,000 people showing a higher risk of earlier mortality as carbohydrate intake decreased. And this is the problem at times with observational research in that two studies can give polar opposite results so the findings of the PURE study should be seen through this filter.

Here is an article: NEW YORK (CNNMoney.com) -- Investors will return from a long holiday weekend to face earnings from a couple of marquee names, a key report on inflation, and more questions about the strength of the long-running bull market. But with the latest bout of strength in the market unlikely to evaporate just yet, analysts say the sailing should remain smooth, at least for now. \\"In the short term, the market can probably hold its recent gains,\\" said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Avalon Partners. \\"But next week we do have inflation news and speeches from some Fed governors, so we could be subject to those events.\\" Stocks rallied last week - with the Dow Jones industrial average hitting a fresh all-time high - as investors welcomed Ben Bernanke's semi-annual monetary policy report to Congress. In it the Federal Reserve Chairman portrayed an economy that is slowing at the moderate pace the central bank wants, amid a gradually improving inflation picture. The comments illustrated the best-of-both-worlds scenario investors like, Wall Street's so-called Goldilocks economy of \\"not too hot, not too cold\\" growth. The comments also convinced investors that the Federal Reserve is likely to hold pat on interest rates for the foreseeable future and possibly cut rates by the end of the year - rather than boost rates further as some had feared. As a result, \\"investor sentiment has improved,\\" said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Harris Private Bank. \\"A few months ago, investors thought there would be a hike by June, now they think there could be a cut by December,\\" he said. \\"What investors are latching on to and reacting well to now is not so much the direction of rates, but the flexibility the Fed is showing it is capable of.\\" This factor should continue to support stocks in the shortened week ahead, with all financial markets closed Monday in observance of Presidents' Day. Bernanke's testimony may be over, but the week ahead still keeps the focus on the Fed and the economy. The minutes from the January policy meeting are due for release on Wednesday. While they probably won't differ much thematically from Bernanke's testimony, they will nonetheless be of interest. Federal Reserve Governor Susan Schmidt Bies speaks at Duke on Tuesday. Bies recently announced her resignation from the Fed's policy board, effective late March. Federal Reserve Governor Donald Kohn speaks Wednesday on financial stability. Also Wednesday, San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank president Janet Yellen speaks on the economy, also on Wednesday. In a week light on economic news, the critical report will be Wednesday's January Consumer Price Index (CPI) and the Core CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices. Both are expected to show modest gains, reinforcing bets that inflationary pressures are being contained. \\"I think CPI will be important, in terms of being watched by the Fed and by those that watch the Fed,\\" said Ablin. Wednesday's leading economic indicators report will also be relevant, Ablin said. Recent economic reports have been mixed, and that has actually supported investor sentiment, as it reinforces the idea that a gradual slowdown is in place, said Alan Gayle, senior investment strategist at Trusco Capital Management. Friday brought the latest discouraging reading on the housing market - and a report that showed a retreat in investor sentiment. However, investors seemed to take the reports in stride, with stocks ending the session barely lower. \\"A slower growth rate is not comprised of uniformly lower numbers, it's comprised of a mix of stronger and weaker numbers,\\" Gayle said. Next week also brings a few key earnings reports, including Dow components Home Depot (Charts), Wal-Mart Stores (Charts) and Hewlett-Packard (Charts) on Tuesday. Other reports due later in the week include Abercrombie & Fitch (Charts) on Wednesday and JC Penney (Charts) and Toll Brothers (Charts) on Thursday. (see chart for details.) While those reports will likely draw attention, they aren't likely to change the perception of overall fourth-quarter earnings.

Zanuck, directed by Henry King and starring Gregory Peck {King David}, Susan Hayward (Bathsheba), Raymond Massey (Nathan), Kieron Moore (Uriah) and Jayne Meadows (Michal). The film is based around the second Old Testament book of Samuel from the Holy Bible. It follows King David, who as a child had slain the giant Goliath, and now we find him in adulthood as the second King of Israel. A tough and assured King, David however has affairs of the heart causing great problems.

John found program A having parallel slowdown, but program B does not have parallel slowdown. He has to weigh the merits of using these programs. But I can use this background: Parallel slowdown is a phenomenon in parallel computing where parallelization of a parallel algorithm beyond a certain point causes the program to run slower (take more time to run to completion).[1] Parallel slowdown is typically the result of a communications bottleneck. As more processor nodes are added, each processing node spends progressively more time doing communication than useful processing. At some point, the communications overhead created by adding another processing node surpasses the increased processing power that node provides, and parallel slowdown occurs. What is an answer for this question: Would program B be slower or faster than program A? Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided, program B would likely be faster than program A. This is because program B does not have parallel slowdown, meaning it doesn't face the issue of progressively more time being spent on communication than useful processing as more processor nodes are added. Unlike program A, the speed of program B does not decrease due to communication bottlenecks, thus making it potentially faster. However, the actual speed would also depend on other variables, including the efficiency of each program's algorithm, the number of processing nodes involved, and their communication protocols."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: For Yali Liu, the hardest thing about UK higher education is having to go to the pub. \\"It's how much you need to invest socially with other students,\\" she says. \\"I don't like going to a pub or club, but people just keep going out and I feel the pressure to go out too.\\" This is because, unlike in China, she says, there is so much emphasis during the course on teamwork and group projects, so socialising with other students - especially British people, is crucial. Liu, 23, who is in her final year of a BSc in business administration at the University of Bath, is one of more than 80,000 Chinese students studying in UK universities. They are responsible for a large proportion of the more than PS10bn a year that international students contribute to the UK economy. However, research shows that where their academic attainment is concerned, the picture is not satisfactory. While nearly 58% of all students - and 45% of overseas students graduated with a first-class degree last year, this was true of only 35% of students from China. To find an explanation, Zhiqi Wang and Ian Crawford, lecturers at the University of Bath, compared the performance of Chinese and British undergraduates in each year of their degree. Taking a sample of 100 British and Chinese students and comparing their average marks and final degree classification, they found a dramatic drop in performance among the Chinese students between year one, when they performed better than their UK counterparts, and year two, when they performed worse. They believe the drop results from two factors. First, Chinese students fail to adapt their approaches to learning and so their performance declines in the later years when the complexity of the work increases. Second, many young people in China enroll in higher education due to pressure from family rather than their own motivation. Professor Sedghi thinks part of the problem may be the changing socio-economic background of Chinese undergraduates. While 85% of Chinese students at British universities before 2000...

In 1768 Russian-backed Ukrainian Haidamaks, pursuing Polish confederates, entered Balta, an Ottoman-controlled town on the border of Bessarabia in Ukraine, and massacred its citizens and burned the town to the ground. This action provoked the Ottoman Empire into the Russo-Turkish War of 1768–1774. The Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca of 1774 ended the war and provided freedom to worship for the Christian citizens of the Ottoman-controlled provinces of Wallachia and Moldavia. By the late 18th century, a number of defeats in several wars with Russia led some people in the Ottoman Empire to conclude that the reforms of Peter the Great had given the Russians an edge, and the Ottomans would have to keep up with Western technology in order to avoid further defeats.

From the information presented, we cannot accurately determine what Alex wants to do next. However, we can make educated guesses based on the possible answers provided: 1. Skilled: This option does not directly specify an action that Alex would want to take. However, if we interpret \\"skilled\\" to mean improving their skills, then Alex may want to further develop their own baking expertise or techniques. They may explore new recipes, innovative techniques, or perhaps experiment with different flavor combinations to ensure their cakes remain top-notch. 2. Learn more from Alex: Since Alex is the one who gave the lesson, it is unlikely that Alex would want to learn more from themselves. This answer may be better suited if the question was regarding what Carson wants to do next after learning from Alex. 3. Bake a cake: Considering that Alex just taught a lesson on making a big piece of cake, it is possible that their next course of action would be to put their knowledge and expertise to practice by baking a cake themselves. Alex may want to create a cake for a special occasion, to share with friends and family, or even to give to Carson as a celebratory gesture for successfully learning the lesson.

After the game they went to see the sports physician for a check up. The physician found that John had inflammation, but Keith didn't have any inflammation. But I can use this background: The body's second line of defense against pathogens includes the inflammatory response. If bacteria enter the skin through a scrape, the area may become red, warm, and painful. These are signs of inflammation. Inflammation is one way the body reacts to infections or injuries. Inflammation is caused by chemicals that are released when skin or other tissues are damaged. The chemicals cause nearby blood vessels to dilate, or expand. This increases blood flow to the damaged area, which makes the area red and slightly warm. The chemicals also attract white blood cells called neutrophils to the wound and cause them to leak out of blood vessels into the damaged tissue. What is an answer for this question: Who would have dilated blood vessels near the wound, John or Keith? Answer:","completion":"Based on the given information, John would have dilated blood vessels near the wound. This is because the sports physician found that John had inflammation, whereas Keith did not. Inflammation is the body's response to infections or injuries and involves several processes, including the release of chemicals that cause blood vessels to dilate or expand. This increase in blood flow to the damaged area results in redness and warmth, which are characteristic signs of inflammation. The chemicals responsible for this also attract white blood cells called neutrophils, which help protect the body from pathogens and facilitate the healing process. Since John displays signs of inflammation, we can conclude that he has dilated blood vessels near the wound as part of his body's inflammatory response. On the other hand, Keith, who did not present any inflammation, would likely not have this same condition."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Nelson had to get some painkillers from the doctor. This sentence describes the contrasting situations of Nelson and Samuel, as one was dealing with pain from an injury while the other was in good health. Despite this, both characters play a significant role in the overall situation, as they each find themselves addressing the consequences of Nelson's physical condition. Nelson, who has been struggling with the pain from their injury, recognizes the need to seek medical assistance. This decision showcases their understanding of the importance of professional help in alleviating discomfort and allowing them to heal properly. By obtaining painkillers from the doctor, Nelson ensures that their pain is managed, which in turn can have a positive impact on their mental and emotional well-being. Furthermore, the decision to seek help could imply that they prioritize their health and are determined to recover quickly. Meanwhile, Samuel's role in this situation can be seen as supportive and empathetic. Although the sentence does not explicitly mention his actions, Samuel's well-being could imply that he is present for Nelson during their time of need. By being there, both emotionally and physically, Samuel can help Nelson to navigate through the complexities, stresses, and challenges that inevitably accompany an injury and its related implications. Moreover, Samuel might also help share responsibilities and tasks that Nelson might temporarily or permanently be unable to perform due to their injury.

English law is the common law legal system governing England and Wales, comprising criminal law and civil law. English law has no formal codification: the essence of English common law is that it is made by judges sitting in courts applying statute, and legal precedent (\\"stare decisis\\") from previous cases. A decision of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom, the highest civil appeal court of the United Kingdom, is binding on every other court. Some rulings are derived from legislation; others, known as common law, are based on rulings of previous courts. For example, murder is a common law crime rather than one established by an Act of Parliament. Common law can be amended or repealed by Parliament; murder, for example, now carries a mandatory life sentence rather than the death penalty. The first schedule of the Interpretation Act 1978, defines the following terms: \\"British Islands\\", \\"England\\", and \\"United Kingdom\\". The use of the term \\"British Isles\\" is virtually obsolete in statutes and, when it does appear, it is taken to be synonymous with \\"British Islands\\". For interpretation purposes, England includes a number of specified elements: \\"Great Britain\\" means England, Wales, Scotland, their adjacent territorial waters and the islands of Orkney and Shetland, the Hebrides and, by virtue of the Island of Rockall Act 1972, Rockall. \\"United Kingdom\\" means Great Britain and Northern Ireland and their adjacent territorial waters, but not the Isle of Man, nor the Channel Islands, whose independent status was discussed in \\"Rover International Ltd. v Canon Film Sales Ltd.\\" (1987) 1 WLR 1597 and \\"Chloride Industrial Batteries Ltd. v F. & W.

Paul Gregory, a Canadian confidence trickster operating in London, targets a wealthy Canadian woman in Britain to sell her collection of valuable coins. After meeting her at an ice hockey match, he sets about winning her confidence until she is prepared to give him legal control over the sale. He completes the deal without her knowledge, puts the money from the sale in a safe deposit box, and then deliberately waits to be caught by the police. Gregory plans on getting a five-year sentence, with time off for good behaviour, and then collecting his loot when he is released. However, the judge makes an example of the uncooperative Gregory by handing down a ten-year term. Not wishing to spend so much time in jail, Gregory pays Victor Sloane, one of his associates on the outside, to help him escape. Almost immediately, things begin to go wrong. Fearing arrest, he is unable for the moment to recover the money from the safe. Sloane also now begins to demand more money, threatening him with violence, and Gregory is forced to retaliate. Gregory tries to get help from his fellow criminals, calling upon an established code that exists between them. But when his former associate Sloane is found dead – accidentally having choked to death on the gag Gregory placed in his mouth – they refuse to offer him any assistance, as he is now too \\"hot\\".

English: When a dairy product is left alone, depending on the conditions and the initial product, it might eventually turn into cheese. The process of cheesemaking involves coagulating the proteins in milk, separating the curds from the whey, and then aging the curds under controlled conditions to develop the desired taste and texture. Milk contains casein protein and whey protein, and when these proteins are coagulated, it starts the process of turning milk into cheese. Several factors, such as acidity, temperature, and the presence of certain bacteria or enzymes, can initiate this coagulation process. In traditional cheesemaking, raw milk is left to sit and become slightly acidic as the lactose in the milk is fermented into lactic acid by naturally occurring lactic acid bacteria (LAB). This process is known as spontaneous acidification. Some cheeses, such as certain types of Swiss cheese, still use this traditional method. However, most modern cheesemaking involves the intentional inoculation of LAB to have better control over the process. Another method to start the coagulation process involves using rennet, an enzyme complex found in the stomachs of ruminant animals such as cows, goats, and sheep. Rennet contains the enzyme chymosin, which specifically breaks down the kappa-casein protein in the milk, causing it to coagulate. Many cheeses, such as cheddar, mozzarella, and gouda, are made using rennet. Once the proteins in the milk have coagulated, the resulting curds are separated from the liquid whey. The curds are then drained, pressed, and shaped into cheese forms, which will determine the final form and size of the cheese. The cheese is then aged for varying amounts of time, depending on the type of cheese being made. During the aging process, different types of microorganisms, such as bacteria, yeast, or mold, are introduced to the cheese to develop its unique flavors and textures. In summary, leaving a dairy product alone may not necessarily result in cheese, as many factors can influence the process of cheesemaking. However, if specific conditions exist and the proteins in the dairy product coagulate, the process of turning the product into cheese may begin. The final outcome will depend on the specific methods used and the controlled conditions applied during the cheesemaking process."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

They trace much of their heritage to groups of Brittonic speakers who immigrated from southwestern Great Britain, particularly Cornwall and Devon, to expand their territory onto the continent. They also descend in some parts from Vikings. They migrated in waves from the 3rd to 9th century (most heavily from 450-600) into Armorica, which was subsequently named Brittany after them. The Breton language is a very important part of Breton identity. Breton itself is one of the Brittonic languages and is closely related to Cornish and more distantly to Welsh. Breton is thus an Insular Celtic language and is more distantly related to the long-extinct Continental Celtic languages such as Gaulish that were formerly spoken on the European mainland, including the areas colonised by the ancestors of the Bretons. In eastern Brittany, a regional langue d'oil, Gallo, developed; it shares certain areal features such as points of vocabulary, idiom, and pronunciation with Breton but is a Romance language). Neither language has official status under French law; however, some still use Breton as an everyday language (particularly the older generation) and bilingual road signs are common in the west of Brittany. From 1880 to the mid-20th century, Breton was banned from the French school system and children were punished for speaking it in a similar way to the application of the Welsh Not in Wales during the 19th and 20th centuries. The situation changed in 1951 with the Deixonne Law allowing Breton language and culture to be taught 1-3 hours a week in the public school system on the proviso that a teacher was both able and prepared to do so. In modern times, a number of schools and colleges have emerged with the aim of providing Breton-medium education or bilingual Breton/French education. There are four main Breton dialects: Gwenedeg (Vannes), Kerneveg (Cornouaille), Leoneg (Leon) and Tregerieg (Tregor), which have varying degrees of mutual intelligibility. In 1908, a standard orthography was devised. The fourth dialect, Gwenedeg, was not included in this reform, but was included in the later orthographic reform of 1941.

Jennifer got a better loan with better repayment plans than Angela because","completion":"Jennifer had taken a more methodical approach to shopping around for loans and analyzing various aspects before finalizing the best deal for herself. As a result, Jennifer’s loan offered her superior repayment terms and a lower interest rate than Angela’s loan. Here are some reasons why Jennifer was able to secure a better loan: 1. Strong credit score: Jennifer had worked on and maintained a strong credit score, which made her a more attractive borrower to lenders. In contrast, Angela's credit score was lower, primarily because of her inconsistent repayment history. Consequently, lenders offered Jennifer better loan terms, knowing that she was considerably less likely to default on her payments. 2. Research and comparison: Jennifer devoted time and effort into researching various loan options available in the market. This enabled her to choose the best loan package that offered the most favorable repayment terms. Angela, on the other hand, did not pay much attention to the finer details and opted for a loan that was not as financially advantageous. 3. Negotiation skills: Jennifer effectively negotiated with lenders, leveraging her strong credit history and reputation. This allowed her to secure favorable repayment terms for her loan and even resulted in a lower interest rate. Angela did not engage in negotiation tactics, which significantly hampered her chances of obtaining a better loan. 4. Loan collateral: Jennifer had valuable assets to offer as collateral for her loan. This reduced the overall risk of the loan for the financial institution, thereby improving her chances of securing better repayment plans and lower interest rates. Unfortunately, Angela did not have any collateral suited for this purpose, which influenced her available loan options. 5. Opting for a fixed-rate loan: Jennifer chose a fixed-rate loan, which offered her a stable interest rate over the course of the loan. Since her interest rate was locked in, her repayment terms were more attractive and predictable. In contrast, Angela opted for a variable-rate loan, making her vulnerable to fluctuating interest rates and potentially higher payments in the future. 6. Longer loan term: Jennifer was willing to opt for a longer loan term, which translated into smaller monthly payments. This made her repayment plan more feasible and manageable over time. Angela, however, chose a shorter loan term, which led to higher monthly payments and put a more significant financial strain on her budget. 7. Financial counseling and advice: Jennifer sought professional financial advice, which helped her understand the nuances of different loan options and choose a loan package that best suited her needs. This informed decision-making process contributed to her ability to secure better repayment plans and preferable loan terms. In contrast, Angela did not choose to consult an expert and was therefore at a disadvantage in selecting the most appropriate loan for her needs. In conclusion, Jennifer's careful approach to loan applications, bolstered by her solid credit history and a keen understanding of financial products, helped her secure a better loan with significantly better repayment plans than Angela. By investing time in research, negotiation, and consultation with financial advisors, Jennifer was able to optimize her loan terms, making it more manageable and cost-effective for her in the long run."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Q:I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What were the names of the five models Saint-Saëns forged his own style from? ? Discounting his collaboration with Dukas in the completion of Guiraud's unfinished Frédégonde, Saint-Saëns wrote twelve operas, two of which are opéras comiques. During the composer's lifetime his Henry VIII became a repertory piece; since his death only Samson et Dalila has been regularly staged, although according to Schonberg, Ascanio (1890) is considered by experts to be a much finer work. The critic Ronald Crichton writes that for all his experience and musical skill, Saint-Saëns \\"lacked the 'nose' of the theatre animal granted, for example, to Massenet who in other forms of music was his inferior\\". In a 2005 study, the musical scholar Steven Huebner contrasts the two composers: \\"Saint-Saëns obviously had no time for Massenet's histrionics\\". Saint-Saëns's biographer James Harding comments that it is regrettable that the composer did not attempt more works of a light-hearted nature, on the lines of La princesse jaune, which Harding describes as like Sullivan \\"with a light French touch\\".Although most of Saint-Saëns's operas have remained neglected, Crichton rates them as important in the history of French opera, as \\"a bridge between Meyerbeer and the serious French operas of the early 1890s\\". In his view, the operatic scores of Saint-Saëns have, in general, the strengths and weaknesses of the rest of his music – \\"lucid Mozartian transparency, greater care for form than for content ... There is a certain emotional dryness; invention is sometimes thin, but the workmanship is impeccable.\\" Stylistically, Saint-Saëns drew on a range of models. From Meyerbeer he drew the effective use of the chorus in the action of a piece; for Henry VIII he included Tudor music he had researched in London; in La princesse jaune he used an oriental pentatonic scale; from Wagner he derived the use of leitmotifs, which, like Massenet, he used sparingly. Huebner observes that Saint-Saëns was more conventional than Massenet so far as through composition is concerned, more often favouring discrete arias and ensembles, with less... A:","completion":"The article does not directly provide the names of the five models Saint-Saëns forged his own style from.

Experts are worried the storm created conditions that could unleash the Zika virus from southern Florida up the Atlantic coast, reports McClatchy. Pools of standing water left in the storm's wake make prime breeding ground for mosquitoes, and damage to homes and screens means the insects have an easier time reaching humans. \\"It knocks a lot of stuff down so you just have a lot more things in which the mosquito can breed,\\" said Philip Stoddard, a biology professor and the mayor of South Miami. \\"A damaged rain gutter, for instance, now becomes a rain collector. Every little object that blows off a house or even a chair flipped over on a porch becomes a container for mosquitoes to breed.\\" Most mosquitoes are no match for hurricane-force winds and flooding. Peter Hotez, dean for the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College, told the Atlantic that the storm surge could have a \\"beneficial effect in terms of washing away mosquito breeding sites.\\" But in the coming days, as the waters recede, offspring from the most hearty of the Aedes aegypti mosquitoes (one of the main carriers of Zika) will hatch, Stoddard tells McClatchy. Since July, there have been 141 cases of Zika in southern Florida, reports CNN, but fears that it could spread post-Matthew are well-founded.

Still, Matthew's appearance late in the season could mitigate things. \\"We might not see this effect,\\" Hotez said. Article:","completion":"Title: Hurricane Matthew's Aftermath: A Potential Zika Outbreak Along the Atlantic Coast Introduction: Hurricane Matthew left a trail of destruction from Haiti to North Carolina, but the devastation might not be over just yet. Experts are concerned that the hurricane has created prime conditions for the Zika virus to spread from southern Florida up the Atlantic Coast. The Role of Standing Water: After a storm like Hurricane Matthew, pools of standing water are left behind, creating the perfect environment for mosquitoes to breed. Moreover, damage to homes and screens means these disease-carrying insects can more easily reach humans, leading to a potential increase in the number of Zika cases in the affected regions. Philip Stoddard, a biology professor and the mayor of South Miami, explains, \\"It knocks a lot of stuff down so you just have a lot more things in which the mosquito can breed. A damaged rain gutter, for instance, now becomes a rain collector. Every little object that blows off a house or even a chair flipped over on a porch becomes a container for mosquitoes to breed.\\" The Resilience of Aedes Aegypti Mosquitoes: While most mosquitoes cannot withstand hurricane-force winds and flooding, the Aedes aegypti mosquito, the primary carrier of Zika, is notably hardy. Peter Hotez, dean for the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College, suggests that the storm surge could have a \\"beneficial effect in terms of washing away mosquito breeding sites.\\" However, as the waters recede, the offspring of the few Aedes aegypti mosquitoes that survive might hatch, increasing the risk of the Zika virus spreading. The Growing Concern: Since July, there have been 141 cases of Zika in southern Florida, according to CNN. The fear that Zika could spread following Hurricane Matthew is well-founded, considering the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Cases of neurological disease from the West Nile virus spiked by 50% after the storm. The Silver Lining: However, the Zika-charged mosquito population might not prosper due to Hurricane Matthew's late arrival in the season. Peter Hotez explains, \\"We might not see this effect.\\" Nevertheless, until the mosquito breeding sites are under control, the threat of Zika remains relevant in the Atlantic Coast communities affected by Hurricane Matthew."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

There is a man involved in this situation. 2. The man is wearing shorts and a black jacket. 3. He is standing on top of a big rock. 4. He is looking down on hills and valleys. These details paint a picture of a man who is outdoors, possibly engaged in some form of physical activity, such as hiking or climbing. The man is standing and observing the landscape that surrounds him. The information provided suggests that he is in a natural environment, with hills and valleys mentioned explicitly. Hypothesis: The man is sitting in his car. The hypothesis introduces a completely different context. It states: 1. The man is sitting. 2. The man is inside his car. This hypothesis contradicts the premise in two significant ways: 1. The premise specifies that the man is standing, while the hypothesis says he is sitting. 2.

So, when facing that challenge, it is important to know how to reach your weight-loss goal. Of course, you have to decide you want to lose weight and be committed to doing so; then, you must stick to your guns and stay motivated or the goal will never be realized. There is no magic bullet, but there are two important tips that can help you reach your weight-loss goal. #1 – Take It a Week at a Time You must break your ultimate goal into smaller chunks and have bench marks that will indicate you are moving in the right direction. According to the Mayo Clinic, “Over the long term, it’s best to aim for losing 1 to 2 pounds (0.5 to 1 kilogram) a week.” When you have a realistic weekly weight-loss target, you will be more confident in your efforts and you will know exactly what you are going to measure at the end of each week. Your long-term goal may be 40 pounds, but take it “one week at a time” (1 to 2 pounds/week = 20 to 30 weeks) In addition to choosing a healthy diet that fits your lifestyle and current health conditions, plus a solid commitment to stay with it, don’t forget to get plenty of rest and exercise. . BUT . . . the primary target should be the number of pounds you plan to lose each week. That target should be clear – and realistic. If it is, you should be able to stick to your weight loss program and enjoy success week after week, after week. AND, feel good in the process. If you are not hitting your target, be willing to look closely at what you are doing, or not doing – and figure out why you are not reaching your weekly target. Maybe the target you set was not sensible or reasonable; or, maybe you are putting too much pressure on yourself. Honest introspection is a good way to see what you are really capable of doing and then, you can develop or choose a plan that is suitable for your unique lifestyle.

A key figure in helping Stafford to develop her solo career was Mike Nidorf, an agent who first heard her as a member of the Pied Pipers while he was serving as a Captain with the United States Army. Having previously discovered artists such as Glenn Miller, Artie Shaw, and Woody Herman, Nidorf was impressed by Stafford's voice, and contacted her when he was demobilized in 1944. After she agreed to let him represent her, he encouraged her to reduce her weight and arranged a string of engagements that raised her profile, and confidence.The success of Stafford's solo career led to a demand for personal appearances, and from February 1945 she embarked on a six-month residency at New York's La Martinique nightclub. Her performance was well-received—an article in the July 1945 edition of Band Leaders magazine described it as \\"sensational\\"—but Stafford did not enjoy singing before live audiences, and it was the only nightclub venue she ever played.

I loved it until it did the beeping, then the numbers in a row (sometimes 3333, sometimes 8888 sometimes 4444....) and then the microwave would just start on its own. But we would just unplug or clear the screen and it can start normally again. But recently, it won't even start. Sometimes I get lucky and upon re-plugging the screen says 2.46 and starts to go so I just let whatever I need heat up for 2.46 minutes. We just bought another microwave and now I am trying to find out what to do with used microwaves. Would you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light? A:","completion":"The review depicts the product in an unflattering light. The reviewer initially mentions their positive experience with the product, but the majority of the review focuses on the problems they encountered, such as beeping, display issues, and the microwave starting on its own. Additionally, the fact that the reviewer ultimately had to replace the microwave and is now seeking advice on disposing of the faulty product further emphasizes their negative experience with it."},{"prompt":"David was conducting experiments on chemical equilibrium in the chemistry lab.

Do these sentences mean the same thing?","completion":"Yes, these sentences essentially mean the same thing, but they are structured differently and contain slight variations in their presentation of information. Both sentences convey that Lorenzo Giuntini and Susannah Louisa Barnett got married on September 11, 1866, in Frome, Somerset, and had eight children. In the first sentence, the focus is primarily on Lorenzo Giuntini, as it begins with his name and provides information about his marriage to Susannah Louisa Barnett. Afterward, the sentence mentions the specific location, date, and the number of children they had together. On the other hand, the second sentence starts by focusing on Susannah Louisa Barnett, as it mentions her name in the beginning and shares details about her union with Lorenzo Giuntini. The sentence, in this case, is structurally identical to the first one but emphasizes Susannah's perspective rather than Lorenzo's. Overall, the primary information the sentences provide concerning the marriage between Lorenzo Giuntini and Susannah Louisa Barnett, the date and place of their marriage, and the number of children they had remains constant. The difference comes down to the order in which they present the subjects (Lorenzo and Susannah) and a slight variation in how the date is written (\\"September 11, 1866\\" vs. \\"11 September 1866\\").

Local businessmen are increasingly facing competition from on line retailers. Larry Pollock, owner of Camera Co/Op on South Congress, said he has been dealing with this kind of problem for years, even before the Internet. The struggle began with mail-order catalogues, which are similar to online retailers in that they have few employees to pay, no sales tax fees and no business venue to lease and manage. \\"Their overhead is lower, but they don't offer a service like we do,\\" Pollock said. Pollock, however, said providing a valuable service to customers does not always guarantee continued sales. \\"We spend 30 minutes to an hour with somebody and they go home and buy it online,\\" he said. According to the state comptroller's office, online shopping is developing at a more rapid rate than traditional businesses. In spite of how fair or unfair online shopping may be to the local businessmen, consumers will continue to turn to the Internet for its variety and accessibility, said Mitch Wilson, an online shopper. \\"You have a larger selection and it's easier to compare prices.\\" Wilson said he built his personal computer and paid a third of the price by shopping online. \\"Before the Internet, I would have had to go and buy an assembled computer from somebody like Dell,\\" he said. \\"Before I started shopping online I could never find all the pieces I wanted.

Joe Burdette (Claude Akins), brother of rancher Nathan Burdette, tosses a silver dollar into a spittoon. Presidio County, Texas, Sheriff John T.

Joe begins punching Dude, then shoots and kills an unarmed bystander who tries to intervene. Joe heads to his brother's saloon, where a bloody Chance comes to arrest him for the murder of the bystander. Another patron draws his gun on Chance, but Dude shoots the gun out of the man's hand. Joe is locked up in the local jail. Chance is willing to deputize Dude, provided he can stay sober. Both remember how good with a gun Dude used to be. Chance's friend Pat Wheeler (Ward Bond) and his wagon train of supplies stop in town, with a young gunslinger, Colorado Ryan (Ricky Nelson), riding guard. Inside the jail, Stumpy (Walter Brennan), Chance's game-legged deputy, keeps watch over the jail and Joe, who knows that Stumpy holds an old grudge against Joe's wealthy and powerful brother. Joe warns his jailers that Nathan Burdette will not like how his brother's being treated. A mysterious woman nicknamed Feathers (Angie Dickinson) is in the saloon, playing poker. In the meantime, Dude and Chance patrol the town. Hotel owner Carlos (Pedro Gonzalez-Gonzalez) stops the sheriff, saying Wheeler has been talking too much about Chance needing help. In the saloon, Chance implores Wheeler to stop, as it will draw attention from the wrong people.

Scientists made a survey in about one thousand people, and then they found that early rising people had less disease than late rising people, and early rising people also look healthier than late rising people, and so on. So we may know early rising is helpful in more than one way. First, it helps to keep us healthy. We all need fresh air. But air is never so fresh as early in the morning. Besides, it is useful to do morning exercises. Secondly, early rising helps us in our studies. In the morning we learn more quickly and find it easier to understand what we learn. Thirdly, early rising can give us a plan of our work for the day. We cannot work well without a good plan. Fourthly; early rising gives us enough time to get ready for our work, such as to wash our hands and faces and eat our breakfast. Late risers may find it difficult to form the habit of early rising.

The White House says China's proposal to abolish presidential term limits — a move that could make Xi Jinping president for life — is an internal matter for Beijing. \\"I believe that's a decision for China to make about what's best for their country,\\" press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said at a Monday press briefing. Term limits, Sanders said, are something Trump \\"supports here in the United States, but that's a decision that would be up to China.\\" The Chinese Communist Party proposed removing the presidential two-term limit from China's constitution, state media reported Sunday. The move would be a further consolidation of power for Xi, who is already seen as one of China's most powerful leaders in decades. On Monday, U.S. President Donald Trump praised Xi, saying he has a \\"very good relationship\\" and \\"great respect\\" for the Chinese leader. \\"I think that President Xi is unique. He's helping us with North Korea,\\" Trump said during a White House meeting with U.S. governors. Trump has not specifically addressed the issue of China removing term limits. To some, Sanders' comments are the latest evidence of a break in the long-standing U.S. tradition of encouraging democracy in China, and reflect an unwillingness to criticize undemocratic regimes. \\"In effect, she is saying that the U.S. is OK with Xi Jinping simply asserting that he will remain in power indefinitely,\\" said Sophie Richardson, China director at Human Rights Watch. \\"Does she realize China isn't a democracy?\\" During the presidential campaign, Trump regularly slammed China and its trade policies. But since becoming president, Trump has toned down the criticism. Instead, Trump has prioritized working with China to address North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile programs. However, several reports suggest the White House could soon announce trade decisions, such as tariffs on Chinese imports, that could strain the U.S.-China relationship.

A young man who like this lamp was more than what he seemed: A diamond, in the rough.\\"The peddler then begins to tell us a tale, beginning on a dark night, where the Sultan's grand vizier, Jafar, meets with a thief named Kassim. Kassim hands over half of a gold scarab beetle, of which Jafar has the second one. Putting them together, the beetle flies off, before causing a giant tiger's head to rise from the sand: the Cave of Wonders.Jafar sends Kassim to enter, telling him to retrieve a lamp inside. However, upon approaching the Tiger's Head, it speaks that only one may enter: \\"One whose worth lies far within: the Diamond in the Rough!\\" Kassim still attempts to enter upon Jafar's orders, but upon entering the tiger's mouth, it bites down on the thief, closing off the entranceway. It is then that Jafar claims he needs to find the Diamond in the Rough in order to enter.The next day, on the streets of Agrabah, a young street urchin named Aladdin is struggling to steal a loaf of bread, along with his monkey, Abu. After outwitting some of the Palace Guards, the two settle down to eat their spoils, but are put off their stomach by a couple children who are hungry. Aladdin and Abu give the two their bread, but are then sidetracked when a Royal Prince marches through the streets, and claims Aladdin to be nothing but \\"a worthless street rat.\\" Aladdin and Abu then retire to their abode, with Aladdin promising his friend that someday, things will be better.The next day, the Royal Prince leaves the Palace, angered that Princess Jasmine has fended off his advances -- Jasmine's pet tiger Raja has bitten out the seat of the suitor's pants.

Process: - Water in the clouds becomes very cold - The cold water forms ice crystals - The ice crystals grow by absorbing surrounding water droplets - Form snowflakes - The snowflakes fall to the ground. suppose it becomes night happens, how will it affect water in the clouds becomes warmer. Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process The answer to this question is:","completion":"indirectly impacting a step of the process. At night, the temperature typically drops due to the absence of sunlight and its direct warming effect on the Earth's surface. This temperature change affects the atmosphere and the water in the clouds. As water in the clouds becomes warmer, it might indirectly impact the process of snowflake formation. Let us delve into the detailed explanation of this process and how it could be affected. The process of snowflake formation consists of the following steps: 1. Water in the clouds becomes very cold: During the day, the sun's rays heat the Earth's surface, causing the water to evaporate and rise into the atmosphere. As the water vapor goes higher, it cools and condenses into tiny droplets, forming clouds. At night, with a decrease in temperature, the water in the clouds may become colder, favoring the formation of ice crystals. 2. The cold water forms ice crystals: When the temperature reaches the freezing point or below inside the clouds, the water droplets combine and form ice crystals. At this stage, the process of creating snowflakes is initiated. 3. The ice crystals grow by absorbing surrounding water droplets: As the ice crystals come into contact with nearby water droplets, they grow larger by absorbing those droplets. This process is known as accretion, and it results in the formation of more extensive and intricate ice crystal structures. 4. Snowflakes are formed: When several ice crystals stick together and aggregate, they form a snowflake. Each snowflake has a unique shape and size, as it is influenced by atmospheric conditions such as temperature, humidity, and wind. 5. The snowflakes fall to the ground: Once the snowflakes become heavy enough, they fall to the ground due to gravity. The right atmospheric conditions, such as cold temperatures and suitable relative humidity, are necessary for the snowflakes to reach the ground without melting. If, at night, water in the clouds becomes warmer, it may indirectly impact the first step of the process – the formation of ice crystals. Warmer temperatures might prevent the water droplets in the clouds from reaching the freezing point or below, making the formation of ice crystals less efficient. This alteration in the first step may subsequently affect the other stages in the process. In conclusion, the supposed warming of water in the clouds at night is an indirect perturbation, as it might influence the first step of the snowflake formation process. This change in atmospheric conditions could lead to a reduced efficiency of ice crystal formation, and consequently, fewer snowflakes being created and reaching the ground."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

However, if I have to provide a rating based on the given scale, I would rate it as follows: Rating: 2/5 Here's a breakdown of the rating and the reasons behind it: 1. Brevity: Although short and straightforward, the review is too brief and lacks comprehensive information. It would be more helpful to other readers if the reviewer had provided more insights or specific reasons behind their positive experience. 2. Lack of context: The review does not mention any context regarding what it is about. It could be for a restaurant, a product, or a service. It is impossible for other users or potential customers to benefit from this review without knowing what the subject is. 3. Ambiguity: The word \\"Best\\" doesn't convey much about what is being reviewed. People often have varied opinions about what qualifies as the best. A more thorough explanation about what made the experience or product exceptional is necessary to understand the reviewer's perspective better. 4. Unhelpful for decision-making: Since the review is limited to only one word, it does not give potential customers any valuable information to make an informed decision.

Question: Given the following passage \\"The early Western Han court simultaneously accepted the philosophical teachings of Legalism, Huang-Lao Daoism, and Confucianism in making state decisions and shaping government policy. However, the Han court under Emperor Wu gave Confucianism exclusive patronage. He abolished all academic chairs or erudites (bóshì 博士) not dealing with the Confucian Five Classics in 136 BC and encouraged nominees for office to receive a Confucian-based education at the Imperial University that he established in 124 BC. Unlike the original ideology espoused by Confucius, or Kongzi (551–479 BC), Han Confucianism in Emperor Wu's reign was the creation of Dong Zhongshu (179–104 BC). Dong was a scholar and minor official who aggregated the ethical Confucian ideas of ritual, filial piety, and harmonious relationships with five phases and yin-yang cosmologies. Much to the interest of the ruler, Dong's synthesis justified the imperial system of government within the natural order of the universe.

Write the answer: What is the name of the substance obtained from the dried bladders of fish, used in brewing and wine-making ?","completion":"The substance obtained from the dried bladders of fish, used in brewing and wine-making, is known as isinglass. Isinglass is a form of collagen derived primarily from the swim bladders of certain fish species, notably sturgeon and other members of the Acipenseridae family, although other fish such as cod and catfish may also be used. Isinglass has been used in various industries since the 18th century, including as a clarifying agent for beers and wines. It functions as a natural fining agent, with the purpose of refining and polishing the appearance of the liquid while maintaining its original flavor profile. The isinglass works by attracting and binding with the haze-forming particles, such as proteins, yeasts, and other suspended materials present in the beverage. These larger combined particles then sink to the bottom of the container, leaving behind a clearer liquid that can be easily decanted or siphoned off. In the brewing and wine-making industry, isinglass is preferred because it is considered to be an organic and efficient way to clarify beverages without the use of synthetic chemicals. Another advantage of isinglass is that it is quite neutral in taste, ensuring that it doesn’t alter the flavor or aroma of the final product. Though isinglass is an effective agent for clarifying alcoholic beverages, its use has raised concerns among vegetarians and vegans. Since it is derived from animal by-products (specifically fish), it renders the final products as non-vegan or non-vegetarian. Consequently, various vegan alternatives have been developed which serve a similar purpose in clarifying beers and wines. Examples include bentonite (a clay), Irish moss (a type of seaweed), and synthetic polymers. In conclusion, isinglass is a collagen-rich substance derived from the dried bladders of fish, specifically used as a fining agent in brewing and wine-making. Due to its natural and neutral properties, it remains a popular choice for clarifying alcoholic beverages and has been in use for centuries. However, as awareness grows about the needs and preferences of vegetarian and vegan consumers, alternative non-animal-based clarifying agents are becoming increasingly popular."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Article: Switch on the broiler setting of your oven and allow the heating element to warm up for 5 to 10 minutes. Some broilers only have on and off settings, while others also have high and low settings. If yours is the latter, switch the broiler onto high. Place the upper oven rack roughly 6 inches (15 cm) away from the upper heating element of the oven. This upper heating element is the only portion that turns on when you use the broiler. Peel the husks back, revealing the entire ear of corn, but do not remove them. Instead, use scissors to cut the husks down to a length of roughly 4 inches (10 cm), then wrap the hanging husks in aluminum foil. Pick away any hanging silks during this step, as well. Wrapping the husks with foil is a necessary step. If you don't do this, the husks will quickly burn under the intense heat of the broiler and may even catch on fire. If you don't wish to use the husks and stem as handles while serving the corn, you can remove them completely. Arrange the ears of corn in single layer on a baking sheet, then drizzle them with olive oil. If desired, you may also season the corn with salt and pepper. You can cover the baking sheet with aluminum foil, if desired, but doing so is not necessary. Note that olive oil is a better choice than butter for this method since it has a higher smoking point and will be less likely to overheat in the broiler. Place the ears of corn under the preheated broiler. Watch the corn carefully, and rotate the ears each time the kernels on that side begin charring. You'll need to rotate the after the first 3 to 5 minutes, then twice more every 3 to 5 minutes after that. When ready, the corn should be lightly and evenly charred, and tender throughout. Note that you can also remove the foil from around the husks during the last 2 minutes, if desired, so that they can char lightly without burning. Remove the corn from the oven and sprinkle it with chopped parsley, if desired. Serve it while it's still hot. What is a summary of what this article is about?","completion":"This article provides a detailed guide on how to broil corn in an oven. It involves preheating the broiler, preparing the corn by peeling back the husks and wrapping them in foil, arranging the corn on a baking sheet and drizzling with olive oil, broiling and rotating the corn to achieve even charring, and finally serving the cooked corn garnished with parsley. The article emphasizes the importance of proper husk preparation to prevent burning and discusses the use of olive oil instead of butter to withstand higher cooking temperatures."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

However, high above the village, in a crooked house, lives the evil landlord of the village, named Barnaby. Barnaby is privy to the fact that upon being wed, Mary will inherit money, and as such, he intents to marry her to get to it. To do so, he recruits two men named Gonzorgo and Rodrigo, to kidnap Tom and throw him in the sea. As well, the sheep tended by Little Bo Peep (who lives with Mary, along with Little Boy Blue, Wee Willie Winkie, and two twin girls) must be stolen too, as they provide a source of income for the small family.After Tom leaves Mary for the evening, the two men knock him out, and tie him in a sack.

Answer:","completion":"The trees in \\"Babes in Toyland\\" may seem like ordinary trees to some characters or audience members, and the reason for this might be that the trees in the setting of Mother Goose Village are simply part of the village's familiar landscape. The ordinary appearance of the trees could also serve as a way to contrast the fantastical elements of the movie with the seemingly normal aspects of the village. The film \\"Babes in Toyland\\" is a musical fantasy film from 1961, also known as \\"March of the Wooden Soldiers,\\" which is based on an operetta of the same name by Victor Herbert. The plot revolves around the classic characters from nursery rhymes that live in Mother Goose Village. The main storyline follows Mary Quite Contrary and Tom Piper as they prepare for their upcoming marriage. However, their plans are threatened by the evil landlord, Barnaby, who wants to marry Mary for her inheritance. The story is filled with a unique blend of magic, adventure, and classic nursery rhyme characters. Some factors to consider when deciding whether to invest in a film proposal like this one are the potential target audience, the appeal of the story, the production budget, and the talent involved in the project. The nostalgic charm and connections to familiar nursery rhymes may make this film appealing for family audiences, while the musical and fantasy elements could potentially draw in a wider variety of viewers. Furthermore, consider researching the response to the original 1961 film and any subsequent adaptations to assess potential market interest in this story. Assessing the current popularity and marketability of similar movies in the musical and fantasy genres may also be helpful in determining the film's potential for success."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. This film has a powerful philosophical ending. But that ending has meaning only if you watch the movie from the beginning. Youth alienation in the late 1960's, from the viewpoint of a young man and a young woman, is the obvious theme of \\"Zabriskie Point\\". Neither Mark Frechette nor Daria Halprin had much acting experience, a fact that actually enhances the film's message. Having untrained actors conveys a sense of realism, as both players seem emotionally detached from the turmoil around them. This is not a script-driven film. Except for the first ten minutes, it is mostly visual, with stunning cinematography. The beautiful naturalistic images seem other-worldly, and perfectly in sync with the emotional detachment of Mark and Daria. I would have replaced the thematically weak Pink Floyd music with the more cogent music of The Doors. Many scenes cry out for \\"Riders On The Storm\\". Even so, I like this film. It's different; it's unique; it is artistic and imaginative. And the desert badlands are beautiful. As the years go by, \\"Zabriskie Point\\" seems more and more attractive.

Review: After having read \\"Midwives,\\" I was looking forward to Chris Bohjalian's next book, \\"The Law of Similars.\\" Unfortunately, it was dull in comparison to \\"Midwives,\\" a book that kept me so enthralled I practically read it in a single sitting. \\"The Law of Similars\\" seemed to be too trendy and too slow such that I was almost completely disinterested by the time I reached the middle part of the novel when it became more interesting. Answer: Answer:","completion":"The tone of this product review can be identified as negative. The author started the review mentioning they had high hopes for the book after reading another book by the same author, which set the expectations they had before reading \\"The Law of Similars.\\" However, the reviewer then proceeds to share a series of disappointments they experienced while reading the book, which contributed to the negative tone. The first disappointment mentioned is that the book was \\"dull\\" in comparison to \\"Midwives,\\" which was a captivating read for the reviewer. By using the word \\"dull,\\" the reviewer communicates that they feel this book lacks the excitement and intrigue that was present in the previous work they read. This implies that the book did not meet their expectations in terms of being a gripping and engaging story. Next, the reviewer describes the book as \\"too trendy\\" and \\"too slow.\\" These criticisms suggest that the reviewer found the book to be trying too hard to appeal to current trends, which, in their opinion, detracted from the overall quality and authenticity of the story. Additionally, the pacing of the book was an issue because it was slow to the extent that the reviewer almost lost interest entirely. The fact that \\"the middle part of the novel\\" became more enjoyable does not seem to be enough to compensate for these earlier disappointments, as it is still outweighed by the negative experiences. Ultimately, the negativity in this review stems from the author's high expectations and the multiple disappointments encountered while reading the book. The tone is undeniably negative due to the emphasis on what the book lacked compared to the author's previous work and the criticisms of its trendiness and pacing. While there may be some redeeming qualities later in the story, the negative aspects discussed were clearly dominant and contributed to the overall tone of disappointment and dissatisfaction."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This ability is especially important when it comes to giving a voice to those who often go unheard, such as kids in need of homes. In a heartwarming effort to create awareness and spark change, talented photographers from around the world are using their skills to provide a glimpse into the lives of these children, capturing their spirit and resilience in the face of adversity. Step 1: Identifying the Need The journey begins with identifying the need for such a project. Millions of children worldwide are living in foster care, orphanages, and other alternative care situations, waiting for a loving family to provide them with a stable home. Understanding the reality of these children's lives and the importance of finding them a loving and permanent home is the first step toward creating a meaningful photography project. Step 2: Collaboration with Organizations Collaborating with nonprofits and other organizations that work in the field of child welfare is crucial. These organizations have access to the children and can facilitate the necessary permissions and arrangements to photograph them. Furthermore, they can provide valuable insight and context into the kids' lives and the hurdles they face, ensuring that the photographs tell a comprehensive story. Step 3: Recruiting Photographers Recruiting photographers who have a passion for the cause and an understanding of the sensitivity required when working with vulnerable children is essential. These photographers should have experience capturing emotions and expressions, allowing them to bring out the true spirit of the kids. By collaborating with multiple photographers, the project can harness a variety of styles and perspectives, creating a rich and diverse visual narrative. Step 4: Building Trust with the Children Entering a child’s life—especially one who has experienced trauma—requires patience, empathy, and understanding. Building trust with the kids is of utmost importance, as it ensures that the photographs reflect their genuine emotions and portray their true spirit. Photographers must take the time to connect with each child, fostering a sense of safety and comfort that translates to the final images. Step 5: Capturing the Spirit With trust established, photographers are ready to capture the spirit of the children in need of homes. By photographing them in their everyday surroundings, the photographers create an authentic representation of the kids' lives. These images can encompass both the obstacles the children have faced and the resilience they have demonstrated, providing a sense of hope and inspiration amidst their struggles. Step 6: Sharing the Stories The ultimate goal of this photography project is to share the children’s stories with as many potential adoptive families as possible. By showcasing the images on various platforms, including social media and exhibitions, the project aims to raise awareness and inspire action from those who could provide loving homes to these kids. This step brings the project full circle and serves as a testament to the power of photography in creating meaningful social change. Conclusion: Photographers have a unique opportunity to use their skills for good, capturing the spirits of kids in need of homes and shedding light on the challenges they face. By working in collaboration with organizations, building trust with the children, and sharing their stories, they can help make a real difference in these kids' lives. Through their work, they not only create beautiful images but also contribute to a better future for those who need it most."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Reunited: Helen Smith has been reunited with her pet dog Snowy - four years after she disappeared. Helen Smith thought she would never see her pet dog Snowy again after she disappeared four years ago. The Parson Russell Terrier had been playing in her owner’s garden in Hook, Hampshire, before she vanished in a suspected theft in October 2010. But the 13-year-old dog is now back home after she was found wandering along a dual carriageway in Portsmouth, more than 40 miles away. Miss Smith, 50, said: ‘I was absolutely devastated when she was stolen. I did all I could to find her, but eventually resigned myself to having lost her for good. ‘I broke down in tears when I got the phone call to say Snowy had been found. I was in complete shock.’ Staff at the Portsmouth City Dog Kennel had scanned Snowy’s microchip and consulted their database, Petlog, allowing them to reunite her with IT worker Miss Smith. Miss Smith said she was worried that Snowy would not recognise her as she had poor eyesight and was due to have a cataract operation before she went missing. But she added: 'I shouldn’t have worried - as soon as we turned down our lane she started to get really excited, so I knew that she hadn’t forgotten. “She has returned straight to her old bed and she hasn’t left my side since getting home. 'I am eternally grateful I had Snowy micro chipped - without that I had no hope of ever finding your beloved pet again.'

Warned that failure to do so would fuel 'mistrust' about rail project. Article:","completion":"Title: Michael Fabricant Calls for Transparency in HS2 Report, Citing Potential 'Mistrust' in the Rail Project Introduction: In a recent announcement, Michael Fabricant, MP for Lichfield and vocal critic of the HS2 project, called for the government to publish a highly anticipated report on the controversial high-speed railway line, citing concerns over potential mistrust surrounding the project. The HS2 railway has faced many challenges since its inception, including significant opposition, cost overruns, and delays. Fabricant's statement encourages transparency to gain public trust and ensure that issues are addressed in the open. The Demand for Transparency: With public taxpayer funds supporting a large portion of the HS2 project, Michael Fabricant believes that the government should provide complete transparency to maintain trust and justify its continued investment. He asserts that keeping the report confidential would only fuel mistrust regarding HS2, potentially undermining its overall success. Fabricant's statement further demonstrates the tension between the government's efforts to keep details of the contentious project under wraps, and mounting calls for full transparency in the decision-making process. He proposes that publishing the full report could help address unanswered questions and alleviate concerns raised by politicians, businesses, environmentalists, and the general public. A Controversial Project: The HS2 project has encountered much controversy since it was first proposed in 2009. Those opposed to HS2 argue that the railway line would have negative environmental and economic impacts, such as irreparable damage to the countryside, excessive noise pollution, and cost overruns. Critics also assert that the potential benefits, including shortened travel times and increased capacity, are overstated. Moreover, there have been widespread allegations of corruption and incompetence associated with the project. Claims of mismanagement, secretive decision-making, and corporate lobbying consistently surface, leading to increased skepticism about HS2's merits and potential return on investment. The Importance of Accountability: As the UK's largest infrastructure project, the HS2 rail line constitutes a significant expenditure for taxpayers. Many argue that, given the enormous financial commitment and potential risks involved, the government should be fully accountable for its decisions. Michael Fabricant's call for releasing the full report underscores the importance of ensuring that all relevant information is available to the public, in a bid to foster informed debate and scrutiny. If the government refuses to release the report, it risks further alienating those concerned with the project's potential impacts and diminishing faith in its ability to deliver efficient, high-quality services on time and within budget. Conclusion: Michael Fabricant's demand for the publication of the HS2 report is a crucial call-to-action for increased transparency and accountability in the project's development, decision-making, and execution. As a representative of those affected by HS2, his statement serves as a reminder of the need to consider – and address – the concerns and mistrust that have arisen throughout the process. In order for the UK government to maintain public trust in the HS2 project and demonstrate a commitment to responsible spending, it is essential that they publish the full report on the high-speed rail line. Failing to do so carries the risk of further exacerbating mistrust and undermining an infrastructure project whose long-term success hinges on the support and confidence of the public."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Significant reforms were announced in late 2008 under Defence Minister Anatoliy Serdyukov (in office 2007-2012), and major structural reorganisation began in 2009. Key elements of the reforms announced in October 2008 included reducing the armed forces to a strength of one million by 2012 (planned end-date was 2016); reducing the number of officers; centralising officer training from 65 military schools into 10 \\"systemic\\" military training centres; reducing the size of the central command; introducing more civilian logistics and auxiliary staff; elimination of cadre-strength formation (military)s; reorganising the reserves; reorganising the army into a brigade system; and reorganising air forces into an air-base system instead of regiments. On 17 October 2012 the head of the State Dumas Defence Committee told RIA Novosti that Russia planned to boost annual defense spending by 59 percent to almost 3 trillion rubles (83.3 billion) in 2015 up from 61 billion in 2012. \\"Targeted national defence spending as a percentage of GDP will amount to 3.2 percent in 2013, 3.4 percent in 2014 and 3.7 percent in 2015\\", Defence Committee chairman Vladimir Komoedov is quoted as saying in the committees conclusion on the draft budget for 2013-2015. Defence Committee chairman Vladimir Komoedov is quoted on a draft budget that covers how many years?","completion":"The draft budget that Defence Committee chairman Vladimir Komoedov is quoted on covers a span of three years, specifically from 2013 to 2015. This draft budget was significant as it outlined an apparent increase in defense spending for Russia. Komoedov addressed plans to significantly boost annual defense spending by 59 percent to nearly 3 trillion rubles or approximately 83.3 billion by 2015, which was a notable increase from the 2012 budget of 61 billion. As a percentage of GDP, the targeted national defense spending would rise to 3.2 percent in 2013, 3.4 percent in 2014, and 3.7 percent in 2015. This report came closely on the heels of a series of significant reforms announced in late 2008 under then Defence Minister Anatoliy Serdyukov. The announced reforms entailed a series of structural reorganizations aimed to streamline and modernize the Russian armed forces. The reforms envisaged a reduction of the armed forces to a strength of one million personnel by 2012, centralizing officer training, downsizing the central command, and introducing a more civilian logistics and auxiliary staff. Furthermore, Serdyukov also declared his intent to eliminate cadre-strength formations, transitioning the army into a brigade system and the air forces into an air-base system, a departure from the traditional regimental arrangement. These reforms aimed to revolutionize the Russian military structure, elevating its standards to correspond with modern military requirements. Thus, the highlighted timeframe, 2013-2015, was a crucial period in the Russian defense landscape as it incorporated both the completion of the ambitious defense reforms as well as a substantial surge in defense expenditure, reaffirming the state's commitment to ensuring a robust, modern, and efficient military apparatus."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Context: I lost sight in one eye when in college, I had two preschool children at the time. I was walking through the house one morning and suddenly I could see NOTHING out of one eye. When I told my husband,who was right there when it happened, he assumed my eye was just blurry or something had gotten in the eye. He took me to the ophthalmologist who verified that I could not see out of the eye. Then we subsequently got the worse news that it was a neurological condition with a long name I do not remember that there was nothing he could do about. He said that I would either get my sight back or I you and all we could do was wait and see if it came back. This was right before finals that semester but he told me I absolutely could not be studying or using my good eye for reading or basically anything that would strain it or I could end up losing sight in that eye also. Needless to say, as a mom of two children ages 2 1/2 and 6 months,I could not afford to lose ALL of my sight! So, I had to wait. I could not drive like that either which made matters worse. Both my husband and I were in school fulltime (until then), fortunately it was the end of the semester, unfortunately it was BEFORE finals. My sight did come back but not for about 5 months. When it first started to come back I still couldn't drive because although I could see I did not have my peripheral vision, that did not fully come back for quite a while. I cannot imagine it a person who goes totally blind goes through, I just know for me it was not an easy to to go through.

Options: - hallway - store window - pole - public place - shop window The answer is \\"public place\\" because A:","completion":"The answer, \\"public place,\\" is the most appropriate option for posting a paper sign announcing a civic meeting, as it offers a myriad of advantages in terms of visibility, accessibility, and information dissemination. By posting the sign in a public place, relevant details and updates about the civic meeting will reach a wider audience, thereby heightening participation and engagement in community matters. Firstly, public places often attract diverse groups of people due to their inherent openness and strategic locations. Consequently, posting the paper sign announcing a civic meeting in a public space ensures that the information is easily viewable by the general public, including those who may not frequent retail establishments or use specific routes where poles and hallways are situated. Secondly, accessibility plays a vital role in effective communication, particularly in instances where important events like civic meetings are involved. Public places are designed to cater to as many people as possible, with minimal restrictions on entry or access. This universal accessibility significantly benefits the dissemination of the meeting's details, giving individuals the opportunity to plan their attendance and contribute to the deliberations and decision-making processes. Additionally, public places may experience higher foot traffic compared to alternative options like store windows or hallways. The tendency for individuals to congregate, pass through, or even linger in public spaces amplifies the chances that the paper sign will be noticed. In turn, greater visibility increases the likelihood that interested citizens will attend the meeting. Moreover, public places often possess a neutral and communal character, devoid of any commercial or private undertones that may be associated with store or shop windows. This neutrality fosters an environment where information about civic matters can be promoted and considered without any perceived biases or ulterior motives, upholding a sense of transparency and good governance. Lastly, posting the notice in a public place complements existing communication channels such as online platforms, local newspapers, and radio broadcasts. The combination of traditional and modern media allows the message to reach even more people, accommodating different preferences in information consumption. In conclusion, posting a paper sign about a civic meeting in a public place is the most suitable option given its benefits in terms of visibility, accessibility, and information dissemination. By choosing a public place, the sign will reach a wider audience, facilitate increased participation in community matters, and reinforce the importance of open, transparent, and inclusive civic engagement."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Is the following sentence linguistically acceptable? I pushed the table.","completion":"Yes, the sentence \\"I pushed the table\\" is linguistically acceptable. Let's break it down and analyze the three main components of this sentence: the subject, the verb, and the object. 1. Subject: \\"I\\" - This is a pronoun that refers to the person who is speaking or writing the sentence, the first person singular pronoun. The use of \\"I\\" as a subject is a common and correct way to refer to oneself in a sentence. 2. Verb: \\"pushed\\" - This is the past tense of the verb \\"to push.\\" Verbs are the action words that express what the subject is doing in a sentence, and \\"push\\" is an appropriate verb that indicates the action of exerting force on an object in order to move it away from oneself. By using \\"pushed\\" in the past tense, it denotes that the action has already occurred. 3. Object: \\"the table\\" - This is the recipient of the action, the thing that is being pushed in the sentence. \\"The table\\" is a definite noun phrase made up of the definite article \\"the\\" and the common noun \\"table.\\" The use of the definite article \\"the\\" specifies that it is a particular table that is being referred to, and not just any table. Together, these three elements (subject, verb, and object) form a simple, complete sentence with clear meaning. The sentence expresses that the speaker has exerted force on a specific table to move it. The structure of the sentence, adhering to the basic subject-verb-object (SVO) word order common in English, is grammatically sound and linguistically acceptable. Furthermore, the syntax, semantics, and pragmatics of the sentence are well-formed, making it appropriate both in spoken and written contexts."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

What data can be extracted from this sentence?","completion":"Alright kiddo, let me explain this to you. This sentence has some interesting information. Let's break it down: 1. \\"Epoch of 1000 Piazzia\\" - This is talking about a special moment in time for something called 1000 Piazzia. It's kind of like knowing when a birthday party is happening. 2. \\"Periapsis of 352497000000.0\\" - This number is really big, isn't it? It's talking about how close 1000 Piazzia gets to something really important. Imagine you're playing on a swing, and when you're at the closest point to your mom, that's like your periapsis (closest point). 3. \\"2015-06-27\\" - This is a date, like on a calendar. It's telling us about the special moment in time for 1000 Piazzia (like a birthday party) that happened on June 27th, 2015.

Question: Clothes can make phone calls, play music, dial your pal's number, keep you warm during cold weather and operate your computer? This is not a fantasy. A British company, called Electrotextiles, has created a wide range of clothes -- clothes that have minds of their own! Scientists, working for the company, have invented a kind of fabric that can be blended with flexible electronic materials to create intelligent clothing. The result are electronic garments. If you think the wearer has to be wired to different devices, think again. These designer clothes are wire-free, soft to touch and washable!! Like any electronic device, these high-tech clothes have to be powered. Currently, a tiny nine-volt battery serves the purpose. But the researchers hope that in the near future the clothes will generate electricity by using body heat. These clothes are 100 percent shock proof, they say. The Electrotextiles team has also created the world's first cloth keyboard. This keyboard can be sewn into your trousers or skirt. To use this device, you will have to sit down and tap on your lap! These 'lap- tap' gadgets are all set to take over laptop computers! Another useful garment is the shirt-cum-mobile phone. This handy invention enables drivers to chat comfortably with others at the wheel! Other popular electronic wear include the denim jacket with flexible earphones sewn into the hood and the electronic ski jacket with a built-in heater. The ski jacket is also programmed to send signals to a satellite. This technology is known as global positioning system and can be used to track lost skiers and wandering kids.

Streets normally filled with people are empty. One of the most popular professional soccer teams recently played a game in an empty stadium that can seat more than100,000 people. It's swine flu that has made life in Mexico City grind to a halt . Seemingly out of nowhere, swine flu has caused confirmed deaths in 12 countries as of April 30. It has sent a wave of alarm around the world. Governments are trying to find ways to prevent further out-breaks. The World Health Organization has raised its swine flu global threat level to five out of six. People may be familiar with bird flu, but they know little about swine flu. Swine flu is a contagious respiratory disease in pigs. It is caused by a type-A influenza virus. Humans can also catch swine flu. The virus causes regular outbreaks in pigs, but people usually do not catch it. However, there have been cases of the virus spreading to people, and then from one person to another. The symptoms of swine flu are similar to the common flu. They include fever, lethargy , lack of appetite, coughing, runny nose, sore throat, nausea , and vomiting . The high proportion of young adults among the deaths is one of several mysteries about this virus. Most of the dead had lung damage. What caused it is not yet known. The virus spreads the same way the common flu does. When an infected person coughs or sneezes around another person, the latter is put at risk. People can get the disease by touching something with the flu virus on it and then touching their mouth, nose or eyes. There are medicines to treat swine flu. Doctors suggest using anti - viral drugs. They keep the virus from reproducing inside the body. Although there are no vaccines for it now, several everyday steps can help prevent the spread of the virus: washing hands frequently; avoiding close contact with people who are sick; and avoiding touching surfaces that might have the virus on it. People may worry that they will get swine flu from eating or preparing pork. In fact,... Question: The following tips can protect us from swine flu EXCEPT _ .

Last week, a federal judge issued a decision lifting the age and point-of-sale restrictions on emergency contraception, citing solid scientific and medical research showing that it is safe and effective in preventing unintended pregnancy. This is great news for all women because these restrictions created confusion and barriers, and when unprotected sex has occurred, time is a crucial factor. Emergency contraception can prevent pregnancy for up to five days after intercourse, but the sooner it's used the more effective it is. That's why women's health providers and activists lobbied to make emergency contraception available without a prescription â€” to reduce delays. And because emergency contraception is safe, making it over-the-counter was a big step in creating better access to birth control. Clearing up confusion about what emergency contraception is and how it works has been more challenging. It's a fact that emergency contraception is birth control. The reality is, pregnancy doesn't happen right after sex. It can take up to six days for the sperm and egg to meet after intercourse. That's why it's possible to prevent pregnancy even after the fact. Emergency contraception postpones ovulation, which prevents sperm from coming in contact with and fertilizing an egg. Pregnancy can't happen if there is no egg to join with sperm. In contrast, the so-called \\"abortion pill,\\" mifepristone, works by blocking the hormone progesterone, which is needed for a pregnancy to continue. So there's a big difference between emergency contraception and nonsurgical abortion. There was much talk last week about the implications of lifting the age restrictions. Some of it was motivated by safety concerns, which is a good and natural question to ask about any medication. It's a fact that doctors have been prescribing emergency birth control since the 1960s, and there have been no reports of serious complications. More to the point, studies have repeatedly shown that emergency contraception is safe for use by women of all ages, including teens. Another concern among some is that access to emergency contraception will increase the rates of unprotected sex, especially among teens. There is no evidence to support this. It's a fact that rates of unprotected sex do not increase when there is more access to emergency contraception. Research also indicates that teens understand how to use emergency contraception and that it is not intended for ongoing, regular use. The bottom line is that the use of reliable birth control is the best way to prevent an unintended pregnancy, but the fact is that unprotected sex does occur and sometimes birth control methods do fail. A condom could break, a woman could forget to take a pill, or nonconsensual sex could occur. That's why when a woman fears she might become pregnant after her contraceptive has failed or she has had unprotected sex, she needs fast access to emergency contraception, not delays at the pharmacy counter. Lifting these restrictions will allow emergency contraception to be stocked on store shelves, making it more accessible to everyone. It will provide a safe, effective way to prevent pregnancy and reduce the need for abortion. That's why last week's ruling is so important â€” it's based on good science and good sense. And that's a fact. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Deborah Nucatola. What are the important parts of this article?","completion":"1.

Information: - In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs. - Life is a characteristic distinguishing physical entities having biological processes, such as signaling and self-sustaining processes, from those that do not, either because such functions have ceased, or because they never had such functions and are classified as inanimate. Various forms of life exist, such as plants, animals, fungi, protists, archaea, and bacteria. The criteria can at times be ambiguous and may or may not define viruses, viroids, or potential artificial life as \\"living\\". Biology is the primary science concerned with the study of life, although many other sciences are involved. - Southeast Asia or Southeastern Asia is a subregion of Asia, consisting of the countries that are geographically south of China, east of India, west of New Guinea and north of Australia. The region lies near the intersection of geological plates, with heavy seismic and volcanic activity. Southeast Asia consists of two geographic regions: - Java (Indonesian: Jawa; Javanese: ; Sundanese: ) is an island of Indonesia. With a population of over 141 million (the island itself) or 145 million (the administrative region) Census released in December 2015, Java is home to 56.7 percent of the Indonesian population and is the most populous island on Earth. The Indonesian capital city, Jakarta, is located on western Java. Much of Indonesian history took place on Java. It was the center of powerful Hindu-Buddhist empires, the Islamic sultanates, and the core of the colonial Dutch East Indies. Java was also the center of the Indonesian struggle for independence during the 1930s and 1940s. Java dominates Indonesia politically, economically and culturally. - Borneo is the third-largest island in the world and the largest island in Asia. At the geographic centre of Maritime Southeast Asia, in relation to major Indonesian islands, it is located north of Java, west of Sulawesi, and east of Sumatra. - Animals are multicellular, eukaryotic organisms of the kingdom Animalia (also called Metazoa). The animal kingdom emerged as a basal clade within Apoikozoa as a sister of the choanoflagellates. Sponges are the most basal clade of animals. Animals are motile, meaning they can move spontaneously and independently at some point in their lives. Their body plan eventually becomes fixed as they develop, although some undergo a process of metamorphosis later in their lives. All animals are heterotrophs: they must ingest other organisms or their products for sustenance. - The Philippines, officially the Republic of the Philippines, is a sovereign island country in Southeast Asia situated in the western Pacific Ocean. It consists of about 7,641 islands that are categorized broadly under three main geographical divisions from north to south: Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao. The capital city of the Philippines is Manila and the most populous city is Quezon City, both part of Metro Manila. Bounded by the South China Sea on the west, the Philippine Sea on the east and the Celebes Sea on the southwest, the Philippines shares maritime borders with Taiwan to the north, Vietnam to the west, Palau to the east and Malaysia and Indonesia to the south. - Sumatra is a large island in western Indonesia that is part of the Sunda Islands. It is the largest island that is entirely in Indonesia (two larger islands, Borneo and New Guinea, are shared between Indonesia and other countries) and the sixth-largest island in the world at 473,481 km (including adjacent islands such as the Riau Islands and Bangka Belitung Islands). - Brackish water or briny water is water that has more salinity than fresh water, but not as much as seawater. It may result from mixing of seawater with fresh water, as in estuaries, or it may occur in brackish fossil aquifers. The word comes from the Middle Dutch root \\"brak\\". Certain human activities can produce brackish water, in particular civil engineering projects such as dikes and the flooding of coastal marshland to produce brackish water pools for freshwater prawn farming. Brackish water is also the primary waste product of the salinity gradient power process. Because brackish water is hostile to the growth of most terrestrial plant species, without appropriate management it is damaging to the environment (see article on shrimp farms). - A Muslim is someone who follows or practises Islam, a monotheistic Abrahamic religion. Muslims consider the Quran (Koran), their holy book, to be the verbatim word of God as revealed to the Islamic prophet and messenger Muhammad. They also follow the teachings and practices of Muhammad (\\"sunnah \\") as recorded in traditional accounts (\\"hadith\\"). \\"Muslim\\" is an Arabic word meaning \\"one who submits (to God)\\". - Marine life, or sea life or ocean life, refers to the plants, animals and other organisms that live in the salt water of the sea or ocean, or the brackish water of coastal estuaries. At a fundamental level, marine life helps determine the very nature of our planet. Marine organisms produce much of the oxygen we breathe. Shorelines are in part shaped and protected by marine life, and some marine organisms even help create new land. - An island country is a country whose primary territory consists of one or more islands or parts of islands. As of 2011, 46 (approximately 24%) of the 193 UN member states are island countries. - Oceania (or ), also known as Oceanica, is a region centred on the islands of the tropical Pacific Ocean. Opinions of what constitutes Oceania range from its three subregions of Melanesia, Micronesia, and Polynesia to, more broadly, the entire insular region between Southeast Asia and the Americas, including Australasia and the Malay Archipelago. - An ocean (the sea of classical antiquity) is a body of saline water that composes much of a planet's hydrosphere. On Earth, an ocean is one of the major conventional divisions of the World Ocean, which covers almost 71% of its surface. These are, in descending order by area, the Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, Southern (Antarctic), and Arctic Oceans. The word \\"sea\\" is often used interchangeably with \\"ocean\\" in American English but, strictly speaking, a sea is a body of saline water (generally a division of the world ocean) partly or fully enclosed by land. - India, officially the Republic of India (\\"Bhrat Gaarjya\\"), is a country in South Asia. It is the seventh-largest country by area, the second-most populous country (with over 1.2 billion people), and the most populous democracy in the world. It is bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast. It shares land borders with Pakistan to the west; China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the northeast; and Myanmar (Burma) and Bangladesh to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives. India's Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand and Indonesia. Its capital is New Delhi; other metropolises include Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Bangalore, Hyderabad and Ahmedabad. - Bitung is a city on the northern coast of the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia . It is in the province of North Sulawesi , and faces Lembeh Island and the Lembeh Strait , which is known for its colorful marine life , in particular sea slugs . Bitung has a population of 187,932 at the 2010 Census . - Oxygen is a chemical element with symbol O and atomic number 8. It is a member of the chalcogen group on the periodic table and is a highly reactive nonmetal and oxidizing agent that readily forms oxides with most elements as well as other compounds. By mass, oxygen is the third-most abundant element in the universe, after hydrogen and helium. At standard temperature and pressure, two atoms of the element bind to form dioxygen, a colorless and odorless diatomic gas with the formula . This is an important part of the atmosphere and diatomic oxygen gas constitutes 20.8% of the Earth's atmosphere. Additionally, as oxides the element makes up almost half of the Earth's crust. - Indonesia (or ; Indonesian: ), officially the Republic of Indonesia, is a unitary sovereign state and transcontinental country located mainly in Southeast Asia with some territories in Oceania. Situated between the Indian and Pacific oceans, it is the world's largest island country, with more than seventeen thousand islands. At , Indonesia is the world's 14th-largest country in terms of land area and world's 7th-largest country in terms of combined sea and land area. It has an estimated population of over 260 million people and is the world's fourth most populous country, the most populous Austronesian nation, as well as the most populous Muslim-majority country. The world's most populous island of Java contains more than half of the country's population. - Manado (pronounced in Manado Malay, in Indonesian)) is the capital city of the North Sulawesi province of Indonesia. Manado is located at the Bay of Manado, and is surrounded by a mountainous area. The city had 408,354 inhabitants at the 2010 Census, making it the second-largest city in Sulawesi after Makassar. The latest official estimate (for January 2014) is 430,790. - Sulawesi, formerly known as Celebes (or ), is an island in Indonesia. One of the four Greater Sunda Islands, and the world's eleventh-largest island, it is situated between Borneo and the Maluku Islands. Within Indonesia, only Sumatra, Borneo and Papua are larger in territory, and only Java and Sumatra have larger populations. - The Maluku Islands or the Moluccas are an archipelago within Indonesia. Tectonically they are located on the Halmahera Plate within the Molucca Sea Collision Zone. Geographically they are located east of Sulawesi, west of New Guinea, and north and east of Timor. The islands were also the historical core of the Spice Islands known to the Chinese and Europeans, but this term usually included other adjacent areas such as Sulawesi. The name was due to the nutmeg, mace and cloves that were originally exclusively found there, and the presence of these sparked colonial interest from Europe in the 16th century. - Tin is a chemical element with the symbol Sn (for ) and atomic number 50, is a post-transition metal in group 14 of the periodic table. It is obtained chiefly from the mineral cassiterite, which contains tin dioxide, SnO. Tin shows a chemical similarity to both of its neighbors in group 14, germanium and lead, and has two main oxidation states, +2 and the slightly more stable +4. Tin is the 49th most abundant element and has, with 10 stable isotopes, the largest number of stable isotopes in the periodic table, thanks to its magic number of protons. It has two main allotropes: at room temperature, the stable allotrope is -tin, a silvery-white, malleable metal, but at low temperatures it transforms into the less dense grey -tin, which has the diamond cubic structure. Metallic tin is not easily oxidized in air. - North Sulawesi is a province of Indonesia. It is located on the northern peninsula of the island of Sulawesi, on the Minahasa Peninsula lies south of Philippines and southeast of Malaysia. The province's capital and largest city is Manado, and its population was 2,270,596 according to the 2010 census; the latest official estimate (for January 2014) is 2,382,941. - Malaysia is a federal constitutional monarchy located in Southeast Asia. It consists of thirteen states and three federal territories and has a total landmass of separated by the South China Sea into two similarly sized regions, Peninsular Malaysia and East Malaysia (Malaysian Borneo). Peninsular Malaysia shares a land and maritime border with Thailand and maritime borders with Singapore, Vietnam, and Indonesia. East Malaysia shares land and maritime borders with Brunei and Indonesia and a maritime border with the Philippines and Vietnam. The capital city is Kuala Lumpur, while Putrajaya is the seat of the federal government. With a population of over 30 million, Malaysia is the 44th most populous country. The southernmost point of continental Eurasia, Tanjung Piai, is in Malaysia. Located in the tropics, Malaysia is one of 17 megadiverse countries on earth, with large numbers of endemic species. - A sea is a large body of salt water that is surrounded in whole or in part by land. More broadly, \\"the sea\\" is the interconnected system of Earth's salty, oceanic watersconsidered as one global ocean or as several principal oceanic divisions. The sea moderates Earth's climate and has important roles in the water cycle, carbon cycle, and nitrogen cycle. Although the sea has been traveled and explored since prehistory, the modern scientific study of the seaoceanographydates broadly to the British \\"Challenger\\" expedition of the 1870s. The sea is conventionally divided into up to five large oceanic sectionsincluding the International Hydrographic Organization's four named oceans (the Atlantic, Pacific, Indian, and Arctic) and the Southern Ocean; smaller, second-order sections, such as the Mediterranean, are known as \\"seas\\". - Plants are mainly multicellular, predominantly photosynthetic eukaryotes of the kingdom Plantae.

Context: I have been preparing our house for the market and in doing so, I have gotten rid of a lot of stuff! I am definitely the hoarder in our house. My husband could live out of two bags, use about five kitchen items each year, and doesn’t gather anything for future use or hang on to much for sentimental value. (Which probably means the items he has hung on to mean a whole lot more!) I am always tucking something away here or stashing materials there…all in preparation for “some day.” It’s also part of the teacher in me. Do you know many teachers that don’t have a ton of stuff or utilize every bit of storage available? But, over the last several years, I’ve been fairly good about going through things every six months and weeding out a little here and a little there. Today I’ll be sharing six simple ways to declutter your home and why you should! GIVE THINGS AWAY It’s nice to make money, but sometimes you come across something that you really think someone else could use and you don’t want to throw it away. If it’s the perfect fit for that person, they may adopt the item and add their own wear and tear! Anyone that’s had children knows that kids go through things so fast and it’s nice to save a little money by taking hand-me-downs from a friend or relative. If the receiver decides they don’t want the item, let it be. They’ll either get rid of it on their own or decline the offer. If they choose the latter, maybe the rest of this list will help. PACK If you know you don’t want to purge an item from your house AND you know that you will use it in the future, but it’s not an everyday use item, pack it up. We have several containers of things in our garage that are full of items we use once or twice each year. I have added close to 100 boxes of things to simply declutter our home while it’s on the market. I took a look at everything and kept the essentials (well, maybe even more than the essentials), and packed up the rest.

Here is a goal: How do you prep sushi rice prior to boiling it. How would you accomplish this goal? OPT: a). Rinse under cold water till it runs clear.; b). Toast on a lightly oiled pan til browned.;","completion":"To accomplish the goal of prepping sushi rice prior to boiling it, the optimum option is: a). Rinse under cold water till it runs clear. Here is a detailed step-by-step guide on how to properly prepare sushi rice prior to boiling it: 1. Measure the sushi rice: Begin by measuring the desired amount of sushi rice you want to prepare. It is advised to use a measuring cup for accuracy. 2. Place the sushi rice in a bowl or fine-mesh strainer: To rinse the rice properly, place it in a large bowl or, if available, a fine-mesh strainer. This will allow you to wash away any dust and excess starch present in the rice. 3. Rinse the sushi rice under cold water: Hold the bowl or strainer under cold running water. Gently swish the rice around with your hands, allowing the water to work its way through the grains. Remember to be gentle during this process as sushi rice is delicate and can easily break apart. 4. Drain the water and continue rinsing: If using a fine-mesh strainer, allow the water to drain away, then continue to rinse under cold water. If using a bowl, carefully pour the water out and refill the bowl with more cold water. Repeat the rinsing process until the water runs clear. This may involve rinsing 5-7 times depending on the rice quality. 5. Allow the rice to drain and rest: Once the water runs clear, let the sushi rice drain in a fine-mesh strainer for 15-20 minutes. This will help remove any excess water as well as allow the rice to rest and \\"air out\\" before cooking. 6. Cook the sushi rice: To boil the sushi rice, you can use either a rice cooker or a pot on the stove. Follow the cooking instructions and add the appropriate water to rice ratio, which is generally 1 cup of rice to 1.2 cups of water for sushi rice. Be sure to refer to the specific recommendations on the sushi rice packaging as the water ratio may vary. 7. Let the cooked rice stand: After the boiling process, allow the sushi rice to stand and steam in the pot for an additional 10-15 minutes with the lid on. This will help ensure that the texture of the rice remains consistent and the grains are fully cooked. 8. Mix the sushi rice with sushi vinegar: While still warm, transfer the cooked sushi rice to a large flat dish or a wooden sushi oke (rice mixing tub). Gently break apart any large clumps using a wooden rice paddle or spatula. Gradually add sushi vinegar (a mixture of rice vinegar, sugar, and salt) and gently mix it with the rice using horizontal cutting motions. Be careful not to squish the rice grains during this process. 9. Cool the sushi rice: Once the sushi vinegar has been evenly mixed with the rice, use a rice paddle or spatula to lift and turn the rice gently to help it cool more evenly. A fan can be used to assist in cooling and adding a subtle shine to the rice. Be mindful not to let the rice become too cold, as it is essential for sushi-making to use rice that is close to room temperature. Now, your sushi rice is prepped and ready to be used in your sushi dishes. Remember to keep the rice covered with a damp cloth when not in use to prevent it from drying out."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

A man named Richard, who was a dad, was hurt really badly by a bad guy. This made his family very, very sad. Richard's daughter, named Joselyn, was just a little girl when it happened. Many years passed, and Joselyn grew up to be a strong and brave woman. She lived in a big city called New York. As she became older, she never forgot about the bad guy who hurt her dad. She wanted to make sure that justice, which is like making things right and fair again, would happen someday. So, Joselyn started doing something called research. This means she looked for lots of information to find clues about the bad guy. She talked to many people like police officers, who help keep everyone safe. She also talked to her family, friends, and people who knew her dad. One day, Joselyn found some very important clues. She shared her clues with the police officers, who then decided to look more closely at the bad guy again. Sometimes, it is hard for police officers to find all the clues by themselves, so Joselyn's help was really important. With the information Joselyn found, the police officers could finally say, \\"Aha! We know who the bad guy is!\\" This meant that all the hard work Joselyn did paid off. She could help make sure that justice would happen for her dad and her family. Everyone was very thankful for Joselyn's help. She showed that even though she was once just a sad, little girl, she could grow up and do something really big and important. Now, other people can learn from her story and know that it is never too late to make things right and fair again.

Conscription dates back to antiquity and continues in some countries to the present day under various names. The modern system of near-universal national conscription for young men dates to the French Revolution in the 1790s, where it became the basis of a very large and powerful military. Most European nations later copied the system in peacetime, so that men at a certain age would serve 18 years on active duty and then transfer to the reserve force. - A conscientious objector is an \\"individual who has claimed the right to refuse to perform military service\\" on the grounds of freedom of thought, conscience, or religion. In general, conscientious objector status is considered only in the context of military conscription and is not applicable to volunteer military forces. - The Big Read was a survey on books carried out by the BBC in the United Kingdom in 2003, where over three quarters of a million votes were received from the British public to find the nation's best-loved novel of all time.

Tanya had a more painful experience with a piercing than Felicia because","completion":"Tanya had a more painful experience with a piercing than Felicia because several factors contributed to the increased discomfort that she faced during and after the procedure. Firstly, Tanya went to an inexperienced piercer who did not possess the necessary skills or knowledge to ensure a smooth process. This, in turn, led to him using an incorrect angle and not paying attention to the appropriate location on Tanya's ear, which subsequently resulted in increased pain and prolonged healing time. Secondly, improper sterilization of the equipment and unsanitary conditions at the piercing studio raised the risk of infection for Tanya. As a result, her piercing site became inflamed, causing additional pain and discomfort. Tanya's sensitivity to metal also played a significant role in her painful experience, as her body reacted adversely to the metal alloy used in the jewelry. This metal allergy caused her skin to become red, itchy, and irritated, resulting in further pain and swelling that took quite a while to subside. In contrast, Felicia had a drastically different experience with her piercing. She went to a reputable, professional studio and consulted with an experienced, competent piercer. The piercer ensured that the equipment was thoroughly sterilized and maintained a clean, safe environment throughout the procedure. Furthermore, Felicia was aware of her sensitivity to certain metals and made sure to choose hypoallergenic jewelry to minimize the risk of an allergic reaction. The piercer also paid close attention to her anatomy, using the correct angle and locating the ideal placement for the piercing. This precision not only minimized the physical discomfort but also expedited the healing process for Felicia, allowing her to enjoy her new piercing with minimal pain and swelling. Additionally, Felicia diligently followed her piercer's aftercare instructions, which helped prevent any potential complications such as infections. In contrast, Tanya may have neglected the essential aftercare regime, making her experience more painful than necessary. Overall, the difference between Tanya's and Felicia's experiences can be attributed to a combination of factors such as the piercer's skill, the cleanliness of the studio, the type of jewelry used, and proper aftercare. Due to these contributing aspects, Tanya faced a significantly more painful experience with her piercing compared to Felicia."},{"prompt":"Read the following article and select the best answer.

Article: The secret of carrier pigeons' unbelievable ability to find their way home has been discovered by scientists: _ follow the roads just like we do. Scientists now believe the phrase \\"as the crow flies\\" no longer means the shortest most direct route between two points. They say it is likely that crows and other day birds also choose AA-suggested routes, even though it makes their journeys longer. Scientists at Oxford University spent 10 years studying homing pigeons using global positioning satellite (GPS) and got a surprising result. The birds often don't use the sun to decide their directions. Instead they fly along motorways, turn at crossing and even go around roundabouts , adding miles to their journeys. \\"It really has knocked our research team sideways to find that after a decade-long international study, pigeons appear to ignore their inbuilt directional instincts and follow the road system,\\" said Prof Tim Guilford, reader in animal behavior at Oxford University's Department of Zoology. Guilford said pigeons use their own navigational system when doing long distance trips or when a bird does a journey for the first time. \\"But once homing pigeons have flown a journey more than once, they can fly home on a habitual route, much as we do when we are driving or walking home from work,\\" said Guilford. \\"In short, it looks like it is mentally easier for a bird to fly down a road. They are just making their journey as simple as possible.\\" Question: Why do homing pigeons tend to follow the road system daring the r journey? Answer: Choose your answer from: (A). Because they don't have their inbuilt directional instincts now. (B). Because their own navigational system doesn't work. (C). Because it is too hard to use their own navigational system. (D).

The study conducted by scientists at Oxford University discovered that homing pigeons often follow the road system rather than using their inbuilt directional instincts or the sun to decide their directions. This occurs particularly when they have flown a journey more than once. Following the road system makes their journey mentally simpler, even if it adds miles to their trip. It was found that, much like humans driving or walking home from work, pigeons prefer to fly home on a habitual route as it is easier for them to navigate, and therefore they choose to follow roads for simpler navigation."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Given the background: In the U.S., the majority of electricity is produced by burning coal or other fossil fuels. This causes air pollution, acid rain, and global warming. Fossil fuels are also limited and may eventually run out. Like fossil fuels, radioactive elements are limited. In fact, they are relatively rare, so they could run out sooner rather than later. On the other hand, nuclear fission does not release air pollution or cause the other environmental problems associated with burning fossil fuels. This is the major advantage of using nuclear fission as a source of energy. and the situation: Seattle produces a large amount of their electricity by burning fossil fuels due to the large presence of natural coal in the state. Jacksonville, on the other hand, has decreased their usage of fossil fuels used to produce electricity to low levels due to recent policy changes enacted by their state's government. Answer the following question: Which city, Seattle or Jacksonville, will contribute more to global warming?

Please answer the following question: What is the final step of the following process: - Salt water is contained in a factory or plant - The water is boiled to a very high tempature - The salt becomes seperated from the water - The salt is removed Answer:","completion":"The final step of the process after the salt is removed from the water is the collection and storage of the resulting fresh water and utilization of the extracted salt. To provide a complete understanding of the process, let me break it down step by step: 1. Salt water containment: The salt water, typically sourced from seawater or brackish water, is brought into the factory or desalination plant and stored in large tanks or containment units. This water is filtered to remove any large debris and impurities before moving on to the next step. 2. Boiling the water: The salt water is heated to a very high temperature, often using a multi-stage flash distillation process. This process involves gradually heating the salt water in a series of chambers with decreasing pressure, causing the water to evaporate repeatedly, leaving behind the salt. 3. Separation of salt and water: As the water evaporates, it leaves behind the salt, and the vaporized water rises to the top of the chamber. The vapor is subsequently collected in condensers where it cools and condenses back into liquid water, now free from salt (fresh water). 4. Salt removal: The remaining salt is removed from the chamber and collected. It can be produced in various forms (e.g., as table salt or for industrial applications) depending on the intended use. The salt can be washed, dried, and further processed to obtain the desired purity and quality. Final step: Collection and storage of fresh water and extracted salt 5. Freshwater collection and storage: The desalinated water collected in the condensers is treated in a post-treatment system to ensure it meets drinking water standards. For example, it may be disinfected to eliminate any remaining microorganisms or adjusted for pH and hardness. After treatment, the fresh water is stored in tanks or reservoirs and distributed to consumers or utilized for other purposes such as agriculture, industrial processes, or environmental uses like wetland restoration. 6. Utilization of the extracted salt: The recovered salt can be used in various ways depending on its quality and type. Some common uses include table salt, water softening, de-icing, animal feed supplements, and in industrial processes like the production of detergents, chemicals, or textiles. The salt may be further processed, packaged, and distributed according to its intended application. In summary, the final step of the process involves the collection and storage of the fresh water and the utilization of the extracted salt for various applications. This process effectively converts salt water into fresh, usable water while also providing a valuable by-product in the form of salt."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

They relied mostly on conventional agriculture and used fertilizer for their crops. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which city contributed less to the creation of dead zones? A:","completion":"Bird City B: Pine City Answer: B: Pine City Based on the information provided, it can be concluded that Pine City contributed less to the creation of dead zones than Bird City. The key factors leading to this conclusion include the geographical location of each city and their respective economic ties and practices. Pine City, located in the mountains, is primarily inhabited by nature lovers and people who are committed to protecting the environment. These individuals likely engage in eco-friendly practices and aim to minimize their negative impact on natural ecosystems. Specifically, the citizens of Pine City may use sustainable agricultural practices, such as organic farming, to grow their crops. This involves avoiding the use of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides, which can contribute to the development of dead zones in bodies of water. In contrast, Bird City is situated along the banks of a large river that flows into the sea. This city relies heavily on conventional agriculture and, as stated, uses fertilizer for their crops. Fertilizers, particularly those containing high levels of nitrogen and phosphorus, can lead to significant issues like nutrient pollution and eutrophication. When excessive levels of nutrients from the fertilizers run off into the river and eventually make their way to the sea, they can cause accelerated growth of algae, leading to algal blooms. When these algae die and decompose, the process consumes oxygen from the surrounding water, resulting in hypoxic or oxygen-depleted zones, commonly called dead zones. Consequently, the agricultural practices and environmental consciousness of Pine City's inhabitants would likely lead to a much smaller contribution to the creation of dead zones as compared to Bird City's reliance on conventional agriculture and fertilizers."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the below context: Doménikos Theotokópoulos (Greek: Δομήνικος Θεοτοκόπουλος [ðoˈminikos θeotoˈkopulos]; October 1541 – 7 April 1614), most widely known as El Greco (\\"The Greek\\"), was a Greek painter, sculptor and architect of the Spanish Renaissance. \\"El Greco\\" was a nickname, a reference to his Greek origin, and the artist normally signed his paintings with his full birth name in Greek letters, Δομήνικος Θεοτοκόπουλος, Doménikos Theotokópoulos, often adding the word Κρής Krēs, Cretan. El Greco was born in the Kingdom of Candia, which was at that time part of the Republic of Venice, and the center of Post-Byzantine art. He trained and became a master within that tradition before traveling at age 26 to Venice, as other Greek artists had done. In 1570 he moved to Rome, where he opened a workshop and executed a series of works. During his stay in Italy, El Greco enriched his style with elements of Mannerism and of the Venetian Renaissance taken from a number of great artists of the time, notably Tintoretto. In 1577, he moved to Toledo, Spain, where he lived and worked until his death. In Toledo, El Greco received several major commissions and produced his best-known paintings. El Greco's dramatic and expressionistic style was met with puzzlement by his contemporaries but found appreciation in the 20th century. El Greco is regarded as a precursor of both Expressionism and Cubism, while his personality and works were a source of inspiration for poets and writers such as Rainer Maria Rilke and Nikos Kazantzakis. El Greco has been characterized by modern scholars as an artist so individual that he belongs to no conventional school. He is best known for tortuously elongated figures and often fantastic or phantasmagorical pigmentation, marrying Byzantine traditions with those of Western painting. Guess a valid title for it!

Question: What is Charlie Muffin's profession? Title: Charlie Muffin Movie plot: The Cold War espionage thriller follows the moves of British anti-hero spy Charlie Muffin (Hemmings) who has fallen on hard times since the forced retirement of Sir Archibald Willoughby, his previous boss at the U.K. secret service (played by Sir Ralph Richardson). His new boss, Sir Henry Cuthbertson (Ian Richardson), who epitomizes the haughty upper class British imperialist, hardly attempts to conceal his disdain for the under-educated agent who quite obviously doesn't stem from the \\"right class\\". Right at the start of the film, we witness how Charlie has evidently been deemed expendable and accordingly gets set up to be caught or killed during a joint mission in East Germany â this despite Muffin essentially having been responsible for the mission's success. Cuthbertson's lap-dog agents Snare and Harrison â who are both totally lacking in experience and as arrogant as their boss â are shocked and embarrassed to see Muffin returning alive and well. Once home in the UK, Muffin's humiliation doesn't end, as he gets demoted and put on leave, which he spends with his wife Edith (Linden), but not until after a hilarious take on the obligatory spy agentâsecretary-receptionist affair. Next, a classic yet utterly unpredictable spy story unfolds around British and U.S. attempts to facilitate a safe defection of high-ranking Soviet General Valery Kalenin (Braun). CIA Director Garson Ruttgers (Wanamaker) proves not much smarter and ultimately equally officious and presumptuous as his British counterpart, though in a distinctly â satirically â American way. After Harrison and Snare's spectacular downfalls at the task (one ends up dead trying to escape and the other captured), Ruttgers' aide Braley (Rimmer), a chubby, good-hearted but docile sideshow official, is assigned to join Muffin on a trip to Prague, to liaise with Kalenin. Will Kalenin's defection succeed? Will Charlie once again be set up? Will he be able to escape alive and well this time? It is not until the very last minutes of the film that we find out.

Possible answers: hang out with Austin, get some pizza for later, get some chickens A:","completion":"Casey's decision to take Austin's chances to win the big pot at bingo on Saturday can be attributed to multiple reasons, combining both personal and external factors. By examining the possible answers provided - hang out with Austin, get some pizza for later, and get some chickens - we can delve deeper into Casey's motivations and objectives in this scenario. First and foremost, Casey's desire to hang out with Austin may have played a crucial role in their decision to take Austin's chances at the bingo game. This indicates that Casey values their relationship with Austin and is willing to invest time and effort in maintaining and fostering this bond. Participating in a shared activity like bingo can strengthen friendship as it creates a shared experience and memories, which are vital for nurturing a meaningful connection. Also, it's essential to consider that Austin's companionship might be a source of emotional support or encouragement for Casey, thereby creating a sense of belonging and trust. In this regard, supporting Austin's chances and potentially sharing the winning pot with them could be seen as an act of generosity and loyalty. Another possible reason behind Casey's actions could be the anticipation of enjoying some pizza later on. This motivation is centered around the reward mechanism, whereby Casey might associate bingo with a fun and enjoyable experience complemented by the consumption of a delicious meal. In this context, participating in the bingo game becomes more than just about winning the big pot; it is about fulfilling a craving or indulging in a pleasurable activity. The prospect of savoring delicious pizza after the game can also serve as a motivational factor for both Casey and Austin to engage actively in the competition, thereby enhancing their experience and partnership. Lastly, obtaining the prize of some chickens can also be a rationale behind Casey's decision to seize Austin's opportunity at bingo. This incentive might indicate that Casey, or perhaps both Casey and Austin, have a practical reason for seeking the big pot prize. Chickens can provide a steady supply of eggs, which can be a valuable resource for various purposes, such as cooking or selling at farmer's markets. Additionally, chickens can contribute to a more sustainable and self-reliant lifestyle, which can be an attractive prospect for either individual or their joint goals. Winning the big pot could ultimately offer significant benefits that go beyond immediate gratification and might establish a foundation for attaining long-term aspirations. In summary, Casey's choice to take Austin's chances and win the big pot at bingo on Saturday may have been driven by a combination of factors such as strengthening their friendship, the anticipation of enjoying pizza as a reward for their efforts, and the practical advantages of acquiring chickens as a prize.

Answer the following question: What is the missing first step of the following process: - A group of people work to design a satellite capable of accomplishing the need - A team designs the physical structure of the satellite - A crew builds the physical satellite - The satellite is packed into a capsule - The satellite capsule is loaded onto a rocket - The rocket is launched into space. Answer:","completion":"The missing first step of the process is: Identifying the need or objective for the satellite. Before a group of people can start working on designing a satellite, they must first determine its purpose or the need it will fulfill. This is a critical step as it lays the foundation for all the subsequent stages in the process of creating and launching a satellite. The need or objective could come from various sectors such as communication, Earth observation, navigation, scientific research, or defense. In this step, stakeholders from various industries, government organizations, and research institutions come together to identify the goals, requirements, and potential benefits of the satellite mission. This can involve analyzing current and future demands, assessing existing satellite capabilities, and exploring new technological possibilities. Some of the factors that may be considered in this step include: 1. Mission objectives: What is the primary purpose of the satellite? What specific goals does it need to achieve? For example, a satellite could be designed to improve global communication networks, help with weather monitoring and prediction, conduct scientific research, or provide surveillance and intelligence in the interest of national security. 2. Technological capabilities and limitations: What existing technologies can be utilized in the satellite's design? What new technologies need to be developed or refined to meet the mission's objectives? For example, a satellite designed for high-resolution Earth imaging may require advanced camera and sensor technology as well as sophisticated data processing systems. 3. Orbital altitude and duration: Where will the satellite be positioned in orbit around the Earth, and what will be the duration of its mission? These factors can influence the satellite's design and capabilities. For example, a satellite placed in low Earth orbit (LEO) may need to be designed for a shorter mission life and require more frequent replacements, while a geostationary satellite placed higher in orbit may require more robust systems to withstand the harsher space environment. 4. Budget constraints: What financial resources are available for the development, construction, and launch of the satellite? Budget considerations can have a significant impact on the design choices and capabilities of the satellite. 5. Legal and regulatory requirements: What international or national laws and regulations must the satellite mission adhere to? Ensuring the satellite's compliance with these rules is essential to prevent legal or diplomatic issues, and can also influence the choice of launch provider and the satellite's development timeline. Once the need or objective for the satellite has been identified and refined, the stakeholders can proceed to the next step in the process - assembling a group of people to work on designing the satellite capable of accomplishing that need. This team will usually include engineers, scientists, researchers, and other technical experts who will collaborate to develop a comprehensive satellite concept, ensuring that it meets the requirements of the mission."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Detailed Instructions: Given a context passage, generate a question from the passage such that its answer is shortest continous span from the passage. Q: Elizabeth Bishop, who was famous for the poetry A Prodigal, Filling Station , Sandpiper, Manuelzinho and so on, was an influential American poet of the 20th century. Her poetry often shows things that concerned her throughout her life, such as her search for a sense of home. Her troubled childhood and feelings of loneliness from this time affected her character and poetry. Bishop's painful childhood is apparent in some of her poems. Her father died when she was eight months old and her mother was mad when she was five. Bishop was raised firstly by her mother's parents and then by her father's parents. This experience left her confused about belonging. She had no home and this was shown in her poetry. In \\"A Prodigal\\", when the character in the poem makes up his mind to go home, there is a sense of pessimism for Bishop who has no home. The lack of a sense of home has contributed to her depression all her life. Bishop attempts to make small, everyday experiences extraordinary in her poems such as \\"Filling Station\\" .In \\"Filling Station \\", Bishop describes the beautyof a family filling station. Although it is \\"dirty\\" there is order in it. Simple family life is celebrated in it. She recognizes the value of home and beauty in everyday life, but she is only an observer of these. Distance remains between her and the family at the filling station. Bishop's struggle to locate herself in the world is seen no more clearly than in \\"sandpiper\\". It deals with searching for something in a confusing world. She uses the metaphor of the bird which is \\"looking for something\\". The \\"something\\" isn't specific . It seems as if the bird doesn't know what he wants; the only certain thing is that he is searching. Bishop's poems are personal on a more subtle level, especially when her childhood, travels, etc, are taken into consideration. It is believed that Bishop is a complex poet who uses her poetry to find this feeling of belonging. A:","completion":"Step 1: Read the passage thoroughly to understand the main ideas and concepts.

Question: Given the below context: ABKCO Industries was formed in 1968 by Allen Klein as an umbrella company to ABKCO Records. Klein hired May Pang as a receptionist in 1969. Through involvement in a project with ABKCO, Lennon and Ono met her the following year. She became their personal assistant. In 1973, after she had been working with the couple for three years, Ono confided that she and Lennon were becoming estranged. She went on to suggest that Pang should begin a physical relationship with Lennon, telling her, \\"He likes you a lot.\\" Astounded by Ono's proposition, Pang nevertheless agreed to become Lennon's companion. The pair soon left for Los Angeles, beginning an 18-month period he later called his \\"lost weekend\\". In Los Angeles, Pang encouraged Lennon to develop regular contact with Julian, whom he had not seen for two years. He also rekindled friendships with Starr, McCartney, Beatles roadie Mal Evans, and Harry Nilsson. While Lennon was drinking with Nilsson, he misunderstood something that Pang had said and attempted to strangle her. Lennon relented only after he was physically restrained by Nilsson.In June, Lennon and Pang returned to Manhattan in their newly rented penthouse apartment where they prepared a spare room for Julian when he visited them. Lennon, who had been inhibited by Ono in this regard, began to reestablish contact with other relatives and friends. By December, he and Pang were considering a house purchase, and he refused to accept Ono's telephone calls. In January 1975, he agreed to meet Ono, who claimed to have found a cure for smoking. After the meeting, he failed to return home or call Pang. When Pang telephoned the next day, Ono told her that Lennon was unavailable because he was exhausted after a hypnotherapy session. Two days later, Lennon reappeared at a joint dental appointment; he was stupefied and confused to such an extent that Pang believed he had been brainwashed. Lennon told Pang that his separation from Ono was now over, although Ono would allow him to continue seeing her as his mistress. Guess a valid title for it!

Here is a news article: DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) — Syrian state media say the army has liberated the eastern city of Deir el-Zour from the Islamic State group. Friday's report says the military is now in full control of the long contested city. Syrian government forces and their pro-government allies first broke the militant group's siege of their part of the city in September and have been advancing against IS positions since then. Deir el-Zour had been divided into a government-held and an IS-held part for nearly three years. The development is the latest significant defeat for IS as the militant group sees its self-proclaimed \\"caliphate\\" crumble and lose almost all urban strongholds. The Syrian army and Kurdish-led forces backed by the U.S. are now racing to take the rest of the oil-rich eastern province. ||||| Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption 'We would rather be killed by IS than be here' - the humanitarian crisis unfolding in Syria So-called Islamic State (IS) has lost control of two of its last remaining strongholds in Syria and Iraq. Early on Friday Syria's army announced it had taken Deir al-Zour. Later in the day the Iraqi prime minister said al-Qaim, across the border, had been recaptured by government forces. The town was taken \\"in record time\\", PM Haider al-Abadi said. Iraqi forces say they have also seized the last border post between Iraq and Syria that was held by IS. Last month, a US-backed Syrian alliance took control of Raqqa in Syria, the former capital of Islamic State's self-styled \\"caliphate\\". In July, Mosul - Iraq's second-largest city - was taken from IS after months of fighting. The territorial ambitions of IS are now all but destroyed although its ideology remains powerful, says the BBC's Arab Affairs Editor Sebastian Usher. Why are these losses important? IS had held most of Deir al-Zour since 2014. It was important because of its proximity to the border with Iraq. While the Syrian army said it had been re-captured, other reports said government forces and their allies were clearing the last pockets of resistance from IS in the city. Al-Qaim was the last sizeable territory held by IS in Iraq. The operation to retake the city and the surrounding area was launched last week. Soldiers, police, Sunni tribesmen and mostly Shia paramilitary fighters, some backed by Iran, took part in the assault. IS had designated the area on both sides of the border as its \\"Euphrates Province\\" and used it to transfer fighters, weapons and goods between Iraq and Syria. The cross-border province was also a symbol of the jihadists' intention to eradicate all the region's frontiers and lay to rest the 1916 Sykes-Picot agreement, an emblem of the colonial division of the area resented by many Arabs. Image copyright AFP Image caption Security forces took al-Qaim swiftly from IS, the Iraqi government says Some 350,000 civilians in Syria's Deir al-Zour province have been forced to flee their homes during weeks of fighting. What territory does IS still control? In Syria, the militant group is now confined to a few pockets in Deir al-Zour province. The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) and Syrian government forces have been carrying out separate offensives there with the aim of taking control of Albu Kamal, a key crossing with Iraq. Interactive Slide the button to see how the area IS controls has changed since 2015 2017 2015 In some areas the US-backed SDF and Russia-backed Syrian army have taken up positions just a few kilometres apart. An SDF spokesman told the BBC they were still encountering some resistance with the militants using suicide cars and trucks, thermal missiles and mortars. In some towns and villages there was house-to-house fighting, Kino Gabriel said. IS has also suffered a series of defeats in recent months to Iraqi government forces, who are advancing along the Euphrates river on the other side of the border. There are about 1,500 IS fighters left in the area, the US-led coalition fighting IS says. Is this the end for IS? IS has now been driven out of about 95% of the land the group once held in Iraq and more than 4.4 million Iraqis have been freed from its rule, according to the US-led coalition.

But Commodore Johnny Stringer told journalists in London that IS would \\"almost certainly morph into an insurgent organisation\\" trying to launch attacks in the two countries. What now in Syria? Jonathan Marcus, BBC diplomatic correspondent The success of the Syrian government forces inevitably raises the potential for clashes between them and US-backed, predominantly Kurdish units who hold a swathe of northern Syria. It is a powerful reminder that while the war against the IS \\"caliphate\\" is well on the way to being won, the situation on the ground in Syria is becoming ever more complex.

If you have good credit, adding a child as an authorized user onto one of your credit cards also provides teachable moments. Allow kids to use the card to make specific purchases and require their participation in payment.

The company, retaining the title \\"Sadler's Wells Opera\\", opened at the Coliseum on 21 August 1968, with a new production of Mozart's Don Giovanni, directed by Sir John Gielgud. Though this production was not well received, the company rapidly established itself with a succession of highly praised productions of other works. Arlen died in January 1972, and was succeeded as managing director by Lord Harewood.The success of the 1968 Mastersingers was followed in the 1970s by the company's first Ring cycle, conducted by Goodall, with a new translation by Andrew Porter and designs by Ralph Koltai. The cast included Norman Bailey, Rita Hunter and Alberto Remedios. In Harewood's view, among the highlights of the first ten years at the Coliseum were the Ring, Prokofiev's War and Peace, and Richard Strauss's Salome and Der Rosenkavalier. The company's musical director from 1970 to 1977 was Charles Mackerras. Harewood praised his exceptional versatility, with a range \\"from The House of the Dead to Patience.\\" Among the operas he conducted for the company were Handel's Julius Caesar starring Janet Baker and Valerie Masterson; five Janáček operas; The Marriage of Figaro with pioneering use of 18th century performing style; Massenet's Werther; Donizetti's Mary Stuart with Baker; and Sullivan's Patience.

Please answer the following question: Given the background: Research has shown an inverse link between income inequality and social cohesion. In more equal societies, people are much more likely to trust each other, measures of social capital (the benefits of goodwill, fellowship, mutual sympathy and social connectedness among groups who make up a social units) suggest greater community involvement, and homicide rates are consistently lower. and the situation: Ron, a sociologist, traveled to two very different societies, society A and society B, for several months each and wrote down his observations. Ron is now examining the data he gathered from the two societies in an attempt to draw scientific conclusions, and write up a paper. In society A, he found that there were high levels of income inequality, while society B had low levels of income inequality. Answer the following question: In which society will there be greater community involvement? A:","completion":"Based on the background research provided, it is likely that there will be greater community involvement in Society B, where there are low levels of income inequality. This assertion is reinforced by the fact that income inequality has an inverse relationship with social cohesion. In more equal societies like Society B, individuals tend to trust each other more, and this increased trust fosters a sense of solidarity and connectedness amongst different social groups. The higher social capital present in Society B facilitates community involvement and cooperation, as people are more willing to work together and engage in collective activities. Moreover, it is important to consider that lower income inequality can lead to better access to resources for a majority of the population, resulting in a stronger foundation to build and maintain social connections. Conversely, in Society A, where there is a high level of income inequality, the divide between individuals of varying income groups is much more apparent. This disparity can create an atmosphere of mistrust – especially between those in higher income brackets and those in lower income brackets. Such negative impacts on social cohesion can lead to a decline in community involvement due to fewer opportunities for residents to come together on equal terms and participate in shared activities. In addition, high income inequality often results in social exclusion and marginalization of the less affluent population. This further reduces the chances of meaningful interactions between individuals from different income groups, thereby hindering community involvement and social capital building. It is essential to note that while Ron's observations and the provided research suggest stronger community involvement in Society B, it is important to investigate other factors that might influence social cohesion and community involvement in each society too. Cultural norms, traditions, and governance structures, among others, could also play a role in shaping the level of community involvement in both societies. Nevertheless, in summary, based on the observed relationship between income inequality and social cohesion, Society B, where there are lower levels of income inequality, will likely exhibit greater community involvement. This is mainly due to the likelihood of higher trust levels, increased social capital, and lower barriers for interaction and cooperation among various social groups."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A family of beavers is to continue living free on a Devon river, officials have ruled. Ministers wanted the remarkable animals, believed to be the first wild beavers to breed in England for 800 years, to be rounded up and put in a zoo after they were spotted last year. But Natural England, the government agency in charge of wildlife, has decided they will instead be allowed to stay in the wild and be carefully monitored in the first project of its kind. Beavers won't be budging: A family of beavers is to continue living free on a Devon river after Natural England, the government agency in charge of wildlife, has decided they won't be put in a zoo, but will instead be allowed to stay in the wild and be carefully monitored in the first project of its kind. Devon Wildlife Trust, which will run the pilot project for the next five years, welcomed the decision as a ‘great day for conservation in England’. There are at least ten beavers thriving along a 12mile (19km) stretch of the River Otter near Exeter. They have been quietly living and breeding there for at least five years, completely unnoticed until just over a year ago. It is an extraordinary environmental success story, for which green groups and conservationists can take no credit. Nobody knows where they came from – but they are certainly thriving without any outside interference. So environmentalists were furious when Defra, the Government’s environment department, decided last year that they would round up the beavers. There are at least ten beavers thriving along a 12 mile (19km) stretch of the River Otter near Exeter (shown on a map). They have been quietly living and breeding there for at least five years, completely unnoticed until just over a year ago. Peter Burgess of the Devon Wildlife Trust said the beavers could have a hugely beneficial impact on rivers, reducing numbers of trees on the banks, improving light levels, and reducing flood risk by controlling water flow with their dams. Some people think they may slow down flood waters, as well as boosting wildlife diversity. Farmers and anglers have that they can damage the landscape and fish migration routes. Officials said that they posed a risk to other wildlife, and might spread parasites and disease. They ordered the beavers to be caged and either rehomed or culled, prompting a fierce campaign to allow the animals to remain free, backed by more than 12,000 people. The threat of a zoo or worse has now been averted. The beavers will be carefully tested for disease this spring and, as long as they are free of disease, will be allowed to stay on the River Otter. Tom Buckley, a retired environmental scientist who spotted the first beaver on the banks of the River Otter a year ago, said: ‘I am very grateful to all those people who have given their support to saving our beavers. ‘Currently there are few signs of the beaver on the river Otter, no dams or lodges, but beaver can do such a lot more to help improve the environment and now they have been given the chance, I'm looking forward very much to helping them show people just what they can do.’ But he said the Animal and Plant Health Agency must be very careful when they trap the beavers to test them for diseases in the coming weeks. He said: ‘There is still grave concerns regarding trapping the beavers, including the significant risk of drowning them and ensuring the safety of the kits who still rely on their parents for their survival. ‘None of the Animal and Plant Health Agency people licenced to trap the beavers have direct beaver skills or experience.’ Beavers, which are native to England, were plentiful in our countryside until they were wiped out by hunters in the Middle Ages. They vanished from our rivers and wetlands for centuries until, mysteriously, one was spotted near Ottery St Mary in eastern Devon last winter. A few months later a second beaver was seen and then grainy pictures emerged in the spring of a juvenile. The Daily Mail revealed in November that there are three generations living on the River Otter, with at least ten individuals. They vanished from our rivers and wetlands for centuries until, mysteriously, one was spotted near Ottery St Mary in eastern Devon last winter. A few months later a second beaver was seen and then grainy pictures emerged in the spring of a juvenile. A screen grab of video footage of the beavers is shown. ‘Natural England has very carefully considered the Devon Wildlife Trust application against international standards, and has decided that a licence will be issued permitting the managed release into the wild of beavers currently resident in the River Otter, on a five year trial basis,' a Defra spokesman said. 'This decision is subject to the beavers being tested and found to be free of Echinococcus multilocularis parasite. ‘Our priority is to ensure humane treatment for the beavers while safeguarding human health, that’s why we will be working with the Devon Wildlife Trust to capture and test the animals before the trial begins.’ This proves that they have been quietly prospering and – crucially – breeding. Experts think they must have been there for at least five years, unnoticed. As well as being a rare victory for native English wildlife, conservationists say beavers directly benefit the environment. Peter Burgess of the Devon Wildlife Trust said the beavers could have a hugely beneficial impact on rivers, reducing numbers of trees on the banks, improving light levels, and reducing flood risk by controlling water flow with their dams. He said: ‘We are really pleased that we have obtained this step forward. ‘It is a really important day for conservation in England, a really great day for conservation in England. We are looking forward to making this trial a success.’ Andrew Sells, Natural England chairman, whose board agreed to give Devon Wildlife Trust the licence for the project, said: ‘Reintroduction of a species is a complicated and emotive subject and we have considered this application very carefully. ‘We are now satisfied with Devon Wildlife Trust’s plans for managing and monitoring the project, which will allow important evidence to be gathered during the trial on any impacts which the beavers may have.’ Peter Burgess of the Devon Wildlife Trust said the beavers could have a hugely beneficial impact on rivers, reducing numbers of trees on the banks, improving light levels, and reducing flood risk by controlling water flow with their dams. An adult beaver with her young is shown. Beavers normally live in family groups and can survive up to 24 years in the wild and 35 years in captivity. They are herbivorous rodents that build corridors in their dams to escape predators such as wolves and bears in the wild. The animals are nocturnal and can grow to more than 3ft, weigh up to 70lbs, and feed on a diet of reeds, leaves and bark. Beavers were hunted almost to extinction in Europe, both for fur and for castoreum - a secretion of its scent gland for medicinal properties. The beavers’ presence in Devon remains a mystery. There are several captive breeding programmes in the UK, including thirty miles away in western Devon, on the other side of Dartmoor. But none of the animals is unaccounted for. Other explanations touted by locals include their escape from a private collection, or a deliberate release by wildlife fanatics. There is a slim chance they travelled from Scotland, where they have been successfully reintroduced on several rivers, or even from Europe, where there are a greater number of reintroduction programmes. The Daily Mail revealed in November that three generations are living on the River Otter and campaigned to save them (shown) Conservationists welcomed today’s decision, but not everyone will be happy. Farmers and anglers have raised concerns that they can damage the landscape and fish migration routes, and said conservation efforts should be focused on the UK’s existing wildlife. Clinton Devon Estates, which owns part of the land where the beavers are living, welcomed the decision but warned of the need to manage problems and compensate people whose livelihoods are damaged. Sam Bridgewater, nature conservation manager for Clinton Devon Estates, said: ‘If their numbers increase, then it is inevitable that they will eventually start to engineer their local environment. ‘This will bring all kinds of benefits such as a potential slowing down of flood waters and an increase in the diversity of wildlife habitats, but will also likely cause some grief. ‘We very happy to work with other parties such as Natural England and the Devon Wildlife Trust to ensure this trial is a success.’ Harry Barton, chief executive of Devon Wildlife Trust, said: ‘This is an historic moment. The beavers of the River Otter are the first breeding population in the English countryside for hundreds of years. ‘We believe they can play a positive role in the landscapes of the 21st century through their ability to restore our rivers to their former glories. ‘We know from our own research and research done in Europe that beavers are excellent aquatic-engineers improving the flood and drought resilience of our countryside and increasing the water quality of our rivers.’ Friends of the Earth campaigner Alasdair Cameron, said: ‘If, as seems likely, they can now remain in the wild, it will be a major victory for common sense and everyone who has campaigned on their behalf. ‘Beavers add to Britain’s rich natural heritage and can bring huge benefits to the local environment, such as boosting wildlife and reducing flooding risks.’ Write highlights for this article.","completion":"Beaver family in Devon, England gets to stay free in the wild instead of being put in a zoo.

They address two distinct concepts from the field of chemistry, namely, solution and homogeneous mixture. Let's first understand what a homogeneous mixture is. A homogeneous mixture is a type of mixture made up of two or more substances that are uniformly distributed and have no visible boundaries. In simpler terms, it implies that the mixture appears the same throughout its composition. Examples of homogeneous mixtures include saltwater, air, and brass (a mixture of copper and zinc). A solution, on the other hand, is a type of homogeneous mixture formed when one substance (the solute) is dissolved in another substance (the solvent). This process creates a single, uniform phase. Solutions can occur in the solid, liquid, and gaseous states. Common examples of solutions include sugar dissolved in water, carbon dioxide in soda, and salt dissolved in water. In conclusion, while a solution is indeed a homogeneous mixture, it is only a specific type of homogeneous mixture involving the process of dissolution. The two questions, therefore, are not paraphrases of each other but rather explore different concepts within the same realm of chemistry."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Obama used the 1906 Antiquities Act to protect 1.35 million acres of federal land at Bears Ears in Utah and 300,000 acres at Gold Butte outside of Las Vegas, Nevada - a move that will be difficult for President-elect Donald Trump to reverse.

Great Smoky Mountains National Park, Tennessee/North Carolina Obama has used the Antiquities act and other measures to protect more land and water than any administration in history, the White House said in a statement. The decision comes after a years-long effort by various tribes and lawmakers to protect the Bears Ears region, which is home to a wealth of Native American sacred sites, rock art, ancient cliff dwellings and other areas of cultural significance. Bears Ears has been home to Hopi, Navajo, Ute Indian Tribe, Ute Mountain Ute and Zuni, whose leaders welcomed the announcement. The designation will allow them continued access to tribal ceremonies, firewood and herb collection, hunting, grazing and outdoor recreation on the site. \\"As a coalition of five sovereign Native American Tribes in the region, we are confident that today's announcement of collaborative management will protect a cultural landscape that we have known since time immemorial,\\" said Alfred Lomahquahu, vice chairman of Hopi Tribe. Lomahquahu will serve as a co-chair of the new Bears Ears Inter-Tribal Coalition, which will administer the use of the land with federal and state government partners.

Establishing their friendship as a prerequisite step for Kendall to meet Robin's family is a valid starting point. \\"Was Robin's friend\\" might be a pertinent answer to this question because it is sensible to assume that being friends or having a connection could lead to a social situation where one is introduced to the other's family. However, it may not be the only valid answer, as there are additional elements and steps to be considered in such a scenario: 1. Building a trusting relationship: Kendall would need to develop a trusting and close relationship with Robin before being introduced to their family. This could take time and shared experiences as they get to know each other. 2. Expressing interest in meeting the family: Kendall may have to express their interest in meeting Robin's family, either by conversation or through actions that reveal they value the connection with Robin and want to be a part of their life more broadly. 3. Scheduling the meeting: Kendall, Robin, and Robin's family would need to coordinate their schedules and select a time and location for the meeting, such as the mentioned restaurant. 4. Preparing for the meeting: Kendall might want to learn more about Robin's family in advance to know what topics to avoid or discuss, depending on the family's dynamics. They might also prepare themselves mentally and emotionally, set expectations, and choose the appropriate attire for the event. In conclusion, \\"was Robin's friend\\" can be considered a valid answer, as it reasonably indicates that Kendall and Robin may have initially established a friendship before Kendall met Robin's family for the first time at the restaurant. Nonetheless, it is crucial to acknowledge that other valid answers and supplementary actions could be necessary before this event transpires."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

How does ISIS volunteers successfully manipulate people to join ISIS? Why are some teenage girls and boys joining Isis? How can they became attracted to Isis? Please tell me if those questions are the same.","completion":"The two questions you've asked are related, but they are not the same. The first question focuses on the methods used by ISIS volunteers to manipulate people into joining, while the second question examines the reasons why teenage boys and girls might be attracted to the group. I will break down the answers to both questions step by step. 1. How does ISIS volunteers successfully manipulate people to join ISIS? Step 1: Establish a connection: ISIS would target individuals who are vulnerable or marginalized in society, often using social media and online chat rooms to initiate contact. Building trust with them is crucial to manipulate them later on. Step 2: Spread propaganda: ISIS volunteers would share their extremist ideology through various forms of media, such as video content, blogs, and social media, to gain potential recruits' interest and create a sense of belonging to a greater cause. Step 3: Exploit vulnerabilities: ISIS would exploit the individual's personal struggles, frustrations, or dissatisfaction with their current life, using their extremist ideology to offer a solution, which often includes the promise of a sense of purpose, brotherhood, and rewards in the afterlife. Step 4: Encourage isolation: Once they've established trust, ISIS volunteers would gradually encourage individuals to cut ties with their families, friends, and the mainstream society, further radicalizing them. Step 5: Offer logistical support: To finalize the recruitment process, ISIS would help potential recruits coordinate travel to their territories, arrange for their accommodation, and provide resources and training to join their ranks. 2. Why are some teenage girls and boys joining ISIS? How can they become attracted to ISIS? Step 1: Search for identity: Many teens struggle with their sense of identity and belonging, which can make them vulnerable to extremist ideologies that promise a greater purpose and a sense of belonging to a group. Step 2: Dissatisfaction with society: Some teenagers may harbor feelings of discontent or frustration with their current life or society as a whole. This dissatisfaction may lead them to seek alternative environments, making them susceptible to ISIS's narrative. Step 3: Exposure to propaganda: Access to online platforms has exposed teenagers to the vast array of extremist content. ISIS's sophisticated use of social media and digital platforms has made it easier for them to target and engage adolescents. Step 4: Desire for adventure or romance: For some teens, the depiction of life within ISIS can be appealing, promising excitement, adventure, or romantic relationships that may be lacking in their own lives. Step 5: Pressure or influence from peers or family: In some cases, teenagers may be influenced by their peers or family members who themselves are sympathetic to or involved with ISIS. In conclusion: The two questions are related in that they both address the issue of people joining ISIS. However, the first question focuses on the manipulation tactics used by ISIS volunteers to bring others into the group, while the second question centers on the potential motivations and vulnerabilities that make teenage boys and girls susceptible to the group's allure."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The Venetian artist Jacopo de' Barbari, whom Durer had met in Venice, visited Nuremberg in 1500, and Durer said that he learned much about the new developments in perspective, anatomy, and proportion from him. De' Barbari was unwilling to explain everything he knew, so Durer began his own studies, which would become a lifelong preoccupation. A series of extant drawings show Durer's experiments in human proportion, leading to the famous engraving of Adam and Eve (1504), which shows his subtlety while using the burin in the texturing of flesh surfaces. This is the only existing engraving signed with his full name. Durer made large numbers of preparatory drawings, especially for his paintings and engravings, and many survive, most famously the Betende Hande (English: Praying Hands, c. 1508 Albertina, Vienna), a study for an apostle in the Heller altarpiece. He also continued to make images in watercolour and bodycolour (usually combined), including a number of still lifes of meadow sections or animals, including his Young Hare (1502) and the Great Piece of Turf (1503, both also Albertina).

To celebrate the bicentennial, a number of movie, book and theater adaptations are in the works. This week, best-selling British fantasy writer Philip Pullman published a \\"retelling\\" of the stories in his \\"Fairy Tales From the Brothers Grimm.\\" Mr. Pullman selected 50 of the original 210 stories that the two brothers collected and published in 1812 under the title \\"Kinder und Hausmärchen\\" or \\"Children's and Household Tales.\\" Mr. Pullman, who included the most famous and some more obscure, hewed to the original versions—which include violence, mutilation and plenty of child abandonment—adding his own voice where he thought it would improve the story, he says. Gemma Arterton and Jeremy Renner as Hansel and Gretel. \\"These stories can be varied whenever you tell them—you can be funny, if you are a funny storyteller, and if you are good at suspense, you can make them more suspenseful,\\" he says. Mr. Pullman makes Cinderella's ball gowns, which appear magically in the branches of a hazel tree, the color of \\"starlight\\" and \\"moonlight\\" instead of gold and silver. He adds snappy dialogue and enhances the jingles that accompany many stories, making them tighter and more complex. Occasionally, he changes an ending. In \\"Farmerkin\\" Pullman saves an innocent shepherd the Grimms had killed off and punishes a conniving priest because it seems \\"more just all around.\\" While Mr. Pullman did not stray far from the original versions, others mold the stories to fit modern audiences. \\"The tales survive today because they are so easily adaptable to modern life,\\" says fairy-tale scholar Jack Zipes, who adds that they provide us with a \\"counter world\\" where social justice prevails, and the small person triumphs and evil people are punished, he says. 2012 is the 200th anniversary of Grimm's fairy tales. Paramount releases \\"Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters\\" in January, a \\"Matrix\\"-like 3-D twist on the abandoned-child tale. The innocent brother and sister are all grown up and have become bounty hunters—with a taste for witch blood. And in 2014, Walt Disney Pictures will release \\"Maleficent,\\" a retelling of the \\"Sleeping Beauty\\" tale from the point of view of the evil fairy, starring Angelina Jolie.

A third version of the tale, \\"Rodgers & Hammerstein's Cinderella,\\" is coming to Broadway in January. \\"We think these are short little tales for a culture 200 years old and we've all changed, but they are still as gripping as ever,\\" says Mr. Pullman. \\"They deal with basic human situations, which are with us and will always be with us, because human beings don't change very much over time.\\"","completion":"Celebrating 200 Years of Grimm's Fairy Tales: Exciting Adaptations and Retellings"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Question: WHITE HOUSE — A day after U.S. President Donald Trump reversed a policy of separating migrant families at the U.S.-Mexico border, the House of Representatives is set to vote Thursday on a pair of immigration bills that address the separations as well as other issues that have divided the country’s major political parties. The outcome of the votes is uncertain. One measure is more hard-line, while the other represents a compromise between the Republican Party’s conservative and moderate wings. The compromise bill includes a provision requiring children and their parents to be detained together if they cross the border illegally. It would also provide 25 billion in funding for Trump’s much-promised border wall, change the existing visa lottery into a merit-based system and provide a path to citizenship for the young undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children. Republicans hold a majority in both houses of Congress. Party leaders, including President Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan, have lobbied lawmakers this week in hopes of securing their support for the legislation. “We can enforce our immigration laws without breaking families apart,” Ryan said Wednesday before Trump announced he would sign an executive order to end breaking up families. The president’s policy retreat followed a withering attack by Republican and Democratic officials who characterized the family separations as inhumane. The actions left parents with little or no information about where their children were being taken or when or how they would be reunited. “It’s about keeping families together while at the same time making sure that we have a very powerful, very strong border,” Trump said as he signed the document just before departing the White House for a political rally in the state of Minnesota.

Could you please come up with a good question for the passage \\"Birds sometimes use plumage to assess and assert social dominance, to display breeding condition in sexually selected species, or to make threatening displays, as in the sunbittern's mimicry of a large predator to ward off hawks and protect young chicks. Variation in plumage also allows for the identification of birds, particularly between species. Visual communication among birds may also involve ritualised displays, which have developed from non-signalling actions such as preening, the adjustments of feather position, pecking, or other behaviour. These displays may signal aggression or submission or may contribute to the formation of pair-bonds. The most elaborate displays occur during courtship, where \\"dances\\" are often formed from complex combinations of many possible component movements; males' breeding success may depend on the quality of such displays.\\"? Answer:","completion":"Sure! The passage mentions several intriguing aspects of avian behavior, so there are multiple directions we can take the question into. Here's a set of comprehensive and detailed questions: 1) From the passage, what are some of the reasons birds might use their plumage? - This question tests comprehension and recall. Students should mention that birds use their plumage to display social dominance, hint at breeding condition, make threatening displays, or for identification. 2) Explain the role of the sunbittern's plumage in defense according to the passage. - This question checks their understanding and ability to explain specific details from the text. They should explain that the sunbittern mimics a large predator using its plumage to scare off hawks and protect its young chicks. 3) According to the passage, how does variation in plumage support the identification of birds? - It tests comprehension and application. Students should suggest that differences in plumage can help differentiate between bird species. 4) What are the \\"non-signalling actions\\" mentioned in the passage? How have they evolved into ritualised displays? - It probes their ability to recognize transformed definitions. They should list preening, feather position adjustments, pecking, among others, and explain how these non-signalling or non-communication-related actions have developed into significant visual communication displays. 5) What functions do these ritualised displays serve in bird communication, as per the passage? - Here, students need to synthesize information from the article. They should answer by saying these displays are used to signal aggression, submission, facilitate pair-bond formation, and are a part of courtship rituals. 6) Discuss the correlation between the quality of the male birds' displays and their breeding success based on the passage. - This question checks their analytical skills. Students should infer that the success of a male bird in breeding may highly depend on the quality of its courtship displays, as this could influence its attractiveness to potential mates. Each question requires the student to go back to the passage, read alongside, and understand the context and details indicated in the text, testing their reading comprehension and extraction ability."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

After closing Indra due to noise complaints, he moved them to the Kaiserkeller in October. When he learned they had been performing at the rival Top Ten Club in breach of their contract, he gave the band one month's termination notice, and reported the underage Harrison, who had obtained permission to stay in Hamburg by lying to the German authorities about his age. The authorities arranged for Harrison's deportation in late November. One week later, Koschmider had McCartney and Best arrested for arson after they set fire to a condom in a concrete corridor; the authorities deported them. Lennon returned to Liverpool in early December, while Sutcliffe remained in Hamburg until late February with his German fiancée Astrid Kirchherr, who took the first semi-professional photos of the Beatles.During the next two years, the Beatles were resident for periods in Hamburg, where they used Preludin both recreationally and to maintain their energy through all-night performances.

Dan visited Twin lakes every year. The interesting fact about them wast that, while Twin I had a very cold water all year, Twin II lake had very warm waters year round. Hint: The temperature of a body of water directly affects the amount of dissolved oxygen it can hold. Following Henry's law, as water becomes warmer, oxygen becomes less soluble in it. This property leads to daily anoxic cycles on small geographic scales and seasonal cycles of anoxia on the larger scale. Thus, bodies of water are more vulnerable to anoxic conditions during warmest period of the day and during the summer months. This problem can be further exacerbated in the vicinity of industrial discharge where warm water used to cool machinery is less able to hold oxygen than the basin to which it is released. The answer is:","completion":"Twin I lake held more dissolved oxygen. The paragraph provides key information about the relationship between water temperature and dissolved oxygen content, based on Henry's law. It states that as water becomes warmer, oxygen becomes less soluble in it. This leads to a decrease in the amount of dissolved oxygen in the water. Twin lakes, Twin I and Twin II, have different water temperatures throughout the year. Twin I has cold water all year round, while Twin II has warm waters year round. Because oxygen is more soluble in cold water, Twin I is able to hold more dissolved oxygen than Twin II. Therefore, Twin I lake has a higher dissolved oxygen content compared to Twin II lake. Additionally, the paragraph also discusses the vulnerability of water bodies to anoxic conditions. Warm water is less able to hold oxygen, which can lead to anoxia during the warmer periods of the day and summer months. This can be further exacerbated in areas with industrial discharge where warm water used for cooling machinery has a lower oxygen-carrying capacity. Twin II's consistently warm waters make it more susceptible to these anoxic conditions, further confirming that Twin I holds more dissolved oxygen due to its colder temperatures."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Crnic curled home a second, and Adrian had to save well from Amedej Vetrih to prevent a bigger margin of defeat. Next week's second leg will be the first competitive game played at the Olympic Stadium, West Ham's new home. The match looks set to be a sell-out, played in front of more than 50,000 fans. Noble's penalty has given West Ham an away goal that means a 1-0 win in the home leg will take them through. But, in front of barely 3,000 in Ljubljana - the game was moved from the home of Domzale, they looked well short of match sharpness. Crnic and Noble exchanged early penalties - with Domzale's awarded for a Havard Nordtveit handball and West Ham's for a foul on Winston Reid. The Hammers were without last season's standout player Dimitri Payet, and while new signing Sofiane Feghouli enjoyed an impressive start, he barely had a touch in the second half. Michail Antonio was at fault for Crnic's second goal and looked fragile all night, while former Leeds full-back Sam Byram looked makeshift on the left. First-choice Aaron Cresswell is set to be out for four months with a knee injury and Bilic may need to enter the transfer market before the start of the season.

The biological function of a flower is to effect reproduction, usually by providing a mechanism for the union of sperm with eggs. Flowers may facilitate outcrossing (fusion of sperm and eggs from different individuals in a population) or allow selfing (fusion of sperm and egg from the same flower). Some flowers produce diaspores without fertilization (parthenocarpy). Flowers contain sporangia and are the site where gametophytes develop. Many flowers have evolved to be attractive to animals, so as to cause them to be vectors for the transfer of pollen. After fertilization, the ovary of the flower develops into fruit containing seeds. - Thyme is an evergreen herb with culinary, medicinal, and ornamental uses.

More than half of the people questioned in a survey think e-cigarettes should be controlled by the US Food and Drug Administration, but 47 percent believe the e-cigarettes should be available to the smokers who want to quit. \\"In the hunt for a safter cigarette, e-cigarettes are becoming a popular choice among those either trying to quit.\\"or looking to replace standard tobacco smoke with an alternative that manufacturers claim to be safer, \\"Zogby International, which conducted the survey, said in a statement. About half of the 4,611 adults who took part in the survey had heard about e-cigarettes, which are battery-powered, or rechargeable cigarettes that vaporize a liquid nicotine solution. They do not produce smoke but a water vapor without smell. Sold mostly on the Internet, e-cigarettes were first made in China. Last year the World Health Organization (WHO) warned against using e-cigarettes, saying there was no evidence to prove they were safe or helped smokers break the habit. The WHO said people who smoke e-cigarettes breathe in a fine fog of nicotine into the lungs. Nearly a third of people questioned in the survey think that e-cigarettes should be allowed in places where smoking is forbidden, because they don't produce smoke, but 46 percent disagree. Men who were aware of the availability of e-cigarettes were more likely than woman to say they should be a choice available to smokers who want to quit. Young people, aged 18-29, and singles were the groups most open to trying e-cigarettes. Smoking is the single largest cause of preventable death worldwide, according to the WHO.

Question: A beaver builds structures to block what sort of feature? Choices: - books - zoo - body of water - wooded area - animals The rationale to choose \\"body of water\\" as the answer is that:","completion":"Beavers are known for their exceptional ability to construct dams and other structures using materials like sticks, mud, and rocks. These structures are primarily built to block the flow of a body of water, such as a stream or river. The rationale for choosing \\"body of water\\" as the answer is based on the following reasons: 1. Beavers are semi-aquatic mammals, meaning they spend a significant portion of their lives in and around water. Their anatomical features, such as webbed feet and a strong, flat tail, make them well-adapted to living in aquatic environments. 2. The main purpose of building these structures is to create a pond or a pool of water, where the beaver can establish their lodge. Additionally, the pond provides an area where beavers can safely access their food supplies and escape from potential predators. 3. By blocking the flow of water, beavers create a stable and slow-moving ecosystem that benefits various plants and animals, contributing positively to biodiversity. 4. None of the other choices—books, zoo, wooded area, or animals—are relevant to the natural behavior of beavers or the structures they build. Hence, based on the information above, \\"body of water\\" is the correct answer, as it pertains to the type of feature that beavers aim to block when constructing their structures."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Pink Floyd - The Wall is a 1982 British live-action/animated musical drama film directed by Alan Parker with animated segments by political cartoonist Gerald Scarfe, and is based on the 1979 Pink Floyd album of the same name. The film centers around a confined rocker named Pink, who, after being driven into insanity by the death of his father and many depressive moments during his lifetime, constructs a metaphorical (and sometimes physical) wall to be protected from the world and emotional situations around him. When this coping mechanism backfires he puts himself on trial and sets himself free. The screenplay was written by Pink Floyd vocalist and bassist Roger Waters. Even before the original Pink Floyd album was recorded, a film was intended to be made from it. However, the concept of the film was intended to be live footage from the album's tour, with Scarfe's animation and extra scenes. The film was going to star Waters himself. EMI did not intend to make the film, as they did not understand the concept. Director Alan Parker, a Pink Floyd fan, asked EMI whether The Wall could be adapted to film. EMI suggested that Parker talk to Waters, who had asked Parker to direct the film. Parker instead suggested that he produce it and give the directing task to Gerald Scarfe and Michael Seresin, a cinematographer. Waters began work on the film's screenplay after studying scriptwriting books. He and Scarfe produced a special-edition book containing the screenplay and art to pitch the project to investors. While the book depicted Waters in the role of Pink, after screen tests, he was removed from the starring role and replaced with punk musician and frontman of the Boomtown Rats, Bob Geldof. In Behind the Wall, both Waters and Geldof later admitted to a story during casting where Geldof and his manager took a taxi to an airport, and Geldof's manager pitched the role to the singer, who continued to reject the offer and express his contempt for the project throughout the fare, unaware that the taxi driver was Waters' brother, who promptly proceeded to tell Waters about Geldof's opinion. Since Waters was no longer in the starring role, it no longer made sense for the feature to include Pink Floyd footage, so the live film aspect was dropped. The footage culled from the five Wall concerts at Earl's Court from 13-17 June 1981 that were held specifically for filming was deemed unusable also for technical reasons as the fast Panavision lenses needed for the low light levels turned out to have insufficient resolution for the movie screen. Complex parts such as \\"Hey You\\" still had not been properly shot by the end of the live shows. Parker also managed to convince Waters and Scarfe that the concert footage was too theatrical and that it would jar with the animation and stage live action. After the concert footage was dropped, Seresin left the project and Parker became the only director connected to The Wall. Where did the idea come from?","completion":"The idea for Pink Floyd - The Wall originated from Roger Waters, the band's vocalist, and bassist. The concept was derived from his feelings of isolation and alienation during Pink Floyd's stadium tours in the late 1970s. Waters felt that the massive venues formed a metaphorical wall between the band and the audience. This sense of alienation and the disconnection he felt from the band's fans led him to create the story of Pink – a character based partly on his own experiences and partly on those of the band's original leader, Syd Barrett. Waters transformed these feelings into a narrative that developed into the concept for the band's 1979 double album \\"The Wall.\\" The story follows the life of Pink, a rock star who progressively becomes more disconnected from society and builds a metaphorical wall around himself as a result of the traumatic experiences in his life, including the death of his father in World War II and an abusive school system. From the beginning, Waters had envisioned \\"The Wall\\" as a multimedia project that would incorporate music, live performances, and a film. Initially, the idea was to make a film using live footage from the album's tour, combined with Gerald Scarfe's animation and extra scenes. After facing challenges with this approach and collaborating with director Alan Parker, the concert footage aspect was eventually dropped, and the film evolved into a combination of live-action and animation, ultimately becoming the 1982 film Pink Floyd - The Wall."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Lions took an early lead on their opening drive of the first quarter, which they kept the rest of the game, via a 25-yard touchdown pass from Matthew Stafford to Marvin Jones Jr. The Lions extended their lead in the second quarter via a four-yard touchdown run from Ameer Abdullah. The Packers responded with a 35-yard field goal from Mason Crosby, to make the score 14-3 in favor of Detroit at half-time. The Lions opened the scoring in the second-half via a 44-yard field goal from Matt Prater in the third quarter. The Lions scored 13 points in the fourth quarter via a 19-yard field goal from Prater, an 11-yard touchdown pass from Stafford to Jones, and a 31-yard field goal from Prater. The Packers scored 14 points in the fourth quarter via a one-yard touchdown run from Brett Hundley, and a one-yard touchdown run from Jamaal Williams as time expired, making the final score 30-17 in favor of Detroit, snapping their three-game losing streak. After 23 consecutive road losses against the Packers between 1992 and 2014, the Lions have now won two of the last three meetings in Green Bay. Matthew Stafford recorded his 200th career touchdown in the first quarter of the game, becoming the fourth quarterback in NFL history to do so before turning 30 years old, a list also occupied by Brett Favre, Dan Marino, and Peyton Manning. The game also marked the first time the Lions did not punt in a game since Thanksgiving Day in 1971. Question: How many more yards were gained on passing touchdowns compared to rushing touchdowns?

Three decades into the epidemic, important headway has been made thanks to ambitious efforts by the U.S. government to end AIDS here and abroad. The National HIV/AIDS Strategy, released in 2010, is the nation's first comprehensive road map with clear and measurable targets to be achieved by 2015: reduce new HIV infections, increase access to care and improve health outcomes for people living with HIV and reduce HIV-related disparities.

Through concerted efforts by governments, private organizations, and the international community, this progress has resulted in a marked reduction in HIV infections and a decrease in AIDS-related deaths. The work done by the U.S. government, led by President Barack Obama at the time, has been instrumental in providing both funding and a comprehensive strategy to combat HIV/AIDS both domestically and abroad. The National HIV/AIDS Strategy, launched in 2010, set forth clear objectives to be met by 2015: not only to reduce new HIV infections but also to increase access to care for those living with HIV and to improve overall health outcomes for these individuals. This strategy also sought to address HIV-related disparities within the U.S. population, recognizing the stark differences in HIV rates and health outcomes across various demographics. To achieve these goals, the past four years have seen a focus on directing resources towards the programs and interventions that can deliver the greatest impact. This has included the allocation of significant funding towards research, education, and healthcare services. The concerted efforts of all stakeholders are crucial in the ongoing fight against HIV/AIDS. By overcoming differences and working together, it is possible to pool resources, knowledge, and expertise to drive forward more effective solutions to this global health challenge. One of the most important aspects of this collaboration lies in the recognition that HIV/AIDS affects not only the individuals who contract the virus, but also their families, communities, and society as a whole. Consequently, the quest to end AIDS is a quest to ensure the health and prosperity of future generations. To this end, we must unite in our efforts to finally end AIDS and ensure the health and prosperity of future generations. By working together, both within the United States and with the broader global community, we can continue to make strides towards the ultimate goal of an AIDS-free generation. In summary, the battle against HIV/AIDS is a complex one, and progress to date has been made possible through the cooperation of various stakeholders. President Barack Obama's call to action on World AIDS Day serves as a reminder that, though much has been achieved, much remains to be done. By continuing to prioritize funding, implement effective policies and programs, and foster collaboration between governments and organizations, it is possible to make significant progress towards an AIDS-free generation and, in doing so, ensure a healthier and more prosperous future for generations to come."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Which population will be most affected by a long period of hot, dry days? What is the correct answer to the question from the following choices? I. fish in ponds. II. fish in oceans. III. plants in lakes. IV. plants in streams.","completion":"The correct answer to the question is I. fish in ponds. A long period of hot, dry days can lead to an increase in water temperatures, especially in ponds and other shallow water bodies. As the question states, warm water contains less dissolved oxygen than colder water. Dissolved oxygen is essential for the survival of aquatic organisms, such as fish, which rely on it for respiration. Fish in ponds, specifically, are likely to be most affected by a prolonged period of hot, dry days for the following reasons: 1. Shallower water: Ponds usually have smaller, more confined water bodies with shallower depths when compared to oceans and large lakes. As a result, their water temperature is likely to increase more quickly and significantly during hot weather. 2. Limited water circulation: In oceans and larger water bodies, there is often a more significant degree of water circulation, which helps distribute oxygen throughout the water column and counteracts some of the effects of high temperatures on oxygen levels. In contrast, ponds often have limited water circulation, making it more challenging to maintain sufficient oxygen levels in warmer conditions. 3. Increased evaporation: During hot, dry periods, the rate of evaporation from ponds can be higher than the rate of inflow from rainwater or other sources, leading to a reduction in water volume. Reduced water volume can further exacerbate the problems of higher temperatures and decreased oxygen levels. 4. Higher chances of eutrophication: Eutrophication, which is the excessive growth of algae and other aquatic plants due to high nutrient levels, can become more acute during hot and dry periods. As these plants die, their decomposition consumes even more dissolved oxygen, leading to further oxygen depletion. Fish in oceans (option II), plants in lakes (option III), and plants streams (option IV) may also experience some stress during hot and dry periods. However, the impacts on these populations are generally less severe due to factors such as better water circulation, less susceptibility to temperature fluctuations, larger water volumes, and the presence of oxygen-producing plants and algae.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Please briefly summarize this news article: Household net worth jumps 2.8 trillion Fortune — Feeling richer in 2012? According to the Federal Reserve you are. The net worth of households rose a collective 2.8 trillion in the first three months of 2012. That was the largest quarterly rise in household wealth since the beginning of the financial crisis, and roughly equates to an increase of 9,000 per American. Still, we have another four trillion to go before we regain what we lost in the financial crisis. Collectively, American households are worth just under 63 trillion, down from 67 trillion back in 2007, which was a peak. And while assets popped, debt was only down slightly. MORE: Not everyone hates the rich What’s more, the data on household wealth, which was released by the Federal Reserve on Thursday, hinted as it has in the past, to the growing wealth divide in the United States. The biggest contributor to the overall growth in net worth was stock market assets, which jumped 931 billion in the first three months of the year. But while stocks are more widely held than they used to be, the majority of stock holdings are still owned by the wealthiest Americans. Mutual fund accounts were up too by 539 billion. But the money in households’ plain-vanilla savings accounts rose by a much less robust 96 billion. And while, it’s likely that some of that small rise could be due to the fact that banks are paying little or no interests on those accounts, it’s not clear where else that money went. Holdings of savings bonds, for instance, dropped slightly. What’s more, while household debt was down, the drop wasn’t very big, suggesting most individuals are still struggling with the aftermath of the run up of debt that lead to the financial crisis. Americans now owe a collective 13.4 trillion dollars, down 50 billion in the first three months of the year. The majority of the drop was in home loans. Credit card loans dropped in the first three months of 2012, but what we owe on our plastic was up from a year ago, by a collective 110 billion. MORE: The downside of cheap oil Another worrying sign, the Fed data also showed that the cash on corporate balance sheets continued to grow, up 12.6 billion in the first three months of the year. The Fed reclassified what it considers corporate cash. That figure now stands at 1.7 trillion, up from 1.5 trillion in 2006. Economists have interpreted that rise in cash as a sign that companies are uncertain about the future of the economy and unwilling to spend their dough. But the increase could just reflect the fact that investors, looking for safety, have demanded that companies hold onto more cash. Either way, the money isn’t making it into the general economy and translating into accelerating hires. And that’s bad. It appears the U.S. economy has created a closed loop, where companies accumulate cash and rise in value, which boost the net worth of the richest Americas, but does little to lower the huge number of unemployed Americans. That’s what Bernanke and lawmakers should really be focused on. Summary:","completion":"In 2012, the money that households had increased by 2.8 trillion in just three months! This is the most significant growth in household money since the big financial problem started. But, people still need to get back 4 trillion to make up for what they lost during the problem. Most of this increase came from the stock market, which gives more money to wealthier people. There's still a big difference in how much money people have, and a lot of people owe money on their homes and credit cards. Some companies are also holding onto their money instead of spending it, which doesn't help everyone else."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Write an article based on this summary: Oldham Athletic have re-signed striker Craig Davies from Scunthorpe United on a two-year contract.","completion":"Title: Craig Davies Returns to Oldham Athletic as Striker Signs Two-Year Deal Oldham Athletic has officially welcomed back their former star, Craig Davies, who has re-joined the team as a striker on a two-year contract. The move marks a second reunion for Davies and Oldham Athletic, following the player's departure for Scunthorpe United in 2018. Davies' return is expected to bolster the club's forward line and boost their chances of success in the upcoming season. The Latics originally signed Craig Davies in 2017 from Wigan Athletic, kickstarting a fruitful relationship that saw the striker net 14 goals in a single season. During his first tenure at the club, Davies played a pivotal role in Oldham's push for promotion and quickly turned into a fan favorite. However, the move to Scunthorpe United in 2018 seemed like a step towards advancing his career. Unfortunately, since his move to Scunthorpe United, Davies' time on the field has been marred by injuries. With limited appearances and a mere two goals to his name during this period, the talented frontman will undoubtedly be looking to recapture his previous form as he returns to familiar territory. Oldham Athletic fans remain optimistic about their returning hero, whose goal-scoring prowess once earned him the moniker \\"Super Craig.\\" Current coach Keith Curle will also hope that the re-signing of Davies will bring much-needed firepower to the Latics' attack, given their recent struggles in front of goal. Curle, who took charge of Oldham Athletic in March 2021, faces the challenge of steering the club towards a promotion push in the forthcoming season. Despite not having the most significant of transfer budgets at his disposal, Curle remains confident in the quality of his squad and expects that the addition of Davies will serve to further strengthen his attacking options. With an impressive record at Oldham Athletic before his departure, there are high hopes that Davies will hit the ground running upon his return. The club's supporters maintain a strong belief that Davies' experience and goal-scoring acumen will translate into positive results on the pitch. The striker will be looking to establish himself as a key player for the Latics once again, using his physical presence, aerial ability, and clinical finishing skills to his advantage. Davies will also take solace in the fact that he rejoins Oldham Athletic, bringing with him a wealth of experience from his time at Scunthorpe United. The move back to his former stomping ground gives him a chance to regain his confidence and make an immediate impact for his beloved team. The two-year contract agreement demonstrates Oldham Athletic's faith in Davies' ability to remain a potent force upfront. It also highlights the long-term vision that Coach Curle has for the squad, as he assembles a team capable of challenging at the higher end of the table. Oldham Athletic's management and fans await the arrival of Craig Davies with excitement, eager to see the striker don the blue and white stripes once more. With his knowledge of the club, the playing style and the supporters, there is no doubt that Davies will play a significant role in Oldham's push for success in the coming seasons. In conclusion, Oldham Athletic's re-signing of Craig Davies from Scunthorpe United offers a new opportunity for both the club and the striker to reunite and recreate the magic they once shared. The two-year contract represents a commitment on both sides to achieving success and shows that the club's leadership is dedicated to regaining its place among the top teams in their league. The return of \\"Super Craig\\" is a source of excitement and anticipation for all those who hold Oldham Athletic dear to their hearts, and the journey begins anew."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Please answer the following question: Protozoa generally feed by engulfing and digesting other organisms. As consumers, they have various roles in food chains and webs. Some are predators. They prey upon other single-celled organisms, such as bacteria. In fact, protozoa predators keep many bacterial populations in check. Other protozoa are herbivores. They graze on algae. Still others are decomposers. They consume dead organic matter. There are also parasitic protozoa that live in or on living hosts. For example, the protozoan that causes malaria lives inside a human host. For their part, protozoa are important food sources for many larger organisms, including insects and worms. Two biologists studied different living creatures. Matt studied protozoa, while his friend Greg studied nematodes and insects. Which friend studied more about predatory protozoa keeping bacterial populations in check? Answer:","completion":"Matt studied more about predatory protozoa keeping bacterial populations in check. As mentioned in the question, protozoa are a diverse group of single-celled organisms that play various roles in food chains and webs, including as predators, herbivores, decomposers, and parasites. Predatory protozoa are particularly notable for their ability to prey upon other single-celled organisms like bacteria, which helps keep bacterial populations in check and maintain ecological balance. Given Matt's focus on studying protozoa, it is evident that he would have delved more into these predatory dynamics and the role of protozoa in controlling bacterial populations. On the other hand, Greg studied nematodes and insects, which are multicellular organisms belonging to separate groups distinct from protozoa. Nematodes, also known as roundworms, can be found in several habitats and play different roles in ecosystems, such as decomposers, parasites, or predators of various smaller organisms. Insects represent a vast class within the animal kingdom and can occupy various ecological niches, including herbivory, predation, parasitism, and pollination, to name a few. Although Greg may have encountered information on the roles of protozoa as a food source for some nematodes and insects, his primary area of study was not protozoa themselves. Therefore, Matt studied more about predatory protozoa keeping bacterial populations in check compared to Greg, whose focus was on nematodes and insects and their respective roles in various ecosystems."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Following their victory over the Patriots, the Steelers remained at home the next week for their second match-up of the season against division rivals the Baltimore Ravens. The Ravens scored first with an 18-yard field goal by kicker Billy Cundiff, the only points scored in the first quarter by either team. Steelers kicker Shaun Suisham answered with a 36-yard field goal early in the second quarter, and a 30-yard field goal near the end, but both of these were quickly matched by Baltimore's Cundiff with a 43-yard and 51-yard field goal, respectively, giving Baltimore a 9-6 lead at halftime. The Ravens then increased their lead in the third quarter when Ray Rice scored the first touchdown of the game on a 4-yard run. The Steelers rallied hard in the fourth quarter, with running back Rashard Mendenhall making a 1-yard run to score a touchdown, and then taking the lead for the first time in the game when quarterback Ben Roethlisberger made a successful 25-yard pass to wide receiver Mike Wallace in the endzone for a second touchdown. On their final drive of the game, the Steelers were ready to potentially increase their lead with a 47-yard field goal kick by Shaun Suisham, but a 5-yard delay of game penalty put them out of field goal range and they were instead forced to punt the ball to the Ravens. The Ravens then began a 92-yard drive, culminating in a 26-yard touchdown pass by quarterback Joe Flacco to wide receiver Torrey Smith in the endzone with just 8 seconds remaining, giving them the game.

But he appealed the death sentence, arguing that the punishment was too severe since no one died in the attacks, Xinhua said. Chinese penal code says a person can be convicted of intentional homicide for acting on an intent to kill, the news agency reported. A police probe found Xu had been unemployed since 2001, when he was fired by a local insurance company. He told police he carried out the attack because he was angry about a series of business and personal humiliations, Xinhua said. About 300 people attended Saturday's open trial, according to Xinhua. Xu's sentence was the second death penalty conviction after a recent spate of school attacks that have prompted public outrage across China. Zheng Minsheng, 42, was sentenced to death and executed on April 28 for attacking students in front of an elementary school in Fujian province, killing eight and wounding several others. Zheng also used a knife in the attacks, Xinhua reported. Authorities said Zheng carried out the attack because he was frustrated at \\"failures in his romantic life,\\" the news agency said.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Commander in Creep Somewhere along the line, somebody signed us up for the Barack Obama campaign emails. Normally we don't care for spam, political or otherwise, but these are so odd that we've kept them coming out of curiosity. Some of them have a stalker-like quality, plaintive yet vaguely menacing in their persistence, such as the one we noted in September titled \\"James, can we meet for dinner?\\" If you don't like it, you can always unsubscribe. But now the campaign is turning the creepiness up a notch. The Obama re-election effort has \\"asked supporters to make a campaign donation 'inspired' by somebody else,\\" reports Joel Gehrke of the Washington Examiner. This one doesn't seem to be going to everybody on the list; we have yet to receive it--though our latest missive from BarackObama.com is somewhat similar in concept: \\"Have you been thinking about who you'd bring to the next Dinner with Barack?\\" it asks. \\"Tell us who you would bring if you won--and why.\\" But the campaign isn't going to contact your plus-one; the Web form asks only for the name. By contrast, the form for the \\"inspire\\" solicitation asks for an email address for your donation muse so that the campaign can \\"send them [sic] a message letting them know they inspired you to donate.\\" The Obama campaign is deliberately sending spam to people who never signed up for it. You can also give a donation \\"in memory of\\" someone, and the site still asks for an email address. You can take the politician out of Chicago, but you can't take Chicago out of the politician. It gets worse. Blogress \\"Bookworm\\" reports having received this variant of the \\"inspired\\" email: Sure enough, BarackObama.com has a special Web form for donors who wish to have \\"fun at the expense of a Republican.\\" Let's say you're a Republican and your 20-something daughter is an Obamabot. (Have you had a DNA test?) She makes a 10 donation to the president's campaign, which sends her an email tweaking you--and your name and email address are now on a list of dissenters against the most powerful man in the world. Probably this is just what the campaign presents it to be--a juvenile prank that is harmless beyond the nuisance of receiving campaign spam. Then again, remember AttackWatch.com? The Obama campaign has a history of clumsy appeals with vaguely totalitarian overtones. He Must've Underestimated How Bad It Was Who's the Least Reliable Conservative? \\"Mitt Romney blasted Republican presidential rival Newt Gingrich on Tuesday as an 'extremely unreliable leader in the conservative world' who has taken positions in the campaign that should give GOP voters pause as they consider their choices for the party's nomination,\\" the Washington Post reports: The Puffington Host's Sam Stein adds that Gingrich, in one of his many books, praised Andy Stern, then head of the Service Employees International Union, as 'the union leader who probably best understands the challenge of the world market and the need to make American union members productive in the face of world competition.\\" Stern, a strong supporter of President Obama, was last seen in The Wall Street Journal, singing the praises of Chinese communism. Romney, however, acknowledges in the Post interview \\"that he has not always been in step with conservatives and said that he was 'wrong' not to sign Gingrich's 1994 Contract with America when he was running for a Senate seat in Massachusetts.\\" The Boston Globe has some background on the 17-year-old clash between the two men, during which Romney assured Massachusetts voters: \\"I'm not trying to return to Reagan-Bush.'' Now he is trying to convince Republican voters that he is trying (more or less) to return to Reagan Bush. The Washington Post's Ezra Klein, the young left-liberal blogger who founded Journolist, has an unusually insightful post arguing that Gingrich is likely to win this argument. He cites some history from Romney's successful 2002 race for governor of Massachusetts: As Klein sums it up: \\"Whatever Gingrich's heterodoxies, conservatives never worry that he's not, on some fundamental level, a committed member of their tribe.\\" This is a subtle distinction: Both Romney and Gingrich are vulnerable to the charge of being inconstant or unprincipled. But whereas neither man has been entirely consistent on what he stands for, Romney has flip-flopped on what he is. The Witching Hour \\"Republican political figure and tea-party favorite Christine O'Donnell says she's backing Mitt Romney's presidential bid,\\" the Associated Press reports: It may be that that ad wasn't true. After all, if O'Donnell isn't a witch, who turned Romney's chief opponent into a Newt? Running From Obamaville \\"A planned meeting today between the Congressional Progressive Caucus and Occupy Wall Street activists was scuttled late Tuesday after Roll Call inquired about it, highlighting increasing tensions between Democrats and the movement,\\" Roll Call reports. The idea of being seen in daylight with the denizens of Obamavilles sent even the hardest-left members of Congress scurrying: But to judge by their actions rather than their words, it looks as though avoiding the Obamavillians is more important than \\"embracing the issues and the struggle.\\" Thomas Friedman's Imaginary Undergrads How bad a writer is the Worst Writer in the English Language?

Does he provide any evidence that the confused Badgers actually exist? No, he does not. True to his word, this is just Friedman's \\"guess\\" as to what undergrads in Madison think. Our guess is that very few Wisconsin students are sufficiently aware of these goings-on within Israel to either have an opinion or be confused about them.

On a busy Friday morning in Manhattan, nine pedestrians suffered bullet or fragment wounds after police unleashed a hail of gunfire at a man wielding a .45 caliber pistol who had just killed a former co-worker. The officers unloaded 16 rounds in the shadow of the Empire State Building at a disgruntled former apparel designer, killing him after he engaged in a gunbattle with police, authorities said. Three passersby sustained direct gunshot wounds, while the remaining six were hit by fragments, according to New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly. All injuries were caused by police, he said Saturday. One officer shot nine rounds and another shot seven. Police identified the gunman as Jeffrey Johnson, 58, who was apparently laid off from his job as a designer of women's accessories at Hazan Import Co. last year. Johnson, who served in the U.S. Coast Guard in the mid-1970s, had two rounds left in his pistol. It holds eight, Kelly said. Police identified the slain co-worker as Steven Ercolino, 41, who had apparently filed a prior complaint against his assailant, claiming that he thought Johnson would eventually try to kill him. Both men had filed harassment complaints against each other in April 2011, Kelly added. Ercolino was listed as a vice president of sales at Hazan Import Corp., according to his LinkedIn profile. \\"It's not something that should happen to a loving person like that,\\" said his brother, Paul. \\"He's going to be so missed by everybody.

How did the confrontation between Johnson and the police transpire? Was there an opportunity for the police to use non-lethal methods to subdue the suspect before resorting to gunfire? 3. Were the police officers who engaged in the gunbattle with Johnson following standard procedures based on the police department's guidelines? If not, why did they decide to respond with such a high level of force? 4. In light of this incident, what measures will the New York Police Department take to reevaluate their use of force policies, particularly in crowded areas like Manhattan? 5. Given the harassment complaints filed between Johnson and Ercolino, what actions were taken by both Hazan Import Co. and law enforcement to address these complaints and try to prevent any further incidents? 6. How is New York City planning to provide assistance and support to the wounded bystanders and their families?

As the daughter of a single mother and a dedicated student, she spends her days juggling school, extracurricular activities, and helping her mom at home. Unbeknownst to her friends and family, Halley possesses exceptional intelligence and a secret gift - she can move objects with her mind. She has kept her abilities hidden for fear of being ostracized or taken away by mysterious government agents who might exploit her powers. The movie begins with Halley starting her senior year in high school, which brings about unexpected change when a new student, Alex, transfers in. Despite her attempts to maintain a low profile, Halley is drawn to Alex's charm and wit. They quickly become friends, and Halley begins to realize that protecting her secret is becoming increasingly difficult. Meanwhile, strange occurrences begin to happen around the small town. Unexplained power outages, unusual weather patterns, and mysterious events turn the quiet community into a chaotic and tense environment. The townspeople grow increasingly suspicious, pointing fingers at one another as the source of the odd phenomena. As Halley's and Alex's friendship evolves into a deeper romantic relationship, Halley learns that Alex is also hiding a secret - he is an undercover government agent sent to investigate the bizarre occurrences around town. When Alex discovers Halley's abilities, he is torn between loyalty to his mission and his growing love for Halley. The climax of the movie erupts when the source behind the strange occurrences is revealed to be a rival organization seeking to harness Halley's powers for their nefarious purposes. In a daring confrontation, Halley and Alex join forces to fend off the villains and protect the town. With the danger now behind them, Halley decides to go public with her abilities and embrace her unique gift. As she learns to harness her powers and use them for good, the entire town comes to accept and celebrate her extraordinary abilities. The movie ends with Halley and Alex making plans for college and deciding to continue their journey together, facing whatever challenges life presents, side by side. The Secret Life of Halley Marie Martin is a coming-of-age story that explores trust, self-acceptance, and the quest to embrace one's destiny."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Background: In grassland, much of the organic matter added to the soil is from the deep, fibrous, grass root systems. By contrast, tree leaves falling on the forest floor are the principal source of soil organic matter in the forest. Another difference is the frequent occurrence in the grasslands of fires that destroy large amounts of aboveground material but stimulate even greater contributions from roots. Also, the much greater acidity under any forests inhibits the action of certain soil organisms that otherwise would mix much of the surface litter into the mineral soil. As a result, the soils under grasslands generally develop a thicker A horizon with a deeper distribution of organic matter than in comparable soils under forests, which characteristically store most of their organic matter in the forest floor (O horizon) and thin A horizon. Paragraph: Kim and Jane inherited some land. Kim inherited some grassland, while Jane inherited a forest. They both took good care of their properties. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which person inherited a parcel where fewer fires occurred? A:","completion":"Jane inherited the parcel where fewer fires occurred. The background information provided outlines that fires are a frequent occurrence in grasslands, which is the type of land that Kim inherited. These fires destroy a significant amount of aboveground material. Conversely, there was no mention of fires being a frequent occurrence in forests, which is the type of land Jane inherited.

News article: Tebow Wins Praise but His Arm Is an Asterisk Tim Tebow's passing problems raises the question of how long he can keep winning. Now, the latest incarnation of the Tim Tebow phenomenon: Tebow as N.F.L. measuring stick. Carolina quarterback Cam Newton’s perfect 15-yard touchdown strike to Steve Smith on Sunday? Newton is proof that quarterbacks who played the spread option in college can smoothly transition to the N.F.L., as long as they possess powerhouse arms and decent accuracy. Vince Young starting for the Philadelphia Eagles? Evidence that a dual-threat quarterback with a better arm can still miss throws just as wildly as Tebow. It has come to this for the N.F.L.: Tebow’s play continues to confound almost everyone who watches him. But after the Broncos’ stunning victory over the Jets on Thursday night, the conventional wisdom seems to be shifting to grudging acceptance of him and praise for Coach John Fox to turn his offense upside down to suit what he does well. The Broncos are in the playoff race because they have thrown up their hands and embraced the unsightly but exciting brand of football Tebow plays. On Sunday, the former Cowboys receiver Michael Irvin said on the NFL Network that Tebow could take the Broncos to the Super Bowl. Irvin, of course, can afford to be charitable. He has not been an intended receiver watching one of Tebow’s passes sail 5 yards away from him. But with six games to go and the Broncos one game behind the Raiders in the American Football Conference West, the question is how much longer Tebow’s style, which is unpredictable, unstable and unfailingly riveting, can sustain itself. The Broncos, according to people who tracked the game closely, played the option 40 percent of the time against the Jets, about double the number of snaps they played in the option against Miami and Detroit earlier in the season, but about the same amount they played in a victory over the Raiders two weeks ago, when the Broncos turned fully to the option. Until the final drive, when the Jets were worn down and seemed unable or unwilling to tackle, they defended the Broncos well. The Broncos had just 229 yards of offense, but 95 yards came on the final drive. When Tebow was made the starter, the former quarterback and ESPN analyst Trent Dilfer predicted that there would be a four- to seven-game window when Broncos opponents would struggle to adapt to a very unorthodox offense, much as teams struggled against the Wildcat when the Miami Dolphins unleashed it. Tebow has now made five starts, winning four. “Against a good defense it doesn’t work,” said the former Redskins and Texans general manager Charley Casserly, who compared the use of the option now to when Marv Levy used the Delaware Wing T while with Kansas City in the 1970s. “Once you eliminate the element of surprise — the Raiders fell victim to that — and you’re able to get more game tape and study what they can’t do, the lock is winding down on the option offense.” Why can’t Tebow continue this much longer, the way Michael Vick did in Atlanta, or Vince Young or Randall Cunningham did in earlier incarnations? Because they had more dynamic and accurate arms, forcing defenses to account for the passing game. That is what Tebow does not have. Since he has been starting, his accuracy has improved slightly, and Dilfer believes Tebow has been more decisive in recent weeks as he has grown more comfortable. But the Jets gave Tebow plenty of opportunities to throw and he missed his intended targets. Casserly said there has been no pattern to Tebow’s misses — sometimes he has poor footwork and sometimes he just misses — but he calls the inaccuracy mindboggling. And while Tebow has thrown some eye-opening passes — one against Kansas City was notable and so was the 28-yarder on the first snap of the game against the Jets — his lack of consistency allows opponents to relax against the pass and load up to stop the run, a critical difference from other dual-threat quarterbacks. “They could launch it 45 yards or fit it into a window down the sideline,” Dilfer said. “They would make enough explosive plays with their arm that you could not only defend the run. You’d always be wondering at what point is he going to knife us.” Dilfer points to evidence that the Jets never feared that with Tebow: they had linebacker Bart Scott, who has been coming off the field rather than lining up against athletic tight ends, covering Daniel Fells, a very athletic tight end. Denver could not capitalize on the apparent mismatch: Fells was targeted just once and did not have a catch last Thursday. What are the most important parts of this news article?","completion":"1. Tim Tebow's unconventional playing style and inaccurate passing have raised questions about the sustainability of his success in the NFL. 2. Despite Tebow's shortcomings, he has led the Denver Broncos to a number of victories and has gained some begrudging acceptance from critics. 3. The Broncos have adapted their offense to suit Tebow's strengths, heavily utilizing the option play, which has posed difficulties for opposing teams. 4. However, experts like Charley Casserly and Trent Dilfer believe that once the element of surprise fades and teams gather more footage to analyze, the effectiveness of the option offense will decline. 5. Tebow's inability to consistently make accurate passes allows opponents to focus on defending the run, which sets him apart from other dual-threat quarterbacks like Michael Vick, Vince Young, and Randall Cunningham, who were more proficient passers."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It is also considered a subcontinent of the Americas, which is the model used in nations that speak Romance languages. The reference to South America instead of other regions (like Latin America or the Southern Cone) has increased in the last decades due to changing geopolitical dynamics (in particular, the rise of Brazil). - Venezuela, officially the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, is a federal republic located on the northern coast of South America. It is bordered by Colombia on the west, Brazil on the south, Guyana on the east, and the islands of Trinidad and Tobago to the north-east. Venezuela's territory covers around with an estimated population . Venezuela is considered a state with extremely high biodiversity (currently ranks 7th in the world's list of nations with the most number of species), with habitats ranging from the Andes Mountains in the west to the Amazon Basin rain-forest in the south, via extensive \\"llanos\\" plains and Caribbean coast in the center and the Orinoco River Delta in the east. - The Haitian Revolution, was a successful anti-slavery and anti-colonial insurrection that took place in the former French colony of Saint-Domingue that lasted from 1791 until 1804. It affected the institution of slavery throughout the Americas. Self-liberated slaves destroyed slavery at home, fought to preserve their freedom, and with the collaboration of mulattoes, founded the sovereign state of Haiti. It led to the greatest slave uprising since Spartacus's unsuccessful revolt against the Roman Republic nearly 1,900 years prior. - Brazil, officially the Federative Republic of Brazil, is the largest country in both South America and Latin America.

His military and political acumen saved the gains of the first Black insurrection in November 1791. He first fought for the Spanish against the French; then for France against Spain and Britain; and finally, for Saint-Domingue (modern Haiti)'s colonial sovereignty against Napoleonic France. He then helped transform the insurgency into a revolutionary movement, which by 1800 had turned Saint-Domingue, the most prosperous slave colony of the time, into the first free colonial society to have explicitly rejected race as the basis of social ranking. - Saint-Domingue was a French colony on the Caribbean island of Hispaniola from 1659 to 1804.

Step 2: Researching about the topic We already know that sloths are typically found in tropical regions. Step 3: Evaluating the options Option 1: \\"basement\\" - This is not a natural habitat for any wild animals, including sloths. Sloths are not domestic creatures and they wouldn't naturally reside in basements. Option 2: \\"universe\\" - This is too broad and nonspecific. All living beings exist in the universe, but this doesn't provide any useful information about the specific places where sloths live. Option 3: \\"Amazonia\\" - While many sloths do live in the Amazon rainforest, not all sloths do. For example, there are also sloths living in Central America.

It occurred in about September 1848 at Avenue Range, a sheep station in the southeast of the Colony of South Australia. Information is scarce about the basic facts of the massacre, including the exact date and number of victims. A contemporary account of the massacre listed nine victims – three women, two teenage girls, three infants, and an \\"old man blind and infirm\\". Another account published by Christina Smith in 1880 gave the number of victims as eleven, and specified that they belonged to the Tanganekald people. Pastoralist James Brown and his overseer, a man named Eastwood, were suspected of committing the murders in retaliation for attacks on Brown's sheep. In January 1849, reports of the massacre reached Matthew Moorhouse, the Protector of Aborigines. He visited the district to investigate the claims, and based on his enquiries Brown was charged with the murders in March 1849. Proceedings against Brown began in June 1849 and continued in the Supreme Court of South Australia for several months, but were eventually abandoned. Some key witnesses, including Eastwood, either fled the colony or refused to cooperate with the investigation. There were also significant restrictions on the use of evidence given by Aboriginal witnesses, especially where a verdict could involve capital punishment. These legal hurdles and settler solidarity ensured the case did not go to trial, although the magistrate who committed him for trial told a friend that there was \\"little question of the butchery or the butcher\\". Although the details of the case were known for decades after the murders, distortions of the massacre eventually appeared in print and were embellished by local white and Aboriginal historians. Two key aspects of these later accounts were that Brown poisoned rather than shot the victims, and that he had undertaken an epic horse ride to Adelaide to establish an alibi.... answer the following question: What was the reason Brown was suspected of committing the murders?

The answer to the question: What is the first name of the person who turned to musical journalism after a failed student career in Oxford and London? is inside the article: Philip Arnold Heseltine (30 October 1894 – 17 December 1930), known by the pseudonym Peter Warlock, was a British composer and music critic. The Warlock name, which reflects Heseltine's interest in occult practices, was used for all his published musical works. He is best known as a composer of songs and other vocal music; he also achieved notoriety in his lifetime through his unconventional and often scandalous lifestyle. As a schoolboy at Eton College, Heseltine met the British composer Frederick Delius, with whom he formed a close friendship. After a failed student career in Oxford and London, Heseltine turned to musical journalism, while developing interests in folk-song and Elizabethan music. His first serious compositions date from around 1915. Following a period of inactivity, a positive and lasting influence on his work arose from his meeting in 1916 with the Dutch composer Bernard van Dieren; he also gained creative impetus from a year spent in Ireland, studying Celtic culture and language. On his return to England in 1918, Heseltine began composing songs in a distinctive, original style, while building a reputation as a combative and controversial music critic. During 1920–21 he edited the music magazine The Sackbut. His most prolific period as a composer came in the 1920s, when he was based first in Wales and later at Eynsford in Kent. Through his critical writings, published under his own name, Heseltine made a pioneering contribution to the scholarship of early music. In addition, he produced a full-length biography of Frederick Delius and wrote, edited, or otherwise assisted the production of several other books and pamphlets. Towards the end of his life, Heseltine became depressed by a loss of his creative inspiration. He died in his London flat of coal gas poisoning in 1930, probably by his own hand., can you guess it ?

Given the following context: By the 18th century, the menagerie was open to the public; admission cost three half-pence or the supply of a cat or dog to be fed to the lions. By the end of the century, that had increased to 9 pence. A particularly famous inhabitant was Old Martin, a large grizzly bear given to George III by the Hudson's Bay Company in 1811. An 1800 inventory also listed a tiger, leopards, a hyena, a large baboon, various types of monkeys, wolves and \\"other animals\\". By 1822, however, the collection included only a grizzly bear, an elephant and some birds. Additional animals were then introduced. In 1828 there were over 280 representing at least 60 species as the new keeper Alfred Copps was actively acquiring animals.After the death of George IV in 1830, a decision was made to close down the Menagerie. In 1831, most of the stock was moved to the London Zoo which had opened in 1828. The last of the animals left in 1835, relocated to Regent's Park. This decision was made after an incident, although sources vary as to the specifics: either a lion was accused of biting a soldier, or a sailor, Ensign Seymour, had been bitten by a monkey. The Menagerie buildings were removed in 1852 but the Keeper of the Royal Menagerie was entitled to use the Lion Tower as a house for life. Consequently, even though the animals had long since left the building, the tower was not demolished until the death of Copps, the last keeper, in 1853.In 1999, physical evidence of lion cages was found, one being 2x3 metres (6.5x10 feet) in size, very small for a lion that can grow to be 2.5 meters (approximately 8 feet) long. In 2008, the skulls of two male Barbary lions (now extinct in the wild) from northwest Africa were found in the moat area of the Tower. Radiocarbon tests dated them from 1280–1385 and 1420–1480.

Answer the following question: Information: - Untermensch (\\"underman\\", \\"sub-man\\", \\"subhuman\\"; plural: \\"Untermenschen\\") is a term that became infamous when the Nazis used it to describe \\"inferior people\\" often referred to as \\"the masses from the East\\", that is Jews, Roma, and Slavs (mainly ethnic Poles, Serbs, and later also Russians). The term was also applied to most Blacks, and persons of color, with some particular exceptions. Jewish people were to be exterminated in the Holocaust. Roma, and the physically and mentally disabled were also to be exterminated. According to the \\"Generalplan Ost\\", the Slavic population of East-Central Europe was to be reduced in part through mass murder, with a majority expelled to Asia or used slave labor in the Reich. A few populations deemed partially \\"Aryan\\" in origin were to be Germanized (see kidnapping of children by Nazi Germany). These concepts were an important part of the Nazi racial policy. While the Nazis were inconsistent in the implementation of their policy, (mostly implementing the Final Solution while implementing \\"Generalplan Ost\\") the democidal death toll was in tens of millions of victims. It is related to the concept of life unworthy of life, a more specific term which originally referred to the severely disabled involuntarily euthanised in Action T4, and was eventually applied to the extermination of the Jews. - Germany, officially the Federal Republic of Germany, is a federal parliamentary republic in central-western Europe. It includes 16 constituent states, covers an area of , and has a largely temperate seasonal climate. With about 82 million inhabitants, Germany is the most populous member state of the European Union. After the United States, it is the second most popular immigration destination in the world. Germany's capital and largest metropolis is Berlin. Other major cities include Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and Düsseldorf. - A minority group refers to a category of people differentiated from the social majority, those who hold the majority of positions of social power in a society, and it may be defined by law. Rather than a relational \\"social group\\", as the term would indicate, \\"minority group\\" refers to the above-described. The differentiation can be based on one or more observable human characteristics, including: ethnicity, race, religion, caste, gender, wealth, health or sexual orientation. Usage of the term is applied to various situations and civilizations within history despite its popular misassociation with a numerical, statistical minority (Barzilai, 2010). In the social sciences, the term \\"minority\\" is used to refer to categories of persons who hold fewer positions of social power. - A city is a large and permanent human settlement. Although there is no agreement on how a city is distinguished from a town in general English language meanings, many cities have a particular administrative, legal, or historical status based on local law. - The German extermination camps or death camps were designed and built by Nazi Germany during World War II (193945) to systematically kill millions of Jews, Slavs and others whom the Nazis considered \\"Untermenschen\\", primarily by gassing, but also in mass executions and through extreme work under starvation conditions. - Nazi Germany is the common English name for the period in German history from 1933 to 1945, when Germany was governed by a dictatorship under the control of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party (NSDAP). Under Hitler's rule, Germany was transformed into a fascist state in which the Nazi Party took totalitarian control over nearly all aspects of life. The official name of the state was \\"Deutsches Reich\\" from 1933 to 1943 and \\"Großdeutsches Reich\\" (\\"Greater German Reich\\") from 1943 to 1945. The period is also known under the names the Third Reich and the National Socialist Period (abbreviated as \\"NS-Zeit\\"). The Nazi regime came to an end after the Allied Powers defeated Germany in May 1945, ending World War II in Europe. - Slavs are the largest Indo-European ethno-linguistic group in Europe. They are native to Central Europe, Eastern Europe, Southeastern Europe, Northeastern Europe, North Asia and Central Asia. Slavs speak Slavic languages of the Balto-Slavic language group. From the early 6th century they spread to inhabit most of Central, Eastern and Southeastern Europe. - University over the Abyss is a book about the educational and cultural life in the Terezín ( German : Theresienstadt ) ghetto .

It is situated across a group of 117 small islands that are separated by canals and linked by bridges. These are located in the shallow Venetian Lagoon, an enclosed bay that lies between the mouths of the Po and the Piave Rivers. Parts of Venice are renowned for the beauty of their settings, their architecture, and artwork. The lagoon and a part of the city are listed as a World Heritage Site. - A ghetto is a part of a city in which members of a minority group live, especially because of social, legal, or economic pressure. The term was originally used in Venice to describe the part of the city to which Jews were restricted and segregated. The term has been applied in various contexts. - World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier. It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities.

Write the answer: Who described his troops – the British army - as ‘the scum of the earth’?","completion":"Arthur Wellesley, the 1st Duke of Wellington, is the person who described his troops – the British army - as 'the scum of the earth.' Born in Dublin, Ireland, on May 1, 1769, Wellesley went on to become one of Britain's most successful and prominent military figures, eventually leading the country to victory against Napoleon Bonaparte at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815. The famous phrase 'scum of the earth' was used by Wellington in a letter to Earl Bathurst, the British Secretary of State for war and the colonies, dated 12 August 1813, during the Peninsular War. The Peninsular War was a conflict fought by the allies of Spain, Portugal, and the United Kingdom against the First French Empire led by Napoleon from 1808 to 1814. This war is known for its brutal nature, high casualty rates, and constant battle between the forces. In the full context of the letter, Wellington was expressing both his frustration with the lack of discipline within the ranks and his admiration for the soldiers' resilience and capabilities in battle. The actual quote reads: \\"We have in the service the scum of the earth as common soldiers; but these very men can and do act well as soldiers, when they are fairly brought to face the enemy.\\" The purpose of this statement was to reveal the flaws and potential underlying qualities of his troops. Despite Wellington's harsh and derogatory description of his soldiers, it's essential to note that he was a demanding leader and an excellent military strategist. This stern manner and realistic view of the situation drove his troops to perform extraordinary feats on the battlefield, ultimately turning them into one of the most successful fighting forces of the time. While Wellington initially scorned his troops for their backgrounds, he later recognized their ability to perform under pressure and acknowledged the tremendous sacrifices they made during the Peninsular War. It could be argued that this quote, as harsh as it may seem, served as a catalyst for the British army to rise above their perceived shortcomings and become the valiant force necessary for victory against the French Empire. In conclusion, Arthur Wellesley, the 1st Duke of Wellington, described the British army as 'the scum of the earth' at the time of the Peninsular War. His critical statement reflects his realistic perspective on the military personnel within the ranks, but it also highlights the potential for growth and change. Under his guidance, the British army managed to overcome its flaws and achieve success against Napoleon in the Peninsular War and ultimately at Waterloo."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Protests can take many different forms, from individual statements to mass demonstrations. Protesters may organize a protest as a way of publicly making their opinions heard in an attempt to influence public opinion or government policy, or they may undertake direct action in an attempt to directly enact desired changes themselves. Where protests are part of a systematic and peaceful campaign to achieve a particular objective, and involve the use of pressure as well as persuasion, they go beyond mere protest and may be better described as cases of civil resistance or nonviolent resistance. - In July 1972, William Whitelaw, the British government's Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, granted Special Category Status (SCS) to all prisoners convicted of Troubles-related offences. This had been one of the conditions set by the Provisional IRA when they negotiated a meeting with the British Government to discuss a truce. - The blanket protest was part of a five-year protest during the Troubles by Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) and Irish National Liberation Army (INLA) prisoners held in the Maze prison (also known as \\"Long Kesh\\") in Northern Ireland. The republican prisoners' status as political prisoners, known as Special Category Status, had begun to be phased out in 1976. Among other things, this meant that they would now be required to wear prison uniforms like ordinary convicts. The prisoners refused to accept that they had been administratively designated as ordinary criminals, and refused to wear the prison uniform. - The dirty protest (also called the no wash protest) was part of a five-year protest during the Troubles by Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) and Irish National Liberation Army (INLA) prisoners held in the Maze Prison (also known as \\"Long Kesh\\") and a protest at Armagh Women's Prison in Northern Ireland. - Patrick \`\` Paddy '' Agnew ( born 8 March 1955 ) is a former IRA volunteer and was elected to Dáil Éireann during the 1981 Irish hunger strike . Agnew was born in Dundalk , County Louth , Ireland in 1955 . His grandfather , was also an Irish republican and an internee during the Irish War of Independence . Agnew was imprisoned at Portlaoise , Mountjoy , Crumlin Road and the H - Blocks of Long Kesh . He was involved in the blanket protest in the H - Blocks . Although he was not on hunger strike , he was elected as a Teachta Dála ( TD ) for the Louth constituency at the 1981 general election , topping the poll . He did not take his seat . This was along with Kieran Doherty , who was elected in Cavan -- Monaghan and died on hunger strike . Agnew was released from prison in 2000 and joined the Gerard Halpenny Sinn Féin cumann in Dundalk , where he remains an active member of the party . - A hunger strike is a method of non-violent resistance or pressure in which participants fast as an act of political protest, or to provoke feelings of guilt in others, usually with the objective to achieve a specific goal, such as a policy change. Most hunger strikers will take liquids but not solid food. - The Troubles is the common name for the ethno-nationalist conflict in Northern Ireland during the late 20th century. Also known internationally as the Northern Ireland conflict, it is sometimes described as a \\"guerrilla war\\" or \\"low-level war\\". The conflict began in the late 1960s and is usually deemed to have ended with the Good Friday \\"Belfast\\" Agreement of 1998. Although the Troubles mainly took place in Northern Ireland, violence spilled over at times into parts of the Republic of Ireland, England and mainland Europe. - The 1981 Irish hunger strike was the culmination of a five-year protest during The Troubles by Irish republican prisoners in Northern Ireland. The protest began as the blanket protest in 1976, when the British government withdrew Special Category Status for convicted paramilitary prisoners. In 1978, after a number of attacks on prisoners leaving their cells to \\"slop out\\", the dispute escalated into the dirty protest, where prisoners refused to leave their cells to wash and covered the walls of their cells with excrement.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Please answer a question about the following article about Capacitor: Capacitors, especially ceramic capacitors, and older designs such as paper capacitors, can absorb sound waves resulting in a microphonic effect. Vibration moves the plates, causing the capacitance to vary, in turn inducing AC current. Some dielectrics also generate piezoelectricity. The resulting interference is especially problematic in audio applications, potentially causing feedback or unintended recording. In the reverse microphonic effect, the varying electric field between the capacitor plates exerts a physical force, moving them as a speaker. This can generate audible sound, but drains energy and stresses the dielectric and the electrolyte, if any.

Write an article based on this \\"A Conservative MP has called on Labour leader Ed Miliband to publish documents relating to his share of his parents' former home.\\"","completion":"Title: Conservative MP Requests Labour Leader Ed Miliband to Publish Documents Concerning Parental Home Shares Introduction: A recent development in the political scene has created quite a stir as a Conservative MP urges Labour leader Ed Miliband to publicly disclose the documents relating to his share of his parents' former home. The call for transparency comes as the MP demands greater clarity on the ownership and financial aspects of the property. Context and Background: Ed Miliband, the leader of the Labour Party, has been scrutinized for his share in his parents' erstwhile home, which he inherited along with his brother, David Miliband. The Conservative MP has raised questions on how Ed and David have managed the inherited property and its financial implications. Step 1 - The Conservative MP's stance: The Conservative MP believes that making these documents public will offer clarity in terms of Ed Miliband's financial transparency, especially in respect to his inheritance. The MP argues that political leaders, like Miliband, should be held to a higher standard of openness to maintain public trust and accountability. Step 2 - Ed Miliband's response: Pending any statement or action from the Labour leader, it remains to be seen if Ed Miliband will submit to the demand and provide the requested information. Compliance with this request would undoubtedly demonstrate commitment to transparency, while reluctance to provide such documents may result in speculation and doubt regarding the leader's integrity. Step 3 - Implications for the Labour Party: If Labour leader Ed Miliband chooses to publish the requested documents, it could set a strong precedent for financial transparency and ethical conduct within the party. This decision could potentially sway public opinion in favor of the Labour Party, should they be perceived as upholding high standards of accountability. Step 4 - Potential backlash: However, releasing these documents may also lead to criticism and scrutiny of Miliband's personal affairs, which may detract from the political goals and agenda of the Labour Party. Opponents may exploit this information to further their own political aims. Step 5 - Public reaction: The public's response to this situation will largely depend on how both the Labour leader and the Conservative MP handle the matter. Transparency and accountability in politics are crucial factors in shaping public perception, and it remains to be seen whether this particular demand will be met and how it will influence the electorate's trust in Miliband as their leader. Conclusion: As political leaders are held to higher standards of ethical conduct and openness, the call for Ed Miliband to publish documents related to his parents' former home is an important development in maintaining trust and accountability in the political system. Whether or not Miliband chooses to comply with this request may significantly impact his image, and by extension, the Labour Party's agenda."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He worked in the tradition of Alonso Sánchez Coello and Juan Pantoja de la Cruz . His death opened the road to court for the young painter Diego Velázquez from Sevilla . - Jan van Eyck (before c. 1390 9 July 1441) was a Flemish/Netherlandish painter active in Bruges. He is often considered one of the founders of Early Netherlandish painting school and one of the most significant representatives of Northern Renaissance art. The few surviving records of his early life indicate that he was born c. 13801390, most likely in Maaseik. He took employment in the Hague as painter and \\"Valet de chambre\\" with John III the Pitiless, ruler of Holland and Hainaut in the Hague around 1422, when he was already a master painter with workshop assistants. After John's death in 1425 he was employed in Lille as court painter to Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy, until 1429 before moving to Bruges, where he lived until his death. He was highly regarded by Philip, and undertook a number of diplomatic visits abroad, including to Lisbon in 1428 to explore the possibility of a marriage contract between the duke and Isabella of Portugal. - The House of Habsburg, also called House of Hapsburg, or House of Austria, was one of the most influential royal houses of Europe. The throne of the Holy Roman Empire was continuously occupied by the Habsburgs between 1438 and 1740. The house also produced emperors and kings of the Kingdom of Bohemia, Kingdom of England (\\"Jure uxoris\\" King), Kingdom of France (Queen consort), Kingdom of Germany, Kingdom of Hungary, Kingdom of Croatia, Second Mexican Empire, Kingdom of Ireland (\\"Jure uxoris\\" King), Kingdom of Portugal, and Habsburg Spain, as well as rulers of several Dutch and Italian principalities. From the sixteenth century, following the reign of Charles V, the dynasty was split between its Austrian and Spanish branches. Although they ruled distinct territories, they nevertheless maintained close relations and frequently intermarried. - A portrait is a painting, photograph, sculpture, or other artistic representation of a person, in which the face and its expression is predominant. The intent is to display the likeness, personality, and even the mood of the person. For this reason, in photography a portrait is generally not a snapshot, but a composed image of a person in a still position. A portrait often shows a person looking directly at the painter or photographer, in order to most successfully engage the subject with the viewer. - Alonso Sánchez Coello (1531 8 August 1588) was a Spanish portrait painter of the Spanish Renaissance. He is mainly known for his portrait paintings executed in a style, which combines the objectivity of the Flemish tradition with the sensuality of Venetian painting. He was court painter to Philip II. - Diego Rodríguez de Silva y Velázquez (; baptized on June 6, 1599August 6, 1660) was a Spanish painter, the leading artist in the court of King Philip IV, and one of the most important painters of the Spanish Golden Age. He was an individualistic artist of the contemporary Baroque period, important as a portrait artist. In addition to numerous renditions of scenes of historical and cultural significance, he painted scores of portraits of the Spanish royal family, other notable European figures, and commoners, culminating in the production of his masterpiece \\"Las Meninas\\" (1656). - The Baroque (or ) is often thought of as a period of artistic style that used exaggerated motion and clear, easily interpreted detail to produce drama, tension, exuberance, and grandeur in sculpture, painting, architecture, literature, dance, theater, and music. The style began around 1600 in Rome and Italy, and spread to most of Europe. - Juan Pantoja de La Cruz (1553 26 October 1608) was a Spanish painter, one of the best representatives of the Spanish school of court painters. He worked for Philip II and Philip III. The Museo del Prado contains examples of his severe portraiture style. - Philip III of Spain (14 April 1578 31 March 1621) was King of Spain (as \\"Philip III\\" in Castile and \\"Philip II\\" in Aragon) and Portugal. A member of the House of Habsburg, Philip III was born in Madrid to King Philip II of Spain and his fourth wife and niece Anna, the daughter of Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian II and Maria of Spain. Philip III later married his cousin Margaret of Austria, sister of Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor. - The Prado Museum is the main Spanish national art museum, located in central Madrid. It features one of the world's finest collections of European art, dating from the 12th century to the early 20th century, based on the former Spanish Royal Collection, and unquestionably the best single collection of Spanish art. Founded as a museum of paintings and sculpture in 1819, it also contains important collections of other types of works. El Prado is one of the most visited sites in the world, and is considered one of the greatest museums of art in the world. The numerous works by Francisco de Goya, the single most extensively represented artist, as well as by Diego Velázquez, El Greco, Titian, Peter Paul Rubens and Hieronymus Bosch are some of the highlights of the collection. - A court painter was an artist who painted for the members of a royal or noble family, sometimes on a fixed salary and on an exclusive basis where the artist was not supposed to undertake other work. Especially in the late Middle Ages, they were often given the office of valet de chambre. Usually they were given a salary and formal title, and often a pension for life, though arrangements were highly variable. For the artist, a court appointment had the advantage of freeing them from the restriction of local painters' guilds, although in the Middle Ages and Renaissance they also often had to spend large amounts of time doing decorative work about the palace, and creating temporary works for court entertainments and displays. In England the role of Serjeant Painter was set up for this, leaving the \\"King's painter\\" (and the queen's) free to paint mostly portraits. See category of \\"Italian art collectors\\" for lists that included non-aristocratic patrons. Some artists, like Jan van Eyck or Diego Velázquez, were used in other capacities at court, as diplomats, functionaries, or administrators. - Valet de chambre, or \\"varlet de chambre\\", was a court appointment introduced in the late Middle Ages, common from the 14th century onwards. Royal households had many persons appointed at any time. While some valets simply waited on the patron, or looked after his clothes and other personal needs, itself potentially a powerful and lucrative position, others had more specialized functions. At the most prestigious level it could be akin to a monarch or ruler's personal secretary, as was the case of Anne de Montmorency at the court of Francis I of France. For noblemen pursuing a career as courtiers, like Étienne de Vesc, it was a common early step on the ladder to higher offices. - The Spanish Golden Age (, \\"Golden Century\\") is a period of flourishing in arts and literature in Spain, coinciding with the political rise of the Spanish Habsburg dynasty. \\"El Siglo de Oro\\" does not imply precise dates and is usually considered to have lasted longer than an actual century. It begins no earlier than 1492, with the end of the \\"Reconquista\\" (Reconquest), the sea voyages of Christopher Columbus to the New World, and the publication of Antonio de Nebrija's \\"Gramática de la lengua castellana\\" (Grammar of the Castilian Language). Politically, it ends no later than 1659, with the Treaty of the Pyrenees, ratified between France and Habsburg Spain. The last great writer of the period, Pedro Calderón de la Barca, died in 1681, and his death usually is considered the end of \\"El Siglo de Oro\\" in the arts and literature. - In the history of Europe, the Middle Ages or medieval period lasted from the 5th to the 15th century. It began with the fall of the Western Roman Empire and merged into the Renaissance and the Age of Discovery. The Middle Ages is the middle period of the three traditional divisions of Western history: classical antiquity, the medieval period, and the modern period. The medieval period is itself subdivided into the Early, High, and Late Middle Ages. - Las Meninas (Spanish for The Ladies-in-Waiting) is a 1656 painting in the Museo del Prado in Madrid, by Diego Velázquez, the leading artist of the Spanish Golden Age. Its complex and enigmatic composition raises questions about reality and illusion, and creates an uncertain relationship between the viewer and the figures depicted. Because of these complexities, \\"Las Meninas\\" has been one of the most widely analyzed works in Western painting. - Ferdinand II (9 July 1578 15 February 1637), a member of the House of Habsburg, was Holy Roman Emperor (16191637), King of Bohemia (16171619, 16201637), and King of Hungary (16181625). His acts started the Thirty Years' War. Ferdinand's aim, as a zealous Catholic, was to restore Catholicism as the only religion in the Empire and to suppress Protestantism. - The Spanish Renaissance refers to a movement in Spain, emerging from the Italian Renaissance in Italy during the 14th century, that spread to Spain during the 15th and 16th centuries. - Philip II of Spain (21 May 1527 13 September 1598), called \\"the Prudent\\" (el Prudente), was King of Spain (155698), King of Portugal (158198, as \\"Philip I\\", \\"Filipe I\\"), King of Naples and Sicily (both from 1554), and during his marriage to Queen Mary I (155458) \\"jure uxoris\\" King of England and Ireland. He was also Duke of Milan. From 1555, he was lord of the Seventeen Provinces of the Netherlands. What entity does 'rodrigo de villandrando ' has the relation 'place of death' with?

Cheaper farmland and proximity to population centres are fueling growth in Amish colonies in The Empire State, a study out of Pennsylvania shows. The Amish, many of them from Ohio or Pennsylvania, have set up 10 new settlements in New York since 2010 - growth that doubles other states. That population has grown by nearly a third in two years, to 13,000. Amish communities are currently in 28 U.S. states, but more communities are popping up in New York over the last few years. The first New York Amish districts were established in the Conewango Valley in 1949, but in-migration slowed until about 10 years ago. As recently as 1991, there were just 3,900 Amish in the state. Elizabethtown College professor Don Kraybill, who directed the study, said the movement has been driven by productive and underpriced land. Factors such as weather, growing season and congenial neighbours and local officials have also contributed to the population boom. In the 1980s and 90s Kentucky played that role for the Amish, while more recently it was Wisconsin, Mr Kraybill said. New York has lower land prices in rural areas than Pennsylvania and Ohio, states that together account for about half of the U.S. Amish population. New York also has more areas of rural isolation, according to Mr Kraybill.'If you want to get away from the suburbs and the high-tech world, there are more places to hide in New York.'New York, Kentucky, Illinois and Kansas have experienced the largest net gain in Amish households since 2006, the study found. The largest net losers were Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Delaware and Ohio, although states with large Amish populations can grow even if they lose households because existing families normally have many children. The Amish emigrated to Pennsylvania from Switzerland and Germany about 300 years ago. Today, the nationwide Amish population totals about 261,000. Nearly all descend from a group of about 5,000 a century ago. 'Empire State of Mind': An Amish man works in the field in Centerville, N.Y., a town with an established Amish community. While their Christian beliefs and practices can vary from settlement to settlement, or from church to church, they were defined for study purposes as people who use horse-and-buggy transportation, and speak a dialect of Pennsylvania German or Swiss German. Mr Kraybill said: 'It's remarkable that a horse-and-buggy people like the Amish are thriving in the midst of high-tech, Twitter America.' Some areas of concentrated Amish populations in Pennsylvania, including Lancaster County, have experienced overall residential and commercial growth that can leave little room for the Amish way of life, so they make the decision to hire a tractor-trailer and head for someplace more remote. Large Amish families sometimes move into new areas to find farmland for the younger generations, while in other cases they are more motivated by a desire to preserve traditional aspects of their family life and to resolve disputes about church rules, said Karen Johnson-Weiner, an anthropology professor at the State University of New York at Potsdam. Ms Johnson-Weiner, whose book on the state's Amish was published last year, said: 'The Amish moving to New York are going to be, for the most part, very conservative. That means they're not going to be so willing to compromise or fit in.' The Amish have been involved in disputes in New York over zoning, construction practices and electronic filing of sales taxes, while some areas have capitalized on local Amish communities for tourism purposes. Ms Johnson-Weiner said some new Amish arrivals are buying land that has not been farmed since the earlier decades of the 20th century. 'The families farming those farms are ready to retire and there aren't any young people ready to take the farm over, so you sell to the Amish,' she said. 'They're revitalising farming, I would say, in many of those areas.' Mr Kraybill said Amish migration in general often consists of younger couples looking for cheaper farmland or new locations to set up small microenterprises. It can cost just a few thousand dollars to start manufacturing furniture or quilts, for example, he said. Other Amish migrants can be multigenerational families moving together so they can afford to buy several adjacent farms at the same time. Mr Kraybill said prime farmland in Lancaster County currently costs about 15,000 an acre, a daunting challenge for a young farmer, along with the expense of buying livestock and farm equipment. That makes land prices of 2,000 an acre in other states very attractive. Pennsylvania had the nation's largest Amish population in the new survey, just over 61,000, with Ohio a close second, about 400 people behind. Indiana ranked third, 46,000, Wisconsin fourth, 16,000, and New York fifth. New York, New York: Map shows new Amish communities in The Empire State. What are highlight points for this article?","completion":"Sure, let's break it down into simple points: 1. The Amish population is growing a lot in the state of New York, much faster than in other states. This is because farm land in New York is cheaper and also because the Amish people can live near to where most people live. 2. There were just 10 new Amish settlements in New York in 2010 and now, there's about 13,000 Amish people living there! 3. The Amish can be found in 28 states in America, but more and more they are choosing to make their homes in New York. 4. The first Amish communities in New York were formed way back in 1949 in a place called Conewango Valley. But more Amish people didn't really start moving to New York until about 10 years ago. 5. The study that found out all this information was led by a man named Don Kraybill, and he said that a big reason for the Amish moving to New York is because the farming land there is good and doesn't cost too much money. 6. New York, Kentucky, Illinois and Kansas have seen the most increase in Amish households since 2006. But even in states like Pennsylvania and Ohio, where many Amish families have been leaving, the Amish population can still grow because Amish families often have lots of kids. 7. Most Amish people in America can trace their family history back to a group of about 5000 people that moved over from Switzerland and Germany about 300 years ago. 8. One important thing to know about the Amish people is that they prefer to live in a traditional way - they use horses and buggies to get around and speak in old types of German languages."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

We have one sweeper hired for whole society to collect waste and sweep out dust from our society roads. BTW her name is Hira masi (my brother calls her diamond masi :p). And she is extremely poor and she lives in those slums where almost nothing is available. She earns 50/100 per house each month. (Source) As she is extremely poor, all the society people help her a lot. From giving 2 times food to giving clothes and giving bonuses on special occasion as much as Rs. 1000, they almost help her in each and every aspect. And this is by far the most incredible thing our society has which is humanity. But the twist comes here. On the other side, she is extremely cunning. She rarely cleans the road, takes rarely wastes from homes, gives excuses that she is sick and does not come for work, etc. She does not do her work properly. She also request money from us saying that her family members are ill as much as Rs 10000, even if they are not. So this thing was discussed in our meeting and there some decided to continue her as she was very poor and some decided to leave her. But my mom today told me a great thing- If a person is doing her work seriously, then we will surely help him in every way, even if it is a matter of money, but the person who is not sincere and not doing work properly, then sometimes we have to step back from humanity and be strict. If the person is honest and he is REALLY in need of help, we should definitely help them. But the person who just fakes that he is in need, we should be strict/ignore them, else they will not do any work, and just simply rely on us. Sometimes, being strict and giving up humanity will make the person grow. Question: The author probably believes that Answer: (i) Daimond masi is lazy. (ii) Diamond masi is a good worker.

The incident raises questions about the responsibilities of public figures and their families and serves as a cautionary tale for others in handling personal relationships and finances. Body: The son of renowned chef Marco Pierre White has recently admitted to the misuse of his ex-girlfriend's bank card, making several unauthorized purchases that amounted to £2,500. The disclosure highlights the ongoing issue of financial abuse in relationships, as well as shedding light on the potential pitfalls of a life in the public eye. While the misuse of a partner's bank card without consent is never acceptable, it is even more shocking when committed by someone with such a high-profile father. This case serves as a reminder that even the children of famous individuals are not immune to the temptations and challenges that anyone else might face in navigating personal relationships and financial matters. One of the critical aspects of this case is the misuse of trust between two individuals in a relationship. While it can be challenging to maintain privacy and individuality in one's finances, especially when finances are shared, honesty and communication are essential. In this case, the son's actions amounted to a severe breach of trust, as he used his ex-girlfriend's bank card to make unauthorized purchases. It is crucial for individuals to recognize the importance of financial responsibility, especially when it comes to handling someone else's sensitive information. In addition, there are legal consequences of financial abuse, and the repercussions of such actions can be detrimental to both parties involved. Financial abuse is a pervasive problem, and this high-profile example has shed light on the critical nature of the issue. In many cases, it is essential to educate individuals about the dangers of misusing someone else's bank information or taking advantage of their trust. Conclusion: As the son of celebrity chef Marco Pierre White faces the fallout of his careless actions, others can learn from this unfortunate incident. The importance of trust and financial responsibility cannot be overstated, and those in the public eye should be held to the same standards as anyone else. The misuse of a partner's bank card can lead to legal troubles and fractured relationships - consequences that are both emotionally devastating and often challenging to rectify. In a world where trust is a vital currency, even the children of well-known individuals must recognize the consequences of their actions and endeavor to make better choices in the future."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The couple had been denied a marriage license by Rowan County Clerk of Courts Kim Davis. (Ty Wright/Getty Images) The Kentucky county clerk who landed in jail after she refused to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples has filed an emergency request for an exemption from the requirement to authorize gay marriages. Kim Davis, a 49-year-old legal clerk from Rowan County, drew a national spotlight when she refused to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples because she said it violated her religious beliefs. After the Supreme Court decision to legalize same-sex marriage in late June, Kentucky Gov. Steven Beshear (D) mandated county clerks to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples. Davis refused to comply and was sued by couples whose marriages she had refused to authorize. She was incarcerated Thursday for contempt of court. “As a prisoner of her conscience, Davis continues to request a simple accommodation and exemption from the Governor,” Mat Staver, founder and chairman of the Christian legal organization Liberty Counsel, said in a statement on Monday. In the new court documents, filed in the Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit, Davis’s attorneys argue that the mandate is a violation of her right to free speech. They add that Davis would find it acceptable if marriage licenses are issued to same-sex couples without her name. 1 of 19 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × The heated scene in Kentucky after clerk refuses to issue same-sex marriage licenses View Photos Rowan County Clerk Kim Davis is booked and jailed after repeatedly refusing to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples.

They have also appealed the contempt order that sent her to jail. In a statement, Davis has explained her actions: “To issue a marriage license which conflicts with God’s definition of marriage, with my name affixed to the certificate, would violate my conscience. It is not a light issue for me. It is a Heaven or Hell decision,” she said. Last week, after federal Judge David L. Bunning jailed Davis for contempt of court, deputy clerks began to issue marriage licenses. “It appears that the citizens of Rowan County will now have access to all the services from the clerk’s office to which they are entitled,” Beshear said in a statement. “Again, the legislature has placed the authority to issue marriage licenses squarely on county clerks by statute, and I have no legal authority to relieve them of their statutory duty by executive order.” ||||| (CNN) Kim Davis broke down in tears, then beamed as she stood before a cheering crowd after her release from jail Tuesday.

Davis, who said issuing the licenses would violate her conscience and go against her religion, plans to return to work in Rowan County, Kentucky, this week and won't resign from her post, attorney Mat Staver said. Asked by a reporter whether her stay in jail was worth it, Davis smiled and nodded. But she didn't speak directly about the case, and a key question remains unanswered: When she goes back to work, what will she do when she gets there? The judge who issued an order releasing her Tuesday attached a caveat Davis may not be willing to accept. U.S. District Judge David Bunning ordered that Davis be released from jail -- five days after he sent her there -- saying he was satisfied that her deputies fulfilled their obligations to give marriage licenses to same-sex couples in her absence. But Bunning's new order says Davis cannot interfere with her deputies issuing marriage licenses to all legally eligible couples. That means Davis could find herself behind bars again if she does anything to prevent the marriages from taking place, CNN Senior Legal Analyst Jeffrey Toobin said. \\"If Ms. Davis stops them from issuing licenses, then we are right back where we started,\\" Toobin said. \\"And Judge Bunning has made it quite clear, he will lock her back up.\\" 'She's not going to violate her conscience' Davis previously said she will not authorize her office to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples if her name remains on the certificate. Bunning's order makes no mention of revising the licenses to accommodate Davis, who says issuing a license with her name on it would violate her Christian convictions against same-sex marriage. One of Davis' attorneys said Bunning hasn't resolved anything. \\"We've asked for a simple solution -- get her name and authority off the certificate. The judge could order that,\\" Staver said. Staver didn't directly answer questions about whether Davis would stop same-sex couples in her county from getting marriage licenses when she returns to work. \\"She loves God, she loves people, she loves her work, and she will not betray any of those three,\\" Staver said. \\"She'll do her job good.

(AP) — Presidential candidate and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee will join protesters at a Tuesday rally outside the jail where a Kentucky clerk is locked in a cell over her refusal to issue marriage licenses to gay couples. This Thursday, Aug. 3, 2015 photo made available by the Carter County Detention Center shows Kim Davis. The Rowan County, Ky. clerk went to jail Thursday for refusing to issue marriage licenses to gay... (Associated Press) Huckabee plans a private meeting with Rowan County Clerk Kim Davis, who was jailed by a federal judge Thursday after defying several court orders. Her lawyers spent Labor Day weekend filing appeals in an effort to force her release, but she remains there on a contempt charge. Huckabee, a former Baptist minister who often reaches out to religious conservatives, says Davis is simply exercising her religious freedom by denying the marriage licenses. Davis' jailing offers the many Republican presidential candidates an opportunity to appeal to the GOP's evangelical Christian wing, which opposes same-sex marriage and casts Davis' imprisonment as an issue of religious freedom. Not all the Republican White House hopefuls see it Huckabee's way, however. Huckabee's visit comes a day after Davis filed yet another appeal in the hopes of being released. Her attorneys asked for an order to have Kentucky Gov. Steve Beshear accommodate Davis' \\"religious conviction,\\" and not force her to grant licenses to gay couples. The same request was denied last month by U.S. District Judge David Bunning, who jailed Davis. If the latest request is granted by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, Beshear would have to allow Davis to remove her name and title from official marriage certificates issued in Rowan County. By doing that, Davis would not be sanctioning any same-sex unions and her conscience would be satisfied, her attorneys say. Her lawyers have also appealed Bunning's ruling that landed her in jail. On Monday, about 30 protesters lined the sidewalk outside Bunning's home in Fort Thomas, Kentucky, carrying signs that read \\"Free Kim Davis.\\" Fort Thomas Police Lt. Casey Kilgore said the group gathered around 2 p.m., and the protest stretched on for several hours. Davis, an apostolic Christian, says gay marriage is a sin. She also says it would be a sin for her to issue a marriage license to a same-sex couple because the licenses are issued under her authority. She tried in vain to have state lawmakers change the law as a legal challenge to Kentucky's same-sex marriage ban wound its way through the federal appeals court. Davis stopped issuing all marriage licenses in June the day after the U.S. Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriage nationwide. Two gay couples and two straight couples sued her. Bunning ordered Davis to issue the licenses, and the Supreme Court upheld his ruling. But Davis still refused to do it, saying she could not betray her conscience or God. Bunning ruled Thursday that Davis was in contempt of court and sent her to jail. Her deputy clerks — except for her son, Nathan Davis — then issued marriage licenses to gay couples Friday with Davis behind bars. ||||| Write a summary.","completion":"Kim Davis is a lady who works at a place called the Rowan County Courthouse in Kentucky.

However, Kim didn't want to give those marriage licenses to same-gender couples because she believed it was against her religion. So, she went to jail for not doing her job properly. Now, she has asked the people in charge to let her keep her job, but not have to put her name on the marriage licenses for same-gender couples.

Question: SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — The U.S. election calendar could be a key factor in determining the scope and timing of a potential deal to end the North Korean nuclear program. Planning is progressing for both the upcoming summit between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in at the end of April and the expected meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim in late May or early June. President Trump said Tuesday that there had been talks at “extremely high levels” between his administration and the North Korean government. Later it was reported that Mike Pompeo, the director of the Central Intelligence Agency and a secretary of state nominee, met recently with Kim Jong Un in Pyongyang. Trump also noted the talks have been marked by “a lot of goodwill” and that “there has been a major change in terms of North Korea’s behavior,” since Kim’s Olympic outreach this year, in which he sent a large delegation to the Pyeongchang Winter games in South Korea, suspended nuclear and missile tests, and expressed a willingness to engage in denuclearization talks. The turn toward diplomacy has reduced, for now, the potential for conflict over the North’s accelerated efforts last year to develop an operational nuclear-armed intercontinental ballistic missile that can reach the U.S. mainland. The North Korean leader’s decision to engage in denuclearization talks was likely motivated by both Trump’s “maximum pressure” campaign, which increased sanctions and the threat of military action against the North, and by South Korean President Moon’s reassuring outreach efforts to improve inter-Korean relations. Trump’s motivation in pursuing a nuclear deal with North Korea, in addition to resolving a growing national security threat, could also have a political component. According to North Korea analysts at the Sejong Institute in South Korea, the Trump administration is likely calculating how achieving such an agreement could help boost the president’s chances for re-election in 2020. “If I were Trump, I...

Answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Climbers at the top of Mount Everest, the world's highest peak, will now be able to make video calls and surf the Internet on their mobile phones, a Nepalese telecom group claims. Ncell, a branch company of Swedish phone giant TeliaSonera, said on Thursday it had set up a high-speed third-generation (3G) phone base station at an altitude of 5,200 metres in the Everest region. \\"Today we made the world's highest video call from Mount Everest base camp successfully. The coverage of the network will reach up to the peak of Mount Everest,\\" Ncell Nepal chief Pasi Koistinen told reporters in Kathmandu. The installation will also help tens of thousands of tourists and hikers who visit the world's highest mountain every year. Climbers who reached its 8,848-metre peak previously depended on expensive satellite phones and a voice-only network set up by China Mobile in 2007 on the Chinese side of the mountain. \\"This is a great milestone for mobile communications as the 3G high speed Internet will bring faster, more affordable telecommunication services from the world's tallest mountain,\\" said Lars Nyberg, chief executive of TeliaSonera, which owns 80 percent of Ncell. The 3G services will be fast enough to make video calls and use the Internet, said the company, which also claimed the world's lowest 3G base at 1,400 metres below sea level in a mine in Europe. Despite the installation in Mount Everest, telecom services cover less than one-third of the 28 million people of Nepal, one of the poorest countries in the world. TeliaSonera said it planned to invest 100 million in the next year to ensure that mobile coverage increases to more than 90 per cent of the Himalayan nation's population. The 3G network on Mount Everest puts TeliaSonera ahead of state-controlled Nepal Telecom, Indian-owned United Telecom and China Mobile. Around 3,000 people have climbed to the Everest summit since Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay became the first people to conquer the peak in 1953.

I have to have 2 more sessions until she 'll start correcting the neck problem again . I would definately suggest acupuncture for anybody experiencing severe muscle pain . What will happen if the neck pain does not immediately go away ?","completion":"If the neck pain does not immediately go away after acupuncture sessions, it's crucial to understand that the effect of such treatments can be cumulative and gradual. Step 1: Maintain Positive Outlook First, it's important to remain positive and patient. Acupuncture is not always a quick fix and sometimes several sessions are needed for the body to begin responding positively to the treatment. Step 2: Continuous Monitoring I would then recommend continuously monitoring your symptoms. Keep track of the frequency, intensity, and location of the neck pain. This information will be useful for the acupuncturist to adjust the treatment plan if necessary. Step 3: Communicate with Your Acupuncturist Communication with your acupuncturist is vital. Share your concerns about the persistence of your neck pain. They can provide reassurance, adjust your treatment plan, and keep track of your progress. Step 4: Seek Advice from Other Health Professionals If after several sessions, the neck pain does not improve, consider seeking advice from other health professionals such as chiropractors or physiotherapists who can provide alternative treatments. Step 5: Consider Alternative Treatments At this stage, your healthcare provider might suggest other treatment options such as physical therapy or neck exercises that can help to alleviate the pain. Remember, the body heals at its own pace and acupuncture often works best as part of an integrated approach to healthcare. So even if the desired immediate results aren't apparent right after the acupuncture sessions, it doesn't necessarily denote failure. It's important to stay patient and persistent, while bridging open communication with your acupuncturist and other healthcare professionals."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The jaguar just sometimes went out of its cave with its \\"girlfriend\\" for a while before it came back to its house again' It is normal for the jaguar to be lazy here.

But another camp is urging everyone to calm down because the FCC still has the potential to keep ISPs in check: Yes, the court \\"vacated the heart of the FCC’s open Internet rules,\\" writes law professor John Blevins in the Washington Post, but it did not curb \\"the FCC’s ability to act in the future. Specifically, it concluded that the FCC could regulate Internet providers under a statute known as Section 706, which authorizes the FCC to take various steps to promote broadband deployment.\\" In fact, \\"the court may have handed the FCC—and the public—a victory that goes well beyond network neutrality.\\" Much of the decision deals with how the FCC classifies ISPs, as \\"information services\\" rather than \\"telecommunication services,\\" writes Jon Terbush at the Week. \\"It's not that the FCC can't impose anti-discrimination regulations on ISPs; it's that they can't do so unless they classify ISPs as 'telecommunications services,' which would then subject them to common carrier regulations.\\" The agency could change the classification, as many reformers have long suggested.

Article:","completion":"Title: Net Neutrality Isn't Doomed – The FCC Can Still Help Summary: Many people are worried that internet service providers like Verizon will be able to ruin how we watch movies and use the internet. However, some people think that the FCC can keep internet service providers in control. Once upon a time, a court made a decision that caused people to worry about how they would enjoy the internet. They were scared that companies like Verizon, who provide us with internet service, would make things difficult for us when we want to watch movies or look for things on the internet. But, there was a group of people who told everybody to take a deep breath and stay calm. They believed that the FCC, which is an organization that helps control how things work on the internet, could still keep the internet service providers in line. A smart person named John Blevins wrote in the Washington Post that the court didn't completely remove the FCC's power to make rules for the future. He said that the FCC can still manage internet providers using some special rules called Section 706. There was another intelligent person named Jon Terbush, who wrote in the Week that much of the decision was about how the FCC calls internet service providers \\"information services\\" instead of \\"telecommunication services.\\" He said that the FCC can still make rules to stop internet service providers from doing bad things if they call them \\"telecommunications services\\". Many people who want to improve how things work have been suggesting this change for a long time. A third clever person, Tim Fernholz, said in Quartz that even if the FCC doesn't change what they call the internet service providers, net neutrality (which means everyone can use the internet fairly) isn't totally gone. He believes that the court's decision could still help the FCC make rules to protect net neutrality, even if they don't call internet service providers \\"telecommunications services.\\" So, people shouldn't worry too much yet, because the FCC might still be able to help us continue enjoying the internet the way we want.

Today, in front of him he has four samples, sample A, sample B, sample C, and sample D. Sample A is the naturally occurring uranium. Sample B is enriched uranium. Sample C is the U-238, and sample D is the U-235. He needs to figure out how to best use them. Which smaple would not be fissionable, sample C or sample D? Hint: Naturally occurring uranium is composed almost entirely of two isotopes, uranium-238 (99%) and uranium-235 (1%). It is the uranium-235 that is fissionable (will undergo fission) and therefore, this is the uranium isotope than can be used for fuel in a nuclear reactor. For uranium to be used as fuel, the percent of uranium-235 must be increased to at least 3%. Uranium in which the U-235 content is more than 1% is called enriched uranium. Somehow, the two isotopes must be separated so that enriched uranium is available for use as fuel. Separating the isotope by chemical means (chemical reactions) is not successful because the isotopes have exactly the same chemistry. The only essential difference between U-238 and U-235 is their atomic masses; as a result, the two isotopes are separated by a physical means that takes advantage of the difference in mass. The answer to this question is:","completion":"Based on the hint provided, naturally occurring uranium is composed almost entirely of two isotopes, uranium-238 (99%) and uranium-235 (1%).

Summarize this article: Researchers have just figured out which cities across the globe face the highest risk from coastal flooding. To do so, they compiled data on 136 coastal cities with more than 1 million residents, looking at the elevation of the cities, the population distribution and the types of flood protection they had, such as levees or storm-surge barriers. They then combined that data with forecasts of sea level rise, ground sinking due to groundwater depletion, as well as population growth projections and economic forecasts of gross domestic product (GDP). From there, they used the depth of water flooding a city to estimate the cost of the damage. [Read full story on coastal flooding] In both their best- and worst-case projections of sea level rise, the yearly global cost reached higher than 1 trillion. The most vulnerable city was Guangzhou, China, followed by Mumbai and Kolkata in India, Guayaquil, Ecuador and Shenzen, China. Almost all cities at the highest risk of flooding damage were in North America or Asia. Here are the top 20 most vulnerable cities: 1. Guangzhou, China 2. Mumbai, India 3. Kolkata, India 4.

Almost all cities facing the worst damage are in Asia and North America, the study showed. Three American cities — New York, New Orleans and Miami — are at particularly high risk of damage, according to the study, published today (Aug. 18) in the journal Nature Climate Change. \\"If we did nothing about the risk, the flood damages in coastal cities would grow to huge amounts. So that's really not an option,\\" said study co-author Robert Nicholls, a coastal engineering professor at the University of Southampton in England. Damaging storms Climate change models generally predict that storms will grow more frequent and fierce over the next several decades. We may already be seeing its impact: Many scientists believe that climate change worsened the toll of Hurricane Sandy. [How Weird!: 7 Rare Weather Events] After Hurricane Katrina ravaged the Gulf Coast in 2005, Nicholls and his colleagues realized that scientists had little idea which cities around the world were most vulnerable to flooding. So the team compiled data on 136 coastal cities with more than 1 million residents, looking at the elevation of the cities, the population distribution and the types of flood protection they had, such as levees or storm-surge barriers. They then combined that data with forecasts of sea level rise, ground sinking due to groundwater depletion, as well as population growth projections and economic forecasts of gross domestic product (GDP). From there, they used the depth of water flooding a city to estimate the cost of the damage. Two vulnerable continents The researchers found that in both their best- and worst-case projections of sea level rise, the yearly global cost reached higher than 1 trillion. The most vulnerable city was Guangzhou, China, followed by Mumbai and Kolkata in India, Guayaquil, Ecuador and Shenzen, China. Almost all cities at the highest risk of flooding damage were in North America or Asia. [See The 20 Cities Most Vulnerable to Flooding] If cities take steps to prevent damage — by increasing the height of levees, erecting storm surge barriers, making buildings flood-resistant or converting flood-prone, low-lying areas to parks or football fields — the cost of the damage could be brought down to about 50 billion annually. It would be cheaper and more sensible to make these changes before Katrina-like storm surges become the norm, Nicholls said. \\"The bottom line is it shows that flood risk is rising today — it's happening\\" Nicholls told LiveScience. \\"All these cities need to be preparing for that.\\" Follow Tia Ghose on Twitter and Google+.

The chill of the January afternoon pierced her through, but it was fear, more than the cold, that made her limbs shake. Having just crossed over to the Left Bank, she glanced back over her shoulder and saw the towers and spires of the royal palace across the Seine. She felt as if hidden eyes there were watching her. Could anyone on the palace wall have seen her walk over the Petit-Pont? Not Amalric. He was still in the south, the King having just appointed him seneschal for Beziers and the surrounding country. But he had so many agents in Paris and allies at court. Except for Agnes, all the servants in the Gobignon town house were loyal to him. His aunt, Queen Blanche, was forever praising him to all who would listen. If Nicolette were involved in scandal, the White Queen would be furious, and would see to it that word reached Amalric. And if indeed he found out about her meeting the troubadour? Just a message, a song, let alone a meeting like this one, could mean death for her and Orlando. I should turn around right now, cross this bridge, and run back to the palace. The streets of the Latin Quarter were crawling with ruffians and criminals - it was insane for her to be walking here alone after sunset. The sight of the small knife she carried under her cloak might deter an attacker, but then she would be discovered. If I screamed for help, the whole palace would find out. Blanche would demand to know why I was here. No, she thought, her blood turning to ice, she would know why. But those eyes of his? to look into them again, was that not worth any risk? She stood, vacillating, in the shadows by a wooden house that overhung the Rue Saint-Jacques. I must see Orlando, she thought. Over a year now, and I have not been able to forget him. She longed just to be alone with him and have him take her in his arms. Who would be furious because of a scandal? Pick the correct answer from the following options: - not enough information - Orlando - Amalric - The White Queen Answer:","completion":"The White Queen would be furious because of a scandal. The White Queen, also known as Queen Blanche, is Amalric's aunt and is mentioned as someone who frequently praises him to others. Nicolette fears that if a scandal involving her were to arise, Queen Blanche would ensure that Amalric would become aware of it. This reveals the close relationship between Amalric and the White Queen, and highlights that Queen Blanche holds significant influence in this situation. Consequently, Nicolette fears her wrath as a result of a potential scandal involving her meeting with the troubadour, Orlando."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Read the following article and select the best answer.

Check your obligations.","completion":"Title: Thinking About Having a Family: What You Should Consider Hello, little friends! Today, we're going to talk about a big and important idea: deciding whether or not to have a family with children. You might be very young, but someday you might want to become a mom or dad. This is a big decision, so let's break it down into three simple things to think about. 1. Consider the Commitment When you become a parent, it's like making the biggest promise you'll ever make, to take care of someone—your little baby—for a very, very long time. It's like when you make a deal with your friends to take care of their toys or pets while they're away. But this time, it's not just for a few days or a week, but for many, many years. You need to make sure you're ready for this big promise because it's super important. You'll spend a lot of time teaching, loving, and helping your child grow. This means less time for yourself and doing things you enjoy. So before you decide to have a family, think long and hard about whether you can keep this commitment. 2. Consider Not Having Children It's perfectly okay to decide not to have children! Some people feel happier and more fulfilled by doing other things, like focusing on their careers or hobbies, or helping others in their community. There are so many ways to make the world a better place! So, if you're not sure about becoming a parent, it's okay to think about other big adventures to have instead. Remember, there are lots of ways to be a happy, caring grown-up. Sometimes, not having children of your own means you can be that cool aunt, uncle or family friend to help other people's kids. 3. Check Your Obligations Life is full of responsibilities, like going to school, doing chores, or spending time with your family. But when you grow up, there are even more things to do, like going to work or keeping your home clean and safe. Before you decide to have children, make sure you can handle all those big-kid responsibilities. Will you be able to do your job and take care of your child? Can you give them a happy and stable home? In conclusion, deciding to have a family is one of the most important choices you'll make in your life. Remember, it's essential to think about the commitment, consider not having children, and check your obligations. And no matter what you choose, it's important to be kind and loving, whether you're a parent, aunt, uncle, or amazing friend!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: SEOUL — Arms control experts estimate that the dismantlement of North Korea’s nuclear program could take a decade to complete, and cost 20 billion, if a nuclear agreement is reached between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un when they meet in Singapore on June 12. “The hard work has not yet begun, and it is gong to take sustained energy on the part of the United States, South Korea, Japan, China and North Korea. It’s going to be a multiyear long process,” said Daryl Kimball, the executive director of the Arms Control Association in Washington. President Trump has said he expects a \\"very positive result\\" from the North Korea nuclear summit, but he also said it will likely be the beginning of a process to resolve differences over the extent of the North’s denuclearization, and the specifics regarding what sanctions relief, economic aid and security guarantees would be offered in return. U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said on Sunday that North Korea would only receive sanctions relief after it takes \\"verifiable and irreversible steps to denuclearization.\\" This position aligns closer to the Kim government’s stance that denuclearization measures and concessions be matched action for action. And it backs away from demands made by some in the president’s national security team that Pyongyang quickly and unilaterally dismantle all its weapons of mass destruction before any concessions would be offered. North Korea is estimated to have 20 to 80 nuclear warheads, both known and covert nuclear research and processing sites, and thousands of ballistic missiles that can be launched from mobile vehicles, and submarine based launchers have been tested in recent years. With such an extensive nuclear arsenal it could cost 20 billion to achieve the U.S. goal of complete, irreversible, and verifiable nuclear dismantlement (CVID), according to a recent study conducted by Kwon Hyuk-chul, a Kookmin University professor of security strategy. Kwon based his assessment in part on past nuclear deals... Question: Why did North Korea have a chance at sanction relief Answer: A:","completion":"North Korea had a chance at sanction relief as a result of potentially reaching a nuclear agreement with the U.S., wherein North Korea would take \\"verifiable and irreversible steps to denuclearization.\\" The U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said that sanctions relief would be provided once these steps were taken, thus giving North Korea a chance to receive sanction relief if they agreed to and followed through with the denuclearization process."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Bob worked in the printing business, which led him to take work where he could find it, and as a result, during McFarlane's childhood, the family lived in thirty different places from Alberta to California. McFarlane began drawing as a hobby at an early age, and developed an interest in comics, acquiring as many as he could, and learning to draw from them. McFarlane lost judgments in two lawsuits in the 2000s. The first was a 2002 suit which McFarlane contested with writer Neil Gaiman over the rights to some supporting Spawn characters created by Gaiman in issue No. 9 of the Spawn series and over payment for later works featuring those characters. In 1997 the two signed a deal in which Gaiman would give his share of characters Angela, Medieval Spawn and Cogliostro to McFarlane in exchange for McFarlane's share of British superhero Marvelman (in reality, what McFarlane actually owned were two trademarks for Miracleman logos, not the character, which would become clear only after the lawsuit concluded). This deal was broken by McFarlane, which motivated Gaiman to start the lawsuit. The jury was unanimous in favor of Gaiman. The two were involved in a lengthy dispute over ownership of Miracleman, but no lawsuit has been filed in that dispute. In 2009, Marvel Comics resolved the matter by purchasing the property. The second was a December 2004 suit in which hockey player Tony Twist sued McFarlane because he named a mobster character in Spawn after Twist. The lawsuit was settled out of court for 5 million. As of late 2012, McFarlane was suing a former employee whose name is the same as the alter ego of Spawn, Al Simmons. According to a lawsuit lodged in Arizona federal court, the real Al Simmons published a book called The Art of Being Spawn, in which Simmons purportedly suggests that his own life was the inspiration for the Spawn character. McFarlane's position was that Simmons violated the terms of his employment pact and breached his duty of loyalty. The lawsuit was settled in December 2012 when McFarlane came to an agreement with Simmons. The terms of any settlement were not made public.

As of January 1, 2004, the United Kennel Club deemed the AHT a separate terrier breed, granting it full UKC recognition. An intelligent, social and energetic working breed, the American Hairless Terrier is often listed as a potential good breed choice for allergy sufferers. Does this next sentence follow, given the preceding text? American Hairless Terriers are generally not very social dogs.","completion":"The statement \\"American Hairless Terriers are generally not very social dogs\\" does not accurately follow the given preceding text. According to the provided information, the American Hairless Terrier (AHT) is an intelligent, social, and energetic working breed dog. These traits indicate that they are friendly dogs that enjoy being around people, animals, and engaging in various activities. Therefore, describing AHT as \\"not very social\\" contradicts the information presented earlier. The American Hairless Terrier originally descended from the Rat Terrier breed. This breed variation gained recognition as a separate terrier breed by the United Kennel Club (UKC) on January 1, 2004. The AHT is known for being hairless, which often leads to them being a consideration for those suffering from allergies. This is due to the lack of hair meaning fewer allergens being produced, thus reducing the likelihood of affecting people who have pet-related allergies. As mentioned earlier, the AHT is characterized as an intelligent dog, which means they are highly trainable and capable of understanding and executing various tasks and commands. This intelligence also makes them curious and makes them quick learners, adapting to new situations and environments well. It also makes the breed well-suited for various dog sports and activities such as agility, obedience, and even therapy work. Additionally, the AHT is known for its social nature. These dogs enjoy being around their family members, as well as other animals and people when properly socialized. This socialization is important as it helps them develop confidence and cope better in different environments. Socialization should begin early on in the puppy's life and continue throughout adulthood to ensure a well-rounded, friendly, and confident dog. The energetic nature of the AHT means that they require an active lifestyle and sufficient mental and physical stimulation. Daily exercise and playtime are key to maintaining their physical health and preventing boredom, which can lead to destructive behavior. Adequate exercise also helps to maintain a balanced temperament in these dogs, fostering closer bonds between them and their human companions. To conclude, the statement that American Hairless Terriers are \\"generally not very social dogs\\" is not accurate based on the provided information.

A mall Santa had a heart attack at work and was rushed to the Emergency Room in full cardiac arrest. Let me explain that a person playing Santa is generally a certain age (white beard) and body type (round) that is predisposed to cardiac disease. We did everything we could but ultimately our efforts were futile. The mall Santa rode his sleigh into the great beyond. A mother, there to visit another patient, was insistent that her 7–8 year old son be allowed back to visit his grandmother. We had a strict 12 year old age limit visitation policy. I was called to speak with her. ”Why do you have such a stupid Draconian policy?” She insisted. “The Emergency Room is no place for a child ma’am. Besides, the germs and infections he may be exposed to, there are things he may see or hear that a child would have a hard time processing,” I explained. “Like what?” She argued. “Well, there are people in pain moaning,” I answered. “And drunks cursing at the staff. It’s a tough place.” “He’s fine,” she insisted. “I think I know how to parent. I don’t need you to worry about what my son is able to handle.” I caved in and allowed her back. As we passed the room with the dead Santa, a tech exited and opened the curtain. Her child looked in and saw Santa’s lifeless body, ET tube sticking out of his throat, boots still on but costume cut to shreds and strewn across the room. The child lost it! “Mom, Santa Claus is Dead!” He cried. “I’m not going to get anything for Christmas.” “Why would someone open the curtain?” The mother demanded. “I warned you,” I said. “That’s why we have a 12 years and above visitation policy.” She was not happy. Come to find out the child had his picture made with that very Santa a few days prior. Very ironic. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.

Pioneering work by Broca (1878), Papez (1937), and MacLean (1952) suggested that emotion is related to a group of structures in the center of the brain called the limbic system, which includes the hypothalamus, cingulate cortex, hippocampi, and other structures. More recent research has shown that some of these limbic structures are not as directly related to emotion as others are while some non-limbic structures have been found to be of greater emotional relevance.\\" Answer:","completion":"The most current inquisition has discovered that the relationship between the section of the organ in a person's head, specifically the limbic system, and sentimental experiences is more complex than previously thought.

Step 1: Reflect on prior knowledge about the brain and emotions, including the work of Broca, Papez, and MacLean, which suggested that the limbic system is related to emotions. Step 2: Take into account recent research findings that challenge the straightforward relationship between the limbic system and emotions. Step 3: Acknowledge the complexity of the relationship by pointing out that some limbic structures, such as the hypothalamus, cingulate cortex, and hippocampi, may not be as directly related to emotions as previously thought.

Answer:","completion":"Title: Extremely Disappointing Experience Review: I recently downloaded the org.telegram.messenger app, hoping for a seamless messaging experience. Unfortunately, my expectations were met with profound disappointment. This app is, without any doubt, deserving of a 1-star rating. Firstly, the registration process was a mess. It took me multiple attempts and an unreasonable amount of time to set up my account. I was eagerly anticipating a user-friendly interface after reading about Telegram, but the app's layout is cluttered and complicated, making it difficult to navigate. Moreover, the performance is highly unreliable, with a consistent lag in message deliveries, which hinders real-time communication. There were instances where it took several minutes for my messages to be sent or received, causing inconvenience and frustration. The app is also plagued with numerous bugs and crashes. It's frustrating to be halfway through a conversation only for the app to crash, deleting any unsaved progress and forcing me to start over. Additionally, the notification system is dysfunctional. I receive notifications for messages that I have already read, and at times, I don't receive notifications at all. As for security, the app claims to provide end-to-end encryption and secure messaging. However, I noticed that the app constantly requests access to my contacts, even after denying permission multiple times – making me doubt its commitment to privacy. Lastly, the customer support is virtually non-existent. I've reached out to the team multiple times regarding various issues, only to be met with silence. It's disheartening to see an app with such potential lack any form of constructive support. In summary, I regret downloading the org.telegram.messenger app and will be uninstalling it immediately. It stands as a disappointing example of poor functionality, cluttered design, and inadequate support. I strongly recommend potential users to look for alternative messaging apps that can offer a better and more reliable experience."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

David Bryan (right), a security specialist at Chicago's Trustwave, stood by crowded shopping areas with a device stashed in his backpack to show how it works. ABC7 I-Team recently revealed just how easily thieves steal personal details from cards that use ‘wave and pay’ radio technology. David Bryan, a security specialist at Chicago's Trustwave, stood by crowded shopping areas with a device stashed in his backpack that could read card numbers. ‘The technology is high-frequency RFID,’ Mr Bryan told DailyMail.com. ‘It uses 13.56 Mhz to communicate with the card and the reader. ‘In this instance, I used low power Embedded Linux Computer, and an easily purchasable RFID reader. The technology in the card, known as radio frequency identification (RFID), transmits bank details via its own radio signal. A RFID reader can pick up these details in a matter of seconds.

The information can then be input into a machine that can be purchased for 300-400 to replicate the card. Cards can be protected from RFID skimmers by being wrapped in tin foil or being kept in special foil-lined wallets. ‘This was then powered by a USB Battery, and stuck into a backpack.’ As well as a device, digital pickpockets can download an RFID app onto their phone.

The information can then be input into a machine that can be purchased for 300-400 to replicate the card. Security firm Norton says that this year 70 per cent of credit cards will be vulnerable to digital pick pocketing. ‘The device can read many different RFID tags- including MiFare Cards, EMV Cards, and many type of RFID tags,’ said Mr Bryan. ‘It works with many Near Field Communication tags and devices’ Because RFID is always switched on, some payment experts say it's more vulnerable to attack than NFC. 'This demonstration shows that contactless payment card reading technology is not a silver bullet for security,' said Mr Bryan. RFID readers can be bought cheaply online. They can also be downloaded onto a smartphone from an app. 'RFID payment cards need to be backed by a mobile device that generates one-time payment card numbers for that specific transaction- rather than having a static payment card that never expires. 'In a crowded train, if someone has an RFID payment card, I could easily pull that data if I get close enough - or have a large enough antenna' As well as using it in his backpack, Mr Bryan successfully stole numbers by attaching the equipment to a laptop. ‘The three digit code on the back of the card could help,’ Marc Rotenberg, President of the Electronic Privacy Information Center (Epic) told DailyMail.com. This code can’t be read by the device, but fake cards could be created without the three digit code and presented at shops. ‘We have some questions about the implementation [of the three digit code] because it wouldn’t make sense to implement it if you don’t require presentation of the product,’ said Mr Rotenberg. Places to watch out for digital pickpockets include crowded shopping centres and busy stations where transactions are constantly being made. Special wallets that use foil can block these radio frequency signals, but the threat remains very real. Apple Pay is attempting to overcome the problem by not storing any numbers on an iPhone. A Chase Bank spokesperson also told the ABC7 I-Team that they are discontinuing the use of that radio technology on their cards. ‘It’s not necessary wrong to pursue these techniques, but more needs to be done to safeguard people,’ said Mr Rotenberg. Articulate's clutch (right) blocks RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) signals - the relatively new technology that allows us to simply wave our credit cards over a scanner to pay for goods (left) A tech-savvy accessories label has launched a clutch purse with built-in capabilities to protect against identity theft. Articulate's clutch costs 35 to pre-order and blocks RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) signals - the relatively new technology that allows us to simply wave our credit cards over a scanner to pay for goods. According to the team behind the purse - entrepreneur Kevin and his sister Lindsay, based in San Diago, California - the clutch contains a 'special material' embedded into the design to help block these pesky RFID signals. 'Criminals with very minimal technical skills have created devices similar to the scanner which vendors such as grocery stores use,' the website description reads. It comes in a range of colors and can also be worn over the shoulder thanks to the chain strap. According to the United States Federal Trade Commission, identity theft had been holding steady for the last few years, having seen an increase of 21 per cent in 2008. Summarize the highlights of this article.","completion":"The article discusses the rise of digital pickpockets who use radio-frequency identification (RFID) readers to steal credit and debit card details without physically touching the victim's wallet. These criminals can operate within a range of six inches (15cm) and harvest bank details through a practice known as 'digital skimming'. The information collected can then be used to create duplicate cards. David Bryan, a security specialist at Chicago's Trustwave, demonstrated how this could be done using low power Embedded Linux Computer and an easily purchasable RFID reader. To counter digital pickpocketing, some individuals use special foil-lined wallets to block the RFID signals. Apple Pay is attempting to overcome the problem by not storing any numbers on iPhones, and Chase Bank is discontinuing the use of radio technology on their cards."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Despite the increasing adoption of digital storage methods, there is still a significant need for organizing and maintaining physical papers too. From office environments to studying scenarios, professional or personal, paper clutter can quickly become an overwhelming issue. One practical method to tackle this challenge is by mastering paper folding and arrangement techniques. This article aims to explore one such technique, step by step, to guide you through creating an efficient and orderly workspace. The Technique: A Step by Step Guide Separate your papers, if necessary. It is essential to begin the organization process by categorizing and separating your papers according to their significance, subject, or any other criteria suitable for your work or habits. This preliminary step will make it easier to identify and retrieve documents when needed, ultimately improving efficiency and productivity. Fold out the flaps of your white papers. Once you have your papers sorted, you can start folding them to create a compact and space-saving arrangement. Begin by folding out the flaps found on one edge of the white paper. By folding the paper in this manner, you create an anchor point to insert other papers into the created compartment. Insert the flap into the pocket. The next step involves creating a pocket by folding the white paper at the edges to shape an opening on one side. When you have created this pocket, simply insert the flap of the next paper, which you previously folded, into this pocket. Doing so will secure the previously folded paper in place and create an interconnected system of papers. Free the other white flap. Gently free the other white flap from the folded paper inserted into the pocket. This action will expose the flap and prepare it for the subsequent connection with another paper. Invert the paper so the top triangle faces downward. After exposing the flap, invert the paper so that the newly created triangle faces downwards. This orientation ensures that the papers stay organized, prevents overlapping, and maintains the intended sequence of the interconnected papers. Connect your ends together. As a final step, connect the ends of your chain by inserting the freed white flap into the previously established pocket. This action will close the loop of your project, solidifying your well-organized system of physical papers. Conclusion The process of organizing physical papers plays a vital role in streamlining your daily workflow while minimizing clutter in your workspace. Mastering simple paper folding and organization techniques can significantly improve the efficiency and productivity of both professionals and students alike. By following the instructions outlined in this article, anyone can create a well-structured and visually appealing paper organization system. Utilizing these techniques will not only make your workspace more presentable, but it will also save time and reduce stress in locating and managing essential documents. Embrace the art of paper organization to enhance the overall efficiency and satisfaction in your work or study environment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Santana is a Latin music and rock band formed in San Francisco, California in 1966 by Mexican-American guitarist Carlos Santana. The band came to public attention with their performance of \\"Soul Sacrifice\\" at Woodstock in 1969. This exposure helped propel their first album, also named Santana, into a hit, followed in the next two years by Abraxas and Santana III. Lineup changes were common. The follow-up to Supernatural came three years later and was highly anticipated by international media and fans alike. On October 22, 2002, Shaman was released worldwide. Although it initially sold briskly (298,973 copies in the US in its first week) and debuted at number 1 on the Billboard 200, the album's appeal quickly wore off and it soon slid down the charts. Despite this, it went on to sell 2x platinum in the US, and achieved platinum status in several other countries including Australia. The first single released from the album, \\"The Game of Love\\", which featured vocals from Michelle Branch, debuted at number 5 on the Hot 100. The album's next four singles failed to chart in most countries, but the final single, \\"Why Don't You & I\\", featuring the vocals of Alex Band, reached number 8 on the Hot 100. Musically, the album was a return to a more conventional sound for the group, with a mainly Latin rock-based sound. With their renewed appeal worn off, another three-year wait saw the release of 2005's All That I Am. The album debuted at number 2 on the Billboard 200 but fared worse internationally, and quickly lost appeal. The album, a continuation of the Latin-rock influenced sound of Shaman, achieved gold certification in the US. A five-year break from recording saw the release of another studio album, 2010's Guitar Heaven. Musically it was a drastic change for the band, with a far heavier sound at its core and strong heavy metal influences. It debuted at number 5 on the Billboard 200 but marked another decline for the band, failing to achieve gold status. In 2012 the group released Shape Shifter, which returned to the conventional Latin rock sound and was completely album-oriented, as no singles were released from it. It debuted at number 16 on the Billboard 200. Which album was released after \\"All That I Am\\"?","completion":"The album released after \\"All That I Am\\" was \\"Guitar Heaven,\\" which came out in 2010.

These days, unfortunately, my spa trips are few and far between. I blame the damn kids for that one! So, as you can imagine, I was pretty damn excited when the in-laws presented me with an Urban Spa voucher for the Urban Indulgence package: one hour hot stone Lomi Lomi massage followed by a Heavenly Spa Facial - two hours on indulgent bliss, for Christmas. I had never had a hot stone massage before so was very much looking forward to this, if nothing else out of curiosity about what is involved. Whenever you see pictures advertising a hot stone massage, the beautiful model always has a bunch of largish stones on her back so I wasn't sure whether it was more an acupressure experience where they left the stones strategically placed on the back to work their magic or whether it was an actual massage. Turns out that it is an actual massage. I requested a firm massage as my back has really been giving me issues. Carrying 15kgs of Crazy Kid or 9kgs of Kiki (or 26kgs of double babies) really isn't too good for the back so it had been causing me problems for a couple of months. My therapist (the lovely Kristy) gave me an expertly firm massage and used a small, smooth hot stone, along with her hands, to perform the massage. It was quite a unique experience as one minute I could sense that she was using her hands to do the massage then then next I'd get a sweep of hotness as the stone was run over me. It really was a delightful sensory experience. As my back was a problem area, Kristy spent 30 minutes just on that then the other 30 minutes was spent on the rest of my body. I could feel myself drifting in and out of consciousness throughout the massage. One really special thing about this massage was that the massage table was heated. Such a small touch, but one that was greatly appreciated (although it was a great contributor to my lack of consciousness!). Question: Why did the therapist work mainly on the author's back?

Q:Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: A recent study, while showing a generally positive attitude toward science, also suggests a widespread worry that it may be \\"running out of control\\". This idea is dangerous. Science can be a force for evil as well as for good. Its applications can be channeled either way, depending on our decisions. The decisions we make, personally or collectively, will determine the outcomes of science. But here is a real danger. Science is advancing so fast is so strongly influenced by businesses that we are likely to believe whatever decisions we come to will make little difference. And, rather than fighting for the best possible policies, we may step back and do nothing. Some people go even further. They say that despite the moral and legal objections , whatever is scientifically possible will be done ----somewhere, sometime. They believe that science will get out of control in the end. This belief is dangerous too, because it a fuels sense of hopelessness and discourages them from making efforts to build a safer world. In our interconnected world, the lack of agreement in and of the world of science can lead to the failure to control the use of science. Without a common understanding, the challenges of \\"controlling\\" science in this century will be really tough. Take human cloning for example. Despite the general agreement among scientists on its possible huge impact on traditional moral values, some countries still go ahead with the research and development of its related techniques.

Since it was a Saturday night, everything else was empty for miles. The parking lot was filled with sports cars, hybrids, and shiny suburban tanks. The door facing the parking lot was open, spilling out muted lights and the din of yuppie chatter. It cast a somewhat foreboding aura over the entrance. The first thing I noticed as I approached was the beefy refrigerator in a rented tux blocking the doorway. The second thing was the surveillance camera perched on the wall above his head. I had stopped home and changed first, so I was sure I was dressed mostly appropriately for some rich faux-hipster art party - charcoal gray pinstripe jacket over a TV on the Radio t-shirt, skinny cuffed jeans, Docs, and a black fedora.

It is surrounded by the Barents Sea to the north and the White Sea to the east and south, with Finland and Norway lying to its west. The Kola Peninsula covers an area of around 100,000 square kilometers (38,610 square miles), which makes it approximately twice the size of Denmark or similar in size to the island of Iceland. The peninsula is predominantly part of the Murmansk Oblast, a federal subject in Russia. Murmansk, the largest city on the peninsula and the administrative center of the Murmansk Oblast, can be found at the eastern coast of the peninsula, close to the entrance of the Kola Bay. To locate the Kola Peninsula on a map, first determine the position of Russia along with its vast territory. The peninsula is situated in the northwest section of the country, attached to the European part of Russia. The peninsula is bordered by Finland to the west, the Arctic Ocean on the north side, and the White Sea to the east and south, creating a separation between it and the mainland. Home to rugged terrain with an assortment of mountains, deep valleys, lakes, and rivers, the Kola Peninsula offers a diverse array of flora and fauna. Moreover, the eastern region of the peninsula carries significance in terms of military installations and industrialization. The Kola Peninsula is known for its rich mineral resources, and it has played a significant role in the economy and geopolitical strategies of the area.

It is also the historical capital of Bohemia. Situated in the north-west of the country on the Vltava river, the city is home to about 1.26 million people, while its larger urban zone is estimated to have a population of nearly 2 million. The city has a temperate climate, with warm summers and chilly winters. - A libertine is one devoid of most moral or sexual restraints, which are seen as unnecessary or undesirable, especially one who ignores or even spurns accepted morals and forms of behaviour sanctified by the larger society. Libertinism is described as an extreme form of hedonism. Libertines put value on physical pleasures, meaning those experienced through the senses. As a philosophy, libertinism gained new-found adherents in the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries, particularly in France and Great Britain. Notable among these were John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester, and the Marquis de Sade. - Don Giovanni (K. 527; complete title: , literally \\"The Rake Punished, namely Don Giovanni\\" or \\"The Libertine Punished\\") is an opera in two acts with music by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Italian libretto by Lorenzo Da Ponte. It is based on the legends of Don Juan, a fictional libertine and seducer. It was premiered by the Prague Italian opera at the National Theater (of Bohemia), now called the Estates Theatre, on 29 October 1787. Da Ponte's libretto was billed as a \\"dramma giocoso\\", a common designation of its time that denotes a mixing of serious and comic action. Mozart entered the work into his catalogue as an \\"opera buffa\\". Although sometimes classified as comic, it blends comedy, melodrama and supernatural elements. - Mariano Padilla y Ramos ( 1842 -- 21 November 1906 ) was a Spanish operatic baritone who excelled in the title role of Mozart 's Don Giovanni . - Don Juan (Spanish), Don Giovanni (Italian) is a legendary, fictional libertine. The first written version of the \\"Don Juan\\" legend was written by the Spanish dramatist Tirso de Molina (\\"nom de plume\\" of Gabriel Téllez). His play, \\"El burlador de Sevilla y convidado de piedra\\" (\\"The Trickster of Seville and the Stone Guest\\"), was set in the fourteenth century and published in Spain around 1630. The name \\"Don Juan\\" is a common metaphor for a \\"womanizer\\". - Dramma giocoso (Italian, literally: drama with jokes; plural: \\"drammi giocosi\\") is a genre of opera common in the mid-18th century. The term is a contraction of \\"dramma giocoso per musica\\" and describes the opera's libretto (text). The genre developed in the Neapolitan opera tradition, mainly through the work of the playwright Carlo Goldoni in Venice. A \\"dramma giocoso\\" characteristically used a grand \\"buffo\\" (comic or farce) scene as a dramatic climax at the end of an act. Goldoni's texts always consisted of two long acts with extended finales, followed by a short third act. Composers Baldassare Galuppi, Niccolò Piccinni, and Joseph Haydn set Goldoni's texts to music. - Lorenzo Da Ponte (10 March 174917 August 1838) was an Italian, later American opera librettist, poet and Roman Catholic priest. He wrote the libretti for 28 operas by 11 composers, including three of Mozart's greatest operas, \\"Don Giovanni\\", \\"The Marriage of Figaro\\" and \\"Così fan tutte\\". - The Estates Theatre or Stavovské divadlo is a historic theatre in Prague, Czech Republic. The Estates Theatre was annexed to the National Theatre in 1948 and currently draws on three artistic ensembles, opera, ballet, and drama, which perform at the Estates Theatre, the National Theatre, and the (separate building, Kolowrat Palace).

Most of the population is Jola. The Jola are very distinct from other major ethnic groups in Senegal by their language, egalitarian society, freedom from political hierarchy, and lack of slavery. Their traditions have persevered because of their independent spirit as well as their geographical isolation. This ethnic group accounts for 80 to 90% of the residents of Basse Casamance, but only 6 to 8% of the total population of Senegal. They are the largest ethnic group in Carabane, followed by Wolofs, Lebous, and Serers (including Niominka fishermen). Manjacks also live on the island, some of whom came from Saint-Louis and Gorée at the time of the first colonization. Two communities from neighbouring countries, one from Guinea (the Susu people) and the other from Guinea-Bissau, have settled on the other side of the island at a distance from the village. There are also seasonal workers who come to fish: Ghanaians, Guineans, and Gambians.The indigenous population was originally animist, but while the fetishes and sacred groves dedicated to initiation rites such as boukout survive as cultural icons of Casamance, the monotheistic belief systems of Catholicism and Islam have become the most widely held in Carabane. The 1988 census reported that Muslims account for 94% of the population of Senegal, but only 26.5% of the population of Oussouye Department, where Carabane is located. Still, this department is largely rural, while Carabane has historically supported great ethnic diversity. Islam has not been practiced by Wolof and Serer fishermen since the 19th century, but the colonial administration brought with it many translators, guides, and secretaries from Dakar, many of whom were Muslim. answer the following question: What are the names of the four largest ethnic groups in Carabane? A:","completion":"The four largest ethnic groups in Carabane are Jola, Wolofs, Lebous, and Serers (including Niominka fishermen)."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Meanwhile, a crude but effective denial of service attack was launched against their company Web site.

He'd agreed for a reason, and once Greg had a reason for making a decision it was usually impossible to change his mind. And it didn't make sense anyway. All he would have done is buy himself a little more time. Chloe and Paul would just march right back in and start all over again - probably after sending out pics of Evan in drag to all the employees. From his point of view, there was no reason for Greg to do that. Of course, it was still a huge risk for Chloe and Paul.

Given the question: A recent study suggests that teens' relationship with parents, friends and teachers may have a lot to do with why they don't get a good night's sleep. David Maume, a sociologist and sleep researcher, analyzed federal health data, which interviewed 974 teenagers when they were 12, and then again at 15. He found that family dynamics have much to do with how well kids sleep. Teens, who had warm relations with their parents and felt like they could talk to them or their parents were supportive of them, tended to sleep better. However, families that were going through a divorce or a remarriage tended to affect teens' sleep. And problems at school also affected teens' sleep. Feeling safe at school and having good relations with teachers tended to promote better sleep. As did good relationships with friends. Kids who took part in sports or other positive social activities or shared similar academic goals with their friends were also more likely to get a good night's sleep. These add up to what makes lots of sense: a general feeling of well-being helps teens sleep. If we're happy and contented, we're much more likely to sleep better than if we're sad and anxious. Now, of course, teens can hardly resist being drawn to their computers and social networking. Maume also found that when parents were strict not only about bedtime, but also about limiting technology, kids slept better. It's a finding that seems obvious, but parents really do matter when it comes to health habits of their teenagers. Clearly, teenagers aren't getting 9 to 10 hours a night, which puts them at risk for all the consequences of lack of sleep, including poor academic performance, colds and stress. What is the passage mainly about? A) Teens' sleep is linked to their relationship with people around them. B) Lack of adequate sleep puts teens at risk of many bad consequences. C) Modern technology has something to do with teens' sleep problems. D) It is necessary for teens to join in sports and positive social activities. The answer is:","completion":"A) Teens' sleep is linked to their relationship with people around them. Justification: The passage discusses how various relationships, like those with parents, friends, teachers, and family dynamics, affect the quality of sleep in teenagers. It also mentions the importance of feeling safe, supported, and having a general sense of well-being in promoting better sleep. While other factors, such as technology and lack of sleep consequences, are mentioned, the main focus is on the connection between relationships and sleep."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Say 'yes' if the claim is true otherwise say 'no' Q: CLAIM : The following post is HISTORICAL. POST : Yesterday morning, my boyfriend and I were waking up when I saw a scary black spider scurrying across the floor. I'm pretty scared of spiders, and I think he's about the same level of terrified of them. Also somewhat relevant, he is between housing situations and staying with me in my studio for a month until he moves into his new place. He is messier than me, and has probably created many homes for spiders with the piles of things he has left around. He has improved though and he's awesome and responsive to criticism. Just a lot of two steps forward one step back progress. I said something like, \\"Holy shit, look at that spider!\\" He leapt back in alarm and then looked at it carefully from a safe distance. He asked me to quickly grab a cup before it got away, so I ran to the kitchen. I use glass jam jars as cups, and that was the first thing I saw so I grabbed one and brought it to him. Once the spider was under the jar he asked for a lid. I had saved all the lids, so I tried a lid on another old jam jar before I brought it back. When I had the second jam jar in my hand is when I started plotting. He captured and jarred the spider, sealing the lid tightly. He set the spider jar on the bookshelf and started to get his shoes on. While he was doing that I grabbed the other matching jar, lidded it, and while he was bent over putting his shoes on in front of the shelf I reached over him and swapped the two jars. I put a blanket over myself to go outside (it was cold too) so that he wouldn't see the spider jar in my pocket. I started inspecting the empty jar carefully. I told him to have a look, and that it looked like the spider was gone. We both carefully looked at the jar for a bit, trying to spot the spider. He became more and more freaked out, shaking the jar, looking around the bookshelf. I say something like \\"we'll never find it with all these clothes and snacks around the apartment\\". Finally he ran out of my apartment, saying he was going to open it outside to check that it was really gone. I went with him, spider jar in my pocket. He opened the empty jar carefully, then moved back from it to inspect from a distance. When it was clear there was no spider he started freaking out, saying there's no way it could have gotten out but it did so it must be in the apartment and it must be angry and out for spider revenge. He started crying, and saying he was going to go to his friends house for the night and maybe move his stuff there later, and that he can't go back in my apartment. I didn't expect things to go so far. I pull out the spider jar and show him that the spider is still in captivity, it was just a dumb prank, and apologize. He freezes, then quietly takes the jar from me and goes and lets the spider out in the grass. He hasn't talked to me since. I really thought it was a harmless prank. I do feel bad and apologized to him. My question is, AITA to the point where not talking to me for over a day is warranted?

I was looking for a budget airline that would get me to a wedding on the cheap. My go-to at that point was Spirit — I suffered through the lack of legroom and shoved everything into a backpack to avoid their odious baggage and \\"extras\\" fees. For whatever reason, Spirit wasn't an option, and I benefited from that. I booked a flight on Sun Country Airlines, figuring it was a crappy Spirit equivalent, and almost expected a propeller plane to pick me up. Maybe it was because I'd been flying budget airlines for so long, but I couldn't get over how smoothly the flights went. I flew on a total of four Sun Country flights over that three-day weekend. Every single flight left the gate on time — down to the minute printed on my boarding passes. Carry-ons were free (something I no longer take for granted), along with the complimentary snacks and (non-alcoholic) drinks. The staff was professional, and travel once again became a means to an end, not the basis for the horror stories you tell once you actually get to your destination. Maybe someday I'll rate highly enough for consistent bookings in business or first class, but for now my experiences in economy have been widespread. Some flights still give an aura of wonder to travel. Others just feel like you've been packed onto a flying bus. Glamorous, it is not. We all know which airlines that are recognized for world-class service and amenities. Skytrax honors those airlines each year with its World Airline Awards, which are based on customer satisfaction surveys and are some of the most prestigious in the industry. Emirates took the top place in 2016, followed by Qatar Airways and Singapore Airlines. (Not surprisingly, Virgin America took the top spot in North America.) But what about the airlines that get consistently decent ratings, but are also affordable for families and travelers who aren't on a company expense account? These airlines fall somewhere in between the luxury of the top airlines and the soul-sucking experiences of the flights we take simply because there's only 300 left in our travel budget. These ones are worth your consideration when you're flying in the United States or abroad. Apparently, I'm not the only one pleasantly surprised by Sun Country's level of service. The airline received four out of five stars on TripAdvisor (from more than 200 reviews). The airline, which is owned privately by Cambria and is based in Minneapolis, rated highly for customer service, the check-in process, and value for your money, among other items. It earns slightly lower marks on Skytrax, but reviewers agree the value and customer service are quality. It also made the Top 10 list from Skytrax for low-cost carries in North America. There are some downsides to the airline, however. It's still a low-cost carrier, so economy seats could be cramped. The biggest issue is flight availability: The airline flies to just 30 destinations in the U.S., Mexico, Costa Rica, and the Caribbean. Many long flights will have a pit-stop in Minneapolis, the airline's hub. However if you're choosing between Sun Country and other low-cost options, it's worth it to give them a try. RELATED: See the 20 \\"most loved\\" airlines For the eighth year in a row, AirAsia topped Skytrax's list of low-cost airlines. The airline has numerous destinations, mostly concentrated in Southeast Asia. The company operates out of several countries, with the Malaysian, Indian, and Thai branches garnering three and a half and four stars on TripAdvisor. Value for your money, cleanliness, and customer service were all rated highly. Skytrax does an independent star rating system separate from its awards. AirAsia is a three-star airline — which is pretty good for a budget choice, considering most premier services like Lufthansa, Virgin America, and JetBlue are just one step ahead in the four-star category. (Only eight airlines have achieved the coveted five-star rating.) The airline scores poorly on in-flight entertainment options, but otherwise receives complimentary ratings on Skytrax for value and customer service. Another three-star airline from Skytrax, this airline is based in Australia with flights to most of Southeast Asia. Its parent company is Qantas, and some of the same qualities carry over even to the lower-cost options Jetstar offers. It scored slightly lower on Skytrax than AirAsia, but one reviewer said their flight had \\"surprisingly professional handling, despite denoted as a 'Low-Cost Carrier.'\\" Not everyone was pleased with Jetstar's service, according to TripAdvisor reviews for branches in Singapore and Australia. However, most said the value was good for the fares they paid. Another perk: If you happen to have Qantas points or rewards, they can be used on Jetstar flights. Qantas rewards members reap the same benefits on Jetstar flights, too. Jetstar ranked No. 5 on Skytrax's list of low-cost carriers, and made the top 10 for several other categories, including long-haul flights and low-cost premium seats. RELATED: The world's \\"safest\\" airlines Qantas has had no fatalities in the jet era. The remainder of the top ten safest airlines are in alphabetical order. The reviews on Skytrax for this western airline oscillate wildly between extremely subpar and over-the-top excitement about great value. Like most consumer-based reviews, they mellow out to a happy medium with a six out of 10 rating. The reviews merit another three-star certification, getting special attention for customer service. WestJet also landed on Skytrax's list of best low-cost carries, along with the No. 2 low-cost carrier in North America, only behind Virgin America. Most reviewers on TripAdvisor listed in the \\"very good\\" or \\"excellent\\" categories, with customer service and cleanliness rating high overall. The company is based in Canada, but flies all over North America, with some destinations to the U.K. When it comes to Skytrax awards for low-cost carriers, Norwegian finds itself toward the top of the list in almost every category. It ranked No. 3 overall for low-cost carriers, and was the best for long-haul flights among its budget counterparts. Customers on Skytrax rated it an average of seven out of 10, and it's in the top of the three-starred airlines. Seat comfort, staff service, and value for money all rated highly. Obviously based in Norway, the airline is one of the largest in Europe with more than 125 destinations, along with long-distance options to Asia and North America. Most reviewers on TripAdvisor gave it a \\"very good\\" or \\"excellent\\" rating, with praise for its customer service, cleanliness, and value. If you're going to upgrade in a low-budget airline, Scoot is the airline for you. The company didn't land in the overall top 10 list from Skytrax this year, but did rate highly for its premium cabin space and seats. It also rated well for long-haul budget flights — not a trivial matter if you're going to be stuck on a plane for more than a couple of hours. A three-star airline, Scoot received an average six out of 10 rating on Skytrax from customers. It rated the worst for inflight entertainment, but if you bring your own reading material you will likely appreciate the value. \\"This was a very very cheap ticket and as such delivered excellent value — there are full fare airlines with worse economy classes,\\" said one reviewer on TripAdvisor. The Singapore-based airline makes stops all over Southeast Asia, and received three and a half stars out of five on the travel website.

Plot title: We Were Soldiers Movie plot: A French Army unit is on patrol in pre-Vietnam IndoChina in July 1954 during the First Indochina War. The captain of the patrol curses the land when they see nothing. Then, the unit is suddenly ambushed by hundreds of Vietminh soldiers who kill the officers and, although the unit kills many Vietminh, it is eventually overrun. One Vietminh officer, Nguyen Huu An (Duong Don), hypothesizing that if they take no prisoners the French will eventually stop sending troops, orders the execution of all surviving French soldiers.Eleven years later, Lieutenant Colonel Hal Moore (Mel Gibson), a dedicated U.S. soldier, is deeply committed to training his troops, who are preparing to be sent to Vietnam. The night before their departure, the unit's officers hold a party to celebrate. Moore learns from a superior officer that his unit will be known as the 1st Battalion / 7th cavalry regiment. He is disquieted because the 7th Cavalry regiment was the unit commanded by General George Custer in the 19th Century when he and his men were slaughtered at the Battle of the Little Bighorn in 1876. Moore is also dismayed because President Lyndon B. Johnson has decreed that the war would be fought \\"on the cheap,\\" without declaring it a national emergency. As a result, Moore believes he will be deprived of his oldest, best-trained soldiers (a formal declaration of war would have meant mobilization and extension of the terms of enlistment for volunteer soldiers) - about 25% of his battalion - just prior to shipping out for Vietnam. Before leaving for Vietnam, Moore delivers a touching speech to his unit:\\"Look around you, in the 7th Cavalry,we got a Captain from the Ukraine, another from Puerto Rico, we got Japanese, Chinese, Blacks, Hispanics, Cherokee Indian, Jews and Gentiles, all American.

Jan Brewer a “lone ranger” and says he agrees with Sarah Palin that President Obama \\"lacks 'the cojones' to deal with illegal immigration.\\" But the good stuff comes later in the article, when he lists his favorite “Jan Brewer Facts” (yes, she has her own fake “facts,” inspired by the “Chuck Norris Facts”), including, “Jan Brewer flosses her teeth with barbed wire from the border.” Norris insists Brewer has even “tougher skin than me,” and commends her for her “pure, unadulterated patriotism” while bashing Obama’s meager attempts to secure the border: His deployment of 1200 National Guardsmen to “support” border security efforts pales in comparison to the 1400 National Guardsmen sent to the Gulf after the oil spill, Norris argues. “Indeed, when the president calls the BP oil spill ‘an invasion’ and illegal immigrants ‘undocumented workers,’ you can bet something is amiss in the Oval Office.” For more of Norris's political thoughts, click here or here.","completion":"Imagine your favorite super-hero, Walker, Texas Ranger. Do you remember him? The tough guy who made sure bad guys never got away with their bad deeds? He was played by a guy named Chuck Norris, who is very cool and strong, just like the way you'd want to be when you grow up. Well, Chuck Norris wrote something in a big people's newspaper called World Net Daily. He was talking about a very important thing called 'securing our borders', which is about keeping our country safe from people who might want to come in without permission. In his writing, Chuck talked about a brave lady named Jan Brewer. He thinks she is doing a great job at being the governor of a place called Arizona. He even calls her a \\"lone ranger\\", which means she is bravely doing things all by herself. Guess what, another important person, Sarah Palin, believes the President, who is kind of like our head teacher, is not being tough enough about this issue. Chuck also had some fun in his writing. He shared some of his most liked \\"Jan Brewer Facts\\". These are jokes like, \\"Jan Brewer flosses her teeth with barbed wire from the border\\". That sounds silly, right? But it's just his way of saying that she's really brave and tough, even more than him. Chuck Norris is not afraid to say what he thinks. He said that he doesn't like how President Obama is trying to keep our borders secure. He pointed out that when a big spill happened in the Gulf, where a lot of oil went into the ocean, 1400 soldiers were sent to help. But only 1200 soldiers were sent to protect our borders. He thinks that's wrong and should be more. Lastly, he jokes about how the President calls bad things good names. When oil spills into the ocean, it’s called an 'invasion', and when people come into our country without permission, they’re called 'undocumented workers'. He thinks this is a mix-up. So, Walker, Texas Ranger, or Chuck Norris, like in real life, is doing what he thinks is right and telling everyone about it.

Answer the following question: Information: - Scotland (Scots: ) is a country that is part of the United Kingdom and covers the northern third of the island of Great Britain. It shares a border with England to the south, and is otherwise surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to the east and the North Channel and Irish Sea to the south-west. In addition to the mainland, the country is made up of more than 790 islands, including the Northern Isles and the Hebrides. - The Court of Session is the supreme civil court of Scotland, and constitutes part of the College of Justice. It sits in Parliament House in Edinburgh and is both a trial court and a court of appeal. The Court of Session has coextensive jurisdiction with the Sheriff Courtthe other Scottish civil court, which sits locallyand the pursuer is given first choice of what court to use. However, the majority of complex, important, or high value cases are brought in the Court of Session. Legal aid, administered by the Scottish Legal Aid Board, is available to persons with little disposable income for cases in the Court of Session. - The Lord Justice Clerk is the second most senior judge in Scotland, after the Lord President of the Court of Session. - A judge presides over court proceedings, either alone or as a part of a panel of judges. The powers, functions, method of appointment, discipline, and training of judges vary widely across different jurisdictions. The judge is supposed to conduct the trial impartially and in an open court. The judge hears all the witnesses and any other evidence presented by the barristers of the case, assesses the credibility and arguments of the parties, and then issues a ruling on the matter at hand based on his or her interpretation of the law and his or her own personal judgment. In some jurisdictions, the judge's powers may be shared with a jury. In inquisitorial systems of criminal investigation, a judge might also be an examining magistrate. - Sir John Bellenden of Auchnole and Broughton ( died 1 October 1576 ) was , before 1544 , Director of Chancery , and was appointed Lord Justice Clerk on 25 June 1547 , succeeding his father Thomas Bellenden of Auchnoule . John was knighted before April 1544 . - The Lord President of the Court of Session is the most senior judge in Scotland, the head of the judiciary, and the presiding judge of the College of Justice and the Court of Session. The Lord President is also the Lord Justice General of Scotland and the head of the High Court of Justiciary, the two offices having been combined in 1836.

No. The suggested answer does not provide a detailed explanation of the players in Quidditch. Here's a more comprehensive answer: In Quidditch, a fictional sport created by J.K. Rowling in the Harry Potter series, there are seven players on each team. These players have distinct roles: 1. Keeper (1 player): The Keeper's primary role is to guard the three goal hoops and prevent the opposing team's Chasers from scoring with the Quaffle. 2. Chasers (3 players): Chasers are responsible for scoring goals by throwing the Quaffle (a ball) through the opponent's goal hoops. They also work together to maintain possession and create scoring opportunities. 3. Beaters (2 players): Beaters are responsible for protecting their team from the Bludgers (two heavy, enchanted balls) by hitting them towards the opposing team, ideally disrupting their play. Their primary tools are Beater bats, similar to baseball bats. Beaters aim to keep Bludgers away from their teammates and direct them towards the opposition. 4. Seeker (1 player): The Seeker's primary responsibility is to catch the Golden Snitch, a small, fast-moving ball with wings. When the Seeker catches the Snitch, their team is awarded 150 points and the game ends. While Muggle Quidditch is mentioned, it is an adaptation of the fictional sport for real-world play, and the positions and roles remain similar.

Which of the following solutions is more sound in terms of naive physics reasoning?","completion":"To address the objective of storing baby pacifiers, we will analyze two approaches, A and B, and evaluate their soundness based on naive physics reasoning. Approach A: 1. Use a designated container with a lid to store baby pacifiers. 2. Periodically clean and sterilize the pacifiers to maintain hygiene. 3. Mark the container with a label or sign for easy identification, and always place it in the same location. Approach B: 1. Attach pacifiers to a ribbon or string and hang them in a row. 2. Provide some type of covering or canopy to keep them free from dust and debris. 3. Ensure the hanging location is high enough to avoid contact with pets or young children yet within reach for the adults. Naive physics is the understanding of physical principles based on intuition and common-sense assumptions. In this context, we'll assess both approaches with these assumptions in mind. Evaluation: Approach A: - A container with a lid will protect the pacifiers from outside contaminants like dust and dirt and prevent contact with any surrounding surfaces. - Periodically sterilizing pacifiers maintains a consistent level of hygiene for the baby. - Marking the container and keeping it in a consistent spot supports the ease of access and storage organization. Approach B: - Hanging pacifiers on a string or ribbon may save space but leaves them exposed to air, risking possible contamination from airborne particles and dust. - A covering or canopy is not as secure as a closed container since there's still a chance of contaminants finding their way onto the pacifiers. - The accessibility factor is riskier as the height can be a challenge, and any disturbance to the hanging position can cause the pacifiers to fall and get contaminated. Based on a naive physics reasoning perspective, Approach A seems like the more sound solution for storing baby pacifiers. Using a designated container provides better protection against contaminants and maintains a hygienic environment for the pacifiers. This approach is more reliable when considering everyday scenarios and the potential risks that come with storing baby items."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Q:Question: \\"What might a bird who is preening might be involuntarily communicating?\\" Context: \\"Birds sometimes use plumage to assess and assert social dominance, to display breeding condition in sexually selected species, or to make threatening displays, as in the sunbittern's mimicry of a large predator to ward off hawks and protect young chicks. Variation in plumage also allows for the identification of birds, particularly between species. Visual communication among birds may also involve ritualised displays, which have developed from non-signalling actions such as preening, the adjustments of feather position, pecking, or other behaviour. These displays may signal aggression or submission or may contribute to the formation of pair-bonds. The most elaborate displays occur during courtship, where \\"dances\\" are often formed from complex combinations of many possible component movements; males' breeding success may depend on the quality of such displays.\\" Answer: A:","completion":"A bird who is preening might be involuntarily communicating various messages through its actions and appearance. Preening involves the cleaning and maintenance of feathers, which is an essential aspect of a bird's health and survival. Step 1: Analyzing the context In the given context, it is mentioned that birds use plumage to convey social status, display breeding conditions, or make threatening displays. Visual communication in birds may also include ritualized displays that have developed from non-signaling actions such as preening. Step 2: Identifying possible messages Based on the context, a bird who is preening might be involuntarily communicating the following messages: 1. Display of health and physical condition: Preening ensures that the feathers are clean and well-arranged. This involuntary communication might signal to other birds that the preening individual is healthy and well-groomed. 2. Social status: By meticulously preening its feathers, a bird may inadvertently communicate its position in the social hierarchy. A well-groomed appearance may suggest dominance or high social standing. 3. Sexual availability: In some sexually selected species, a bird who is preening might be showcasing its breeding condition to potential mates. This behavior could attract the attention of the opposite sex and lead to courtship interactions. 4. Submission or aggression: Preening may be followed by other displays like feather fluffing or pecking, indicating submission or aggression towards other birds in the vicinity. Although not intentionally signaling these emotions, the preening act may trigger such behavior in response to perceived threats or challenges.

Dr. Donald Blake, a science professor at Dunsford University, receives delivery of a coelacanth. A student, Jimmy, asks Blake if the fish is really a million years old. Blake replies, \\"It's the species that's old. No change in millions of years. See, the coelacanth is a living fossil, immune to the forces of evolution\\". Blake lectures his students about evolution and devolution, telling them that man is the only creature that can decide whether to move forwards or backwards, and that \\"unless we learn to control the instincts we've inherited from our ape-like ancestors, the race is doomed\\". Inside the lab, Blake scratches himself on its teeth of the Partially-thawed coelacanth, accidentally sticking his bloody hand into the water-filled container which held the fish. Molly Riordan, assistant to Dr. Cole Oliver, is with Blake and offers him a ride home. When they get to Molly's car, Blake says he doesn't feel well and passes out. At Blake's home, Molly is attacked by person or persons unknown. Madeline Howard, Blake's fiancee and daughter of Dr. Gilbert Howard, president of the university, arrives and finds the home in shambles and Blake moaning on the ground. Madeline calls the police after seeing Molly hanging by her hair in a tree, her eyes wide, dead. Detective Lt. Mike Stevens and Detective Sgt.

Process: - Water flows into the dishwasher - The dishwasher heats the water - The detergent dispenser opens at the right time - Water is shot through the jets to clean the dishes - The dirty water is drained - More water is sprayed to rinse the dishes - The water is drained again - The air is heated in the dishwasher to dry the dishes. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose the heating element of the dishwasher is broken happens, how will it affect the dishwasher does not heat the water. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process?","completion":"Step 1: Identify the perturbation The perturbation here is that the heating element of the dishwasher is broken. Step 2: Determine effects of the perturbation on different steps of the process Effect on \\"Water flows into the dishwasher\\": There will be no effect on this step since the water flow is not dependent on the heating element. Effect on \\"The dishwasher heats the water\\": With the heating element broken, the dishwasher will not be able to heat the water. This will result in the water remaining at its initial temperature when it enters the dishwasher. Effect on \\"The detergent dispenser opens at the right time\\": The opening of the detergent dispenser is a separate mechanism and is not controlled by the heating element. Thus, there should be no direct effect on this step. Effect on \\"Water is shot through the jets to clean the dishes\\": Although the water jets' functioning is independent of the heating element, the washing process will be less effective due to the water not being heated. The cold water may not dissolve the detergent as effectively and may not break down grease and food residues as efficiently. Effect on \\"The dirty water is drained\\": There will be no effect on this step since draining the water is not dependent on the heating element. Effect on \\"More water is sprayed to rinse the dishes\\": As with the cleaning step, the rinsing process will still happen, but using cold water instead of hot water could be less effective in removing any remaining detergent and food residues. Effect on \\"The water is drained again\\": There will be no effect on this step since draining the water is not dependent on the heating element. Effect on \\"The air is heated in the dishwasher to dry the dishes\\": With the broken heating element, the dishwasher will not be able to heat the air to dry the dishes, leaving the dishes wet after the cycle is completed. Step 3: Analyze the overall impact of the perturbation In conclusion, the perturbation of a broken heating element has both direct and indirect effects on the dishwasher's process. The direct effects include the inability to heat water and air, affecting cleaning effectiveness and leaving dishes wet. The indirect effects come from these, as cold water may not dissolve detergent or remove food residues effectively, potentially compromising the cleanliness of the dishes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Max Chilton has every confidence he will be retained by Marussia for a third consecutive season. Chilton started the campaign relatively strongly, claiming the best results of his Formula One career by finishing 13th in the season-opening race in Australia and again in Bahrain. In Monaco, however, team-mate Jules Bianchi stole Chilton's thunder as the Frenchman scored Marussia's first points from their four and a half years in F1 with ninth place in Monaco. Centre of attention: Max Chilton remains hopeful of being retained by Marussia for the 2015 season. Since then Chilton has struggled for form and results, but the 23-year-old from Reigate in Surrey sees no reason why Marussia would not retain him for 2015. 'I naturally want to stay with the team,' said Chilton. 'Like a lot of these things they filter down from the top, and there are a lot of rumours with regard to the top of the grid, with people moving around and you don't really know where you stand until then. 'I won't focus on that until later on in the year, but I'm confident I'll be here next year. I've had good races this year. 'I started off fairly strong, and okay the last few have not been particularly great, but I feel we've got to the bottom of that. Overall I've been consistent and had good results.' Chilton may yet be thanking Bianchi for that result in Monaco as the young Briton would like to believe it could play a key role in his own future. On track: The British driver joined the team in 2013 and finished every race of his debut season. Those two points mean Marussia lie ninth in the constructors' title race ahead of both Sauber and Caterham. If Marussia can hold on to that position the financial rewards would be considerable, which in turn may mean Chilton not having to find the cash to fund his seat. 'Marussia have a good future, especially if we hold off Sauber for ninth. That would really build up momentum,' added Chilton. 'That would be a big help to the team financially if we could do that as it would help us develop the car for next year. 'If the team gets this ninth then we might not need to worry about that (his financial situation). That's just me really thinking of the bigger picture. 'I've not properly looked into it, but I'd like to think I could continue to help the team develop over the next couple of years.'

Information: - The Democratic Alliance (AD), originally called Democratic Republican Alliance (ARD), was a French political party (19011978) created in 1901 by followers of Léon Gambetta, such as Raymond Poincaré who would be president of the Council in the 1920s. The party was at first conceived by members of the Radical-Socialist Party tied to the business world who united themselves in May 1901, along with many moderates, as gathering center-left liberals and \\"Opportunist\\" Republicans (Gambetta, etc.). However, after World War I and the parliamentary disappearance of monarchists and Bonapartists, it quickly became the main center-right party of the Third Republic. It was part of the National Bloc right-wing coalition which won the elections after the end of the war. The ARD successively took the name \\"Parti Républicain Démocratique\\" (Democratic Republican Party, PRD) then \\"Parti Républicain Démocratique et Social\\" (\\"Social and Republican Democratic Party\\"), before becoming again the AD. - Léon Gambetta (2 April 1838 31 December 1882) was a French statesman, prominent during and after the Franco-Prussian War. - The Democratic and Social Action ( French : Action démocratique et sociale , ADS ) was a French parliamentary group in the Chamber of Deputies of France during the French Third Republic between 1928 and 1932 . The group was formed by the right - wing ( bourgeois and industrialist wing according to André Siegfried ) of the Democratic Republican Alliance , later Democratic Alliance . A number of ADS deputies were formerly members of the most left - wing faction of the Republican Federation , the main conservative party in France which they had left due to the Federation 's evolution to the right . The ADS was resurrected in 1949 by members of the Democratic and Socialist Union of the Resistance ( UDSR ) who joined the Gaullist Rally of the French People ( RPF ) . - World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier. It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history. - Nazi Germany is the common English name for the period in German history from 1933 to 1945, when Germany was governed by a dictatorship under the control of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party (NSDAP). Under Hitler's rule, Germany was transformed into a fascist state in which the Nazi Party took totalitarian control over nearly all aspects of life. The official name of the state was \\"Deutsches Reich\\" from 1933 to 1943 and \\"Großdeutsches Reich\\" (\\"Greater German Reich\\") from 1943 to 1945. The period is also known under the names the Third Reich and the National Socialist Period (abbreviated as \\"NS-Zeit\\"). The Nazi regime came to an end after the Allied Powers defeated Germany in May 1945, ending World War II in Europe. - World War I (WWI or WW1), also known as the First World War, or the Great War, was a global war originating in Europe that lasted from 28 July 1914 to 11 November 1918. More than 70 million military personnel, including 60 million Europeans, were mobilised in one of the largest wars in history. Over nine million combatants and seven million civilians died as a result of the war (including the victims of a number of genocides), a casualty rate exacerbated by the belligerents' technological and industrial sophistication, and the tactical stalemate caused by gruelling trench warfare. It was one of the deadliest conflicts in history, and paved the way for major political changes, including revolutions in many of the nations involved. - André Siegfried (April 21, 1875 March 28, 1959) was a French academic, geographer and political writer best known for his commentaries on American, Canadian, and British politics. - The Republican Federation (FR) was the largest conservative party during the French Third Republic, gathering together the liberal Orleanists rallied to the Republic. Founded in November 1903, it competed with the more secular and centrist \\"Alliance démocratique\\" (Democratic Alliance). Later, most deputies of the \\"Fédération républicaine\\" and of \\"Action libérale\\" (which included Catholics rallied to the Republic) joined the \\"Entente républicaine démocratique\\" right-wing parliamentary group. - Vichy (is a city in the Allier department of Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes in central France, in the historic province of Bourbonnais. - Raymond Nicolas Landry Poincaré (20 August 1860 15 October 1934) was a French statesman who served three times as Prime Minister of France, and as President of France from 1913 to 1920. He was a conservative leader, primarily committed to political and social stability. - The French Third Republic (sometimes written as \\"\\") was the system of government adopted in France from 1870, when the Second French Empire collapsed, until 1940, when France's defeat by Nazi Germany in World War II led to the formation of the Vichy government in France. It came to an end on 10 July 1940. - The Second French Empire was the Imperial Bonapartist regime of Napoleon III from 1852 to 1870, between the Second Republic and the Third Republic, in France. What is the relationship between 'democratic and social action' and 'political party'? The answer to this question is:","completion":"The relationship between 'Democratic and Social Action' and 'political party' lies in the fact that the Democratic and Social Action (ADS) was a political formation within the French parliamentary system during the French Third Republic. The term 'political party' generally refers to an organized group of people who share a common ideology or set of goals and work together to promote their ideas, elect representatives to government positions, and influence public policy. In the case of the Democratic and Social Action, it was a parliamentary group in the Chamber of Deputies of France between 1928 and 1932. The group was formed by the right-wing faction of the Democratic Republican Alliance, which in turn was a part of the Democratic Alliance. The ADS represented the interests of its members, often associated with the bourgeois and industrialist factions, within the larger framework of the French political landscape. Therefore, the relationship between 'Democratic and Social Action' and 'political party' is that the Democratic and Social Action was a political formation or subgroup within the larger political party system in France during the Third Republic. It provided a platform for its members to work together and advance their shared political goals within the broader context of French politics."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The recommendation aims to promote stability in the stock market and ensure that companies make well-informed decisions when raising capital through equity offerings. Step 1: Understanding and Interpreting the Statement The CSRC's statement underscores the importance of analyzing market trends and conditions to determine the appropriate timing and strategy for share sales. By encouraging companies to consider the current state of the market, the regulator hopes to maintain a stable financial environment and minimize potential risks associated with irrational equity offerings. Step 2: Significance of Market Analysis Accurate market analysis plays a crucial role in the success of a company's share sale. In addition to evaluating overall market conditions, companies must also consider industry-specific factors and potential impacts on its stock price. A thorough market assessment helps companies establish a strong plan to maximize the benefits of their share offerings while mitigating risks. Step 3: Factors to Consider When gauging market conditions, companies should take into account various factors, such as investor sentiment, industry trends, stock market volatility, and economic outlook. These factors can have a significant impact on a company's share sale strategy and ultimate success. By incorporating these factors into their decision-making process, companies can make more informed share sale plans that safeguard their financial interests. Step 4: Benefits of Following the Stock Regulator's Advice Complying with the CSRC's advice can yield numerous advantages for companies looking to issue shares. Cautiously evaluating market conditions can help companies identify the perfect window to maximize returns on their share offerings. Furthermore, it can reduce the potential of stock price fluctuations after the issuance and minimize overall financial risks associated with share sales. Conclusion: In summary, the China Securities Regulatory Commission has emphasized the importance of market analysis before initiating share sale plans. By carefully assessing market conditions, companies can make well-informed decisions that ultimately benefit their financial performance and market value. Following the regulator's advice can lead to a stable stock market and contribute to the long-term growth of China's economy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The student tried to use the book to learn the new language but the","completion":"terminology was dense and the grammar structures complex, creating an intimidating hurdle for the novice learner. In her determination to master the new language, the student started dedicating a significant part of her evenings, post her regular study hours, to comprehend the language course in the book. Initially, she tried to memorize the terminology, which, in her estimation, was the cornerstone for getting a hang of any new language. The book would introduce her to new words, idioms, phrases, slang, and proverbial language unique to the culture where the language originated. This inevitably exposed the student to a dense lexical field which could be perplexing and discouraging at the same time. In order to tackle this hurdle, she began creating her own glossary of sorts, much like a personalized dictionary which elucidated the meaning, pronunciation and contextual usage of each term. She adopted different language learning strategies like spaced repetition and use of mnemonics which could enhance her memory and lead to better retention. She made index cards, categorizing the various terms based on common themes or root words. She also started practicing with language learning apps during her daily commute which helped her to utilize her time more productively. Simultaneously, she started grappling with the grammatical structures of the new language. The varying sentence patterns, the rules for tense usage, the placement of verbs, and other peculiarities posed a major challenge. The syntax was different from her native language and required a whole new way of thinking. To simplify this, she started working on grammar exercises provided at the end of each chapter in her book, gradually increasing the level of difficulty. She made it a point to practice writing sentences, which helped her understand the natural flow of the language and how its different elements interacted in a sentence. On days when she felt particularly overwhelmed, she opted to watch movies and listen to songs in the target language, thereby enhancing her understanding of conversational language and cultural nuances. By doing so, this helped familiarize her with the accents, pronunciations, and even slang associated with the language which was not detailed in the book. However, the process was not one without tribulations. There were times when she felt particularly exasperated and her self-confidence waned. At such times, she sought help from her peers who were trying to master the same language or turned to online forums where learners from across the world discussed their challenges and shared learning techniques. These platforms provided her with a sense of camaraderie amid her struggles and refueled her motivation to continue. Her journey through the maze of a new language was arduous but this rigorous engagement with the book significantly enhanced her language skills. It girded her with a greater level of commitment and patience, as she realized that learning a language was not a linear process; it was, however, a fascinating exploration of a new way of thinking and perceiving the world. Indeed, the book, with its dense terminology and complex grammar, was a challenge. However, in confronting this challenge head-on, the student uncovered within herself an uncharted potential for resilience and adaptability, skills which would serve her well in the future."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A cooling resistor will increase or decrease in resistance?","completion":"A cooling resistor will generally decrease in resistance. As a resistor cools, its temperature drops, which in turn causes a reduction in the thermal motion of its atoms. Most resistive materials, like metals, follow a simple rule called the temperature coefficient of resistance. This quantifies the change in resistance as a function of temperature. For metals, the resistance usually increases with temperature. Thus, when cooling a resistor, the opposite occurs and its resistance will typically decrease. It's important to note that the effect may vary for different materials, as some materials (such as semiconductors) may have a more complex temperature dependence.

Artsy Louisville hotel again voted best USA's best hotel by Conde Nast Traveler readers By Barbara De Lollis, USA TODAY A Louisville, Ky., boutique hotel that revolves around its owners' 10 million art collection has taken top honors for the second consecutive year in Conde Nast Traveler magazine's Reader Choice Awards. The 21c Museum Hotel - which houses an extensive modern art collection and the highly touted restaurant, Proof - was voted the best hotel in the USA by Traveler readers, the Louisville Courier-Journal reports. The hotel bested traditional luxury hotels such as the Peninsula in Chicago (No. 2) and the Mandarin Oriental in Boston (No. 3), the paper reports. The winners will be published in the magazine's November issue, which hits newsstands Tuesday. Two years ago, by the way, I included the hotel - and its whimsical red penguins - in a USA TODAY roundup of hotels with unusually rich art collections. Globally, Traveler's nearly 26,000 readers who participated in the survey ranked the 21c Museum Hotel the sixth-best hotel in the world for the second year running. \\"I'm amazed,\\" Steve Wilson, who with his wife, Laura Lee Brown, opened the 90-room hotel four years ago, tells the paper. The hotel dedicates 9,000 square feet to gallery space, but also features art in guestrooms, in the restaurant Proof, and even in public bathrooms. \\"Most hotels use art as decoration,\\" Wilson says, while museums often \\"don't recognize or accept the cult of commerce.\\" The hotel's art collection includes Text Rain, an interactive video installation by conceptual artists Camille Utterback, an American artist, and Romy Achituv, an Israeli artist. The hotel's owners in the past have said they'd like to build more 21c Museum Hotels in other cities, so we'll have to keep an eye out for them in the future. To celebrate its victory, the hotel's offering a complimentary toast of Woodford Reserve Bourban and a rate deal. Mention ROCKSTAR when calling to book a Thursday night or Sunday night getaway. See the hotel's website for details. Here's a link to the full list of the other winning hotels in the USA. Readers: Which hotels in the USA would you rank No. 1 and No. 2?

So, you know how your toy boxes are in your playroom? Just like that, the data you're seeing is telling us that Alpharetta is inside the bigger area named Georgia, just like a little toy is part of your entire toy collection. Alpharetta is a small city, and it's tucked right into a larger spot called Georgia. This Georgia is not any Georgia but a special one that is a state in the country that we call the United States, or U.S. If you think about it like a set of Russian nesting dolls, Alpharetta would be a smaller doll that fits right into the bigger doll, which here is Georgia. In other words, Alpharetta is a part of Georgia in the same way that your toy box is a part of your playroom."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The only thing of interest here was their attempt to show the feds being a lot like the gang. This is the only attempt at good film-making. The rest of the movie was predictable, and cheaply-made. The quality of the photography on some of the scenes inside bars and floozy joints almost made you think there was a problem with your DVD player because of the bad contrasts and some of the actors were hard to hear at times because of the bad sound. The acting was pretty-much characatures of all your favorite gangsters from better movies with corny names like Vinnie \`Knuckles' and Jimmie \`Tattoos', and the plot pretty much followed those patterns as well. So, go see a better gangster movie before you put your money out for this one.","completion":"The correct sentiment from the given candidates for the movie review text is (a). negative.

He was a part of the Samanid dynasty. 2. Reign and territory: He ruled over the city of Herat from 856 to around 867. Herat is located in present-day Afghanistan, and during this period, it was under the Samanid rule. 3. Inheritance: Upon his father's death in 856, Ibrahim inherited control of the city of Herat. 4. Military leadership: Ibrahim ibn Ilyas served as a military leader under the Tahirid governor of Khurasan, Muhammad ibn Tahir. The Tahirids were an Iranian dynasty who were governing Khurasan on behalf of the Abbasid Caliphate during this period. 5. Involvement in conflict: In 867, Ibrahim was sent by Muhammad ibn Tahir to battle against the upstart Saffarid ruler, Ya'qub bin Laith. The Saffarids were also an Iranian dynasty and their rule marked the start of the Iranian intermezzo period in the region. 6. Battle and defeat: Ibrahim ibn Ilyas faced defeat near Pushang, a location in modern-day Iran, in his battle against the Saffarids. This led him to advise Muhammad ibn Tahir to seek a compromise with the Saffarids to avoid further conflict. 7. Capture and consequences: Despite Ibrahim's advice, conflict persisted between the two sides. Eventually, Ibrahim was captured by the Saffarids in the city of Nishapur, located in present-day Iran, and sent to Sistan. The Tahirids then took direct control over the city of Herat.
