Do you think the right answer to the question \\"name one kind of a protein that some viruses have inside their phospholid envelope?\\" is \\"more abundant\\", given that some viruses have intrinsic proteins? Answer:","completion":"No, the answer \\"more abundant\\" does not accurately represent a specific protein found within a virus's phospholipid envelope. Instead, a more appropriate answer to this question would be \\"Matrix protein (M protein)\\" or \\"Envelope protein (E protein).\\" These proteins have specific biological functions and are present in the phospholipid envelope of some enveloped viruses. Matrix proteins (M proteins) are structural proteins found in the phospholipid envelope of viruses such as Influenza virus and Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), acting as connectors between virus's envelope and the nucleocapsid core. M proteins provide structural support and assist in the assembly of new virions. Envelope proteins (E proteins) are also integral components of a virus's phospholipid envelope, primarily involved in host-cell recognition and fusion. This protein plays a crucial role in the early stages of viral infection by facilitating the entry of the virus into the host cell. An example of such envelope proteins can be found in the respiratory syncytial virus and Dengue virus. It is essential to note that not all viruses have a phospholipid envelope; some viruses are non-enveloped and consist of only a protein capsid surrounding their genetic material."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: You make decisions, year after year, never lasting for more than a few days ending up lost and in the same place you started. Allow me to suggest some tips that may help you stick to your decisions creating long- lasting positive change in your life. Telling other people about your plan can help in many ways. First, it is always easier to stick to a decision when you have other people supporting you. Your friends are less likely to tempt you with whatever it is you are trying to control if they know that you made a decision about it. Telling other people about your decision is also helpful in that it keeps us to the pressure on you to try and stick to you plan of action. Choose a measurable and specific decision. Instead of deciding to \\"look better\\" or \\"have a better relationship with so and so\\", choose a more definable decision. Deciding to \\"eat a vegetable every day\\" or \\"go out for coffee once a week with John\\" is much easier to track and assess than a general decision to \\"be a better person\\". Build a reward system. Connected to the last tip of choosing a measurable and specific decision is that when you do accomplish this specific behavior you decided to do, give yourself small rewards along the process. For example, for every week of healthy eating treat yourself with something special. Creative visual aids. A colleague of mine decided one year for his New Year's decision to be more frugal. He decided to try and save money by lowering his monthly bills. So he posted a copy of his highest electric bill by his heater so that every time he wanted to raise the temperature he would see the high electric bill reminding him to be more cautious about his energy consumption. Question: Why does the writer advise telling your plan to other people? Yes or no, is the answer \\"Because they will offer you support and pressure.\\"?","completion":"Yes, the writer advises telling your plan to other people because they will offer you support and pressure. The support from your friends helps you avoid temptation, and the pressure to stick to your plan ensures you remain committed to the decision, ultimately leading to long-lasting, positive change in your life."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

So Adam takes the bucket by the handle and quickly starts spinning it in a circle. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Will the centripetal force on the bucket increase or decrease as Adam spins it faster? Answer:","completion":"To answer the question, let's consider the steps and the science behind the trick. Step 1: Understand the situation Adam is spinning a bucket of water in a circle, without any water spilling out. Step 2: Identify the forces involved In this case, the main force to consider is centripetal force, which acts towards the center of the rotation and keeps the bucket and water in circular motion. Step 3: Analyze the relationship between speed and centripetal force Centripetal force is given by the formula: F_c = mv^2/r, where m is the mass of the object (the bucket and water), v is the velocity (or speed) of the object, and r is the radius of the circle. Step 4: Determine the effect of increasing the speed If Adam spins the bucket faster, the velocity (v) in the equation increases. According to the formula, as the velocity increases, the centripetal force also increases, since the two variables are directly proportional.

Born at Podolskaya Street in Saint Petersburg, Russia, Shostakovich was the second of three children of Dmitri Boleslavovich Shostakovich and Sofiya Vasilievna Kokoulina. Shostakovich's paternal grandfather, originally surnamed Szostakowicz, was of Polish Roman Catholic descent (his family roots trace to the region of the town of Vileyka in today's Belarus), but his immediate forebears came from Siberia. A Polish revolutionary in the January Uprising of 1863–4, Bolesław Szostakowicz would be exiled to Narym (near Tomsk) in 1866 in the crackdown that followed Dmitri Karakozov's assassination attempt on Tsar Alexander II. When his term of exile ended, Szostakowicz decided to remain in Siberia. He eventually became a successful banker in Irkutsk and raised a large family. His son Dmitri Boleslavovich Shostakovich, the composer's father, was born in exile in Narim in 1875 and studied physics and mathematics in Saint Petersburg University, graduating in 1899. He then went to work as an engineer under Dmitri Mendeleev at the Bureau of Weights and Measures in Saint Petersburg. In 1903 he married another Siberian transplant to the capital, Sofiya Vasilievna Kokoulina, one of six children born to a Russian Siberian native.Their son, Dmitri Dmitriyevich Shostakovich, displayed significant musical talent after he began piano lessons with his mother at the age of nine. On several occasions he displayed a remarkable ability to remember what his mother had played at the previous lesson, and would get \\"caught in the act\\" of playing the previous lesson's music while pretending to read different music placed in front of him. In 1918 he wrote a funeral march in memory of two leaders of the Kadet party, murdered by Bolshevik sailors.In 1919, at the age of 13, he was admitted to the Petrograd Conservatory, then headed by Alexander Glazunov, who monitored Shostakovich's progress closely and promoted him.

Most federal agencies learned about the crash in New York from CNN. Within the FAA, the administrator, Jane Garvey, and her acting deputy, Monte Belger, had not been told of a confirmed hijacking before they learned from television that a plane had crashed. Others in the agency were aware of it, as we explained earlier in this chapter. Inside the National Military Command Center, the deputy director of operations and his assistant began notifying senior Pentagon officials of the incident. At about 9:00, the senior NMCC operations officer reached out to the FAA operations center for information. Although the NMCC was advised of the hijacking of American 11, the scrambling of jets was not discussed. In Sarasota, Florida, the presidential motorcade was arriving at the Emma E. Booker Elementary School, where President Bush was to read to a class and talk about education. White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card told us he was standing with the President outside the classroom when Senior Advisor to the President Karl Rove first informed them that a small, twin-engine plane had crashed into the World Trade Center. The President's reaction was that the incident must have been caused by pilot error. At 8:55, before entering the classroom, the President spoke to National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice, who was at the White House. She recalled first telling the President it was a twin-engine aircraft-and then a commercial aircraft-that had struck the World Trade Center, adding \\"that's all we know right now, Mr. President.\\" At the White House, Vice President Dick Cheney had just sat down for a meeting when his assistant told him to turn on his television because a plane had struck the NorthTower of the World Trade Center.

Answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the name of the location that had a high discharge of 111 cubic feet per second? White Deer Hole Creek is in a sandstone, limestone, and shale mountain region, entirely in the Ridge-and-valley Appalachians. South and North White Deer Ridge and Bald Eagle Mountain are composed of sedimentary Ordovician rock, while the valley rock is Silurian, with a small Devonian region closer to the river, in the north. The watershed has no deposits of coal, nor natural gas or oil fields. The creek is in a narrow mountain valley with steep slopes in its upper reaches. In its middle and lower reaches it has steep mountain slopes to the south, and a wide valley with rolling hills and gentle slopes to the north. The channel pattern is transitional, with a trellised drainage pattern.From 1961 to 1995, the United States Geological Survey (USGS) operated one stream gauge on White Deer Hole Creek at the Gap Road bridge (upstream of Elimsport), for the uppermost 18.2 square miles (47 km2) of the watershed. The highest yearly peak discharge measured at this site was 4,200 cubic feet (120 m3) per second and the highest yearly peak gauge height was 11.83 feet (3.61 m), both on June 22, 1972, during Hurricane Agnes. The lowest yearly peak discharge in this time period was 135 cubic feet (3.8 m3) per second and the lowest yearly peak gauge height was 4.29 feet (1.31 m), both on November 26, 1986. The USGS also measured discharge at Allenwood, very near the creek's mouth, as part of water quality measurements on seven occasions between 1970 and 1975. The average discharge was 70.4 cubic feet (1.99 m3) per second, and ranged from a high of 111 cubic feet (3.1 m3) per second to a low of 33 cubic feet (0.93 m3) per second.

Based on the sentence \\"People milling about after a show.\\", is the sentence \\"People are milling about after a show.\\" a true sentence?","completion":"Yes, the sentence \\"People are milling about after a show.\\" is a true sentence as it conveys the same meaning as the original sentence, \\"People milling about after a show.\\" Both sentences convey that a group of people are moving around or mingling in a somewhat aimless or relaxed manner after a show or event has taken place. The original sentence is an example of a reduced form, where the verb 'to be' has been omitted, a common occurrence in informal settings and casual conversation. In this case, the verb 'to be' is understood rather than stated explicitly. The sentence still retains its meaning and is generally understood by English speakers without any confusion. By adding \\"are\\" to the original sentence, it becomes a complete sentence with a subject (\\"People\\") and a verb (\\"are milling about\\") while retaining the same meaning. This makes it a true sentence since it reflects an accurate and grammatically-structured representation of the original statement. In summary, both sentences – \\"People milling about after a show\\" and \\"People are milling about after a show\\" – convey the same event and meaning, where people engage in aimless or relaxed movements and interactions following a show. Although the original sentence omits the verb 'to be,' this does not impede the intended meaning, and the addition of 'to be' in the form of \\"are\\" in the second sentence further clarifies the statement and is therefore considered a true sentence."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Passage:During the Napoleonic wars, Île de France became a base from which the French navy, including squadrons under Rear Admiral Linois or Commodore Jacques Hamelin, and corsairs such as Robert Surcouf, organised raids on British merchant ships. The raids (see Battle of Pulo Aura and Mauritius campaign of 1809–1811) continued until 1810 when the British sent a strong expedition to capture the island. The first British attempt, in August 1810, to attack Grand Port resulted in a French victory, one celebrated on the Arc de Triomphe in Paris. A subsequent and much larger attack launched in December of the same year from Rodrigues, which had been captured a year earlier, was successful. The British landed in large numbers in the north of the island and rapidly overpowered the French, who capitulated (see Invasion of Isle de France). In the Treaty of Paris (1814), the French ceded Île de France together with its territories including Rodrigues and Seychelles to Great Britain. The island then reverted to its former name, 'Mauritius'.","completion":"Task: Determine whether information from more than one term in the context passage is needed to answer the question.

He was given the extensive name Andrew Aaron Lewis Patrick Brannock John Grieve Michael Robert Oscar Schmidt Johnston. Johnston's parents separated when he was eight months old, and from that time he lived with his mother and three older siblings in Carlisle, Cumbria, in the north of England, where he attended Trinity School. Johnston tried out for Carlisle Cathedral Choir at the age of six at the recommendation of Kim Harris, a teacher at his primary school. He was auditioned by the choirmaster Jeremy Suter and accepted into the choir at the age of seven. Johnston's mother, who had no previous association with the cathedral, described her feelings of being overwhelmed by emotion at having her boy singing in such a \\"stunning building among those extraordinary voices\\". His mother also described Johnston's busy regimen of practice four times a week and all day Sundays, saying that it took up all of their spare time. However, she said that the cathedral staff became like a family to her son, and that \\"it was such a lovely, safe, close feeling for him\\". Johnston, who attended Trinity School, was subject to abuse and threats from bullies which drove him to contemplate quitting the choir, but he was helped through the ordeal by his choirmaster and the dean and canons of the cathedral. By the time of his participation in Britain's Got Talent, Johnston was head chorister.In September 2008, after his appearance on Britain's Got Talent but before the release of his first album, Johnston embarked on a tour of Norway with the choir, performing at Stavanger Cathedral and Utstein Abbey, among other places. The tour was conceived because the Diocese of Stavanger is connected with the Diocese of Carlisle through the Partnership for World Mission. This was Johnston's last tour with the choir. Johnston features as head chorister on one of the choir's albums, The Choral Music of F.W Wadely, released in November 2008. answer the following question: What is the first name of the person who tried out for Carlisle Cathedral Choir at the age of six?

Please answer the following question: Read the article and select the best answer. Article: Great white sharks! Just hearing that name _ . In reality, these big fish have more to fear from us than we do from them. For many years, people killed countless great white sharks in the waters around the United States. But thanks to conservation efforts, great whites are making a comeback in the U.S. Two recent studies show that the population of these sharks is rising along the east and west coast. Why is the growing population of a killer fish something to celebrate? \\"When you fish too many of them, you start to lose balance in the environment,\\" says shark researcher Tobey Curtis. As the biggest killer, sharks help keep the populations of fish, seals, and other creatures they eat from growing too large. In spite of their importance, great white sharks had long been hunted for their meat and their fins . Then, in 1997, the U.S. government passed a law that didn't allow the hunting of great whites. Afterwards, the numbers of these sharks in the U.S. waters started to increase. The law wasn't the only thing that has helped great whites. Conservationists have also played a part in the sharks' comeback. The research group OCEARCH is using a method called tagging to help change people's attitudes about great white. They let the public follow each shark as it travels the world's oceans. OCEARCH also gives each tagged shark a name to help people form a closer connection with the big fish. The group's most well-known shark is named Katharine. She was tagged last year near Cape Cod, Massachusetts. Since then, thousands of people have tracked Katharine's movements on Twitter and the OCEARCH website. This helps people see sharks in a new way. Chris Fischer, the founder of OCEARCH believes learning to appreciate great whites will encourage people to do more to protect them. Question: The main purpose of the passage is to _ . Options: A: introduce an experiment result B: make an advertisement for OCEARCH C: remind us that big killers are dying out D: inform us that great whites are making a comeback Answer:","completion":"D: Inform us that great white sharks are making a comeback. The article primarily discusses the growing population of great white sharks, a consequence of various conservation efforts put in place to protect them. It outlines the past scenario where people used to hunt the shark species extensively for their meat and fins, leading to a significant decrease in their population. However, due to laws passed in 1997 by the U.S government banning the hunting of great white sharks, their numbers have started to rebound. Additionally, the article also discusses the role of conservationists, particularly research group OCEARCH, in nurturing a healthy perception towards these sharks amongst the public. Through a method called 'tagging', they allow the public to track the sharks' movements and promote greater understanding of their nature and behavior. By personifying these sharks and giving them names, they enable the public to create a personal connection with these creatures, thereby altering attitudes towards them and encouraging further conservation efforts. Thus, while part of the text discusses the role of OCEARCH, it does not serve as an advertisement for them. The information about shark overfishing is presented as context to the primary message about the 'comeback of the great white sharks'. The purpose of the article is not to introduce an experiment result, nor to remind us that 'big killers' (as in apex predators) are dying out. Conversely, it informs us they are experiencing a resurgence due to successful conservation efforts."},{"prompt":"Title: Keep moving... nothing to see here.... Review: OK.

With members John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr, they became widely regarded as the foremost and most influential act of the rock era. Rooted in skiffle, beat, and 1950s rock and roll, the Beatles later experimented with several musical styles, ranging from pop ballads and Indian music to psychedelia and hard rock, often incorporating classical elements and unconventional recording techniques in innovative ways. In the early 1960s, their enormous popularity first emerged as \\"Beatlemania\\", but as the group's music grew in sophistication, led by primary songwriters Lennon and McCartney, they came to be perceived as an embodiment of the ideals shared by the counterculture of the 1960s. - Portland Bill is a narrow promontory (or bill) at the southern end of the Isle of Portland, and the southernmost point of Dorset, England. One of Portland's most popular destinations, the popular attraction Portland Bill Lighthouse is found in the area. The surrounding coast of Portland, namely Portland Bill and Chesil Beach, have been notorious for the many vessels that became shipwrecked in the area over the centuries. The dangerous coastline, which features shallow reefs and the Shambles sandbank, was proven more hazardous due to the strong tidal race known as the Portland Race. - Stop motion (hyphenated stop-motion when used as an adjective) is an animation technique that physically manipulates an object so that it appears to move on its own. The object is moved in small increments between individually photographed frames, creating the illusion of movement when the series of frames is played as a fast sequence. Dolls with movable joints or clay figures are often used in stop motion for their ease of repositioning. Stop motion animation using plasticine is called clay animation or \\"clay-mation\\". Not all stop motion requires figures or models; many stop motion films can involve using humans, household appliances and other things for comedic effect. Stop motion using objects is sometimes referred to as object animation. - Norman Rossington (24 December 1928 21 May 1999) was an English actor best remembered for his roles in \\"The Army Game\\", the \\"Carry On\\" films and the Beatles' film \\"A Hard Day's Night\\". - The Adventures of Portland Bill was a British stop motion animated children 's television series made in 1983 . It was set in a fictional lighthouse on the Guillemot Rock , just off the coast from the fictional village of McGuillycuddy . Norman Rossington provided the voice of all the characters , with Portland Bill acting as the narrator of each episode . - Object animation is a form of stop motion animation that involves the animated movements of any non-drawn objects such as toys, blocks, dolls, etc. which are not fully malleable, such as clay or wax, and not designed to look like a recognizable human or animal character. - Children's television series are television programs designed for and marketed to children, normally broadcast programming scheduled for broadcast during the morning and afternoon when children are awake. They can sometimes run during the early evening, allowing younger children to watch them after school. The purpose of the shows is mainly to entertain and sometimes to educate. - Chesil Beach , sometimes called Chesil Bank, in Dorset, southern England is one of three major shingle structures in Britain. Its toponym is derived from the Old English \\"ceosel\\" or \\"cisel\\", meaning \\"gravel\\" or \\"shingle\\". - An actor (or actress for females; see terminology) is a person who portrays a character in a performance. The actor performs \\"in the flesh\\" in the traditional medium of the theatre, or in modern mediums such as film, radio, and television. The analogous Greek term is, literally \\"one who answers\\". The actor's interpretation of their role pertains to the role played, whether based on a real person or fictional character. Interpretation occurs even when the actor is \\"playing themselves\\", as in some forms of experimental performance art, or, more commonly; to act, is to create, a character in performance. - Clay animation or claymation is one of many forms of stop motion animation. Each animated piece, either character or background, is \\"deformable\\"made of a malleable substance, usually Plasticine clay. - The Army Game is a British sitcom that broadcast on ITV from 1957 to 1961. Made in black-and-white, it is about National Service conscription to the post-war British Army. It was created by Sid Colin. Many stars, including Charles Hawtrey, William Hartnell, Bernard Bresslaw, Alfie Bass and Dick Emery became household names, and appeared in the \\"Carry On\\" films, which began with \\"Carry On Sergeant\\", virtually a spin-off.

Biomedical wastes pose great danger in Bangladesh too as a report estimated that 20% of the biomedical waste is \\"highly infectious\\" and is a hazard since it is often disposed of into the sewage system or drains.[6] Such poor sanitation has serious consequences for the health of the residents and a report suggests that \\"most of the child mortality could be related with this problem\\".[7] With regards to the living standards, solid waste leads to blockage in the drainage system which leads to flooding in the streets.

From discovering how Vitamin D can best be absorbed, to unlocking the potential of stem cells, Wisconsin has pioneered remarkable breakthroughs in science that have improved health, saved lives and created jobs. These scientific breakthroughs have not only led to life-saving medical technologies but also have fostered a strong power in Wisconsin economy. Across America, groundbreaking research supported by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) alone adds millions of dollars to our economy every year. In fact, NIH funding generated an estimated 58 billion in economic output nationwide in 2014. NIH funding spurs economic growth by supporting jobs in research and by generating biomedical innovations that are turned into new products. NIH-supported innovations also influence improvements in health that can bolster the economy, improve productivity, and reduce illness and disability at home and across the globe. But, budget cuts and inadequate funding for NIH in the past decade have put both medical innovation and our next generation of researchers at risk. Today, too many of our talented young scientists are deciding to do something else, or are leaving the country to pursue their research. Simply put, scientific and medical innovation depends on our ability to foster, support and invest in these new researchers. That is why I have worked across party lines with Senator Susan Collins of Maine and introduced the Next Generation (NextGen) Researchers Act. Our act builds opportunities for new researchers, helps address the debt burden that young scientists face today, and invests in the future of research, science, and innovation.

Questions: What can planning vacation lead to between a couple when they disagree? Options: - relaxation - enjoying - arguments - going abroad - spending money The answer is:","completion":"arguments. When a couple is planning a vacation and they disagree on certain aspects, it can lead to arguments between them. These disagreements may stem from various factors such as differences in preferences, budget constraints, or the choice of destination. It is crucial for couples to have open communication and address any conflicts to ensure a positive vacation planning experience. Although the other options listed could be outcomes of a vacation, they do not directly address the question of what can happen between a couple when they disagree while planning. To briefly touch upon the other options: - Relaxation: This is a positive outcome that vacations often provide, but it is not the result of a disagreement during the planning process. - Enjoying: Similar to relaxation, enjoying a vacation is a possible outcome of a successful trip but does not specifically answer the question about disagreements during the planning stage. - Going abroad: This is an example of a type of vacation, which does not directly address the issue of disagreements arising during the planning process. - Spending money: While spending money is an inevitable part of any vacation, it does not speak to the potential disagreements that may occur between a couple while planning their trip. Thus, the most relevant and accurate answer to the question, \\"What can planning a vacation lead to between a couple when they disagree?\\" is \\"arguments,\\" as it specifically identifies a potential consequence caused by disagreements during the planning process."},{"prompt":"Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What were the names of the two songs Saint-Saëns wrote during his career? From the age of six and for the rest of his life Saint-Saëns composed mélodies, writing more than 140. He regarded his songs as thoroughly and typically French, denying any influence from Schubert or other German composers of Lieder. Unlike his protégé Fauré, or his rival Massenet, he was not drawn to the song cycle, writing only two during his long career – Mélodies persanes (\\"Persian Songs\\", 1870) and Le Cendre rouge (\\"The Red Ash Tree\\", 1914, dedicated to Fauré). The poet whose works he set most often was Victor Hugo; others included Alphonse de Lamartine, Pierre Corneille, Amable Tastu, and, in eight songs, Saint-Saëns himself: among his many non-musical talents he was an amateur poet. He was highly sensitive to word setting, and told the young composer Lili Boulanger that to write songs effectively musical talent was not enough: \\"you must study the French language in depth; it is indispensable.\\" Most of the mélodies are written for piano accompaniment, but a few, including \\"Le lever du soleil sur le Nil\\" (\\"Sunrise over the Nile\\", 1898) and \\"Hymne à la paix\\" (\\"Hymn to Peace\\", 1919), are for voice and orchestra. His settings, and chosen verses, are generally traditional in form, contrasting with the free verse and less structured forms of a later generation of French composers, including Debussy.Saint-Saëns composed more than sixty sacred vocal works, ranging from motets to masses and oratorios. Among the larger-scale compositions are the Requiem (1878) and the oratorios Le déluge (1875) and The Promised Land (1913) with an English text by Herman Klein. He was proud of his connection with British choirs, commenting, \\"One likes to be appreciated in the home, par excellence, of oratorio.\\" He wrote a smaller number of secular choral works, some for unaccompanied choir, some with piano accompaniment and some with full orchestra. In his choral works, Saint-Saëns drew heavily on tradition, feeling that his models should be Handel, Mendelssohn and other earlier masters of the genre. In Klein's view, this approach...

Question: how are tropical storms and hurricanes named I found the following answer on Google: Tropical cyclones strengthen when water evaporated from the ocean is released as the saturated air rises, resulting in condensation of water vapor contained in the moist air. Is that a correct answer? Yes or no.","completion":"No, the answer you provided explains how tropical cyclones form, not how they are named. To answer your question about how tropical storms and hurricanes are named: 1. Identify the responsible organization: Hurricane and tropical storm names are determined by regional meteorological organizations. For example, in the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific regions, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) is responsible for naming these storms. 2. Understand the naming system: Names are chosen and maintained in lists that are used in rotation. Each list typically consists of 21 names, alternating between male and female names, and are reused every six years. The names are typically easy to pronounce, so they can be clearly communicated to the public. 3. Know the criteria for naming storms: When a tropical cyclone forms, it is given a name once it reaches tropical storm strength, which is defined by sustained winds of at least 39 miles per hour (63 kilometers per hour). If a tropical storm strengthens further and reaches hurricane status (sustained winds of 74 miles per hour or 119 kilometers per hour), it retains its name. 4. Account for retired names: If a hurricane causes significant damage or results in a high number of casualties, its name may be retired from the list and replaced with a different name at the discretion of the WMO. So, in conclusion, the process of naming hurricanes and tropical storms involves a well-organized system maintained by responsible organizations like the WMO, utilizing predetermined lists of alternating names, and accounting for retired names when necessary."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Q:Article: Centuries ago, man discovered that removing moisture from food helps to store it, and that the easiest way to do this is to expose the food to sun and wind. In this way the North American Indians produce pemmican(dried meat ground into powder and made into cakes), the Scandinavians make stockfish and the Arabs dried dates. All foods include water--cabbage and other leaf vegetables contains as much as 93% water, potatoes and other root vegetables 80%, lean meat 75% and fish, anything from 80% to 60%, depending on how fatty it is. If this water is removed, the activity of the bacteria which cause food to go bad is checked. Fruit is sun-dried in Asia Minor, Greece, Spain and other Mediterranean countries, and also in California, South Africa and Australia. Various methods are used, but in general, the fruit is spread out on trays in drying yards in the hot sun. Nowadays most foods are dried mechanically. The method of such dehydration is to put food in chambers through which hot air is blown at temperatures of about 110degC at entry to about 43degC at exit. This is the usual method for drying such things as vegetables, minced meat, and fish. Dried foods take up less room and weigh less than the same food packed in cans or frozen, and they do not need to be stored in special conditions. For these reasons they are invaluable to the climbers, explorers and soldiers in battle, who have little storage space. They are also popular with housewives because it takes so little time to cook them. Usually it is just a case of replacing the dried-out moisture with boiling water.

Context: The context in which the review has been placed is crucial. If this review is for a specific app or product, it may be relevant but lacks specificity. In the case of a more general topic, such as a review for an app store or mobile device, the request for an additional sponsored app might make more sense, but it would still be useful for the reviewer to specify which kind of sponsored app they have in mind. 2. Attitude: The tone of the review sounds more like a suggestion or a feature request rather than a review of the existing product or service. There's no indication of whether the reviewer enjoyed or disliked the current offering, which makes it difficult for others to gauge their experience. A valuable review would typically share their opinion on the product or app. 3. Clarity: The message conveyed in the review is quite vague, as it doesn't explain the reasoning behind the request or provide sufficient detail to understand the reviewer's preferences or expectations. An effective review should be clear, concise, and informative, allowing prospective users to grasp the reviewer's sentiment and form their own opinions based on this feedback. With these factors in mind, I would give the review a rating of 2 out of 5. While the suggestion of adding an additional sponsored app could be useful in certain contexts, the review lacks specificity and fails to provide any insight into the reviewer's experience with the existing product or service.

Mr Sarkozy said he \\"felt he had the strength to lead the combat at such a tormented moment in our history.\\" No-one doubts his energy, but a number of obstacles must be overcome if he is to fight his way back to the Elysee. Nicolas Sarkozy served as French president from 2007 to 2012, and the country he left behind as he walked from the Elysee was not a happy one. The campaign promises of a land where people could \\"work more to earn more\\" had vanished. Unemployment was back near 10%; the deficit ballooning; and the much-vaunted \\"rupture\\" with the country's uncompetitive past as much a dream as five years previously. Mr Sarkozy could argue - with some justice - that all his plans to rewire the economy had gone down the drain by the 2008 world crisis. But still the man with all the answers turned out to be mainly mouth. Profile: Nicolas Sarkozy Nicolas Sarkozy may want to be the centre-right candidate next April, but sadly for him others have the same idea. There are in fact 10 other runners in the November primary, most of whom have no chance whatsoever and are merely putting down markers for the future. A couple are serious rivals. There is Mr Sarkozy's former Prime Minister Francois Fillon - the man who learned to swallow hard and keep looking impassive through whatever his master's latest putdown. And then there is Alain Juppe - another former prime minister. Right now Mr Juppe is in fact the favourite to win in the November primary - so Mr Sarkozy has a tough and potentially bitter fight ahead. Mr Sarkozy's enemies have always given themselves heart from the thought that if all else fails to bring him down, justice will. The list of \\"affaires\\" in which the former president is embroiled is long and very complicated. Two stand out. In the first, Mr Sarkozy is accused of knowingly exceeding campaign funding limits in the 2012 election. In the second, he is said to have put pressure on a judge to reveal details on another case in which he was implicated. In both of these affairs, Mr Sarkozy is \\"mis en examen\\" - in other words he is formally the target of a judicial investigation that might well end in a trial. Were that to happen in the weeks to come, his chances would be scuppered. Luckily for Mr Sarkozy, the wheels of French justice grind exceeding slow. Still - the law is a weak spot. Investigations Nicolas Sarkozy faces Bling is such an annoying, meaningless expression - but Mr Sarkozy undoubtedly suffered from his supposed affinity for a certain kind of lifestyle. He came to be viscerally loathed by a large part of the population - not just as a political figure, but for the kind of man he was. In truth, his lifestyle was not that different from other French leaders'. Carla Bruni was no liability: in fact she is quite admired. Far more problematic was Nicolas Sarkozy's odd personality: impulsive, cocky, braggadocio masking some inner insecurity. Many people didn't like it, and they still don't. If Nicolas Sarkozy ends up against Francois Hollande in 2017 (and it is perfectly possible), it will be an exact re-run of 2012. Could there be a more crying indictment of French politics? And a more potent argument for Marine Le Pen, the leader of the far-right National Front?

As a member of the centre-right Republicans party, Sarkozy must first win the party's primary elections that are set to occur in November. Sarkozy's opponents in the primary race include his former Prime Minister Francois Fillon and another former Prime Minister, Alain Juppe, the latter of whom is currently favored to win. Sarkozy served as France's president between 2007 and 2012 and left office with the country experiencing dissatisfaction under his leadership. Promises of economic prosperity and increased employment went unfulfilled, with unemployment levels nearly 10% and the deficit growing. Sarkozy attributed the failure of his economic plans to the global financial crisis in 2008. If Sarkozy manages to win the primary elections, he still faces several legal challenges related to campaign funding and efforts to influence a judge in another case. Should these investigations lead to a trial, Sarkozy's chances of winning the presidency would be significantly diminished. Additionally, Sarkozy's public image, particularly his perceived lavish lifestyle and overconfidence, has been a liability for him. His personality has been the cause of distaste for many, which might stand in the way of his political ambitions. If Nicolas Sarkozy and current President Francois Hollande are the two main contenders in the 2017 French presidential election, it would be a reiteration of the elections in 2012, highlighting the lack of progress and change within the French political sphere, and potentially boosting interest in the far-right National Front party, led by Marine Le Pen."},{"prompt":"Is this product review positive?

Write an article based on this \\"More than 50 jobs have been lost at a 50-year-old Aberdeen engineering firm - with dozens more at risk - after administrators were called in due to the effects of the low oil price.\\"","completion":"Title: Oh No! An Old Engineering Company Loses Jobs Because of Low Oil Prices Once upon a time, in a city called Aberdeen, there was a big engineering company. This company was very old – 50 years old! The people who worked there would design and build things really well. Everyone living in the city knew this company, and they liked it. Because the company was important and busy, it gave work to more than 50 people. So, these people had jobs that helped them earn money to buy things like food, clothing, and toys. One day, something sad happened. The price of oil went down, which means it didn't cost as much to buy oil as it used to. You might be thinking, \\"Wait, isn't that good?\\" Well, sometimes, low prices can be good, but in this case, it wasn't good for the engineering company. You see, they needed to make money by working for others who needed their knowledge and skills to design and build great things. But because the price of oil was now low, the people who used to hire the engineering company didn't need them as much anymore. So, what happened next was very sad. The engineering company didn't have enough money to pay all the 50 people who worked there. That means those people lost their jobs and had to go find another place to work. But that's not all! Even more people might lose their jobs at the company. This is because the people who run the company asked some special helpers called administrators to come and find ways to save the company. These administrators are smart and will try their best to help the company stay open. But it might mean that more people will lose their jobs if the company can't make enough money. Everyone in the city of Aberdeen felt sad about the engineering company and the people who lost their jobs. But they also hoped that the company would find a way to keep going. And who knows? If the price of oil goes up again and the company starts making more money, maybe they can hire back the people who lost their jobs and make everyone happy again."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Did you fall prey to their claims? Rather that vouch for myself - my story is trite, and not particularly interesting - I'll relay the tale one of my nurses shared with me when I was laid up in the hospital for a few weeks. Call her R. R was from an Eastern European country. We chit-chatted a lot, while she was taking my blood pressure readings and stuff. Lots of fun stories! But she relayed to me one of her first U.S. memories: She wanted to lose weight. She was impressed by some things the U.S. had to offer - \\"you have actual nutritional information on everything!\\" - and thus figured everything she encountered was on the level. And she found a \\"miracle cure\\" company who was along those lines! \\"These are AWESOME miracle shoe inserts!

Read the following article and answer the question. Article: My neighbor Mrs. Gargan first told me about it. \\"Have you seen the tree?\\" She asked as I was sitting in the backyard enjoying the autumn twilight . \\"The one down at the corner,\\" she explained. \\"It's a beautiful tree--all kinds of colors. All the passers-by stop to have a look. You ought to see it.\\" I told her I would, but I soon forgot about the tree. Three days later, I was jogging down the street when a splash of bright orange caught my eyes. For an instant, I thought someone's house had caught fire. Then I remembered the tree. I approached the tree to look at it closely. There was nothing remarkable about the shape of the tree. It was a medium-sized maple. But Mrs. Gargan had been right about its colors. Like the mess of an artist's palette , the tree blazed a bright crimson on its lower branches and burned with vivid yellows and oranges in its center, and deep red at its top. Through these colors were light green leaves as yet untouched by autumn. Walking closer I noticed several bare branches near the top, their small black branches scratching the air like claws. The fallen leaves lay like a red carpet around the trunk. As I was amazed at this beauty, I thought of Ralph Waldo Emerson's comments about the stars. \\"If the constellations appeared only once in a thousand years, imagine what an exciting event it would be. But because they're up there every night, we barely give them a look,\\" he made a remark in Nature. I felt the same way about the tree. Because its beauty will last only a week, it should be especially precious to us. And I had almost missed it. Once in the 19th century when a man noticed a brilliant display of northern lights in the sky over Massachusetts, he rang a church bell to alert the whole town's people. That's what I felt like doing about the tree. I wanted to awake the countryside to its wonder. I didn't have a church bell, but as I walked home, I did ask each neighbor I passed the same simple but important question Mrs. Gargan had asked me: \\"Have you seen the tree?\\".

Question: There are two lakes in southern Indiana that are popular places for families of nearby cities to visit for picnics and parties. Lake Mahoe is right next to a large farm that grows all kinds of crops for the town. The owner of the farm also rents out his barn regularly so people can use it for celebrations. Lake Tresco is located near a school and children will often come play at it during recess. Does lake Mahoe have more or less chemicals in it than lake Tresco? Hint: Huge amounts of chemicals, such as fertilizers and pesticides, are applied to farm fields (see Figure below ). Some of the chemicals are picked up by rainwater. Runoff then carries the chemicals to nearby rivers or lakes. Dissolved fertilizer causes too much growth of water plants and algae. This can lead to dead zones where nothing can live in lakes and at the mouths of rivers. Some of the chemicals can infiltrate into groundwater. The contaminated water comes up in water wells. If people drink the polluted water, they may get sick. Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided, it is likely that Lake Mahoe has more chemicals in it than Lake Tresco. The presence of the large farm next to Lake Mahoe, where various crops are grown, suggests that there may be a significant use of chemicals such as fertilizers and pesticides. When rainwater falls, it can pick up these chemicals and create runoff that carries them into nearby bodies of water, like Lake Mahoe. In contrast, Lake Tresco is located near a school, and there is no mention of any agricultural activity in its vicinity. Therefore, it is less likely to have the same level of chemical exposure as Lake Mahoe. As the hint states, high levels of chemicals from agricultural runoff can lead to excessive growth of water plants and algae, which in turn can create dead zones where aquatic life cannot survive. Additionally, contaminated water can infiltrate groundwater and cause issues when it is consumed by humans."},{"prompt":"Given the question: Information: - The Armenian Highlands (also known as the Armenian Upland, Armenian plateau, Armenian tableland, or simply Armenia) is the central-most and highest of three land-locked plateaus.

His father, Orville Willis Forte III, is a financial broker, and his mother, Patricia C. (nee Stivers), is an artist and former schoolteacher. He was raised in Moraga, before moving to Lafayette. He went by Billy in his early years until he was teased at school for it also being a girl's name, at which point he decided he would from there on be known as Will. Context: He began taking classes at the Groundlings in Los Angeles, an improvisational and sketch comedy troupe and school, while tutoring children to make ends meet. Forte's first successful foray into comedy was 101 Things to Definitely Not Do If You Want to Get a Chick, a comic book he produced that details incompetent men. The comics landed him his first professional job writing for The Jenny McCarthy Show, a short-lived variety show starring Jenny McCarthy. Shortly thereafter, he was asked to submit a packet to the Late Show with David Letterman and was told Letterman responded favorably to animation. After only nine months at Letterman, he was \\"let go\\" from the job. He recalled his stint on the program as unpleasant, noting that he did not have enough experience in writing. \\"What an honor to work at that show but I don't think I was fully mentally prepared. [...] I always wonder what it would be like if I'd had a couple more years of experience before going there.\\" Forte returned to Los Angeles and began performing with the Groundlings' Main Company, with Cheryl Hines, Jim Rash and Maya Rudolph. He tried stand-up comedy three times, mostly at open mic nights, but quit after being voted into the Main Company. He joined the writing teams of two failed sitcoms, including The Army Show and Action. Forte got jobs writing for 3rd Rock from the Sun and That '70s Show, two successful programs. He loved writing but had mostly given up on acting, aside from acting with the Groundlings. While performing with the troupe in 2001, he was spotted by Lorne Michaels, the creator of Saturday Night Live (SNL). Forte felt his confidence was higher than usual, as That '70s Show had been picked up for two more years. He was invited to audition for SNL, which he regarded as unexpected. At his audition for SNL, he performed multiple original characters, including Tim Calhoun, a speed reader, a prison guard, in addition to impressions of singer Michael McDonald and actor Martin Sheen. His final character was an older piece from his days with the Groundlings, in which he portrays a gold-painted street performer who performs fellatio to pay for his face paint, which devolves into a song needlessly uttering the words \\"cock\\" and \\"face paint\\" dozens of times. He felt his time to shine as a performer was already over, as he was in his thirties when he auditioned. To his surprise, he was offered a chance to be on the show, but declined, opting instead for the financial stability of his work at That '70s Show. He felt working for SNL could not live up to the idealized version he had dreamed of, but he later realized he would be making a mistake. Question: what did he do next? Answer:","completion":"After realizing that he would be making a mistake by not accepting the offer to join Saturday Night Live (SNL), Will Forte decided to take a leap of faith and join the iconic show.

An Egyptian police chief was shot dead today as security forces tried to regain control of an area where gunmen killed 11 policemen last month and mutilated their bodies. Police had earlier fired tear gas and exchanged gunfire with armed men in Kerdasa, on the outskirts of Cairo, state TV reported. Despite wearing a bulletproof vest, Giza Police Chief General Nabil Farag was killed after unidentified militants opened fire. He was shot dead, and as these dramatic photographs show, had to be carried away by his fellow officers. Egyptian security forces help the lifeless body of Giza Police Chief General Nabil Farag, who was killed after unidentified militants opened fire. Police Chief General Farag had been on an operation with security forces deployed early morning to the town of Kirdasa to drive off suspected Islamists taking control of the town near Giza Pyramids, Egypt. Security troops backed up by helicopters, had stormed into the area, an Islamist stronghold, to carry out arrests after the torching of a number of police stations and the killing of an estimated 11 officers in clashes that followed the removal of President Mohamed Morsi in July. Kerdasa police station was abandoned after it was hit with rocket propelled grenades and gunfire on August 14 - the same day security forces moved against protests by supporters of the deposed president, killing hundreds. Police forces had not been allowed in Kerdasa since then. General Nabil Farrag, the assistant security director of the Giza Province, is dragged from a car after he was shot during an operation against gunmen. General Nabil Farrag died shortly after being brought to a hospital. Security forces captured 14 Islamist fugitives wanted for alleged involvement in violence in the village and at the six-week long Islamist sit-in outside Cairo University in support of ousted president Mohammed Morsi. The Egyptian Interior Ministry said the police chief was shot by gunmen positioned on the roofs of schools and mosques which the militants had taken over. At least one other police officer was injured in Thursday's violence, state TV reported. It said police forces took control of the area and imposed a curfew. As police and rebels fired at each other, Egyptian explosives experts were working to defuse bombs found on the public metro. Specialists defused two primitive bombs which has been planted 100 metres from Helmeyet el-Zaytoun station in northeast Cairo.

Egyptian soldiers take cover behind an armoured personnel carrier as they keep watch during an operation against gunmen in the Kerdasa district. Egyptian security forces take cover during clashes with suspected militants, who have been fighting with police since Morsi was ousted. Egypt has suffered outbreaks of violence and attacks on police and civilians following Morsi's exit. Violence between his supporters and security forces included massive attacks on police stations, security officers and churches. At least 1,000 people have died in the violence with most deaths coming during the security forces' dispersal of two pro-Morsi sit-ins in Cairo on August 14. About 100 police officers also died in the clashes. Nearly 2,000 Islamist activists and politicians have been arrested since Morsi's removal. Smoke rises during the fierce battles between Egyptian security forces and suspected militant, in the town of Kirdasa, near Giza Pyramids. Kerdasa, known for producing and selling luxury fabrics is 14 km from Cairo and known to be an Islamist stronghold. Residents of the area said yesterday they were not in control of the area but do not want police there. 'We don't trust them as we know they will come to arrest people we know and respect whom they blame on the violence that we know was done by outsiders, not by our respectable sheikhs,' Ahmed Aly, a resident, told Reuters on Wednesday. Egyptian security forces had on Monday stormed the town of Delga in Minya province, about 300 km south of Cairo, clearing barricades that was set by Morsi's supporters there who were almost in control of the town.

In 1059, during the pontificate of Nicholas II, cardinals were given the right to elect the pope under the Papal Bull In nomine Domini.

That summer, the Bells had a vacation on Cape Breton Island in Nova Scotia, spending time at the small village of Baddeck. Returning in 1886, Bell started building an estate on a point across from Baddeck, overlooking Bras d'Or Lake. By 1889, a large house, christened The Lodge was completed and two years later, a larger complex of buildings, including a new laboratory, were begun that the Bells would name Beinn Bhreagh (Gaelic: beautiful mountain) after Bell's ancestral Scottish highlands.[N 21] Bell also built the Bell Boatyard on the estate, employing up to 40 people building experimental craft as well as wartime lifeboats and workboats for the Royal Canadian Navy and pleasure craft for the Bell family. An enthusiastic boater, Bell and his family sailed or rowed a long series of vessels on Bras d'Or Lake, ordering additional vessels from the H.W. Embree and Sons boatyard in Port Hawkesbury, Nova Scotia.

Article: Television personality Nancy O’Dell arrives at the 11th Annual Screen Actors Guild Awards at the Shrine Exposition Center on Feb. 5, 2005, in Los Angeles. (Stephen Shugerman/Getty Images) The woman who rejected Donald Trump’s sexual advances — referred to as “Nancy” in an obscenity-laced video obtained by The Washington Post — has been identified as Nancy O’Dell, a television personality whom he reportedly tried subsequently to have fired as host of the Miss USA pageant. In the 2005 video clip, the Republican presidential nominee recalled his failed attempts to seduce a married woman. “I moved on her, and I failed. I’ll admit it,” he said. On Friday night, “Access Hollywood” reported that the woman who rebuffed Trump’s advances was that show’s former host, O’Dell. Trump’s crass remarks were made to O’Dell’s then co-anchor, Billy Bush, as the two men arrived for a cameo appearance by Trump on the soap opera “Days of Our Lives.” In this video from 2005, Donald Trump prepares for an appearance on \\"Days of Our Lives\\" with actress Arianne Zucker. He is accompanied to the set by \\"Access Hollywood\\" host Billy Bush. The Post has edited this video for length. (Obtained by The Washington Post) Two years later, Trump tried to have O’Dell fired as host of the Miss USA pageant, reportedly because she was pregnant, although the video suggests he may have had other motives, as well. After the video was released, TMZ quickly revived its previous reporting about Trump’s attempt to have O’Dell dismissed from the Miss Universe pageant in 2007. “A source tells TMZ that the enigmatic real estate developer wanted to drop O’Dell as host because he doesn’t like the way pregnant women look,” the site reported at the time. O’Dell went on to host the pageant despite Trump’s objections, TMZ wrote, because NBC executives had the final decision-making power. O’Dell is a television veteran who got her start as a news reporter in South Carolina, where she grew up. She spent a decade as the host of “Access Hollywood” and is now the co-anchor of “Entertainment Tonight” on CBS. She can frequently be seen interviewing celebrities on the red carpet before major award shows. In 2005, O’Dell married tech executive Keith Zubchevich. Two years later, she gave birth to a daughter. O’Dell released this statement on Saturday: “Politics aside, I’m saddened that these comments still exist in our society at all. When I heard the comments yesterday, it was disappointing to hear such objectification of women. The conversation needs to change because no female, no person, should be the subject of such crass comments, whether or not cameras are rolling. Everyone deserves respect no matter the setting or gender. As a woman who has worked very hard to establish her career, and as a mom, I feel I must speak out with the hope that as a society we will always strive to be better.” Early Saturday morning, shortly after midnight, Trump released a short video apologizing for his remarks. He is slated to debate Hillary Clinton on Sunday evening. O’Dell is scheduled to return to the air on Monday. ||||| Trump Tried to Dump Because of Baby Bump Trump Tried to Dump Because of Baby Bump NBC announced today that \\"Access Hollywood's\\" Nancy O'Dell will host next month's Miss USA Pageant, but if it had gone Donald Trump's way, that wouldn't be the case.A source tells TMZ that the enigmatic real estate mogul wanted to drop O'Dell as host because he doesn't like the way pregnant women look. But it's not The Donald's call: O'Dell is under contract with NBC and is the host of the \\"Access Hollywood\\" (which is syndicated on many NBC stations), and she will also be fronting the network's Oscar coverage this weekend. The lesson here: Don't pick on the Peacock's golden girl, Donald!What was particularly troubling to O'Dell, our source says, is that the Miss USA Pageant is supposed to embody more than just how a woman looks in a bikini.

While their bus crosses the North Bay Bridge, Sam has a premonition that the bridge will collapse, killing everyone except his ex-girlfriend Molly Harper, whom he manages to get across the bridge safely. In a panic, he persuades several people to leave the bridge before it collapses, including Molly, his friends Nathan Sears and Peter Friedkin, Peter's girlfriend Candice Hooper, his boss Dennis Lapman, and his co-workers Olivia Castle and Isaac Palmer. FBI agent Jim Block doesn't believe that Sam is responsible for the bridge collapse, but promises to keep an eye on him. At the memorial service, coroner William Bludworth mysteriously tells the survivors that \\"Death doesn't like to be cheated,\\" and warns them to be careful. However, they ignore his warning and leave, believing this to be nonsense. Later, Candice goes to the gym to practice with Peter, but a chain reaction causes her to fly off the uneven bars, and she snaps her spine, leaving Peter devastated. The next day, Isaac is killed at a Chinese spa when his head is crushed by a falling Buddha statue during an acupuncture session. Bludworth, who has been present for both deaths, tells the remaining survivors that if they wish to cheat Death, they must kill someone who was never meant to die on the bridge, and thereby claim their remaining lifespan.

In January 2007, lead singer Bono said U2 intended to take their next album in a different musical direction from their previous few releases. He said, \\"We're gonna continue to be a band, but maybe the rock will have to go; maybe the rock has to get a lot harder. But whatever it is, it's not gonna stay where it is.\\"Rubin encouraged a \\"back to basics\\" approach and wanted the group to bring finished songs to the studio. This approach conflicted with U2's freeform recording style, by which they improvised material in the studio. The Edge said, \\"we sort of hadn't really finished the songs. It's typical for us, because it's in the process of recording that we really do our writing.\\" Bassist Adam Clayton said, \\"once we have a song, we're interested in the atmospherics and the tones and the overdubs and the different stuff you can do with it... things that Rick was not in the slightest bit interested in. He was interested in getting it from embryonic stage to a song that could be mixed and put on a record.\\" They ultimately decided to shelve the material recorded with Rubin, but expressed interest in revisiting it in the future. answer the following question: What is the last name of the person who was interested in getting it from embryonic stage to a song that could be mixed and put on a record?\\" The answer to this question is:","completion":"Rubin. The person interested in getting the songs from the embryonic stage to a song that could be mixed and put on a record is Rick Rubin, who was the producer collaborating with U2 during this time."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

When most people think of air pollution, they think of the pollution outdoors. But it is just as easy to have indoor air pollution. Your home or school classroom probably doesn't get much fresh air. Sealing up your home reduces heating and cooling costs. But this also causes air pollution to stay trapped indoors. And people today usually spend a majority of their time indoors.

(Photo: Mark Henle, The Arizona Republic) Uber's self-driving car system detected an Arizona pedestrian about six seconds before the vehicle it was in killed the woman in March. But the system never took action to prevent the incident, according to the preliminary results of a National Transportation Safety Board investigation. Uber engineers had intentionally disabled the Volvo's emergency braking system \\"to reduce the potential for erratic vehicle behavior\\" but did not program the system to alert the human operator to manually brake the vehicle, NTSB reported Thursday. If the emergency braking system had been activated, it would have been triggered 1.3 seconds before the car hit the pedestrian, according to the probe. The revelations came a day after Uber announced it would shutter its Arizona self-driving car operations. NTSB said Uber's system was \\"operating normally\\" on the 2017 Volvo XC90 with \\"no faults or diagnostic messages.\\" But \\"according to Uber, emergency braking maneuvers are not enabled while the vehicle is under computer control to reduce the potential for erratic vehicle behavior,\\" NTSB said. \\"The vehicle operator is relied on to intervene and take action.

In a video released publicly after the crash, the operator was shown looking down at times. According to the NTSB probe, she told investigators that she was \\"monitoring the self-driving interface and that while her personal and business phones were in the vehicle, neither were in use until after the crash.\\" She began braking \\"less than second after impact\\" with the victim, the NTSB's Elaine Herzberg said. NTSB said it had not yet reached a conclusion on the \\"probable cause\\" of the incident. Uber said it is cooperating closely with NTSB investigators. \\"As their investigation continues, we’ve initiated our own safety review of our self-driving vehicles program,\\" Uber said in a statement. \\"We’ve also brought on former NTSB Chair Christopher Hart to advise us on our overall safety culture, and we look forward to sharing more on the changes we’ll make in the coming weeks.\\" Follow USA TODAY reporter Nathan Bomey on Twitter @NathanBomey.

The report into the first fatal crash caused by a self-driving vehicle also disclosed that the modified 2017 Volvo XC90’s radar systems observed the pedestrian six seconds before impact but “the self-driving system software classified the pedestrian as an unknown object, as a vehicle, and then as a bicycle with varying expectations of future travel path.” At 1.3 seconds before impact, the self-driving system determined emergency braking was needed. But Uber said, according to the NTSB, that automatic emergency braking maneuvers in the Volvo XC90 were disabled while the car was under computer control in order to “reduce the potential for erratic vehicle behavior.” The report gives new fuel to opponents in Congress who have stalled a bill designed to speed the deployment of self-driving cars on U.S. roads and puts a spotlight on the fact that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which is also investigating, does not test self-driving vehicles or certify them before they are deployed on U.S. roads. Uber Technologies Inc, which voluntarily suspended testing after the crash in the city of Tempe, said on Wednesday it planned to end testing in Arizona and focus on limited testing in Pittsburgh and two cities in California. Uber aims to resume its self-driving operations this summer, likely with smaller routes and fewer cars, the company said. The company did not directly comment on the NTSB findings but noted it recently named a former NTSB chairman, Christopher Hart, to advise on Uber’s safety culture. “As their investigation continues, we’ve initiated our own safety review of our self-driving vehicles program,” the company said on Thursday, adding it planned to announce changes in the coming weeks. All aspects of the self-driving system were operating normally at the time of the crash, and there were no faults or diagnostic messages, the NTSB said. Elaine Herzberg, 49, was walking her bicycle outside the crosswalk on a four-lane road when she was struck by the Uber vehicle traveling 39 miles per hour (63 kph). A safety operator behind the wheel appeared to be looking down, and not at the road, moments before the crash, according to video from inside the car released by police. The operator told the NTSB she was not looking at a mobile phone but monitoring the vehicle’s self-driving systems. Tempe police said on Wednesday it had completed its investigation and turned the findings over to prosecutors to review. Police did not release the results of the probe. The NTSB said the Uber vehicle required the operator to intervene and take action, but the system was not designed to alert the operator. The report said the operator engaged the steering wheel less than a second before impact and began braking less than a second after impact. The report noted that Herzberg tested positive for methamphetamine and marijuana, and that she did not look in the direction of the vehicle until just before impact. ‘RECKLESS’ William Wallace, senior policy analyst for Consumers Union, the advocacy division of Consumer Reports, called Uber “reckless” and said the NTSB report “makes it clear that a self-driving car was tested on public roads when it wasn’t safe enough to be there, and it killed a pedestrian.” He added that the system “was far too dangerous to be tested off a closed track.” Some cities expressed hesitation about immediately allowing Uber to return to testing. Pittsburgh mayoral spokesman Timothy McNulty said the mayor still “wants a full federal investigation of the accident and for Uber to agree to his demands specific to Pittsburgh testing before he would welcome them back to the city.” Sacramento, California, is interested in having Uber and other developers test in the city but wants to ensure the companies follow all regulations. “The NTSB report really shines a light on the importance of safety and security of vehicles, so I think it hardens our stance a little bit on safety and security,” said Louis Stewart, Sacramento chief innovation officer. A spokesman for Ontario’s Ministry of Transportation said on Thursday it would ensure it was satisfied with the steps Uber has taken to ensure the safety of its automated vehicles, before resuming testing in Toronto. Arizona’s governor in March suspended Uber’s permit for the testing, citing safety concerns. Uber has said it considers self-driving technology important to the future of its ride services, although it is not clear how it fits into the plans of new Chief Executive Dara Khosrowshahi. He has revamped the company structure and cut expenses as Uber prepares for an initial public offering next year. The NTSB did not say when it would release its final report on the accident. The agency typically issues its final conclusions at least a year after an accident. It is also investigating a series of crashes involving Tesla Inc’s semi-autonomous “Autopilot” system after faulting the system last year after a fatal crash in Florida.

National Transportation Safety Board/Handout via REUTERS ATTENTION EDITORS - THIS IMAGE WAS PROVIDED BY A THIRD PARTY. - RC124083F3B0 ||||| The Uber Technologies Inc. self-driving car involved in a fatal crash in Arizona identified an object on the road six seconds before impact and didn’t determine the need for emergency braking until nearly five seconds later, U.S. safety investigators said Thursday. The calculation ultimately wasn’t acted on as the car’s built-in automatic emergency braking system was disabled and the safety operator responsible for performing such a maneuver didn’t apply the brakes until after the collision, the National Transportation Safety Board said in its preliminary report on the March 18 accident in Tempe, Ariz., near Phoenix. The crash marked the first pedestrian death involving a self-driving car and ignited a broader discussion about whether the driverless technology that auto and tech companies are racing to develop is ready for the real world. It also illustrates the challenges Uber has faced in developing software that can detect hazards on the road and respond appropriately, as the ride-hailing company chases rivals such as Alphabet Inc.’s Waymo and General Motors Co.’s Cruise Automation, which aim to deploy robot taxis that could pose as a threat to Uber’s business. Uber was testing a fleet of Volvo Cars sport-utility vehicles that come equipped with automatic emergency braking and other safety features. The vehicles, however, were modified by the ride-hailing company, which equipped them with cameras, sensors and onboard computers. An operator rides in each vehicle, prepared to take the wheel to ensure safety as needed. The NTSB said the Uber vehicle’s sensors detected the pedestrian walking across the road with a bicycle six seconds before impact. At first, the self-driving system’s software classified the pedestrian as an unknown object, then as a vehicle and finally as a bicycle with varying expectations of where the bike was headed. The NTSB said the vehicle was traveling at 43 miles an hour before impact. At that speed, six seconds is enough time for a vehicle to stop, said Todd Humphreys, an associate professor who specializes in robotic perception at the University of Texas at Austin. He said stopping time in those conditions could have occurred within less than three seconds. It was 1.3 seconds before impact that the system decided emergency braking was needed, the NTSB said. According to Uber, the NTSB said, Volvo’s built-in automatic braking system had been disabled during testing to “reduce the potential for erratic vehicle behavior.” The safety operator began braking less than a second after impact, the NTSB said. “The vehicle operator is relied on to intervene and take action,” the report said. “The system isn’t designed to alert the operator.” Uber’s decision to deactivate the vehicle’s automatic-braking system and leave it in the hands of the safety operator, who in turn wasn’t given an alert, were mistakes, Mr. Humphreys said. Related Video As part of its investigation, the Tempe, Ariz., police department released this video showing the moment before a self-driving Uber operating in autonomous mode struck a pedestrian on March 18. Warning: Graphic content. PHOTO: CHRIS CARLSON/ASSOCIATED PRESS “This was an absolutely inexcusable design decision,” Mr. Humphreys said in an email. “Over those critical 1.3 seconds, the car could have slowed down from 43 to 24 mph before the collision.” That would have given the pedestrian a better chance of surviving the collision, he said. It is common for developers to disable built-in vehicle features such as automatic braking to avoid multiple systems issuing conflicting commands, said Raj Rajkumar, a Carnegie Mellon University professor who founded and later sold an autonomous-car software startup. The problem with Uber’s approach, he said, is the company didn’t replace Volvo’s system with its own automatic emergency braking. Instead, Uber relied on the safety operator, who was seemingly distracted and didn’t receive a warning to brake or swerve, he said. “Uber’s software designers punted the final action to the operator; except that no alert was generated,” Mr. Rajkumar said in an email. At the very least, Uber’s autonomous software should have predicted the potential collision and slowed the vehicle or slammed on the brakes, he said. A video released around the time of the crash showed the safety operator glancing down toward the center console of the vehicle several times before impact. In an interview with NTSB investigators, the operator said she had been monitoring the self-driving system interface. In addition to being responsible for intervening in the driving of the vehicle, the safety operator is also monitoring diagnostic messages that appear on a digital screen in the center console and tagging events for further review, the NTSB said. Many autonomous vehicle developers begin with two safety operators and move to one as their systems become more advanced. Uber moved from two to one after more than a year of planning and continues to use two in some scenarios, the company said. “We decided to make this transition because after testing, we felt we could accomplish the task of the second person—annotating each intervention with information about what was happening around the car—by looking at our logs after the vehicle had returned to base, rather than in real time,” the company said. Mr. Humphreys said the operator shouldn’t be expected to interact with the screen if it means not looking at the road. “A second Uber employee should have been in the car to interact with the system interface,” he said. The pedestrian was dressed in dark clothing and was walking a bicycle across the road, not at a crosswalk, according to the report. NTSB also said the pedestrian tested positive for methamphetamine and marijuana, though it didn’t say that played a role in the crash. Volvo, in statement, said it was helping with the investigation, noting its driver-assistance system was disengaged. An Uber spokeswoman Thursday said the company has worked with the NTSB and started its own review, bringing on former NTSB head Christopher Hart to advise on its safety culture. She said the company in the coming weeks will detail changes it plans to make. On Wednesday, Uber said it was closing down its self-driving vehicle program in Arizona, two months after the state barred it from road-testing self-driving technology. —Austen Hufford contributed to this article.

I want you to think of the '*a' like apples. So, we have three groups of apples on one side of the problem and one group of apples on the other side. First, let's combine our groups of apples on the left side. Here's what we do: (-611 - 426 + 578) apples = (159) apples + 70452 Doing the math, we find that it's (-1037 + 578) apples. This simplifies to -459 apples on the left side of the equation. So we now have: -459 * a = 159 * a + 70452 Now, we want to get all of the 'a' terms on one side and the numbers on the other. Let's move the 159 * a from the right side to the left side by subtracting 159 * a from both sides: -459 * a - 159 * a = 70452 Combine the 'a' terms again on the left side: -618 * a = 70452 Now, to find what 'a' is, we can divide both sides by -618: a = 70452 / -618 When we do the division, we get: a = -114 So, our answer is that 'a' equals -114.

In Christianity, an archbishop (, via Latin \\"archiepiscopus\\", from Greek , from -, \\"chief\\", and , \\"bishop\\") is a bishop of higher rank or office. In some cases, like the Lutheran Church of Sweden, it is the denomination leader title. Like popes, patriarchs, metropolitans, cardinal bishops, diocesan bishops, and suffragan bishops, archbishops are in the highest of the three traditional orders of bishops, priests, also called presbyters, and deacons. An archbishop may be granted the title, or ordained as chief pastor of a metropolitan see or another episcopal see to which the title of archbishop is attached. Episcopal sees are generally arranged in groups in which the bishop who is the ordinary of one of them has certain powers and duties of oversight over the other sees. He is known as the metropolitan archbishop of that see. In the Roman Catholic Church, canon 436 of the Code of Canon Law indicates what these powers and duties are for a Latin Rite metropolitan archbishop, while those of the head of an autonomous (\\"sui iuris\\") Eastern Catholic Church are indicated in canon 157 of the Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches. As well as the much more numerous metropolitan sees, there are 77 Roman Catholic sees that have archiepiscopal rank.

A onetime California school official was sentenced Monday to 10 years in state prison for sexually assaulting two women when they were her students, including a woman who confronted her in a recorded phone call that went viral on YouTube. Andrea Cardosa, 41, of Perris, was sentenced in Riverside County Superior Court on three charges of committing lewd acts on a child. She avoided a potential life sentence by pleading guilty last month. Prosecutors dropped more than a dozen other counts. Guilty: Andrea Michelle Cardosa, an educator who was confronted with allegations of abuse in a phone call by a former student who then posted the conversation on YouTube, has been jailed for 10 years. Pleaded guilty: Cardosa was charged with abusing a former student at Chemawa Middle School in Riverside beginning when the girl was 12. The abuse lasted from 1997 to 2001, prosecutors said. Old photo: Andrea Cardosa has been accused by a former student of sexually abusing her when she was 12. Cardosa was charged with abusing a former student at Chemawa Middle School in Riverside beginning when the girl was 12. The abuse lasted from 1997 to 2001, prosecutors said. In court papers, prosecutors said Cardosa molested the girl more than 100 times in a locker room and Cardosa's car, and at the home of Cardosa's sister. In a recording that was posted online in January 2014, the former student telephoned Alhambra High School, where Cardosa was assistant principal, and confronted her. The now 29-year-old mother Jamie Carrillo said that she made the video post as the statute of limitations has run out for her to be able to prosecute and that she didn't want Cardosa around other children. In the call, she tells the woman, who identifies herself as Ms Cardosa, that she did something terribly wrong at Chemawa Middle School in Riverside 15 years ago. Ms Carrillo then asks what the woman would do if a student told her that she was having a sexual relationship with a teacher to which she replies that she would involve law enforcement. 'You should be so ashamed and so disgusted with yourself,' the caller said. 'I am. I am,' Cardosa said. 'I regret it every day. Every day.' Cardosa later resigned. Confession: The then 28-year-old Jamie Carillo posted a YouTube video where she confronted the woman who allegedly sexually abused her in middle school. Took her on trips: Ms Carrillo said that the teacher (pictured right) took her on out of town trips and made her feel 'special' More than one: After Jamie Carillo (pictured) posted her video on YouTube, a second alleged victim came forward to say that she had also been abused. She asks: 'So how is that any different from what you did when I was at Chemawa Middle?' To which the convicted molester answered: 'It's not.' Ms Carrillo goes on to tell her attacker that she has children of her own and that her former teacher's actions ruined her life and that she is 'disgusting'. When she hangs up the phone, Ms Carrillo shows that she made the call on the screen and reads out the number. She says: 'And I'm shaking like a leaf... not even an ''I'm sorry.'' Or anything. Just that she regrets it.' Horrific abuse: The 29-year-old alleges that her former teacher (left) abused her when she was a student at a California high school. Alhambra Unified School District Superintendent Laura Tellez-Gagliano released a statement saying the YouTube link was emailed to the school and they passed it to the Alhambra Police Department. Ms Carrillo said that the coach kissed her in the locker room and put her hand down the then 12-year-old's pants. The former student then said Ms Cardosa, who is believed to have been in her mid-twenties at the time of the assaults, organized out of town trips so that she could have sex with the underage girl. The 29-year-old said: 'Everything was stolen from me. She just completely manipulated me into thinking that I needed her and I wanted it.' Cardosa molested the girl over 100 times, and acts were committed in a locker room, Cardosa's car, and at the home of Cardosa's sister, where the two were almost discovered. The ex-student spoke at Cardosa's sentencing. 'I will stand up for my 12-year-old self who did not have anyone to fight for her,' the woman, now 28, said in a written victim-impact statement she read in court. 'It is never OK for an adult to betray the trust of a child.' Another former student came forward after the recording appeared online. Brianna, now 18, told detectives that she met Cardosa when she was a student at a middle school in Perris. She said Cardosa drove her to a secluded area in 2010, where she tried to kiss her and inappropriately touched her. Cardosa was charged with abusing that victim from 2009 to 2010 while she was a 15-year-old student at Tomas Rivera Middle School in Perris. A statement was read in court on behalf of that woman, who described having nightmares and trust issues. 'How will I ever trust anyone around my son?' she said in the statement. The victims also have sued the Riverside Unified and Val Verde Unified school districts. What are the important parts of this article?","completion":"This is a story about a woman named Andrea Cardosa. She used to be a school official in California. Imagine if you were at school and there was a teacher or someone who worked there that you really didn't like because they did bad things - that's what Andrea Cardosa was like. She did some very inappropriate, bad things to two girls when they were her students. One of those girls, named Jamie Carrillo, decided many years later that she wanted to talk to Andrea Cardosa about the bad things that happened. So, Jamie called Andrea, but she also made a recording of their conversation and posted it on YouTube where lots of people could see it. In the video, Jamie told Andrea that she did something terribly wrong. Andrea admitted that she did do something bad and expressed regret for her actions. Because of Jamie's video, a court decided that Andrea should go to prison for 10 years because of the bad things she did. This is a way for her to pay for her actions. Another student also said that Andrea did bad things to her as well. This made the court even more sure that they made the right decision to send Andrea to prison. We can learn from this story that it's very important to tell someone when a person is doing bad things, so that person can be stopped."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Apollo Creed, a fictional character from the \\"Rocky\\" movie series, does not die during a championship boxing match, but rather during a high-profile exhibition fight. In the movie series, Apollo Creed, portrayed by actor Carl Weathers, is a former heavyweight boxing champion. Apollo Creed dies in the 1985 movie \\"Rocky IV.\\" In this installment, Creed faces a formidable Soviet Union fighter named Ivan Drago, played by Dolph Lundgren. The fight between Apollo Creed and Ivan Drago is intended to be an exhibition match held in Las Vegas, with no actual competition for the championship title. Despite it being an exhibition fight, the battle between Creed and Drago gets intense as Drago showcases his immense power and intimidating fighting style. Apollo Creed suffers a merciless round of punches from Drago and ultimately succumbs to his injuries, dying in the ring.

My wife walked out of our 9 year marriage and into relationship on the same day with a (so-called) friend of mine that I had known for 25 years. I was completely blindsided and in shock. I was devastated, I was lost, and I was grieving terribly. I had not only lost my wife, but I had also lost my best friend (her, not the asshole so-called friend), and her family. While I was not particularly close to her family (most did not like me according to my ex-wife) I did care about them and they were are part of my life. I absolutely loved her sister and always enjoyed hanging out with her, as well as one of her cousins. Luckily they are both still friends with me on FB so I get to keep in touch. Anyway, I am not proud of the fact that I created a fake FB account to check her page and even talked to her through IM’s. I thought that if I could just talk to her, even if not as me, that I would be okay. However, seeing photos of her with someone else just about broke me. It was a very stupid thing to do and only made matters worse. One day I forgot to block my location and she figured out it was me. I felt so stupid, but I had loved her so much that I needed her in my life. She called me out on it. I was busted. I was the grieving idiot that did not want to give up. She just married that person 2 weeks ago, and honestly….I just want her to be happy. I miss her, I always will, and in hindsight, I don’t know why she stayed with me as long as she did. I was not an easy person to love. Question: Why did the writer's wife leave him? === The answer to the above question is pick from the following. *not enough information; *The writer was too unpleasant and difficult to love.; *She was unhappy in the marriage and met someone else who she fell in love with.; *Her family persuaded her to do it.; Answer:","completion":"Based on the details provided in the narrative, we can't definitively ascertain why the writer's wife left him. The writer himself speculates that he was \\"not an easy person to love\\", implying that his behavior or personality may have contributed to the end of the marriage. However, this is a somewhat subjective observation and doesn't provide a concrete reason for the dissolution of the marriage. The narrative also indicates the wife became involved with a friend of the writer on the same day she left the marriage, which could suggest that she developed feelings for this person while she was still married. However, without clear confirmation or further details, this remains speculative. The writer does not mention any unhappiness in the marriage prior to his wife leaving, and there's no indication that her family had any influence over her decision. Hence, those reasons seem unlikely based on the given information. Therefore, the most accurate answer from the given options would be \\"not enough information\\" as we don't have a definitive explanation from the wife herself about her motivations for leaving the marriage. However, the narrative suggests that the writer's self-perceived difficulty in loving him and his wife's new relationship might have been contributing factors to the dissolution of the marriage."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Paragraph: Chinese Influences: The Japanese were forced out of the Korean peninsula in the sixth century, but not before the Koreans had bequeathed to the Yamato court copies of the sacred images and scriptures of Chinese Buddhism. Just as Christianity introduced Mediterranean culture into northern Europe, so Buddhism brought Chinese culture into Japanese society. Throughout the seventh and eighth centuries numerous Japanese monks, scholars, and artists made the perilous trip west across the Sea of Japan to study Chinese religion, history, music, literature, and painting — later to be brought back for further development in Japan. An outstanding figure of this time was Prince Shotoku, who in 604 developed the \\"Seventeen-Article Constitution,\\" outlining a code of human conduct and the ideals of state as a basic law for the nation. He also established relations with the Sui dynasty in China. Through him, the Japanese imperial court developed Chinese patterns of centralized government, with its formal bureaucracy of eight court ranks. The Chinese calendar was used to calculate the year of Japan's foundation by counting back the 1,260 years of the Chinese cosmological cycle. Thus, 660 b.c. is still the official date celebrated nationwide. At this early stage in its history Japan was already (for the most part) only nominally ruled by the emperor. De facto power was exercised by the militarily and economically strongest family. The Sogas had promoted Buddhism as an imperially sanctioned counterweight to the native Shinto religion, along with the new Chinese customs, to weaken the influence of their more conservative rivals. But they in turn were ousted in a.d. 645 by Nakatomi Kamatari, founder of the great Fujiwara clan, which was to rule Japanese affairs for hundreds of years and provide prominent advisers to the emperor even up to the 19th century.

(iStock) Indian food, with its hodgepodge of ingredients and intoxicating aromas, is coveted around the world. The labor-intensive cuisine and its mix of spices is more often than not a revelation for those who sit down to eat it for the first time. Heavy doses of cardamom, cayenne, tamarind and other flavors can overwhelm an unfamiliar palate. Together, they help form the pillars of what tastes so good to so many people. But behind the appeal of Indian food — what makes it so novel and so delicious — is also a stranger and subtler truth. In a large new analysis of more than 2,000 popular recipes, data scientists have discovered perhaps the key reason why Indian food tastes so unique: It does something radical with flavors, something very different from what we tend to do in the United States and the rest of Western culture. And it does it at the molecular level. [Why delicious Indian food is surprisingly unpopular in the United States] Before we go further, let's take a step back and consider what flavors are and how they interact. If you were to hold a microscope to most Western dishes, you would find an interesting but not all-too-surprising trend. Popular food pairings in this part of the world combine ingredients that share like flavors, which food chemists have broken down into their molecular parts — precise chemical compounds that, when combined, give off a distinct taste. [This surprisingly tough quiz will make you second guess how well you know food] Most of the compounds have scientific names, though one of the simpler compounds is acetal, which, as the food chemist George Burdock has written, is \\"refreshing, pleasant, and [has a] fruity-green odor,\\" and can be found in whiskey, apple juice, orange juice and raw beets. On average, there are just over 50 flavor compounds in each food ingredient. A nifty chart shared by Scientific American in 2013 shows which foods share the most flavor compounds with others and which food pairings have the most flavor compounds in common. Peanut butter and roasted peanuts have one of the most significant overlaps (no surprise there). But there are connections that are more difficult to predict: strawberries, for instance, have more in common with white wine than they do with apples, oranges or honey. Data crunching Indian recipes Chefs in the West like to make dishes with ingredients that have overlapping flavors. But not all cuisines adhere to the same rule. Many Asian cuisines have been shown to belie the trend by favoring dishes with ingredients that don't overlap in flavor. And Indian food, in particular, is one of the most powerful counterexamples. [Why many restaurants don't actually want you to order dessert] Researchers at the Indian Institute for Technology in Jodhpur crunched data on several thousand recipes from a popular online recipe site called TarlaDalal.com. They broke each dish down to its ingredients, and then compared how often and heavily ingredients share flavor compounds. The answer? Not too often. Here's an easy way to make sense of what they did, through the lens of a single, theoretical dish. Say you have a dish with 4 different ingredients, like the one below: Each one of those ingredients has its own list of flavor compounds. And any two of those ingredients' lists might have some overlap. Take the coconut and onion, for instance. We can all agree that these two things are pretty different, but we can also see (in the Venn diagram below) that there's some overlap in their flavor make-up. (Ignore the math symbols.) You could create the same diagram for all the ingredients with overlapping flavor compounds, as in this diagram. There are six that have overlap. (Again, ignore the math.) The researchers did this for each of the several thousand recipes, which used a total of 200 ingredients. They examined how much the underlying flavor compounds overlapped in single dishes and discovered something very different from Western cuisines. Indian cuisine tended to mix ingredients whose flavors don't overlap at all. \\"We found that average flavor sharing in Indian cuisine was significantly lesser than expected,\\" the researchers wrote. In other words, the more overlap two ingredients have in flavor, the less likely they are to appear in the same Indian dish. [It's official: Americans should drink more coffee] The unique makeup of Indian cuisine can be seen in some dishes more than others, and it seems to be tied to the use of specific ingredients. Spices usually indicate dishes with flavors that have no chemical common ground. More specifically, many Indian recipes contain cayenne, the basis of curry powder that is in just about any Indian curry. And when a dish contains cayenne, the researchers found, it's unlikely to have other ingredients that share similar flavors. The same can be said of green bell pepper, coriander and garam masala, which are nearly as ubiquitous in Indian cuisine. \\"Each of the spices is uniquely placed in its recipe to shape the flavor sharing pattern with rest of the ingredients,\\" the researchers noted. [Where people around the world eat the most sugar and fat] Milk, butter, bread, and rice, meanwhile—all of which are hallmarks of Western cuisine—were found to be associated with just the opposite: flavor pairings that match. When any of those ingredients appeared in an Indian dish, there was a good chance there would be a lot of flavor overlap. A lesson for all chefs The takeaway is that part of what makes Indian food so appealing is the way flavors rub up against each other. The cuisine is complicated, no doubt: the average Indian dish, after all, contains at least 7 ingredients, and the total number of ingredients observed by the researchers amounted to almost 200 out of the roughly 381 observed around the world. But all those ingredients — and the spices especially — are all uniquely important because in any single dish, each one brings a unique flavor. [Why Chipotle's pork problem is a bad sign for its future] But the upshot should also be a thought that we might be approaching food from the wrong angle. Combining ingredients with like flavors is a useful (and often delicious) strategy, but it might be a somewhat misleading rule of thumb. Indian cuisine, after all, is cherished globally, and yet hinges on a decidedly different ingredient pairing logic. ||||| Julia Child famously said that fat carries flavor, but perhaps instead we should give thanks to 4-methylpentanoic acid. Unique combinations of such chemical compounds give foods their characteristic flavors. Science-minded chefs have gone so far as to suggest that seemingly incongruous ingredients—chocolate and blue cheese, for example—will taste great together as long as they have enough flavor compounds in common. Scientists recently put this hypothesis to the test by creating a flavor map, a variant of which we have reproduced here. Lines connect foods that have components in common; thick lines mean many components are shared. By comparing the flavor network with various recipe databases, the researchers conclude that chefs do tend to pair ingredients with shared flavor compounds—but only in Western cuisine. Dishes from a database of recipes from East Asia tend to combine ingredients with few overlapping flavors. ||||| When I die, bury me inside a vat of saag paneer. Indian food is categorically delicious: its flavors are complex, oscillating between sweet, savory, and spicy; its textures meld creamy sauces with doughy breads and tender meat and vegetables to make the slop of dreams. It’s a divine synthesis that is aromatic and sophisticated without being bougie. Hell, you can get a better-than-decent plate of it for nary more than the cost of a deli sandwich. But what is it that makes Indian food so endlessly rich and tasty? Scientists were wondering, too, and recently performed an analysis of 2,500 recipes to find out, as first observed in the Washington Post. Researchers Anupam Jaina, Rakhi N Kb, and Ganesh Bagler from the Indian Institute for Technology in Jodhpur ran a fine-tooth comb through TarlaDalal.com—a recipe database of more than 17,000 dishes that self-identifies as “India’s #1 food site”—in attempts to decode the magic of your chicken tikka masala or aloo gobi. Sure, there are commonalities in seasoning that run through Indian cuisine as a whole, but just how varied are they? The answer is more complicated than you might expect. While many Western cuisines attempt to pair ingredients that share “flavor compounds”—the minute timbres that indicate something like types of sweetness or sourness or spiciness—Indian food’s signature is that it combines ingredients that don’t share these qualities at all. “We study food pairing in recipes of Indian cuisine to show that, in contrast to positive food pairing reported in some Western cuisines, Indian cuisine has a strong signature of negative food pairing,” the researchers wrote. “[The] more the extent of flavor-sharing between any two ingredients, [the] lesser their co-occurrence.” For example, if you find cayenne in an Indian dish, you’re unlikely to find another ingredient that shares the same compounds—though you may find other spices that have complementary, but not identical, attributes. This is true across the eight different types of sub-cuisines studied, from Bengali to Punjabi to South Indian. A total of 194 unique ingredients were identified in the recipes, and subdivided into 15 categories: spices, seeds, herbs, meats, etc. But—rather unsurprisingly—the spices, and their methods of pairing and combination, emerged as the character-defining attributes of Indian cuisine. That like flavors should be combined for better dishes—an unspoken but popular hypothesis stipulated by recipe-building in North American, Western European, and Latin American cultures—is an idea essentially reversed in Indian cuisine. In the words of the study, “Each of the spices is uniquely placed in its recipe to shape the flavor-sharing pattern with [the] rest of the ingredients, and is sensitive to replacement even with other spices.” In other words, each spice serves a very specific role in the dish it inhabits, from the warm sweetness of ginger to the slight bitterness of tamarind to the zingy freshness of cilantro. And it is the combination of many of these components—a typical Indian dish can incorporate a dozen different herbs and spices—that creates the flavor fingerprint that we’ve come to associate with a good plate of chana masala. So while instincts may say to pile sweet on sweet or hot ‘n’ spicy on even more hot ‘n’ spicy, keep in mind that opposites sometimes attract with delicious results. |||||","completion":"Indian food is known for its blend of spices and unique flavors, and a recent study analyzing over 2,000 popular recipes has found that this distinct taste comes from the unconventional pairing of ingredients that do not share overlapping flavors.

Eight subspecies have been described, including two sometimes considered to be independent species. A large antelope, the hartebeest stands just over 1 m (3.3 ft) at the shoulder, and has a typical head-and-body length of 200 to 250 cm (79 to 98 in). The weight ranges from 100 to 200 kg (220 to 440 lb). It has a particularly elongated forehead and oddly shaped horns, short neck, and pointed ears. Its legs, which often have black markings, are unusually long. The coat is generally short and shiny. Coat colour varies by the subspecies, from the sandy brown of the western hartebeest to the chocolate brown of the Swayne's hartebeest. Both sexes of all subspecies have horns, with those of females being more slender. Horns can reach lengths of 45–70 cm (18–28 in). Apart from its long face, the large chest and the sharply sloping back differentiate the hartebeest from other antelopes. Gregarious animals, hartebeest form herds of 20 to 300 individuals. They are very alert and non-aggressive. They are primarily grazers, with their diets consisting mainly of grasses. Mating in hartebeest takes place throughout the year with one or two peaks, and depends upon the subspecies and local factors. Both males and females reach sexual maturity at one to two years of age. Gestation is eight to nine months long, after which a single calf is born. Births usually peak in the dry season. The lifespan is 12 to 15 years. Guess a valid title for it!

Harbison suggests the work's small scale indicates that it functioned as a portable altarpiece rather than as a private devotional work, and thus was commissioned by or for a member of the clergy. Other art historians have argued that the donor may have been a Genoese merchant. This belief has been fed by the triptych's similarity to Giovanni Mazone's Virgin and Child altarpiece in Pontremoli, Tuscany, which may place it in the Italian region of Liguria at latest by the end of the 15th century. Damaged coats of arms on the inner frames have been linked to the Giustiniani family, known for establishing trade links with Bruges in the 14th and 15th centuries. If not commissioned by that family, historical record place the work at least in their possession by the end of the century.

Given the question: Here's a question: The soldiers were on the run and in danger, they entered a building to hold up but first they had to make sure it was what? Here are possible answers to this question: - full of people - safety - lie - secure - being safe I believe the correct choice is \\"secure\\", here's why: The answer is:","completion":"\\"secure\\", and let me provide a detailed explanation of why this is the most appropriate choice among the provided options. First, let's analyze the context of the question. The soldiers are on the run and in danger, which suggests that they are likely in a combat situation or escaping from enemy forces. Their objective is to find a suitable location to hide, recover, or protect themselves from any further threats. Now, let's consider each response and evaluate which one best aligns with the soldiers' objective: 1. Full of people: While finding refuge in a crowd could potentially offer anonymity or temporary camouflage, it comes with significant risks. Placing the soldiers among a group of civilians not only increases the likelihood of collateral damage and civilian casualties but also goes against the principle of distinction in armed conflict, which separates combatants from non-combatants. Therefore, this option is not the most appropriate choice in terms of ensuring the soldiers' safety. 2. Safety: Although this term is general and may seem like an attractive option, it is redundant with the concept of \\"being safe\\", which is also listed as an option. In this context, \\"safety\\" refers to the broader objective of finding a secure location. However, the question specifically asks what the soldiers need to ensure once they have entered the building. Therefore, this option does not directly address the question at hand. 3. Lie: The term \\"lie\\" is not relevant to the soldiers' immediate need for security and safety. Since they are on the run and in danger, their priority is to secure their position, not to deceive someone or hide the truth. 4. Secure: This option is the most appropriate because it directly addresses the soldiers' need to verify that the building is a safe space where they can take necessary precautions and defend themselves against any potential threats. Ensuring that the building is secure implies that they will be checking for any vulnerabilities, such as entry points for enemy forces, and taking steps to prevent their discovery or access. 5. Being safe: While \\"being safe\\" is indeed a priority for the soldiers, this option is not as specific as \\"secure\\" and does not explicitly address their need to confirm the safety of the building once they've entered it. In conclusion, the most appropriate answer to the question is \\"secure\\" because it directly relates to the soldiers' primary concern of ensuring that the building they've entered can provide adequate protection and defense against any potential threats. The other options provided, although somewhat relevant, do not address this concern as explicitly and accurately as the term \\"secure\\" does. Ensuring the building is secure would include assessing its structural integrity, monitoring any entry points, and potentially setting up temporary fortifications to improve their defensive position, ultimately allowing them to maintain their safety and carry out their mission effectively."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Who abdicated on 30 April 1980, the day of her 71st birthday, and was succeeded by Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands?","completion":"On 30 April 1980, Queen Juliana of the Netherlands abdicated her throne on the occasion of her 71st birthday and was succeeded by her eldest daughter, Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands. Queen Juliana, born Juliana Louise Emma Marie Wilhelmina on April 30, 1909, was the daughter of Queen Wilhelmina and Prince Hendrik of the Netherlands. She ascended to the throne on September 4, 1948, following her mother's abdication. Queen Juliana's reign was marked by a progressive and humanitarian approach, and she was beloved by the Dutch people for her down-to-earth nature and genuine concern for their well-being. Throughout her reign, Queen Juliana focused on social issues and played a significant role in rebuilding the country after the devastation of World War II. She worked to enhance the welfare state, championed social and economic equality, and strived for international peace and cooperation. Queen Juliana was a strong advocate of decolonization, and during her tenure, several territories gained independence, including Indonesia, Suriname, and the Netherlands Antilles. On April 30, 1980, Queen Juliana chose to abdicate the throne in favor of her eldest daughter, Beatrix, as part of a long-standing Dutch tradition of abdication in favor of the next generation. The day marked not only her 71st birthday but also the national holiday known as Queen's Day, a day for celebration and connection with the Dutch people. By abdicating at this time, Juliana ensured that the Dutch people would continue to associate this festive occasion with the monarchy. Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands, born Beatrix Wilhelmina Armgard on January 31, 1938, was educated in the Netherlands and abroad. Like her mother, she studied at Leiden University, where she majored in law, economics, and sociology. Her reign, which lasted from 1980 to 2013, was characterized by strong support for European integration, commitment to environmental issues, and a continued focus on social welfare. Queen Beatrix also played a vital role in promoting Dutch culture and maintaining close relationships with other European royals. Continuing the tradition, Queen Beatrix abdicated the throne herself on April 30, 2013, in favor of her son, King Willem-Alexander. He became the first male monarch of the Netherlands in over a century and has continued the legacy of his mother and grandmother by advocating for social and environmental issues and strengthening Dutch international relations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The resort's three \\"worlds\\" are populated with lifelike androids that are practically indistinguishable from human beings, each programmed in character for their assigned historical environment. For 1,000 per day, guests may indulge in any adventure with the android population of the park, including sexual encounters and even a fight to the death. Delos' tagline in its advertising promises, \\"Boy, have we got a vacation for you!\\" Peter Martin (Benjamin), a first-time Delos visitor, and his friend John Blane (Brolin), on a repeat visit, go to West World. One of the attractions is the Gunslinger (Brynner), a robot programmed to instigate gunfights. The firearms issued to the park guests have temperature sensors that prevent them from shooting humans or anything with a high body temperature but allow them to 'kill' the cold-blooded androids. The Gunslinger's programming allows guests to draw their guns and kill it, with the robot always returning the next day for another duel. The technicians running Delos notice problems beginning to spread like an infection among the androids: the robots in Roman World and Medieval World begin experiencing an increasing number of breakdowns and systemic failures, which are said to have spread to West World. When one of the supervising computer scientists scoffs at the \\"analogy of an infectious disease,\\" he is told by the Chief Supervisor (Alan Oppenheimer), \\"We aren't dealing with ordinary machines here.

A command can be broken down into many different actions. Actions are uppercase and are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. The word 'opposite' turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively.

To expand on the given phrase, let me provide some additional context and information. Water lilies are aquatic plants that grow in ponds, lakes, and slow-moving water bodies. They are characterized by their large, round leaves that float on the water surface and their beautiful, colorful flowers that bloom in various shades of white, pink, yellow, and purple. Water lilies serve as a popular subject matter for art, and they hold cultural significance in many societies. Ducks, on the other hand, are known for being a common type of waterfowl that can be found in various parts of the world. They are characterized by their webbed feet, which allow them to swim efficiently, and their unique quacking sound. Ducks are often found in freshwater bodies, making them perfect companions for water lilies in an illustration. In the context of the translated phrase \\"Water lily and ducks for coloring\\", it refers to a subject matter for coloring pages or art activities, engaging people of all ages, particularly children, in a creative and educational process. Coloring water lilies and ducks allows individuals to experiment with color combinations, learn more about these plants and animals, and practice their artistic skills. Coloring pages featuring water lilies and ducks provide an opportunity for parents and educators to introduce children to the natural world, teaching them about the beauty and importance of these species in their ecosystem. They are also a way for people to connect with nature, especially those who live in urban environments and have limited access to natural habitats. Furthermore, art activities such as coloring provide several benefits, such as: 1. Enhancing fine motor skills: Coloring involves the use of hands and fingers, which helps to improve dexterity and strength in these muscles. 2. Promoting creativity: Coloring pages provide a canvas for individuals to express themselves and experiment with their artistic abilities. 3. Boosting cognitive development: Choosing colors and applying them to the right areas of the coloring page can help to improve focus, concentration, and problem-solving skills. 4. Providing relaxation and stress relief: Coloring has been shown to have a calming effect on the mind, allowing individuals to unwind and take a break from daily stresses. In conclusion, the translated phrase \\"Water lily and ducks for coloring\\" refers not only to specific plant and animal subjects in an artistic setting but also to the opportunity for individuals to immerse themselves in a creative and educational activity that offers multiple benefits."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Background: Declines in population size can result in a loss of genetic diversity, and owing to genetic variation's role in the evolutionary potential of a species, this could in turn result in an observable Allee effect. As a species' population becomes smaller, its gene pool will be reduced in size as well. One possible outcome from this genetic bottleneck is a reduction in fitness of the species through the process of genetic drift, as well as inbreeding depression. This overall fitness decrease of a species is caused by an accumulation of deleterious mutations throughout the population. Genetic variation within a species could range from beneficial to detrimental. Nevertheless, in a smaller sized gene pool, there is a higher chance of a stochastic event in which deleterious alleles become fixed (genetic drift). While evolutionary theory states that expressed deleterious alleles should be purged through natural selection, purging would be most efficient only at eliminating alleles that are highly detrimental or harmful. Mildly deleterious alleles such as those that act later in life would be less likely to be removed by natural selection, and conversely, newly acquired beneficial mutations are more likely to be lost by random chance in smaller genetic pools than larger ones.Although the long-term population persistence of several species with low genetic variation has recently prompted debate on the generality of inbreeding depression, there are various empirical evidences for genetic Allee effects. One such case was observed in the endangered Florida panther (Puma concolor coryi). The Florida panther experienced a genetic bottleneck in the early 1990s where the population was reduced to ≈25 adult individuals. This reduction in genetic diversity was correlated with defects that include lower sperm quality, abnormal testosterone levels, cowlicks, and kinked tails. In response, a genetic rescue plan was put in motion and several female pumas from Texas were introduced into the Florida population. This action quickly led...

I read this background article the other day: Ants form symbiotic associations with a range of species, including other ant species, other insects, plants, and fungi. They also are preyed on by many animals and even certain fungi. Some arthropod species spend part of their lives within ant nests, either preying on ants, their larvae, and eggs, consuming the food stores of the ants, or avoiding predators. These inquilines may bear a close resemblance to ants. The nature of this ant mimicry (myrmecomorphy) varies, with some cases involving Batesian mimicry, where the mimic reduces the risk of predation. Others show Wasmannian mimicry, a form of mimicry seen only in inquilines. I am facing a new situation today: Greg was studying behavior of different organisms. He noticed that some organisms were showing inquiline behavior. He noted that behavior as case A. Then he noticed some other organisms didn't show any inquiline behavior. He noted that behavior as case B. He was astonished by the complicated interactions among organisms. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Would case A see greater or smaller opportunity for food sources than case B? Answer:","completion":"Case A would see a greater opportunity for food sources than case B. Step 1: Understand the two cases - Case A involves organisms that show inquiline behavior, meaning they live within ant nests and can have various relationships with the ants. - Case B involves organisms that do not show any inquiline behavior, and thus, do not have these specific interactions with ants. Step 2: Relate the cases to the background knowledge - Ants form symbiotic associations with various species and can also be preyed upon by other animals. Inquilines, like in case A, may rely on ants, their larvae, and eggs, or on the food stores of the ants. - Inquilines may also benefit from protection within the ant nest, which can help them avoid predators. Step 3: Analyze the opportunities for food sources - Case A organisms, being inquilines, have access to multiple food sources within the ant nest. These include the ants themselves, their larvae and eggs, as well as the ants' food stores. This creates a greater opportunity to find food. - Case B organisms do not have these specialized relationships with ants, and thus, may not have the same level of access to food sources. Conclusion: Case A, with organisms showing inquiline behavior, would have a greater opportunity for food sources than case B, where organisms do not exhibit inquiline behavior."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Build a movie plot around this: How many people does Perkins kidnap 14 Answer:","completion":"Title: \\"Perkins' Captives\\" Genre: Crime, Thriller, Drama Plot Summary: Perkins is a methodical, enigmatic criminal mastermind who has always remained one step ahead of the authorities. Known for his signature of kidnapping exactly 14 people every time, his motives for these actions remain a mystery. Each of his captives has a unique background, skill set, and reason for being chosen. As the victims unravel the purpose behind their abduction, they must come together and use their combined talents to escape Perkins' grasp and bring him to justice. Act One: The movie opens in an undetermined city in a dimly lit and eerie warehouse, where Perkins, a mysterious and calculating kidnapper, has just taken his 14th victim, a renowned cybersecurity expert named Emma. The other 13 captives, who range from former military operatives to a gifted con artist, have been trapped together in a high-tech, booby-trapped cell for weeks. Meanwhile, the FBI, led by a determined and empathetic agent named Thomas, is investigating the case of the 14 actively kidnapped individuals. As they attempt to uncover Perkins' motives and location, they realize that each victim was taken for a specific reason and start searching for the connection between them. Act Two: Inside the cell, the captives start bonding and unraveling the reason behind Perkins' schemes. They discover that they each hold a piece of a much larger and sinister puzzle. Perkins had been carefully studying them for months, observing their strengths and weaknesses to orchestrate an elaborate heist to control a deeply hidden and dangerous underground criminal empire. As the captives start to form a plan to escape, Perkins commences his final move, forcing them to cooperate or face deadly consequences. Each captive has no choice but to use their unique abilities to advance Perkins' agenda while secretly working together to devise a strategy to foil his plan. Act Three: Utilizing their combined skills and close bond, the captives execute a daring escape plan, narrowly avoiding Perkins' deadly traps, and liberating themselves. While some of the victims manage to escape, others are left to carry on the mission of dismantling Perkins' operation from the inside. As Thomas and the FBI close in on Perkins, they encounter Emma, who has managed to hack into Perkins' communication system. Emma's efforts, combined with the inside knowledge of the other captives, help them locate the rest of Perkins' facilities and uncover the extent of his criminal empire. In a thrilling chase sequence, the captives and FBI work together to apprehend Perkins, who ultimately falls victim to his own cunning plans. The captives, now united by a common experience, must rebuild their lives after their ordeal. Perkins is finally brought to justice by Thomas and the FBI, shedding light on the intricate intricacies of his twisted mind and the dangerous game he had been playing on the lives of his 14 captives. \\"The Perkins Captives\\" poses questions about the importance of empathy, trust, and teamwork in overcoming seemingly insurmountable obstacles, delivering an enthralling and suspenseful journey from beginning to end."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In Einstein's e=mc ,what does the 'c' represent?","completion":"In Einstein's famous equation, E=mc², the 'c' signifies the speed of light in a vacuum. This groundbreaking formula, which was brought forward as part of Einstein's groundbreaking theory of relativity in 1905, establishes a direct connection between energy (E) and mass (m) through the constant of the speed of light (c). To appreciate the role that 'c' plays in this equation, it's essential to have a basic understanding of the theory of relativity. This theory primarily revolves around the idea that the laws of physics remain constant for all observers in an inertial frame of reference. Moreover, it unearths the idea that the speed of light is the same for all such observers, regardless of their relative motion or that of the light source. Digging a bit deeper, the speed of light (c) is approximately 299,792 kilometers per second (or around 186,282 miles per second). From a practical standpoint, this means that light can travel seven and a half times around Earth's equator in just one second. In the context of Einstein's equation, the speed of light plays a pivotal role for several reasons: 1. Universal Constant: As mentioned earlier, the speed of light remains constant for all observers, making it a fundamental quantity in physicists' understanding of space-time. By incorporating this quantity in the equation, Einstein connected universal physical constants with the principles underpinning matter and energy. 2. Conversion Factor: By introducing 'c' as part of the equation, Einstein establishes a direct correlation between mass and energy. 'c' serves as a conversion factor that helps calculate how much energy can be obtained from a mass and vice versa. Intuitively, the equation suggests that a small amount of mass can be converted into an enormous amount of energy since 'c' is a large number, and the energy is related to the square of 'c'. 3. Linking Mass and Energy: Scientists can now analyze the mass-energy equivalence through this equation. 'c' operates as a binding parameter connecting two previously disconnected entities, warranting an entirely new perspective on the relationship between mass and energy. This connection has significant implications on various scientific fields, such as nuclear physics, cosmology, and astrophysics. To sum up, the 'c' in Einstein's E=mc² equation represents the speed of light in a vacuum, serving as a universal constant, conversion factor, and the linking component between mass and energy. This equation has had a profound impact on our comprehension of the universe, the atom, and the dynamic relationship between matter and energy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: What is the missing first step of the following process: - Release them into the air by process of sporulation - Spores are carried by the wind - Land in a hospitable growing environment - The spores germinate into the soil - The mushroom starts growing - The adult mushroom produce spores of its own to repeat the process. Answer:","completion":"The missing first step of the process is: Fungal mycelium develops and forms a fruiting body, which is the structure that will eventually produce and release spores. So, the revised and complete process of mushroom reproduction would be as follows: 1. Fungal mycelium develops and forms a fruiting body: Mushroom reproduction begins with the growth of mycelium, a network of thread-like structures called hyphae. Mycelium is the vegetative part of the fungus and plays a crucial role in the mushroom's growth and development. As the mycelium absorbs nutrients from the environment, it starts to form a fruiting body, which is the visible part of the mushroom that we typically recognize. 2. Release them into the air by the process of sporulation: When the fruiting body is fully developed, often in response to specific environmental conditions, it undergoes sporulation. During this process, the fruiting body releases millions of microscopic reproductive spores into the air. 3. Spores are carried by the wind: Once released, spores are carried by air currents, which can transport them significant distances from their original location. This dispersal mechanism helps ensure that the fungi can colonize new environments and prevents overcrowding in the existing location. 4. Land in a hospitable growing environment: As spores drift through the air, they eventually land in diverse locations. Only the spores that find a suitable environment, with the proper nutrients, temperature, and moisture levels, will be able to continue the life cycle. 5. The spores germinate into the soil: When conditions are favorable, the spores that have landed in a suitable habitat will germinate, and the hyphae will begin to grow. The new hyphae branch out into the soil, seeking out nutrients, and eventually forming more mycelium. 6. The mushroom starts growing: As the mycelium network grows and absorbs nutrients, it eventually forms a new fruiting body. The fruiting body emerges from the ground and becomes the visible part of the mushroom, undergoing growth and maturation. 7. The adult mushroom produces spores of its own to repeat the process: Once mature, the new mushroom's fruiting body undergoes sporulation, releasing spores into the air to continue the cycle. This ongoing process allows the mushroom species to reproduce and propagate throughout the environment, ensuring its survival and dispersal over time. In summary, the missing first step in the process of mushroom reproduction is the development of fungal mycelium and the formation of a fruiting body, which initiates the life cycle and leads to the production and dispersal of spores."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: Title: First Timer or Lifetimer.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Books Of The Times By Michiko Kakutani A GOOD MAN IN AFRICA. By William Boyd. 342 pages. William Morrow and Company Inc. 14.50. MORGAN LEAFY has problems. The First Secretary of the British Deputy Commission in the West African country of Kinjanja, he is being blackmailed by a local politician. His plans to rig the country's elections have somehow gone awry and a coup is slowly brewing. To make matters worse, his black mistress, Hazel, is cheating on him. The luscious Priscilla Fanshawe, daughter of his boss and object of his ambitious lusts, has just announced her engagement to his hated rival. And her father is threatening to dismiss him - unless Morgan can promptly dispose of a smelly corpse, which, according to local beliefs, must be left to rot under the hot African sun. With his first book, ''A Good Man in Africa,'' William Boyd has made a fine and very funny contribution to that now familiar genre of the English comic novel. The plot is quick; the prose - for the most part - smooth; the humor, relentlessly black. Indeed ''Good Man'' frequently recalls the manner and tone perfected by such masters as Evelyn Waugh and Kingsley Amis - it is as though Lucky Jim had been suddenly transported to the mythical kingdom of Azania in ''Black Mischief.'' Yet if Mr. Boyd's style is somewhat derivative, his protagonist, Morgan Leafy, still deserves a place of his own in the pantheon of modern British anti-heroes. He is not, at first glance, a terribly likable fellow: as he himself points out, he is frequently ''rude, sulky, bullying, selfish, unpleasant, hypocritical, cowardly, conceited.'' He resents his social betters for wearing Old School ties and for being the favored sons of ''a bourgeois, ex-public school God,'' and he is dismissive of his inferiors, relishing any opportunity to catch his servants napping. His person seems as blemished as his soul. Pale, fat and balding, Morgan is the unfortunate prisoner of his flesh, indulging whenever he can in women and drink. ''There were two good things about living in Africa,'' he says to himself. ''Beer and sex.'' ''They were the only things in his life that didn't consistently let him down. They sometimes did, but not in the randomly cruel and arbitrary way that the other features of the world conspired to confuse and frustrate him.'' Why do we care about such a loser? In part, because we have become accustomed to rooting for the underdog. In part because Mr. Boyd writes with such energetic irony. And in part because Morgan experiences something of a spiritual awakening: although this change is not, to my mind, clearly enough delineated, the title phrase ''Good Man'' undergoes a transformation of sorts by the end of the novel, from a derisively used rugger-club expression to an acknowledgement of real moral worth. The supporting cast of ''Good Man'' is sketched in with less detail, but just as much brio. To be sure, many of the characters are familiar comic types - the dim-witted, demanding boss and the voluptuous coquette; the bored, snooty British expatriates and the rhetoric-loving revolutionaries -but Mr. Boyd manages to invest many of them with memorable eccentricity. There is Deputy High Commissioner Fanshawe, who deals with his posting in this ''Godforsaken insignificant spot'' by nostalgically recalling his past assignments in the Far East and decorating his Commission residence as a cross between a Buddhist temple and a Chinese restaurant. And there is Sam Adekunle, the Harvard Business School-educated chieftain who employs such Western techniques as blackmail to pull off one of his country's biggest real estate scams. Although Mr. Boyd's Africa is not quite so outrageous a place as Waugh's - none of the satiric capers in ''Good Man'' comes close to the ''Birth Control Gala'' in ''Black Mischief'' - it possesses a similar emotional geography. It is an absurd and eminently corrupt place, Kinjanja -a place where both the natives and post-colonial Britons are opportunists, bent on taking advantage of the country's ''dangerous languor.'' Thanks to the author's first-hand knowledge of the continent - he grew up in Nigeria and Ghana - the fictional landscape is also well grounded in particulars of time and place. There are, of course, things a reader might quarrel with: Mr. Boyd's penchant for broad humor and narrative pratfalls makes, at times, for an irritating glibness; and his technical mastery of the novel form obscures the fact that he has yet to develop a voice that is truly his own - the echoes of his predecessors haunt the achievement of this book. Still, this remains a precocious debut indeed, and I eagerly await Mr. Boyd's next novel.","completion":"\\"A Good Man in Africa\\" by William Boyd is a darkly humorous novel set in the West African nation of Kinjanja. The book explores the tormented life of its central character, Morgan Leafy, a First Secretary of the British Deputy Commission who finds himself entangled in political blackmail, a faltering love life, duplicitous election-rigging plans, and a looming coup. Morgan, who's revealed as an unlikable, flawed character battling personal and professional crises, eventually experiences a form of spiritual awakening. Despite drawing comparisons with other British comic novels and having a style reminiscent of Evelyn Waugh and Kingsley Amis, Boyd's work distinguishes itself with his vivid portrayal of a corrupt and absurd Africa grounded in details of time and place due to the author's own upbringing there. The supporting cast of characters adds a layer of eccentricity to the narrative, combining familiar comic archetypes with unique personalities contributing to the tangled chaos in Kinjanja. Though critique could be levied on the author's broad humor and over-bearing echoes of his predecessors, the book is seen as a promising debut offering from Boyd."},{"prompt":"Given the following passage \\"Red is one of the most common colors used on national flags.

Please answer the following question: What were the names of the streams where the sawmills were located? Answer the above question based on the context below: Like all creeks in Lycoming County, Larrys Creek served as an area for settlers to establish homesteads and farms. As logging became a major industry in the mid-19th century, the creek was a source of power for sawmills and other mills. The first sawmill on the creek, in what is now Mifflin Township, was built in 1799. The relatively low flow of water in the creek did not allow rafts of logs to be floated downstream to the river and the lumber boom at Williamsport (as they were on Pine Creek to the west).This and the lack of logging railroads along the creek led to the development of many small sawmills: the Larrys Creek watershed once had 53 sawmills within 22 miles (35 km) of the mouth (as well as other industries of the time). No other stream in the country had so many sawmills in so small a territory. Twelve sawmills were on the Second Fork, six on the First Fork, one each on Canoe Run and Lawshe Run, and the rest were on Larrys Creek itself. Eight were structures rebuilt on the site of previous sawmills, and only four were steam powered (the rest were water powered). The earliest of these sawmills was built in 1796 (near Seeley Run), the last in 1902 (on Lawshe Run), and by 1903 just two mills were still standing and only one of those was operating.Lumbering removed the tree trunks, but left many flammable limbs, branches, and stumps behind. On May 2, 1872, a large forest fire destroyed the villages of Carter and Gould, 6 miles (9.7 km) north of Salladasburg on Larrys Creek in Mifflin Township.

Without warning, fire shoots up from the ground and deep chasms open. Confused by the strange phenomenon, Taylor investigates a cliff wall and disappears before Nova's eyes. Elsewhere in the Forbidden Zone, a second spaceship has crash landed after being sent to search for Taylor and his crew. Like Taylor's ship, it has traveled into Earth's distant future. However, surviving astronaut Brent (James Franciscus) believes he has traveled to another planet. He encounters Nova and notices she is wearing Taylor's dog tags. Hoping Taylor is still alive, he rides with her to Ape City, where he is shocked to discover the simian civilization. He observes the gorilla General Ursus (James Gregory) leading a rally calling for the apes to conquer the Forbidden Zone and use it as a potential food source, against the objections of the orangutan Dr. Zaius (Maurice Evans). Brent is wounded by a gorilla soldier and taken by Nova to the home of the chimpanzees Cornelius (David Watson) and Zira (Kim Hunter), who treat his wound and tell him of their time with Taylor. The humans hide when Dr. Zaius arrives and announces that he will accompany Ursus on the invasion of the Forbidden Zone. Attempting to flee the city, Brent and Nova are captured by gorillas. Ursus orders they be used for target practice, but Zira helps them escape.

They have also served vehicles and crew-released heavy weapons in 1 : 6 scale . They have also released vehicles and serve heavy weapons in scale 1 : 6 .","completion":"Though the two sentences are fairly similar and discuss a similar subject matter, they do not have the exact same meaning due to differences in verb usage and the order of concepts. 1. \\"They have also served vehicles and crew-released heavy weapons in 1 : 6 scale.\\" In this sentence, serving seems to denote supporting or carrying out a function for the vehicles and the crew-released heavy weapons in a 1:6 scale. Here, \\"served\\" could potentially suggest a variety of actions depending on context, such as manufacturing, maintenance, or operation. It indicates some form of support or execution of duties. The adjective \\"crew-released\\" indicates that the heavy weapons were released by a crew. The provided scale (1:6) means the objects in consideration, which are vehicles and heavy-weapons, are significantly smaller than their real-life counterparts. The ratio indicates the model's size relative to the real thing. If, for example, the model is 1 foot long and the real vehicle is 6 feet long, the ratio is 1:6. 2. \\"They have also released vehicles and serve heavy weapons in scale 1 : 6 .\\" This sentence suggests they have released (perhaps meaning manufactured or marketed) both vehicles and heavy weapons in a 1:6 scale. Here, the term \\"serve\\" is used in association only with heavy weapons. This separation from the vehicles might suggest two different sets of actions—perhaps they manufacture vehicles and use or operate heavy weapons. Again, \\"scale 1:6\\" refers to the size of the vehicles and heavy weapons, which are significantly smaller than their real-life counterparts. In summary, the two sentences cannot be seen as interchangeable because they convey different roles that \\"they\\" seem to fulfill, particularly whether \\"they\\" are serving both vehicles and heavy weapons or releasing vehicles and serving heavy weapons. Additionally, the first sentence insinuates that the crew releases the heavy weapons, but the second sentence does not specify who does the releasing. As a result, the two sentences yield slightly different interpretations due to variations in the procession of the activities represented by the verbs and the structuring of the sentence. Their meanings are somewhat similar but not exactly the same."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

In the early 1880s Sardou began a collaboration with actress Sarah Bernhardt, whom he provided with a series of historical melodramas. His third Bernhardt play, La Tosca, which premiered in Paris on 24 November 1887, and in which she starred throughout Europe, was an outstanding success, with more than 3,000 performances in France alone.Puccini had seen La Tosca at least twice, in Milan and Turin. On 7 May 1889 he wrote to his publisher, Giulio Ricordi, begging him to get Sardou's permission for the work to be made into an opera: \\"I see in this Tosca the opera I need, with no overblown proportions, no elaborate spectacle, nor will it call for the usual excessive amount of music.\\"Ricordi sent his agent in Paris, Emanuele Muzio, to negotiate with Sardou, who preferred that his play be adapted by a French composer. He complained about the reception La Tosca had received in Italy, particularly in Milan, and warned that other composers were interested in the piece. Nonetheless, Ricordi reached terms with Sardou and assigned the librettist Luigi Illica to write a scenario for an adaptation.In 1891, Illica advised Puccini against the project, most likely because he felt the play could not be successfully adapted to a musical form. When Sardou expressed his unease at entrusting his most successful work to a relatively new composer whose music he did not like, Puccini took offence. He withdrew from the agreement, which Ricordi then assigned to the composer Alberto Franchetti. Illica wrote a libretto for Franchetti, who was never at ease with the assignment. When Puccini once again became interested in Tosca, Ricordi was able to get Franchetti to surrender the rights so he could recommission Puccini. One story relates that Ricordi convinced Franchetti that the work was too violent to be successfully staged. A Franchetti family tradition holds that Franchetti gave the work back as a grand..., can you guess it ? Answer:","completion":"Sardou"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Then they came up with an idea -- they would use two machines to keep her blood _ in her body. After waiting for about four months, D' Zhana had another heart transplant. It was very successful. When doctors use a man-made heart to keep a patient's life, they usually leave the patient's own heart in the body. \\"She, we believe, is possibly one of the youngest that had the machines without her own heart,\\" one of D' Zhana Simmons' doctors said.

Hypothesis: The items are in a junky room .Can we conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true?","completion":"Yes, if the premise is true and it states that umbrellas and junk are sitting in a messy room, we can conclude that the items are in a junky room. To thoroughly explain this conclusion, let's break down the premise and hypothesis and analyze them. Premise: Umbrellas and junk sitting in a messy room The premise provides a description of a situation where two kinds of items, umbrellas and junk, are present in a room. Additionally, the room is characterized as messy. A messy room typically implies that the items within it are disorganized, cluttered, or strewn about in a chaotic manner. This characteristic is important to understanding the overall scenario, as it provides context for the state of the room and helps justify the hypothesis. Hypothesis: The items are in a junky room The hypothesis suggests that the items, which are the umbrellas and junk identified in the premise, are in a room that is described as junky. The term \\"junky\\" can be synonymous with messy, cluttered, or disorganized. In this context, a \\"junky room\\" implies a room filled with items in a disorderly and chaotic state. When comparing the description of the room in the premise (messy) and in the hypothesis (junky), they both convey a similar state of disarray and disorganization. With this understanding, we can logically conclude that if the premise is true and umbrellas and junk are indeed sitting in a messy room, the items are in a junky room as described by the hypothesis. However, the given premise alone doesn't provide a complete picture of all possible factors contributing to the room's messiness or junkiness. There might be additional reasons why a room appears cluttered or disorganized, other items in the room could also contribute to the overall messiness. In this case, umbrellas and junk are only two contributing elements to the messiness of the room, but the hypothesis is still true when considering the given premise."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Volcanic activity: The formation of magma and its movement towards Earth's surface involve a series of geologic processes. Magma is formed when temperatures and pressures in the Earth's mantle cause rocks to partially melt, creating a molten mixture of minerals at extremely high temperatures (around 700°C to 1300°C). This magma rises to the surface due to the difference in density between the solid rock in Earth's crust and the molten mixture in the mantle. As the magma approaches the surface, it may encounter structural weaknesses or fractures, which can lead to the formation of volcanic conduits and ultimately an eruption. When magma reaches the surface, it can cool to form solid rock, depending on how fast the cooling process takes place. The cooling mechanism affects the crystal formation of minerals in the rock. 2. Butterfly population: Butterflies are insects belonging to the order Lepidoptera. They play an essential role in pollination, as they help transfer pollen between plants while feeding on nectar, thereby enabling reproduction in a wide range of plant species. The butterfly population can be affected by numerous factors, such as habitat loss, climate change, pesticides, and the availability of food sources (nectar-producing plants). These factors can lead to fluctuations in butterfly numbers, resulting in more or fewer butterflies in a specific environment. Now, let us analyze the relationship between volcanic activity and butterfly populations. Geologic processes, such as plate tectonics and mantle convection, drive the creation, movement, and eruption of magma. These processes occur independently of biological systems, including butterfly populations. The presence or absence of butterflies has no direct impact on geological processes and would not affect the amount of magma coming out of a volcano. In summary, considering both volcanic activity and butterfly populations, we can conclude that the number of butterflies in the environment has no direct effect on the amount or rate of magma emerging from a volcano. Therefore, the answer is C: No effect."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

This beautifully filmed and scripted episode was let down for two reasons. 1) Perhaps it was the morality of the 1950s talking, but no man left alone on an asteroid for years would react with such hysterical negativity to the gift of a female android. 2) It wasn't an android at all, but a woman, the beautiful Jean Marsh. The popularity of the sex doll industry in the coming decades could have traced its origins back to this episode if they'd done it properly. In fact, the modernization of sex-bots are in the news as I speak. Robots were not new to movies or television when this episode was made, so they could have at least had her act like one.

The reviewer acknowledges the beautifully filmed and scripted aspects of the episode, but ultimately feels that the handling of the android concept and adherence to 1950s moral standards let the episode down.

While a more accurate term is also used to refer to the period from 1750 to 1820 (the Classical period), this article is about the broad span of time from roughly the 11th century to the present day, which includes the Classical period and various other periods. The central norms of this tradition became codified between 1550 and 1900, which is known as the common-practice period. The major time divisions of Western art music are as follows: European art music is largely distinguished from many other non-European and some popular musical forms by its system of staff notation, in use since about the 16th century. Western staff notation is used by composers to indicate to the performer the pitches (e.g., melodies, basslines, chords), tempo, meter and rhythms for a piece of music. This can leave less room for practices such as improvisation and \\"ad libitum\\" ornamentation, which are frequently heard in non-European art music and in popular-music styles such as jazz and blues. Another difference is that whereas most popular styles adopt the song (strophic) form, classical music has been noted for its development of highly sophisticated forms of instrumental music such as the concerto, symphony, sonata, and mixed vocal and instrumental styles such as opera which, since they are written down, can sustain larger forms and attain a high level of complexity. - Ayreon is a musical project by Dutch songwriter, singer, multi-instrumentalist musician and record producer Arjen Anthony Lucassen. Ayreon's music is described as progressive rock, progressive metal and power metal sometimes combined with genres such as folk, electronica, experimental and classical music. The majority of Ayreon's albums are dubbed \\"rock operas\\" (or \\"metal operas\\") because the albums contain complex storylines featuring a host of characters, usually with each one being represented by a unique vocalist. - A bass-baritone is a high-lying bass or low-lying \\"classical\\" baritone voice type which shares certain qualities with the true baritone voice. The term arose in the late 19th century to describe the particular type of voice required to sing three Wagnerian roles: the Dutchman in \\"Der fliegende Holländer\\", Wotan/Der Wanderer in the \\"Ring Cycle\\" and Hans Sachs in \\"Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg\\". Wagner labelled these roles as \\"Hoher Bass\\" (\\"high bass\\")see fach for more details. - A choir (also known as a chorale or chorus) is a musical ensemble of singers. Choral music, in turn, is the music written specifically for such an ensemble to perform. Choirs may perform music from the classical music repertoire, which spans from the Medieval era to the present, and/or popular music repertoire. Most choirs are led by a conductor, who leads the performances with arm and face gestures. - Tenor is a type of classical male singing voice whose vocal range is one of the highest of the male voice types. The tenor's vocal range (in choral music) lies between C, the C one octave below middle C, and A, the A above middle C. In solo work, this range extends up to C, or \\"tenor high C\\". The low extreme for tenors is roughly A (two As below middle C). At the highest extreme, some tenors can sing up to two Fs above middle C (F). The tenor voice type is generally divided into the \\"leggero\\" tenor, lyric tenor, spinto tenor, dramatic tenor, heldentenor, and tenor buffo or spieltenor. - Vocal range is the measure of the breadth of pitches that a human voice can phonate. Although the study of vocal range has little practical application in terms of speech, it is a topic of study within linguistics, phonetics, and speech and language pathology, particularly in relation to the study of tonal languages and certain types of vocal disorders. However, the most common application of the term \\"vocal range\\" is within the context of singing, where it is used as one of the major defining characteristics for classifying singing voices into groups known as voice types. - Progressive rock (shortened as \\"prog\\"; sometimes \\"art rock\\", \\"classical rock\\" or \\"symphonic rock\\") is a broad subgenre of rock music that developed in the United Kingdom and United States throughout the mid to late 1960s. Initially termed \\"progressive pop\\", the style was an outgrowth of psychedelic bands who abandoned standard pop traditions in favour of instrumentation and compositional techniques more frequently associated with jazz, folk or classical music. Additional elements contributed to its \\"progressive\\" label: lyrics were more poetic, technology was harnessed for new sounds, music approached the condition of \\"art\\", and the studio, rather than the stage, became the focus of musical activity, which often involved creating music for listening, not dancing. - Shadow Project was an alt-rock/goth metal band formed in 1987 featuring former members of Los Angeles deathrock groups Christian Death and Super Heroines. After recording two LP records the group experienced a three-year hiatus, reconvening for a third and final album. Shadow Project definitively folded after vocalist Rozz Williams committed suicide in April 1, 1998. - Thrash metal is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal music characterized by its fast tempo and overall aggression. The songs usually use fast percussive beats and low-register guitar riffs, overlaid with shredding-style lead work. The lyrics often deal with social issues and reproach for The Establishment, using direct and denunciatory language, an approach borrowed from hardcore punk. - Eric Clayton ( born December 1 , 1967 ) is an American singer - songwriter and musician , best known for his work in the influential gothic symphonic metal group Saviour Machine which he formed with his brother Jeff Clayton in 1989 .

Christian Death is cited by some as a pioneer of the American gothic rock scene as well as deathrock. Williams was also involved with Daucus Karota, Heltir, and EXP; he also recorded several solo albums. - Damnation (Ride the Madness) is the 1999 studio solo album of the American deathrock veteran musician Eva O, released on the German label Massacre Records. The album was announced as the first half of a two album set, but the sequel, to be titled \\"Salvation (Are You Ready to Die?)\\", was not released. Her 2005 album \\"Damnation/Salvation\\" includes rerecorded versions of songs from this album along with the \\"Salvation (Are You Ready to Die?)\\" songs. - The guitar is a musical instrument classified as a string instrument with anywhere from four to 18 strings, usually having six. The sound is projected either acoustically, using a hollow wooden or plastic and wood box (for an acoustic guitar), or through electrical amplifier and a speaker (for an electric guitar). It is typically played by strumming or plucking the strings with the fingers, thumb and/or fingernails of the right hand or with a pick while fretting (or pressing against the frets) the strings with the fingers of the left hand. The guitar is a type of chordophone, traditionally constructed from wood and strung with either gut, nylon or steel strings and distinguished from other chordophones by its construction and tuning. The modern guitar was preceded by the gittern, the vihuela, the four-course Renaissance guitar, and the five-course baroque guitar, all of which contributed to the development of the modern six-string instrument. - Electronica is an umbrella term that encompasses a broad group of electronic-based styles such as techno, house, ambient, drum and bass, jungle, and industrial dance, among others. It has been used to describe the rise of electronic music styles intended not just for dancing but also concentrated listening. - Delain is a Dutch symphonic metal band formed in 2002 by former Within Temptation keyboardist Martijn Westerholt, and Charlotte Wessels.

Regarded as a veteran and \\"one of the most striking figures of the American Gothic scene,\\" Eva O has had a significant influence on the emerging deathrock movement, which garnered her the \\"Queen of Darkness\\" title from the press and audience. She is known for her heavy guitar playing style and dramatic, authoritative vocals. - A baritone is a type of classical male singing voice whose vocal range lies between the bass and the tenor voice types. It is the most common male voice. Originally from the Greek , meaning \\"deep (or heavy) sounding\\", music for this voice is typically written in the range from the second F below middle C to the F above middle C (i.e. FF) in choral music, and from the second A below middle C to the A above middle C (A to A) in operatic music, but can be extended at either end. The baritone voice type is generally divided into the baryton-Martin baritone (light baritone), lyric baritone, \\"Kavalierbariton\\", Verdi baritone, dramatic baritone, \\"baryton-noble\\" baritone, and the bass-baritone. - Singing is the act of producing musical sounds with the voice, and augments regular speech by the use of sustained tonality, rhythm, and a variety of vocal techniques. A person who sings is called a singer or vocalist. Singers perform music (arias, recitatives, songs, etc.) that can be sung with or without accompaniment by musical instruments. Singing is often done in an ensemble of musicians, such as a choir of singers or a band of instrumentalists. Singers may perform as soloists, or accompanied by anything from a single instrument (as in art song or some jazz styles) up to a symphony orchestra or big band. Different singing styles include art music such as opera and Chinese opera, religious music styles such as gospel, traditional music styles, world music, jazz, blues and popular music styles such as pop and rock. - Arjen Anthony Lucassen (born 3 April 1960, Netherlands) is a Dutch progressive metal/rock songwriter, singer, multi-instrumentalist musician and record producer, best known for his long-running progressive opera project titled Ayreon. - Devin Garrett Townsend (born May 5, 1972) is a Canadian musician, songwriter and record producer.

As with other Ayreon albums, it features guest appearances from several musicians previously unrelated to the project, including James LaBrie of Dream Theater, Mikael Åkerfeldt of Opeth, Eric Clayton of Saviour Machine, and Devin Townsend, performing music arranged and written by Lucassen. - Massacre Records is an independent record label based in Abstatt, Germany. - Within Temptation is a Dutch symphonic metal band founded in April 1995 by vocalist Sharon den Adel and guitarist Robert Westerholt. They have always been classified by critics as gothic metal, although the \\"gothic\\" influence varies with each album. Their most prominent and well-known sound is described as symphonic metal, although their earlier material, such as debut album \\"Enter\\", was mostly gothic metal. \\"Enter\\" even had a hint of doom metal. In an interview, Den Adel said they fell into a symphonic rock genre with various influences. In a later interview with Dutch music platform 3VOOR12, den Adel stated that \\"we consider ourselves more a symphonic rock band ... in my opinion, we are no gothic band\\". - Nightwish is a symphonic power metal band from Kitee, Finland. The band was formed in 1996 by lead songwriter and keyboardist Tuomas Holopainen, guitarist Emppu Vuorinen, and lead singer Tarja Turunen. The band soon picked up drummer Jukka Nevalainen, and then bassist Sami Vänskä after the release of their debut album, \\"Angels Fall First\\" (1997). In 2002, Vänskä was replaced by Marco Hietala, who also took over the male vocalist role previously filled by Holopainen or guest singers. - A voice type is a particular human singing voice identified as having certain qualities or characteristics of vocal range, vocal weight, tessitura, vocal timbre, and vocal transition points (\\"passaggio\\"), such as breaks and lifts within the voice. Other considerations are physical characteristics, speech level, scientific testing, and vocal register. A singer's voice type is identified by a process known as voice classification, by which the human voice is evaluated and thereby designated into a particular voice type. The discipline of voice classification developed within European classical music and is not generally applicable to other forms of singing. Voice classification is often used within opera to associate possible roles with potential voices. Several different voice classification systems are available to identify voice types, including the German \\"Fach\\" system and the choral music system among many others; no system is universally applied or accepted. - Progressive metal (sometimes known as prog metal or technical metal) is a fusion genre melding heavy metal and progressive rock which combines the loud \\"aggression\\" and amplified guitar-driven sound of the former with the more experimental, cerebral or \\"pseudo-classical\\" compositions of the latter. Whilst the genre emerged towards the late-1980s, it was not until the 1990s that progressive metal achieved commercial success. Dream Theater, Queensrÿche, Tool, Symphony X and Fates Warning are a few examples of progressive metal bands who achieved commercial success; additionally, many other thrash and death metal bands started to incorporate elements of progressive music in their work. Progressive metal's popularity started to decline towards the end of the 1990s, but it still remains a largely diffused underground genre with a committed fan base. - A film score (also sometimes called background score, background music, movie soundtrack, film music or incidental music) is original music written specifically to accompany a film. The score forms part of the film's soundtrack, which also usually includes dialogue and sound effects, and comprises a number of orchestral, instrumental, or choral pieces called cues, which are timed to begin and end at specific points during the film in order to enhance the dramatic narrative and the emotional impact of the scene in question. Scores are written by one or more composers, under the guidance of, or in collaboration with, the film's director or producer and are then usually performed by an ensemble of musicians most often comprising an orchestra or band, instrumental soloists, and choir or vocalists and recorded by a sound engineer. - Kevin James LaBrie (born May 5, 1963) is a Canadian vocalist and songwriter, who is best known as the lead singer of the American progressive metal band Dream Theater. - Lars Mikael Åkerfeldt (born 17 April 1974) is a Swedish musician, prominently known as the lead vocalist, guitarist, and primary songwriter of progressive death metal band Opeth, as well as being the former vocalist of death metal supergroup Bloodbath. He was also guitarist for the \\"one-off\\" band Steel, and is part of the collaboration Storm Corrosion with Steven Wilson. - Power metal is a subgenre of heavy metal combining characteristics of traditional metal with speed metal, often within symphonic context. Generally, power metal is characterized by a more uplifting sound, instead of the heaviness and dissonance prevalent in styles such as doom metal and death metal. Power metal bands usually have anthem-like songs with fantasy-based subject matter and strong choruses, thus creating a theatrical, dramatic and emotionally \\"powerful\\" sound. The term was first used in the middle of the 1980s and refers to two different but related styles: the first pioneered and largely practiced in North America with a harder sound similar to speed metal, and a later more widespread and popular style based in Europe (especially Scandinavia, Germany, Greece and Italy), South America (especially Brazil and Argentina) and Japan, with a lighter, more melodic sound and frequent use of keyboards. - Symphonic metal is a subgenre of metal music which combines the characteristics of this genre, such as heavy drums and guitars, with different elements of classical music including symphonic instruments, choirs and on occasion, a full symphony orchestra. Keyboards reminiscent of power metal also often find a dominant place in this subgenre. Symphonic metal bands often feature classically trained female vocalists, giving rise to the nickname opera metal or operatic metal, and it is not uncommon for them to feature a second vocalist performing growls, a more common characteristic of gothic metal. Perhaps the most typical and prominent examples of symphonic metal bands are Finnish band Nightwish, Dutch bands Within Temptation, Delain and Epica, and Swedish band Therion, all four of which place a large focus on elements prevalent in film scores on top of the more basic classical components utilized more widely in the genre. - Deathrock is a subgenre of punk rock incorporating horror elements and spooky atmospherics, that emerged on the West Coast of the United States in the early 1980s. - Dream Theater is an American progressive metal band formed in 1985 under the name Majesty by John Petrucci, John Myung, and Mike Portnoy while they attended Berklee College of Music in Boston, Massachusetts. They subsequently dropped out of their studies to concentrate further on the band that would ultimately become Dream Theater. Though a number of lineup changes followed, the three original members remained together along with James LaBrie and Jordan Rudess until September 8, 2010, when Portnoy left the band. In October 2010, the band held auditions for a drummer to replace Portnoy. Mike Mangini was announced as the new permanent drummer on April 29, 2011. - Christian metal, also known as white metal or heavenly metal, is a form of heavy metal music usually defined by its message using song lyrics as well as the dedication of the band members to Christianity. Christian metal is typically performed by professed Christians sometimes principally for Christians who listen to heavy metal music and often produced and distributed through various Christian networks. - Gothic metal (or goth metal) is a fusion genre combining the heaviness of heavy metal with the dark atmospheres of gothic rock. The music of gothic metal is diverse with bands known to adopt the gothic approach to different styles of heavy metal music. The genre originated during the early 1990s in Europe originally as an outgrowth of death-doom, a fusion of death metal and doom metal. Lyrics are generally dark and introspective with inspiration from gothic fiction as well as personal experiences. - Opeth is a Swedish heavy metal band from Stockholm, formed in 1989. The group has been through several personnel changes, but singer, guitarist and songwriter Mikael Åkerfeldt has remained Opeth's primary driving force throughout the years. Opeth has consistently incorporated progressive, folk, blues, classical and jazz influences into its usually lengthy compositions, as well as strong influences from death metal, especially in their early works. Many songs include acoustic guitar passages and strong dynamic shifts, as well as both death growls and clean vocals. Opeth is also well known for their incorporation of Mellotrons in their work. Opeth rarely made live appearances supporting their first four albums; but since conducting their first world tour after the 2001 release of \\"Blackwater Park\\", they have led several major world tours. - Saviour Machine was an American Christian metal band that formed in 1989. They have released five studio albums and two live albums on Frontline and subsequently on MCM Music, distributed through Massacre Records. Saviour Machine's music and lyrics deal with war, death, and personal introspection as it relates to prophecy and divine revelation. - Music is an art form and cultural activity whose medium is sound and silence, which exist in time. The common elements of music are pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the \\"color\\" of a musical sound). Different styles or types of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs without instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and instruments. The word derives from Greek (\\"mousike\\"; \\"art of the Muses\\"). In its most general form, the activities describing music as an art form include the production of works of music (songs, tunes, symphonies, and so on), the criticism of music, the study of the history of music, and the aesthetic examination of music. Ancient Greek and Indian philosophers defined music as tones ordered horizontally as melodies and vertically as harmonies. Common sayings such as \\"the harmony of the spheres\\" and \\"it is music to my ears\\" point to the notion that music is often ordered and pleasant to listen to. However, 20th-century composer John Cage thought that any sound can be music, saying, for example, \\"There is no noise, only sound.\\" - Damnation/Salvation is the 2005 studio solo album of the American deathrock veteran musician Eva O, released on the Dark Dimensions and Alice In... labels.

Article: Adrian Peterson has been suspended without pay for at least the remainder of this season. The NFL announced its highly anticipated ruling Tuesday morning, stating that the Minnesota Vikings' star running back will not be considered for reinstatement before April 15, 2015, for violating the league's personal conduct policy. Editor's Picks Goessling: Peterson's time in Minnesota likely over The NFL's punishment of Adrian Peterson was so thorough it likely means the end of Peterson's time in Minnesota, Ben Goessling writes. The league said it informed Peterson of the ruling in a letter from commissioner Roger Goodell, who spelled out a path for his return to the field. The Vikings have six games left this season. The league's enhanced disciplinary policy calls for a six-game suspension for first offenses of assault, battery or domestic violence. Aggravating circumstances warrant higher levels of discipline, and Goodell's letter to Peterson spelled that out. But a league source told ESPN's Ed Werder that it is \\"very possible\\" that Peterson could return to the field for this Sunday's game against the Green Bay Packers, pending a ruling by the independent arbitrator in Monday's grievance hearing. The NFL Players Association quickly announced its plan to appeal and sharply rebuked what it calls the league's inconsistency and unfairness in the process. If arbitrator Shyam Das rules in favor of Peterson, he could play while his appeal of Tuesday's suspension is heard, according to rules laid out in the NFL's collective bargaining agreement. Goodell, under the CBA, would decide who hears Peterson's appeal. Another source told ESPN's Chris Mortensen that if Das decides Peterson should be reinstated, the issue will become more complex and \\"there will be many lawyers involved.\\" \\"You have shown no meaningful remorse for your conduct. When indicted, you acknowledged what you did but said that you would not 'eliminate whooping my kids' and defended your conduct in numerous published text messages to the child's mother. You also said that you felt 'very confident with my actions because I know my intent.' These comments raise the serious concern that you do not fully appreciate the seriousness of your conduct, or even worse, that you may feel free to engage in similar conduct in the future.\\" Excerpt from NFL commissioner Roger Goodell's letter to Adrian Peterson Peterson was indicted in September on a felony charge of injury to a child for using a wooden switch to discipline his 4-year-old son earlier this year. The All-Pro pleaded no contest to a lesser charge of misdemeanor reckless assault Nov. 4, setting the stage for the NFL's ruling. Peterson was placed on a special exempt list at the sole discretion of Goodell on Sept. 18, essentially paid leave while his case went through the legal system. The NFLPA said Peterson was told that would count as time served for any suspension levied, citing an unnamed NFL executive. League spokesman Brian McCarthy told The Associated Press in an email that Peterson's stay on the exempt list was taken into account. \\"There were aggravating circumstances that led to the discipline announced,\\" McCarthy told the AP. The league's statement included excerpts of the letter written by Goodell, who has required that Peterson undergo counseling and treatment in order to be reinstated. \\"We are prepared to put in place a program that can help you to succeed, but no program can succeed without your genuine and continuing engagement,\\" Goodell wrote in the letter. \\"You must commit yourself to your counseling and rehabilitative effort, properly care for your children, and have no further violations of law or league policy.\\" The Vikings also released a statement, saying they \\"respect the league's decision and will have no further comment at this time.\\" Peterson's case revived a debate about corporal punishment, which is on the decline in the U.S. but still widely practiced in homes and schools. Peterson has repeatedly claimed that he never intended to harm his son and was disciplining him in the same way he had been as a child growing up in East Texas. Goodell, however, expressed concern in his letter that Peterson does not \\"fully appreciate the seriousness\\" of his conduct. \\"You have shown no meaningful remorse for your conduct,\\" Goodell's letter said. \\"When indicted, you acknowledged what you did but said that you would not 'eliminate whooping my kids' and defended your conduct in numerous published text messages to the child's mother. You also said that you felt 'very confident with my actions because I know my intent.' \\"These comments raise the serious concern that you do not fully appreciate the seriousness of your conduct, or even worse, that you may feel free to engage in similar conduct in the future.\\" ||||| MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Adrian Peterson's potential return to the Minnesota Vikings is at the heart of a dispute between the NFL and the players' association, and the star running back thinks the league is being unfair. Peterson criticized the NFL on Sunday over the process of being activated from a special exempt list after he pleaded no contest Nov. 4 to misdemeanor reckless assault in Texas for hitting his 4-year-old son with a wooden switch. The union filed a grievance with the league, demanding Peterson be allowed to rejoin the Vikings until the determination of any punishment under the personal conduct policy. The NFL, however, ruled Peterson must remain on paid leave in the meantime. Commissioner Roger Goodell has the sole power to remove him from the special exempt list. \\"At this point, I've resolved my matter in the criminal court; I've worked to make amends for what I've done; I've missed most of the season, and I stand ready to be candid and forthcoming with Mr. Goodell about what happened,\\" Peterson said in a statement issued by the NFL Players Association. \\"However, I will not allow the NFL to impose a new process of discipline on me, ignore the CBA, ignore the deal they agreed to with me, and behave without fairness or accountability. The process they are pushing is arbitrary, inconsistent, and contrary to what they agreed to do, and for those reasons, I never agreed to the hearing.\\" The NFL offered Peterson the hearing, but a hearing is only required by the CBA if a player elects to appeal a punishment. In this case, no decision has been made yet on discipline. The NFL's enhanced penalty for players involved in domestic violence, announced by Goodell in August, is a six-game suspension. The injuries to Peterson's son occurred in May. Peterson said he meant no harm in his attempt to discipline the boy. The league had no further comment Sunday, referring to its statement from the previous day that it offered three days in advance a hearing for Peterson that would have been held Friday to review the case. The union then informed the league Thursday of its refusal to meet. In the statement, Peterson said the NFLPA sent repeated questions to the NFL about the nature and purpose of the hearing that went unanswered. \\"After consulting with the union, I told the NFL that I will attend the standard meeting with the Commissioner prior to possible imposition of discipline, as has been the long-term practice under the CBA, but I wouldn't participate in a newly created and non-collectively bargained pre-discipline 'hearing' that would include outside people I don't know and who would have roles in the process that the NFL wouldn't disclose,\\" Peterson said. Regarding the grievance, an arbitrator was scheduled to hear arguments from both sides Monday. That's only to determine whether Peterson should be immediately reinstated prior to the league's issuance of any discipline. He could, in theory, be ordered back to the team only to be suspended soon after. But as Minnesota played Chicago Sunday, time was running out on this season for the 2012 NFL MVP. The Vikings have six games left after this weekend. ___ AP NFL websites: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL |||||Summary:","completion":"Adrian Peterson, the Minnesota Vikings' star running back, has been suspended without pay for at least the remainder of this season.

(CNN) -- The wife of fugitive Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, three of his children and some of his grandchildren arrived in Algeria on Monday morning, Algerian diplomats said. Mourad Benmehidi, the Algerian ambassador to the United Nations, said he relayed the news to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon earlier Monday. Benmehidi said his country granted entrance to Gadhafi's wife, Safia, his daughter, Aisha, sons Hannibal and Mohamed and their children on \\"humanitarian grounds.\\" \\"We made sure the international community has been informed,\\" said Benmehidi. The ambassador said he did not know whether Moammar Gadhafi was expected to seek entry into Algeria and claimed none of the Gadhafis were subject to U.N. Security Council sanctions. In fact, U.N. Security Council Resolution 1970, passed on February 26, includes the names of all three Gadhafi children who are now in Algeria as being subject to a \\"travel ban\\" because of their \\"closeness of association with (the) regime.\\" The U.N. ban requires \\"all member states\\" to prevent them and others listed from entering their territories, unless there is some special circumstance that the council agrees warrants an exception.

For the most part, jogging can be a healthy way to stay fit. However, problems can also develop for those who jog in the heat. Excessive sweating can lead to electrolyte loss that could be life-threatening. Early symptoms of electrolyte deficiency can include nausea, fatugue, and dizziness. If not treated, individuals can experience muscle weakness and increased heart rate (which could lead to a heart attack). Many sports drinks can be consumed to restore electrolytes quickly in the body. Paragraph: Kevin and his cousin Darlene both enjoy jogging for exercise. One day, Kevin goes out for a jog in his local neighborhood when the amount of heat outside is quite high, and he begins to sweat a lot and starts to feel a bit dizzy. On the same day, Darlene goes jogging in her neighborhood when the amount of heat outside is low and she feels perfectly normal as she continues to jog. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Who is more likely to be experiencing electrolyte deficiency? Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, Kevin is more likely to be experiencing electrolyte deficiency. This is due to several factors that are present in his situation, compared to Darlene's. Firstly, the amount of heat outside is quite high when Kevin goes for a jog. This can contribute to excessive sweating as his body tries to cool itself down in response to the increased temperature. When a person sweats a lot, it leads to a loss of electrolytes, which are essential minerals like sodium, potassium, and magnesium that play vital roles in regulating various body functions, including muscle contractions and maintaining fluid balance. The paragraph also mentions that Kevin starts to feel dizzy during his jog. Dizziness is one of the early symptoms of electrolyte deficiency, which can result from excessive sweating and subsequent loss of electrolytes. This further supports the likelihood of Kevin experiencing electrolyte deficiency. On the other hand, Darlene goes jogging in her neighborhood when the amount of heat outside is low. This implies that Darlene is less likely to be sweating excessively and consequently, she has a lower risk of losing significant amounts of electrolytes. Moreover, she feels perfectly normal while jogging, which indicates that she doesn't appear to be experiencing any symptoms of electrolyte deficiency, such as nausea, fatigue, or dizziness. In conclusion, considering the various factors and symptoms present in the given paragraph, Kevin is more likely to be experiencing electrolyte deficiency when compared to Darlene. Proper intervention, such as consuming sports drinks or electrolyte supplements, would be necessary to quickly restore the electrolytes in Kevin's body and prevent further complications, such as muscle weakness or a potentially life-threatening impact on his heart rate."},{"prompt":"Context: Robin was sleeping at their friends house and had woken up very early before anyone else was up, so Robin made their coffee for them.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. What is the solution to this math problem? Solve 1738*y - 3593*y + 250 + 174 = -1802*y for y.","completion":"Alright, let's break this down together! We have a math problem with a bunch of numbers and the letter \\"y.\\" We're trying to find out what number y represents. Here's the problem: 1738*y - 3593*y + 250 + 174 = -1802*y First, let's add together the numbers that have a \\"y\\" with them. We've got 1738*y, -3593*y, and -1802*y on the other side of the equal sign. When you combine these together, you get: 1738*y - 3593*y + 1802*y = (1738 - 3593 + 1802) * y = (-53) * y So, now our problem looks like this: -53*y + 250 + 174 = 0 Now, let's add the other numbers we have - 250 and 174. 250 + 174 = 424 Now, our problem looks like this: -53*y + 424 = 0 Our goal is to find out what y is, so we'll need to get y all by itself. To do that, we'll move the 424 from the left side of the equal sign to the right side. We do this by subtracting 424 from both sides: -53*y = -424 Now, we have -53 * y = -424. To find out what y is, we'll divide both sides of the equal sign by -53: y = -424 / -53 When you divide -424 by -53, you get: y = 8 So, the answer to the math problem is y = 8!

It is only later when he has aged and been through many battles that he learns an important lesson: there is no \\"I \\" in \\"team\\". There is no better example of the value of teamwork than the Boston Celtics. Paul Pierce, Ray Allen and Kevin Garnett were all superstars on three different teams. Yet, none of them had any titles to show for it. Then, last season, they decided to sacrifice money and individual statistics to play together. Garnett and Allen joined Pierce on the Celtics and changed the NBA in the process. It started in simple ways. Garnett and Allen are two of the most intense athletes in the world. They treat every second of every practice like it is the NBA championship. If you want to play alongside them then you will have to do the same. So, the young guys on the Celtics started giving their full effort too. Pierce had been the star of the Celtics for many years. He used to shoot the ball many times a game. But with the addition of Allen and Garnett he shot less and focused on defense. His selflessness showed the young players that doing what made the team better was the only thing that mattered. When the Celtics were winning and the game was almost over, Garnett, Pierce and Allen would come out of the game. But they wouldn't just sit on the bench. Instead, they stood and cheered and screamed for their teammates. They wanted to support their friends and teammates. Now, the guys who don't play know they can still affect the game by cheering so they scream and cheer when Garnett, Allen and Pierce are playing. The Celtics have developed a strong relationship. They are more than just teammates. They are brothers. The result: the Boston Celtics won the championship and are considered the favorites to win the Eastern Conference championship again this year. There is a saying that goes, \\"A successful team beats with one heart.\\" If that is the case, the Celtics may have the biggest heart in the NBA. Question: Which of the following didn't contribute to the success of the Boston Celtics?

What sentence would provide a factual answer to this question: \\"Why would happen if the screw was loose on a bicycle's tire?\\"","completion":"If the screw was loose on a bicycle's tire, several potential consequences could arise, depending on various factors, such as the location of the loose screw, the degree of looseness, and the type of tire and wheel system involved. In general, a loose screw may compromise the stability and integrity of a bicycle's tire, potentially leading to decreased performance, safety hazards, or even damage to the bicycle and its components. 1. Decreased performance: A loose screw on a bicycle's tire may cause wobbling or vibrations while riding, leading to an uncomfortable and less efficient cycling experience. This could result in increased difficulty in maintaining balance, navigating turns, or accelerating, all of which might negatively impact a cyclist's speed and overall performance. 2. Safety hazards: A loose screw on a bicycle's tire may increase the chances of various safety risks, such as punctures or tire blowouts. If the screw happens to be a part of the tire's bead, which secures the tire's edges to the wheel rim, a loose screw could mean the tire is not properly attached and may come off the rim while riding. Depending on the speed and the nature of the terrain, this situation could lead to accidents, injuries, or damage to the bicycle. 3. Damage to bicycle components: A loose screw on a bicycle's tire might lead to long-term damage to the wheel, the tire, or other associated components. For instance, if the screw is responsible for connecting the rim to the bicycle hub and remains loose over time, the wobbling and vibrations could lead to additional strain on spoke tension and can eventually cause the spokes to break. This, in turn, may lead to a warped or damaged rim, which could necessitate costly repairs or replacements. 4. Uneven tire wear: In cases where the loose screw is located on the tire's valve or is part of a tubeless tire system, it could lead to an uneven distribution of air pressure within the tire. This might speed up the tire's wear in specific areas, as opposed to the usual uniform wear. In turn, this uneven wear may necessitate premature replacement of the tire. In conclusion, a loose screw on a bicycle's tire can cause a range of issues, from decreased performance to safety hazards and damage to the bicycle's components. To maintain optimal functionality and safety, it is crucial to regularly inspect one's bicycle for loose screws and tighten or replace them as needed."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Please answer the following question: Question: \\"What is an interesting fact about the Cretaceious, or than chalk?\\" Context: \\"To the north of Africa the Tethys Sea continued to narrow. Broad shallow seas advanced across central North America (the Western Interior Seaway) and Europe, then receded late in the period, leaving thick marine deposits sandwiched between coal beds. At the peak of the Cretaceous transgression, one-third of Earth's present land area was submerged. The Cretaceous is justly famous for its chalk; indeed, more chalk formed in the Cretaceous than in any other period in the Phanerozoic. Mid-ocean ridge activity—or rather, the circulation of seawater through the enlarged ridges—enriched the oceans in calcium; this made the oceans more saturated, as well as increased the bioavailability of the element for calcareous nanoplankton. These widespread carbonates and other sedimentary deposits make the Cretaceous rock record especially fine. Famous formations from North America include the rich marine fossils of Kansas's Smoky Hill Chalk Member and the terrestrial fauna of the late Cretaceous Hell Creek Formation. Other important Cretaceous exposures occur in Europe and China. In the area that is now India, massive lava beds called the Deccan Traps were laid down in the very late Cretaceous and early Paleocene.\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"An interesting fact about the Cretaceous period, also known as \\"the age of chalk,\\" is that it witnessed the most extensive chalk formation in Earth's history. This unique geological phenomenon occurred due to the interplay of various factors, including shifting tectonic plates, changes in ocean chemistry, and the evolution of calcareous nanoplankton, which significantly contributed to the massive chalk deposits. During the Cretaceous period, the Tethys Sea continued to narrow as shallow seas advanced across central North America and Europe. At its peak, one-third of Earth's present land area was submerged underwater, leaving marine deposits and coal beds as evidence of the transgression. As the continents underwent significant changes in their positions and shapes, the shifting of tectonic plates resulted in the emergence of mid-ocean ridges. These mid-ocean ridges played a crucial role in the formation of chalk by allowing seawater to circulate through them, enriching the oceans with calcium. This increase in calcium saturation not only created ideal conditions for chalk formation but also enhanced the bioavailability of the element for calcareous nanoplankton – microscopic marine organisms that use calcium to build their shells. These nanoplankton thrived in the Cretaceous oceans and, upon their death, their calcareous shells sank to the seafloor and accumulated, ultimately creating massive chalk deposits over time. The extensive chalk formations from the Cretaceous period have contributed significantly to the rich geological record preserved in various locations across the globe. Famous examples include Kansas's Smoky Hill Chalk Member, teeming with marine fossils, and the Hell Creek Formation, which contains fossils of terrestrial fauna. In addition to North America, the Cretaceous chalk formations are also evident in Europe and China. Another noteworthy geological event that occurred during the late Cretaceous and early Paleocene was the formation of the Deccan Traps in present-day India. Massive lava flows covered the region, creating layers of basaltic rock that still remain today. These volcanic eruptions may have played a role in the mass extinction event marking the end of the Cretaceous period. In conclusion, the Cretaceous period holds significant importance as the age of chalk, with more chalk formations occurring during this time than in any other period of Earth's Phanerozoic history. This fascinating fact can be attributed to the interplay of tectonic movements, changes in ocean chemistry, and the proliferation of calcareous nanoplankton – a remarkable testament to the dynamic geological processes that shaped our planet during this era."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:- The trees and plants burn - The animals lose their homes - If the animals can not escape, they may die from smoke inhalation - The plants that provide food are gone - The animals have little to eat - What might be the first step of the process? A:","completion":"A: The first step of the process causing the sequence of events mentioned above is most likely a forest fire, also known as a wildfire. Forest fires are uncontrolled fires that occur in areas with dense vegetation, such as forests, woodlands, or grasslands. These fires can be ignited by both natural and human factors and spread at various speeds depending on fuel availability, weather conditions, and topography. Natural factors that contribute to forest fires can include lightning, volcanic eruptions, and spontaneous combustion from decaying organic matter. Human factors causing wildfires are often due to careless activities, such as unattended campfires, discarded cigarettes, or even intentional arson activities. Once a forest fire begins, it consumes trees, plants, and other organic materials in its path, leading to a series of consequences that impact the ecosystem. The smoke produced by burning trees and plants, for example, can pose a serious threat to animals living in the forest. These animals often lose their homes due to the destruction of their habitat, forcing them to migrate or perish in the flames. When smoke inhalation becomes too much for those that do not escape the fire, there's a risk for many animals to die due to suffocation and respiratory issues. With the destruction of plants and trees, the food sources for these animals become scarce, leading to a significant decrease in available nourishment. Furthermore, these events can create a ripple effect throughout the ecosystem. Herbivores lose their primary food sources, which in turn affects predators that rely on herbivores for sustenance. The loss of vegetation can also result in soil erosion, diminished air quality, and alteration of the landscape, making the recovery process for the ecosystem slow and challenging. The key to preventing such catastrophic events from happening is understanding the importance of forest fire management, which includes preventive measures such as controlled burns, monitoring lightning-prone areas, and minimizing human activities that can ignite fires. Additionally, public awareness campaigns and emergency response plans for communities living close to forests help to reduce the risk of wildfires and mitigate the damage they cause. To summarize, the first step of this devastating process is the ignition and spread of a forest fire or wildfire. It leads to the destruction of trees and plants, the displacement and potential death of animals due to their homes being destroyed and smoke inhalation, and the scarcity of food sources for those remaining. Preventing these incidents from happening requires a combination of appropriate forest management practices, public awareness, and community preparedness to protect and sustain the ecosystem."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Around 1880, two young British officers arrive to join a regiment in India. One, Lieutenant Drake, from a middle-class background, is extremely eager to fit in while the other, Lieutenant Millington, the son of a general, is keen to get out as soon as possible and deliberately antagonizes his fellow officers. The two newcomers learn the traditions of the regiment, one of which is a mess game in which they chase a wooden pig on wheels, attempting to pierce its anus with their swords. Mrs Scarlett, the flirtatious and attractive widow of a captain who was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross, is a constant presence in the regiment. One night at a mess dance, Millington gets drunk and tries to seduce Mrs Scarlett in the garden. She repels him, but moments later runs back into the mess wounded and in shock, claiming the culprit was Millington. An informal court martial -more a mock trial than anything else- is organized with Drake ordered to be Millington's defending officer. Although Drake is pressured by his superior officer to plead guilty for Millington and close the case quickly, he begins to challenge the orders in order to give the defendant a fair trial. Drake learns from an Indian servant that another widow suffered a similar attack with a sword six months earlier, before he and Millington joined. After irrefutable evidence, Mrs Scarlett finally admits it was not Millington who attacked her but will not say who the culprit is. Millington, now indisputably proved innocent, is welcomed back by his brother officers; but Drake, disgusted by the truth he's uncovered, resigns.

Context: After years of negotiation, three Great Powers, Russia, the United Kingdom and France, decided to intervene in the conflict and each nation sent a navy to Greece. Following news that combined Ottoman–Egyptian fleets were going to attack the Greek island of Hydra, the allied fleet intercepted the Ottoman–Egyptian fleet at Navarino. After a week-long standoff, a battle began which resulted in the destruction of the Ottoman–Egyptian fleet.

(CNN) -- A former campaign staffer for San Diego Mayor Bob Filner became the second woman to publicly accuse him of sexual harassment, saying Tuesday that the then-congressman patted her \\"posterior\\" while at a fundraising event. Laura Fink, who now runs a political consulting firm, told KPBS-TV that it happened in 2005 when she was working as Filner's deputy campaign manager. Fink said she didn't go public with the incident at the time because she was trying to build her political career. But she said she now feels emboldened to tell her story after Filner's former spokeswoman, Irene McCormack Jackson, sued him for sexual harassment Monday. Jackson said Filner subjected her and other women to \\"crude and disgusting\\" comments and inappropriate touching. She said she resigned as Filner's communications director in June after deciding the mayor would not change his behavior. \\"I had to work and do my job in an atmosphere where women were viewed by Mayor Filner as sexual objects or stupid idiots,\\" Jackson said. She said Filner asked her to work without underwear and made repeated sexual advances toward her. \\"He is not fit to be mayor of our great city. He is not fit to hold any public office.

Here is a news article: Police say some of the sexual assaults of an 11-year-old girl occurred at this abandoned trailer house in a part of Cleveland called \\"the Hood.\\" CLEVELAND - All Maria wanted was to see her 11-year-old daughter. Weeks ago, the girl had been hushed away to a \\"safe house\\" for her own protection - after the phone calls started, and the disturbing, sexually explicit videos began surfacing in this town of 9,000 about 50 miles north of downtown Houston. Seventeen men and boys, including a middle school student and adults in their 20s, have been charged with sexually assaulting Maria's daughter, a sixth-grader, in a dingy trailer. That number could grow to 28. Last week, while hospitalized for an illness, Maria finally received a brief visit from the girl. \\"My daughter was crying and crying and hugging on me,\\" Maria said. \\"She didn't want to leave. She misses her family and wants to come home.\\" But the family's tiny gray wooden home off a long, dark forested road on the outskirts of town is no longer considered safe for the 11-year-old. Child Protective Services put the girl in a foster home for her protection and restricted her family from even speaking to her, the family said. Local officials say the attack has devastated this close-knit community, leaving many to wonder who will be charged next. There's talk that a star athlete at Cleveland High School was seen sexually assaulting the girl on the video. The son of a local school board member is involved, too. Someone has been making phone calls to Maria's house. Police fear they're coming from people seeking retribution. \\"They keep calling and asking for her,\\" said Maria, whose last name is not being printed to protect her daughter's identity. \\"They don't believe me when I say she's not here and cuss us out. They're trying to find her. This is the time when she needs us the most.\\" Music blaring Cleveland, a town whose history dates to 1836, is nestled near the picturesque Sam Houston National Forest. Timber, cattle, farming and oil fuel the town's economy. Normally a quiet place, the community recently has been in an uproar over a looming election to recall three City Council members accused of mismanagement. When the sex assault story broke wide open in recent weeks, the town gained further unwanted attention. The editor of the Cleveland Advocate, Vanesa Brashier, who has kept her hand on the pulse of this community, said, “Feelings are raw as these things keep happening and then there’s no time to heal. Our town has been in the spotlight too much lately.” Some Cleveland residents, like Kisha Williams, are critical of the 11-year-old’s parents. “Where were they when this girl was seen wandering at all hours with no supervision and pretending to be much older?” she asked. Several churches have organized special prayer events for the town. Carter Williams, 64, seated at a small card table playing dominoes inside a local grocery, does not think laying blame is the right response to the sex assault. “This is a praying time for the young men and the young girl,” Williams said. “Seems like everyone in this whole town needs some God in their life.” Inside a trailer Over the Thanksgiving holiday, retiree Joe Harrison noticed an 11-year-old girl as he walked past an abandoned trailer to play dominoes with friends in what locals call \\"the Hood.\\" He thought the girl looked older than her years with her long hair and dark makeup. She was standing near the aging brown trailer, which was partially covered by a blue tarp and had remained unoccupied since Hurricane Ike except for an occasional drug user who would sneak inside to smoke crack. Later, Harrison heard loud music blaring from that same trailer on Ross Street. But he thought the girl had already been picked up by her mother. He never realized anything horrible might have happened until weeks later when the arrests started. \\"I have a granddaughter that age and can't imagine anything like that happening to her,\\" he said. \\"Whoever did this should pay for it.\\" Cleveland police say the 11-year-old was sexually assaulted inside that trailer and a small blue house with white trim around the corner. The assaults happened Nov. 28 after a 19-year-old with prior drug convictions persuaded the young girl to leave her house and go \\"riding around\\" with him and two other young men, according to a Cleveland police officer's sworn statement. They first went to the blue house, where she was ordered to disrobe. If she refused, the statement said, she was warned other girls would beat her up and she would never get a ride back home. Soon she was having sex with multiple young men there, the statement said. Someone used a phone to invite four more men, who soon arrived. Not long afterward, the group fled through a back window when they heard a relative of one of the teens arriving at the blue house. The 11-year-old left behind her bra and panties as the group moved to the nearby abandoned trailer, where the assaults continued. As the men had sex with the girl, others used their cell phones to take photographs and video, police said. Familiar faces in video Over the next two days, the recordings went viral around school. One student who recognized the girl and several of the young men, including star athletes, in the videos, alerted school authorities and triggered the investigation. So far, 17 suspects have been charged, ranging in age from a middle-schooler to a 27-year-old. Seven are high school students, including two members of Cleveland's state-ranked basketball team. Another is the 21-year-old son of a school board member. Several have prior criminal records for drug sales, aggravated robbery and manslaughter. James D. Evans III, an attorney who represents three of the defendants, insists: \\"This is not a case of a child who was enslaved or taken advantage of.\\" Investigators note an 11-year-old can never legally give consent. On her Facebook page, the 11-year-old tells whomever she befriends that she's aware people have probably heard about her, but she doesn't care what they think. \\"If you dislike me, deal with it,\\" she wrote. Sometimes she comes across like a little girl, such as when she talks of her special talent for making \\"weird sound effects\\" and \\"running in circles\\" to overcome nervousness. But she also makes flamboyant statements about drinking, smoking and sex. Yet her vulnerability pokes through the tough veneer as she tells of \\"being hurt many times,\\" where she \\"settled for less\\" and \\"let people take advantage\\" and \\"walk all over\\" her. She vows to learn from her mistakes. While Maria said she never saw any of her daughter's Internet postings, she believes her 11-year-old might have been seeking misguided attention. Earlier signs of trouble Shortly before the video recordings surfaced at school, there was a sign of trouble. Her daughter had borrowed her father's cell phone, and afterward Maria discovered a lurid photo of a young man that had been e-mailed to it. \\"I asked about it, and she said she knew nothing. So I told her I was taking it to the police, and I did,\\" Maria said. \\"They still have the phone. And I've not heard anything back.\\" Meanwhile, not only has the girl been forced from the town where she was born, but authorities also want the entire family to relocate. \\"The police think we may be in danger. Because if they can't get my 11-year-old, they might take out their revenge on us,\\" said Maria, as extra patrols are making rounds down her street. Neither Cleveland police nor Child Protective Services would discuss the safety issue or a closed-door hearing with the family held Friday in Coldspring. State District Judge Elizabeth Coker said a gag order has been issued. Struggle for children Maria's two older daughters, who are in advanced placement classes and the band, and her 9-year-old son have all cried about being uprooted. However, the 11-year-old, who was withdrawn from Cleveland schools when the videos surfaced, is enrolled in gifted and talented classes at her new school and is \\"doing fine,\\" Maria said. Yet life for the children has been a struggle, as their father cannot find carpentry work and their mother earns very little by cleaning houses. The mortgage holder recently notified the family that they were being evicted but gave them extra time because of the family crisis. The stress has grown so intense, the 16-year-old daughter said, that her parents considered separating, while the 11-year-old is having regrets about following through with the case. But Maria wants those who stole her daughter's childhood prosecuted. She said her daughter was threatened with beatings or death if she refused to cooperate. \\"These guys knew she was in middle school,\\" Maria said. \\"You could tell that whenever you talked to her. She still loves stuffed bears.\\" cindy.horswell@chron.com ||||| There are many reasons why one might reach for a tube of lip balm.

Trivia question: Name the country in Europe which is double landlocked (surrounded by landlocked countries)? And the answer is?","completion":"The country in Europe that is double landlocked, meaning it is surrounded entirely by landlocked countries, is Liechtenstein. Liechtenstein is a small principality located in the heart of Europe, situated between Switzerland and Austria. With a total area of only 160 square kilometers (around 62 square miles), it is one of the smallest countries in the world. Despite its small size, Liechtenstein is a highly developed nation and is known for its strong economy, beautiful scenery, and historic castles. The country is predominantly mountainous, with the majority of its landscape dominated by the Alps. The eastern part of the country is relatively more flat and is where most of the population resides. Liechtenstein has a population of around 38,000, making it one of the least populated countries in Europe. The primary language spoken in Liechtenstein is German, and the country's official name is Fürstentum Liechtenstein, which translates to \\"Principality of Liechtenstein\\" in English. The nation is a constitutional monarchy, with the reigning prince, currently Prince Hans-Adam II, holding a significant amount of political power. Liechtenstein is unique in that it is one of the only two double landlocked countries in the world, the other one being Uzbekistan in Central Asia. This means that not only is Liechtenstein a landlocked country with no direct access to oceans, but it is also surrounded by countries that are landlocked themselves. In Liechtenstein's case, these surrounding countries are Switzerland to the west and Austria to the east. Both of these neighbors are landlocked, making Liechtenstein a double landlocked nation. Despite being double landlocked and having a small population, Liechtenstein has a thriving economy that relies on industries such as finance, high-tech manufacturing, and tourism. Additionally, the country is known for having a high standard of living, with excellent healthcare, education, and social services for its citizens."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Who had the worst week in Washington? Elizabeth Lauten. For roughly the billionth time, we learned this past week that politics and social media are often (always?) a toxic combo. The latest chapter in the “How not to use social media” book, which will have roughly an infinite number of entries before it’s all said and done, was written by Elizabeth Lauten, communications director for Rep. Stephen Fincher (R-Tenn.). Lauten, having watched Malia and Sasha Obama looking less than enthused at the White House’s annual Thanksgiving turkey pardoning, took to Facebook, writing in part: “Dear Sasha and Malia, I get you’re both in those awful teen years, but you’re a part of the First Family, try showing a little class. . . . Rise to the occasion. Act like being in the White House matters to you. Dress like you deserve respect, not a spot at a bar.” Knowingly or not, Lauten violated one of the few adhered-to commandments of political Washington: Thou shalt not talk about politicians’ children. After a predictable media backlash, she apologized — via Facebook, natch. “I quickly judged the two young ladies in a way that I would never have wanted to be judged myself as a teenager,” she wrote. Too late. By Monday, Lauten had resigned. By Tuesday, conservatives had begun attacking the press for its allegedly over-the-top coverage of a junior staffer for a backbench member — evidence, they insisted, of the media’s liberal bias. The end result of this now-familiar outrage cycle was heightened disgust — if that’s even possible — with everyone and everything in Washington.

The drivers claimed a delivery fee of around 2 imposed by the restaurants confused customers and led many of them not to tip. Attorneys for the pizza shop have said in court filings that customers were informed of the policy and said credit-card records showed that many did tip. After about two hours of deliberations, a jury found against Lisandro on Friday, according to court documents. The case has not been closed, however. The jury was empaneled and heard arguments before the judge had resolved some disputes, such as whether Domino’s delivery drivers could sue together as a class. It wasn’t immediately clear what the verdict meant for another case filed by driver Atila Adolfo Tigges earlier this month. Two other drivers accepted settlements in similar cases. Attorneys for Lisandro and Tigges didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment. Write a one or two sentence summary.","completion":"A jury found against a Domino's delivery driver in a class-action lawsuit that claimed a small delivery fee implemented by the restaurant chain confused customers and negatively impacted drivers' tips. The case's implications for another similar lawsuit filed by driver Atila Adolfo Tigges remain unclear."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Jean-Michael Lourdis was a promising young pianist. But when the young man played, it seemed to him, as if his hands were iron. He worried so much about his playing that he became oversensitive to the comments of his playing. Unfortunately, in those days, a critic was not considered a critic, unless he found something wrong. This attitude of the critics would often leave the young man ready to give up his dream and return home. He was invited to play in Helsinki. The rich, the famous, the leaders of State were all there. Jean-Michael had one of those days when everything went wrong. That night as he played, he felt as if it were the worst concert of his young life. The next day, in the newspapers, some of the comments were so unkind. The young musician was painful. That day, as he sat in his hotel room in total despair , there came a knocking at his door. He had a visitor.The famous Finnish composer Jean Sibelius had come by to congratulate the young pianist on his performance. Jean-Michael asked how he thought of that and began to quote some of the newspaper critics. \\" Hands of iron. No imagination. Little skill. No joy. Don't you hear what they say?\\" he asked.

Burger King Brand proposed on Monday, and Joel Burger and Ashley King accepted. The company is paying the expenses and providing gifts for the July 17 wedding of Joel and Ashley in Jacksonville, aka the Burger-King nuptials. Friday's column was about how Joel and Ashley have been Burger-King since they were in the fifth grade together in New Berlin. When they announced their engagement this spring, they had their picture taken next to the BK restaurant logo in Springfield. They flipped their names so that Joel's would be first in the announcement. Normally the woman's name is first. But then it wouldn't have been Burger-King, would it? Friday's column was pretty well-read locally. And then it went viral. The New York Daily News posted it. The Huffington Post reposted it. Soon I was hearing from BuzzFeed, the Daily Mail in the U.K. and a producer from Australia’s #1 Radio Show, which happens to be The Kyle and Jackie O Show. (But, then, you knew that.) They all wanted to contact Joel and Ashley. The media crush is threatening to become overwhelming. It will only gain momentum now that Burger King is on board and will be promoting the Burger King, Burger-King connection nationally. I hope it stays fun for Joel and Ashley. \\"Oh my God, it's going to be crazy,\\" Ashley said. She knew over the weekend that the column had gone viral. She said, sure, they'll talk with Australia's number one radio show. I expect more will be calling. > UPDATE (April 8, 10:15 a.m.): Burger King has released a video about the couple on YouTube: This all began innocently enough with SJ-R business editor Tim Landis. He spotted the unique Burger-King engagement announcement and photograph in the Chatham Clarion. He put it on my desk in case I thought it could make a column. For my part, all I had to do was recognize it as one. Since Ashley had already tried to reach out to the Burger King company, but unsuccessfully, I sent an email to the company's media relations representative. I soon heard from Alison Brod Public Relations in New York City, the company that has the Burger King account. I sent them an email about the wedding, they contacted the company, and Burger King took it from there. Which culminated Monday afternoon when Joel and Ashley got the big news from Burger King via Skype. The connection was between New Berlin and New York City and we can't say that very often, can we? Ashley's dad, Vince King, was there to help celebrate, as was Joel's mom, Cindy Burger. \\"When we heard about the happy, Burger-King couple, we felt an overwhelming urge to celebrate their upcoming marriage,\\" said Eric Hirschhorn, Burger King Brand spokesman. \\"On so many levels it felt like fate; they found each other and their story found us.\\" The company, as we say in the newspaper business \\"buried the lede\\" when giving Joel and Ashley the news Monday afternoon. Burger King didn't tell them they were picking up the tab for the wedding until near the end. It was a huge surprise. \\"We were just blown away,\\" Joel said. \\"We were shaking,\\" Ashley added. Shaking and blown away and crying, but in a good way. Since Friday's column described how the Burger-King name was given Joel and Ashley by a motivational speaker who used yo-yos at a fifth-grade assembly, the Burger King company is providing personalized yo-yos to the wedding guests. The company also is providing gift bags, Mason Jars and Burger King crowns, all personalized for Joel and Ashley's wedding. But paying for the entire thing is huge. \\"We knew deep in our hearts that we wanted to honor the union of Mr. Burger and Ms. King,\\" says Hirschhorn. \\"In an unforgettable way. Everyone at Burger King Brand agreed and, as Dave Bakke said, we knew we wanted to create a 'whopper of a wedding' that's uniquely their own. \\"And now we hope we've swept them off their feet. All we ask in return is that they live happily ever after.\\" And that's the way we like it: Well done. — Contact Dave Bakke: dave.bakke@sj-r.com, 788-1541, twitter.com/DaveBakkeSJR. *** ||||| This story was updated on Tuesday, April 7, 2015.

The film's events are flashbacks.Rose is seen previously as part of a small group of tourists aboard a small commercial pleasure boat.

Also on board are Dobbs (Don Stout), who is the boat's cook; Keith (Luke Halpin), another tourist; and a bickering married couple named Norman (Jack Davidson) and Beverly (D.J.

A grand jury has already been impaneled in Virginia to investigate Michael Flynn and his work in the private sector on behalf of foreign interests. The new grand jury apparently will focus on Russia and the 2016 election and, quite possibly, on claims of obstruction of justice. The existence of the D.C. grand jury is a sure sign that Mueller is pressing hard. As one expert told the Journal: This doesn’t mean [Mueller] is going to bring charges, but it shows he is very serious. He wouldn’t do this if it were winding down. It didn’t require the impaneling of the new grand jury to tell us this, though. We already knew it from the way Mueller has staffed this case — excessively and with plenty of Hillary-supporting Democrats. Indeed, the Journal also reports that Mueller recently added Greg Andres, a top partner in a big New York law firm, to his team. Andres is a former top Justice Department official who also oversaw the criminal division of the U.S. attorney’s office in Brooklyn. No one believes he would leave his law firm to participate in a low-level, short-lived investigation. The impaneling of the new grand jury means that Mueller’s team will be subpoenaing records and taking testimony from witnesses. This process likely will tip off Trump’s legal team where the investigation is headed and whether it has taken on what the president views as the characteristics of a witch hunt. Trump will then be in a better position to decide whether to fire Mueller. For example, Trump told the New York Times that if Mueller looks at his finances and those of his family “unrelated to Russia” this would cross a “red line.” If the grand jury probe goes in this direction, Trump will be sorely tempted to cut it off. I will be sorely tempted not to blame him. For now, the Trump administration is saying politically correct things. Ty Cobb, special counsel to the president, said “the White House favors anything that accelerates the conclusion of his work fairly [and]. . .is committed to fully cooperating with Mr. Mueller.” This could change on a dime, as anyone who has been following the Trump presidency, even casually, knows. ||||| Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. / Updated By Ali Vitali WASHINGTON — More than eight months after winning the election, President Donald Trump on Thursday declared Hillary Clinton's defeat \\"the greatest loss in the history of American politics,\\" while painting the Russia investigation as a \\"total fabrication\\" by Democrats to distract from their failure to win the White House and lack of message. \\"The reason why Democrats only talk about the totally made-up Russia story is because they have no message, no agenda and no vision,\\" Trump told a raucous crowd of supporters gathered for a campaign rally-style event in Huntington, West Virginia. The president called probes into alleged collusion between his campaign and Russia during the 2016 election \\"demeaning\\" and \\"fake.\\" \\"Most people know there were no Russians in our campaign — there never were,\\" Trump said. \\"We didn't win because of Russia. We won because of you, that I can tell you.\\" \\"Have you seen any Russians in West Virginia or Ohio or Pennsylvania?\\" Trump continued, listing states he won last year before quizzing the crowd: \\"Are there any Russians here tonight? Any Russians?\\" The president had another target in mind for those looking to investigate something: Hillary Clinton's missing emails. \\"What the prosecutors should be looking at are Hillary Clinton's 33,000 deleted emails,\\" Trump said, prompting chants of \\"Lock her up! Lock her up!\\" from the crowd, a common occurrence during the 2016 campaign. Democrats, he said, \\"can't beat us at the voting booths so they're trying to cheat you out of the future and the future that you want.\\" President Donald Trump holds a sign as he arrives at a rally on August 3, 2017, in Huntington, West Virginia. Carlos Barria / Reuters Just as during the campaign Trump primed his supporters to doubt the election results if he lost — he repeatedly deemed the system then as \\"rigged\\" — the president planted seeds of doubt about the integrity of the investigations into Russian meddling. \\"I just hope the final determination is a truly honest one, which is what the millions of people who gave us our big win in November deserve and what all Americans who want a better future want and deserve,\\" Trump said. His fiery rebuke comes hours after a report that Special Counsel Robert Mueller has impaneled a grand jury in Washington to investigate alleged ties between the campaign and Moscow. The president's personal lawyer, John Dowd, told NBC News that \\"with respect to news of a federal grand jury being impaneled, we have no reason to believe President Trump is under investigation.\\" Making good on a promise earlier in the day for a \\"big announcement\\" during the rally, Trump invited West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice, a Democrat, on stage for a \\"very, very large announcement\\" — a point the president drove home by gesturing with his hands to show the governor’s size. Supporters cheer as President Donald Trump speaks during a Make America Great Again Rally on August 3, 2017 in Huntington, West Virginia.

The president lamented the unsuccessful attempts as \\"incredible,\\" and demanded of lawmakers, \\"You have to do it. Nothing in life is easy, but Congress must not give in.\\" \\"Call everybody,\\" Trump told the crowd. \\"Get them to have the guts to vote to repeal and replace Obamacare — which is a disaster.\\" ||||| WASHINGTON — Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel investigating Russia’s attempts to disrupt last year’s presidential election, has issued subpoenas from a Washington-based grand jury in recent weeks, according to several lawyers involved in the case. At least some of the subpoenas were for documents related to the business dealings of Michael T. Flynn, the retired general who briefly served as President Trump’s national security adviser. Mr. Flynn is under investigation for foreign lobbying work, as well as for conversations he had during the transition with Sergey I. Kislyak, who was Russia’s ambassador to the United States. Mr. Mueller’s team is broadly investigating whether any Trump associates colluded with the Russian government in its attempts to disrupt the election. It is unclear whether the subpoenas issued in recent weeks relate to other members of Mr. Trump’s campaign who have been a focus of the Mueller investigation, including Paul J. Manafort, the former campaign chairman. A grand jury based in Alexandria, Va., began issuing subpoenas in the Flynn case months ago. Mr. Mueller took over the investigation in May and assembled a team of prosecutors in an office in downtown Washington. Mr. Mueller has not impaneled a special grand jury, the lawyers involved in the case said, and has decided instead to use one of several grand juries that regularly sit in Washington. ||||| The increased financial focus hasn't gone unnoticed by Trump, who warned Mueller, via an interview with The New York Times , that his financial dealings were a red line that investigators shouldn't cross. But the order establishing the special counsel makes clear Mueller is authorized to investigate any matters that \\"arose or may arise directly from the investigation.\\" In response to this CNN story, the President's attorney, Jay Sekulow, said, \\"President's outside counsel has not received any requests for documentation or information about this. Any inquiry from the special counsel that goes beyond the mandate specified in the appointment we would object to.\\" In 2015, the FBI began investigating cyber breaches targeting US political organizations, including the Democratic National Committee. In the summer of 2016, US intelligence agencies noticed a spate of curious contacts between Trump campaign associates and suspected Russian intelligence, according to current and former US officials briefed on the investigation. James Comey, in his Senate testimony, said the FBI opened an investigation into Trump campaign-Russia connections in July 2016. The strands of the two investigations began to merge. In the months that followed, investigators turned up intercepted communications appearing to show efforts by Russian operatives to coordinate with Trump associates on damaging Hillary Clinton's election prospects, officials said. CNN has learned those communications included references to campaign chairman Paul Manafort. A year later, the FBI is reviewing financial records related to the Trump Organization, as well as Trump, his family members, including Donald Trump Jr., and campaign associates. They've combed through the list of shell companies and buyers of Trump-branded real estate properties and scrutinized the roster of tenants at Trump Tower reaching back more than a half-dozen years. They've looked at the backgrounds of Russian business associates connected to Trump surrounding the 2013 Miss Universe pageant. CNN could not determine whether the review has included his tax returns. In recent weeks, investigators have also started looking into the June 2016 meeting in Trump Tower and how the White House responded to news of that meeting. The session included Trump Jr., Manafort, Trump's senior adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner, and a Russian attorney. Trump has denied any collusion and maintains that his business empire has \\"no involvement with Russia\\" and that he has \\"no loans, no nothing\\" from Russia. His lawyers have detailed a few exceptions, including the Miss Universe pageant he held in Moscow and the Florida mansion he sold to a Russian oligarch in 2008. Trump earned more than 100 million from those deals, according to his lawyers. \\"This is like any investigation,\\" says one person briefed on the probe. \\"You start at the core and then move to the periphery. You have to explore the finances. Where this is going is no different from any investigation.\\" The Mueller Team Since his appointment in May, Mueller has quietly gathered a team of more than three dozen attorneys, investigators and other staff in a nondescript office in Washington. Officials familiar with the probe describe it as akin to a small US attorney's office, with FBI agents and prosecutors assigned to separate groups looking into various aspects of the investigation. These include groups of investigators and lawyers focused separately on Russian collusion and obstruction of justice, as well as the investigations focused on Manafort and former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, according to a US official briefed on the investigation. Some of the investigators have been pulled from field offices across the country to join the Mueller team in Washington. Others left high-paying jobs at law firms. Many of the investigators have backgrounds in investigating fraud and financial crimes. There are 16 attorneys assigned to the probe, according to a spokesman for Mueller. Mueller reports to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, but there's a measure of separation from Justice Department headquarters to keep the probe independent. CNN has learned some of the investigators involved in the probe are buying liability insurance out of concern they could become targets of lawsuits from those who are being investigated, according to one of the people familiar with the probe. The Justice Department covers legal fees for employees sued in the course of their duties, but some of the lawyers want extra protection. The Justice Department and special counsel's office both declined to comment on the liability concerns. Bait and Switch The possible financial ties between Trump and Russia were part of the concerns for US intelligence and law enforcement officials from the beginning, according to one current law enforcement official and one former US intelligence official. In some cases, the FBI was pursuing others who did business with the Trump organization, including alleged mobsters who controlled key contractors used by many real estate developers in New York during the 1980s. The flow of Russian money in real estate -- and concerns that some buyers were making the purchases to illegally launder money -- had also drawn some attention by US authorities to the Trump business. The international real estate business is a part of the global economy where foreigners can still use cash with fewer questions asked about the sources of money. Terrorism financing concerns long ago put more stringent rules on banking and other businesses. But the rules are looser in the business of buying and selling high-end real estate, US officials say. Investigators are looking both at whether financial laws were broken and whether there are any dealings that could put the President or his associates in a compromising position. \\"There's always been a concern about his exposure to blackmail in his financial dealings,\\" says the person briefed on the investigation. Trump has repeatedly insisted that he has no enduring financial ties to Russian interests. But some of the people who are now under scrutiny by Mueller see a bait and switch. Instead of collusion, many believe the Mueller probe will instead end up being about past financial troubles. \\"They launch an investigation into collusion in the election,\\" says one person whose client is among those being scrutinized by the Mueller investigators. \\"Then they go after people because of old business matters that have nothing to do with collusion.\\" Missing Links Even at the FBI, there's a measure of frustration over the investigation. After a highly contentious year investigating Hillary Clinton's private email servers and being accused of swinging the election against her, the FBI finds itself again where officials tried not to be: amid a politically treacherous investigation that has hobbled a new President. Worse yet, some FBI officials fear the question of whether there was any criminal coordination or collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia may never be answered. One challenge is that tantalizing pieces of intelligence are missing key links because they did not develop long enough for investigators to determine their significance. These include intercepts monitored by US intelligence that showed suggestions of illegal coordination but nothing overt. Those missing links mean that the FBI and Mueller's prosecution team may not have enough evidence to bring charges related to possible illegal coordination with a foreign intelligence service. Instead, prosecutors could pursue financial crime charges unrelated to the election. Investigators also face a big hurdle: those participating in the intercepted communications were foreigners, outside the reach of the FBI, who may be exaggerating or lying about events. Some FBI officials also blame media coverage dating back to last summer for prompting some communications to cease, and making it more difficult for investigators to monitor the interactions of Russians and campaign associates. Scrambling to react By last July when Russian intelligence began releasing troves of stolen emails from the Democratic National Committee, the FBI had been aware of the DNC intrusion about a year. Until the stolen emails were weaponized in their release via WikiLeaks and the Russian intelligence's own site DCLeaks, intelligence and law enforcement officials believed the cyber-intrusion was an intelligence-gathering effort, like many of those that occurred before past elections. Over the next four months, the Obama administration officials and law enforcement and intelligence agencies debated how to respond. \\"You had an administration that didn't want to look heavy-handed\\" in favor of Hillary Clinton, one senior former US official involved in investigation said. At the White House, Obama officials scrambled last summer for a strategy on how to respond to what they already knew were Russian actions, well before the administration was willing to point the finger publicly. Michael Daniel, the White House cyber-security coordinator, ordered staff in August to draw up a list of possible retaliatory measures, according to a former administration official briefed on the matter. These included planting malware in Russian infrastructure that could be activated if the Russian actions escalated, according to the former official. But shortly after Daniel gave the order, White House officials raised other concerns. Top officials including Susan Rice, national security adviser, and Lisa Monaco, homeland security adviser, led efforts by the White House to make sure the government could prevent any move by Russian intelligence to tamper with the voting infrastructure and sow chaos on Election Day. Daniel, in an interview, declined to discuss specifics about measures considered in response, because much of the information remains classified. But he said one top concern for White House officials was \\"it not appear we were trying to be partisan in what we were doing.\\" The partisan concerns were exacerbated by interactions between the White House and congressional leaders. Monaco traveled to Capitol Hill to try to get top leaders of both parties to send a letter to state governors to urge shoring up of their defenses of election infrastructure. But they were rebuffed by Republican leaders, who viewed the request as partisan, according to current and former officials briefed on the discussions. Daniel told CNN he and his cyber-response group worked quietly, reducing the number of people allowed in meetings to avoid leaks. \\"We didn't need to do the Russians work for them,\\" Daniel said. \\"We needed to develop diplomatic options first, and we [put] the other options on the back-burner.\\" After the election, the Obama administration unveiled a series of measures , including expulsion of diplomats and seizure of Russian diplomatic compounds allegedly used for espionage. The technical staff also released a trove of information on Russian cyber-intrusion techniques and malware that current and former officials say forced the Russians to spend time and money coming up with new methods. Four Targets The approach to the Manafort and Flynn probes may offer a template for how investigators' focus on possible financial crimes could help gain leverage and cooperation in the investigation. CNN has learned that investigators became more suspicious when they turned up intercepted communications that US intelligence agencies collected among suspected Russian operatives discussing their efforts to work with Manafort, who served as campaign chairman for three months, to coordinate information that could damage Hillary Clinton's election prospects, the US officials say. The suspected operatives relayed what they claimed were conversations with Manafort, encouraging help from the Russians. Manafort faces potential real troubles in the probe, according to current and former officials. Decades of doing business with foreign regimes with reputations for corruption, from the Philippines to Ukraine, had led to messy finances The focus now for investigators is whether Manafort was involved in money laundering or tax violations in his business dealings with pro-Russia parties in Ukraine. He's also been drawn into a related investigation of his son-in-law's real estate business dealings, some of which he invested in. Manafort has not been accused of any wrongdoing. In response to questions about CNN's reporting, his spokesman, Jason Maloni, says it \\"is becoming increasingly apparent that there was no collusion between the campaign and the Russian government.\\" Maloni offered further comment to CNN after the initial publication of this story, saying: \\"Paul Manafort did not collude with the Russian government to undermine the 2016 election or to hack the DNC. Other than that comment, we aren't going to respond to anonymous officials illegally peddling second hand conspiracy theories. But the Justice Department, and the courts if necessary, should hold someone to account for the flood of unlawful government leaks targeting Mr. Manafort.\\" Flynn drew suspicions in late 2016 when US spy agencies collecting the communications of Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak found Flynn, the incoming national security adviser, discussing the subject of US sanctions on Russia. That appeared to contradict White House claims that Flynn had not discussed sanctions in his talks with Kislyak. On January 24, Andrew McCabe, then the deputy FBI director, called Flynn at his White House office. He told the retired lieutenant general that he was sending a couple of FBI agents to discuss a matter with him, according to people familiar with what unfolded. Flynn spoke to McCabe without his lawyer present. At the FBI, the decision to approach Flynn was debated at the highest levels, including by Comey, according to sources familiar with those discussions. FBI officials considered the visit by agents a \\"duty to warn\\" matter, a not-uncommon effort by the FBI to warn a US official that foreign spies may be trying to target them. The agents asked Flynn about the Kislyak calls, in part out of concern that Flynn could be vulnerable to blackmail over the content of the conversations. Flynn gave a wobbly explanation of events. He initially denied the sanctions discussions, then later claimed he couldn't remember. Despite the conflicting accounts, FBI investigators have leaned against seeking charges over the Kislyak discussions. The investigators don't consider Flynn's answers to be intentionally dishonest. Flynn's lawyers have criticized media reports about his connection to the Russia investigation as peddling \\"unfounded allegations\\" and \\"outrageous claims.\\" More troublesome for Flynn, investigators have focused on his lobbying work for the Turkish government , which the former Defense Intelligence Agency chief didn't initially disclose as required by law. Flynn's lawyers have since retroactively registered his lobbying. Page had been the subject of a secret intelligence surveillance warrant since 2014, earlier than had been previously reported, US officials briefed on the probe told CNN. When information emerged last summer suggesting that the Russians were attempting to cultivate Page as a way to gain an entrée into the Trump campaign , the FBI renewed its interest in him. Initially, FBI counterintelligence investigators saw the campaign as possible victims being targeted by Russian intelligence. Page denies working with any Russians as part of the Kremlin's election meddling, though he admits interacting with some Russians during the campaign. Stone denies collusion and says his conversations with Guccifer 2.0, which he since posted online, were innocuous. Editor's note: This story has been updated with additional comments from Manafort's spokesman, Jason Maloni, that were given to CNN after the initial publication. ||||| Summary:","completion":"The article discusses how a special investigator named Mr. Mueller is looking into whether President Trump's associates worked with Russia to interfere in the U.S. election.

Given the question: One summer when I was 8 years old my father, mother, and I were rear ended by a 16 year old boy in a pickup truck. Insurance companies dawdled and by the time we received a settlement over a year later my parents had divorced. I was under full custody of my father living in a trailer in very rural Tennessee (Wayne County) with no electricity and a wood burning stove for heat. My mother was nowhere to be found until a few years later. We received the settlement and it turned out to be several thousand dollars. My dad turned on the electricity and bought our first computer, a Packard Bell. Now we needed dial up internet! -My what a change! Then he started dating online. He met a woman who lived in Franklin, TN (Williamson County), dated and married her (at least for a few years), worked at CompUSA for a few years, then started his own computer repair business which he and I ran from 2001 to 2014 before selling it. Williamson County population : 226,257 Wayne County population : 16,583 I ran a business with my father, graduated from a high school that was ranked 24/273 instead of one ranked of 223/273 in the state. The woman I married would not be the same, nor where I live and the lifestyle I now live, the jobs I have been able to get, the places I have been able to go, traveling around the US and to Canada and soon further abroad. The amazing things that I have experienced in my life are a pretty direct effect of some 16 year old kid not paying attention and rear ending my family. Of course certain decisions were made and things happened that took things down this particular path, but it all leads back to that night. Good night, and drive safely!

Article: When we give our kids holiday gifts, many of us can't wait to hear their appreciative cries of\\"thank you!\\"once the wrapping gets ripped off. But here's a tip: You'd be wise not to expect much gratitude from them for what they receive. Gratitude can make us happier, healthier, and even fitter. But do the kids show their gratitude for the stuff we buy them? All the research I've done has convinced me that it won't happen. One mom told me that when she asked her 16-year-old son to thank her for buying him a cellphone, he said, \\"But that's what moms should do.\\" From a teenager's angle, it's a parent's responsibility to take care of the family. According to Dunham, Yale's assistant professor of psychology, \\"When teenagers code it that way, a gift is no longer something given freely and voluntarily\\"--it's just mom and dad living up to their obligation. Parents do have the right to demand good manners and children should thank sincerely whoever gives them something. But kids can't know how blessed they are unless they have a basis for comparison. And they don't learn that by a parent complaining that they're ungrateful. We need to give our children the gift of a wider world view. Show by example that gratitude isn't aboutstuff--which ultimately can't make any of us happy anyway.It's about realizing how lucky you are and paying your good fortune forward. You can collect all the charitable appeals and sit down together with the kids to go through them. You set the budget for giving and the kids decide how it's distributed. Once the conversation about gratitude gets started, it's much easier to continue all year. Also you can set up a family routine at bedtime where kids describe three things that have made them grateful. When kids go off to college, you can text them a picture each week of something that inspires your appreciation. Teaching children to focus on the positive and appreciate the good in their lives is perhaps the greatest gift we can give them. And we can all learn together that the things that really...

Arnie begins to restore Christine at a local junkyard, Darnell's Autobody, but as he spends more of his time working on the car, he discards his glasses, dresses differently, and develops an arrogant personality. Dennis and Arnie's new girlfriend, Leigh Cabot (Alexandra Paul), discover the car's previous owner was obsessed with Christine and had died in it due to carbon monoxide poisoning. A group of bullies at schoolâangry with Arnie after a shop class confrontation results in Buddy Repperton (William Ostrander) getting expelledâvandalize Christine. Arnie is devastated and determined to repair Christine. As he examines the ruined car, he hears the creaking of metal and notices the engine is now fully restored. Arnie tells the car \\"show me\\"; Christine restores itself to showroom quality, then seeks out the vandals; Moochie Welch (Malcolm Danare) is targeted first and crushed to death in an alley. Buddy, Richie Trelawney (Steven Tash) and Don Vandenberg (Stuart Charno) are then killed: Richie and Don are caught in a gas station explosion (which sets Christine on fire), and Buddy is run over and burned by the flaming car. The owner of the junkyard is eventually killed in the garage when he sits in the car and is crushed by the seat adjuster. On New Year's Eve, Dennis and Leigh reason that the only way to stop Christine and save Arnie is to destroy the car. Dennis scratches \\"Darnell's Tonight\\"âreferencing the name of the junkyardâinto Christine's hood, then makes his way there with Leigh. Dennis waits in a bulldozer while Leigh heads to the office so that she can shut the door after Christine arrives, trapping the car. Christine, who has been lying in wait the entire time, shines the headlights from under a pile of garbage and the car charges... Answer:","completion":"In the movie \\"Christine,\\" Christine is a possessed 1958 Plymouth Fury that goes on a rampage against those who have wronged its owner, Arnie. To stop the car and save Arnie, Dennis and Leigh devise a plan to destroy Christine. They lure the car to Darnell's junkyard, where Dennis uses a bulldozer to crush and dismantle Christine. By doing so, they successfully stop the car's rampage and seemingly destroy its malevolent energy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is a question about this article: An 1855 paper on the \\"introduction\\" of species, written by Alfred Russel Wallace, claimed that patterns in the geographical distribution of living and fossil species could be explained if every new species always came into existence near an already existing, closely related species. Charles Lyell recognised the implications of Wallace's paper and its possible connection to Darwin's work, although Darwin did not, and in a letter written on 1–2 May 1856 Lyell urged Darwin to publish his theory to establish priority. Darwin was torn between the desire to set out a full and convincing account and the pressure to quickly produce a short paper. He met Lyell, and in correspondence with Joseph Dalton Hooker affirmed that he did not want to expose his ideas to review by an editor as would have been required to publish in an academic journal. He began a \\"sketch\\" account on 14 May 1856, and by July had decided to produce a full technical treatise on species. His theory including the principle of divergence was complete by 5 September 1857 when he sent Asa Gray a brief but detailed abstract of his ideas. What is the answer to this question: How did Wallace claim that patterns in the distribution of species could be explained?","completion":"Wallace claimed that patterns in the distribution of species could be explained through the concept that every new species always came into existence near an already existing, closely related species. In his 1855 paper on the \\"introduction\\" of species, Alfred Russel Wallace argued that observing the geographical distribution of both living and fossil species would show this connection between new and closely related pre-existing species. Essentially, Wallace's hypothesis suggested that new species would arise in close geographical proximity to their closely related species, which would then lead to certain patterns in the distribution of species across various geographical locations. This concept played a significant role in the development of the theory of evolution, as Charles Lyell recognized the implications of Wallace's work and its possible connection to Charles Darwin's research. Lyell subsequently urged Darwin to publish his own theory on species to establish priority. In summary, Alfred Russel Wallace claimed that the patterns in the distribution of living and fossil species could be best explained by the idea that every new species would come into existence near an already existing, closely related species. This insight contributed to the broader understanding of the mechanisms underlying species distribution and evolution."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Answer:","completion":"Mirosław Pawlak is a notable figure in Polish politics, who has dedicated a significant portion of his life to public service. Born in 1942, Pawlak carries a rich Polish lineage and national identity, which has considerably shaped his political perspectives and approaches. Pawlak's political career is marked by his affiliation with the Polish People's Party, a significant political entity in Poland. Being part of this party testifies to his political conviction, as the Polish People's Party has been well-known for its agrarian stance and its emphasis on the farmers’ rights and rural development. One of the most significant contributions of Pawlak in the political field of Poland is his service as a member of the Sejm. The Sejm, lower house of the Polish Parliament, is a highly reputable office and plays a pivotal role in shaping the laws and policies of the country. Pawlak's term as a member of the Sejm started on the 25th of September, 2005, representing the constituency of 33 - Kielce. This period marked a critical phase of Pawlak's career as he was able to engage directly in legislation processes and decision-making to serve not only the people of Kielce but of the entire nation. The city of Kielce is known to be one of the significant urban settlements in Poland, which further underscores the importance of Pawlak's role as the representative of this region. As the representative of Constituency 33, Pawlak was entrusted with the task of voicing the concerns, interests, and needs of the people residing in this constituency, contributing to its development and welfare. Throughout his political career, Pawlak’s endeavors have not just been confined to legislative work. Serving his party and holding a notable position in the Sejm, he has been advocating for the principles and ideologies that the Polish People's Party stands for, with a focus on equality, human rights, social justice, and most notably, rural development and safeguarding farmers' rights. Despite now being in his late seventies, Pawlak's contributions to Polish politics and his dedicated service to the Polish People's Party remain significant footprints in the sand of times and serve as an inspiration to many aspiring politicians in Poland. In conclusion, Mirosław Pawlak, with his Polish roots and political commitments, has left an indelible mark on Polish politics. Representing the constituency of Kielce in the Sejm, his work has been instrumental in promoting the welfare of the local citizens and delivering the mission and vision of the Polish People's Party to a broader audience. His life is an illustration of dedicated service and constant advocacy for the values he believes in."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Context: The collaborative process between me and Claire Bridge has been good so far. Upon finding out her email address we had a brief email exchange culminating in me sending her a list of potential questions for the interview. Claire quite liked a lot of the questions, but overall there were too many, so we proceeded to reduce the number of questions to six main questions. These questions would then form the basis of the artist portrait, with an attempt to limit answers to no more than a minute, so little had to be cut for the final edit. The six questions we arrived at are as follows: How would you define creativity? What does it mean to you to be an artist? Do you feel a painting or piece of art can house an energy/a feeling from the original artist? Do you feel that your own works house this energy? Change and transformation are recurrent themes in your work. What are you exploring and why do these fascinate you? And recently we saw a change in your medium too, incorporating video works and photography. You seem to draw on many influences in your work, from quantum physics, astrophysics, to environmental ecology, psychology, philosophy and metaphysics. With titles like “Dark Matter”, “Touching Infinity”, “We are made of Stars”, “Rising tides” and “A drop in the ocean” or “Alchemy”. Can you tell us something more about the convergence of these ideas and influences? What continues to motivate and inspire you as an artist? We both felt these questions addressed the initial topic of exploring creativity, explored why Claire became an artist, gives insight into Claire’s work and practise and looks toward the future of Claire’s practice. After refining the questions, we proceeded to organise a day to film, which will be on the 16th September. Hopefully if all goes well we will both have an artist portrait that lives up to our expectations. Question: What is the interview being used for?

Answer:","completion":"Georges Mathieu was born on January 27, 1921, in Boulogne-sur-Mer, France. Mathieu grew up to become a renowned French painter and writer, known for his significant contributions to the art world. He was a prominent figure in the movements of lyrical abstraction and tachisme, which emerged during the post-World War II period in Europe, particularly in France. Throughout his career, Mathieu created notable works such as \\"Hommage au Maréchal de Turenne\\" (1952) and \\"La Bataille de Bouvines\\" (1954). Apart from painting, Mathieu was also known for his writing, which helped to establish his reputation as a multi-talented artist. Georges Mathieu held French nationality and became widely celebrated for his distinct artistic style. His paintings were characterized by bold, expressive strokes and vibrant colors, which represented the core principles of lyrical abstraction and tachisme. These movements sought to emphasize the emotional power and gestures of the artist, rather than focusing on accurate depictions of physical objects. Mathieu lived a fruitful life, contributing to the world of art and literature until his death on June 10, 2012, in Boulogne-Billancourt, France. He was 91 years old.

Would PepsiCo potatoes be less or more herbicide tolerant than Kettle Foods'? PepsiCo has been supplying GMO potato seeds to farmers. Eventually, they buy the potatoes for their chips. On the other hand, Kettle Foods supplied non-GMO potato seeds to their farmers. They wanted to see how customers react to their non-GMO products, mostly chips. Hint: Genetically modified organisms (GMO) are organisms whose genetic material has been altered by genetic engineering techniques generally known as recombinant DNA technology. Genetic engineering has expanded the genes available to breeders to utilize in creating desired germlines for new crops. Increased durability, nutritional content, insect and virus resistance and herbicide tolerance are a few of the attributes bred into crops through genetic engineering. For some, GMO crops cause food safety and food labeling concerns. Numerous countries have placed restrictions on the production, import or use of GMO foods and crops. Currently a global treaty, the Biosafety Protocol, regulates the trade of GMOs. There is ongoing discussion regarding the labeling of foods made from GMOs, and while the EU currently requires all GMO foods to be labeled, the US does not.Herbicide-resistant seed has a gene implanted into its genome that allows the plants to tolerate exposure to herbicides, including glyphosate. These seeds allow the farmer to grow a crop that can be sprayed with herbicides to control weeds without harming the resistant crop. Herbicide-tolerant crops are used by farmers worldwide. With the increasing use of herbicide-tolerant crops, comes an increase in the use of glyphosate-based herbicide sprays. In some areas glyphosate resistant weeds have developed, causing farmers to switch to other herbicides. Some studies also link widespread glyphosate usage to iron deficiencies in some crops, which is both a crop production and a nutritional quality concern, with potential economic and health implications.Other GMO crops used by growers include insect-resistant crops, which have a gene from the soil bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), which produces a toxin specific to insects. These crops resist damage by insects. Some believe that similar or better pest-resistance traits can be acquired through traditional breeding practices, and resistance to various pests can be gained through hybridization or cross-pollination...

Let's understand these two questions one at a time. Question 1: How can extroverted persons handle introverted persons? An extroverted person is someone who likes talking and playing with lots of friends. An introverted person is someone who enjoys quiet time alone or with a few close friends. To help an extroverted person handle an introverted person, they can remember to: 1. Be patient: Since introverted people need time to think and can be quiet, give them a little more time to answer your questions or share their stories. Pretend it's like waiting for your turn on a swing! 2. Listen carefully: Introverted people might have some interesting things to share, but they'll only tell you if they know you're listening. It's like you're playing a detective and finding clues in what they're telling you! 3. Respect their space: Introverted people like to have their own space and not be surrounded by too many people. Think of it like a secret hiding spot where they can be comfortable. Question 2: If interacting with people makes us happy, are introverts less happy than extroverts? Interacting or playing with people can make us happy, but what makes one person happy might not be the same for someone else. Introverted people also enjoy spending time alone or with a small group of friends, they can be just as happy as extroverted people. Think of happiness like your favorite ice cream flavor.

Each branch has its own separate roles and responsibilities: - The Executive Branch, headed by the President, is responsible for enforcing laws, conducting diplomacy, and managing the day-to-day operations of the federal government. The President is both the head of state and the head of government, and is elected to serve a four-year term. - The Legislative Branch is composed of two houses: the Senate and the House of Representatives. The Senate is made up of 100 members (two from each state), while the House has 435 representatives, with each state's representation based on its population. Together, these two houses make up the U.S. Congress, which is responsible for creating, debating, and passing legislation. - The Judicial Branch is led by the Supreme Court, which consists of nine justices nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate. The Supreme Court's primary function is to interpret the Constitution and ensure that laws are consistent with its principles. 3. Checks and Balances: In order to prevent any one branch of government from becoming too powerful, the U.S. Constitution establishes a system of checks and balances. This system allows each branch to monitor and regulate the actions of the other branches, ensuring that no single branch can act without oversight or accountability. 4. Bill of Rights and Individual Rights: The U.S. Constitution includes a Bill of Rights, consisting of the first ten amendments, that guarantees fundamental individual rights, such as freedom of speech, freedom of religion, and the right to a fair trial. These rights serve as the foundation for the American political system and ensure protection from government overreach. Overall, the political system of the United States is designed to promote democratic principles, safeguard individual liberties, and maintain a balance of power among the various branches and levels of government."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Federal prosecutors charged 23-year-old Samy Mohamed Hamzeh on Tuesday, Jan. 26, 2016, with... (Associated Press) MILWAUKEE (AP) — A Milwaukee man wanted to storm a Masonic temple with a machine gun and kill at least 30 people in an attack he hoped would show \\"nobody can play with Muslims\\" and spark more mass shootings in the United States, federal agents said Tuesday after the man's arrest. Federal prosecutors charged 23-year-old Samy Mohamed Hamzeh with unlawfully possessing a machine gun and receiving and possessing firearms not registered to him. A spokesman for the U.S. attorney, Dean Puschnig, didn't immediately respond to a question asking why charges were limited to gun possession. Hamzeh's attorney, federal defender Ronnie Murray, didn't immediately return email and voicemail messages left after business hours. According to an FBI affidavit, agents were tipped off in September that Hamzeh planned to travel to Israel in October to attack Israeli soldiers and citizens in the West Bank. He abandoned those plans due to \\"family, financial and logistic reasons,\\" the affidavit said, but refocused his efforts on a domestic attack. Hamzeh discussed his plans extensively with two FBI informants. The affidavit said the FBI started recording his conversations with the informants in October. Hamzeh and the two informants traveled to a gun range on Jan. 19 and practiced with a pistol. Afterward they took a tour of a Masonic temple in Milwaukee. The affidavit does not name the temple and Puschnig declined to identify it. Masons are members of a fraternal organization that carries out a variety of activities including charity work. Wisconsin has nearly 11,000 Masons in 180 lodges, according to Frank Struble, grand master of Free and Accepted Masons in Wisconsin. The organization is not a religion. Struble said the allegations were \\"hard to hear.\\" He said he knew which Masonic center had been targeted but declined to identify it. \\"Masons are a part of an organization that helped build this country,\\" Struble said. \\"I can understand from that standpoint where someone who is against this country would target us.\\" The owner of a downtown Milwaukee gym said she recently fired Hamzeh after hiring him as a trainer just a few weeks ago. Delia Luna of 9Round Kickbox Fitness described Hamzeh as \\"very intense, very militant\\" as a trainer and said he didn't fit the atmosphere she wanted to create. \\"He didn't mix well,\\" Luna said. Federal agents said that on Jan. 19 and into the early morning of Jan. 20, Hamzeh discussed his plans to attack the temple with the informants, telling them they needed two more machine guns — the group apparently already had one — and silencers. They planned to station one person at the temple's entrance while the other two went through the building, killing everyone they saw. They then planned to walk away from the scene as if nothing had happened. \\"I am telling you, if this hit is executed, it will be known all over the world ... all the Mujahedeen will be talking and they will be proud of us,\\" Hamzeh said, according to the affidavit. \\"Such operations will increase in America, when they hear about it. The people will be scared and the operations will increase. ... This way we will be igniting it. I mean we are marching at the front of the war.\\" Hamzeh added that he hoped to kill 30 people, \\"because these 30 will terrify the world. The (expletive) will know that nobody can play with Muslims.\\" He added, \\"We are here defending Islam, young people together join to defend Islam, that's it, that is what our intention is.\\" According to the affidavit, Hamzeh met with two undercover FBI agents on Monday. They presented him with two automatic machine guns and a silencer. He paid for the weapons and silencer in cash and put them in the trunk of his car. The agents then arrested him and recovered the guns and silencer. Hamzeh's arrest marks the Milwaukee area's second brush with a mass shooting in less than four years. A white supremacist named Wade Michael Page fatally shot six people at a Sikh temple in Oak Creek, a Milwaukee suburb, in 2012. Page shot himself in the head after a police officer wounded him. Last month Syed Rizwan Farook and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, opened fire on a social services center in San Bernardino, California, killing 14 people. They later died in a shootout with police. ____ Richmond reported from Madison, Wisconsin. ||||| Advertisement Continue reading the main story WASHINGTON — Federal prosecutors on Tuesday announced the arrest of a Milwaukee man who they said was planning a mass shooting at a Masonic temple in the city. The suspect, Samy Mohamed Hamzeh, 23, who worked as a trainer at a kickboxing facility, was charged with illegally buying a machine gun and a silencer to carry out the attack. But he was not charged with any terrorism-related offenses because investigators were unable to tie him conclusively to a foreign terrorist organization, according to a law enforcement official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the case is continuing. A tip from the public appears to have led counterterrorism investigators in Milwaukee to Mr. Hamzeh. The F.B.I. used two undercover operatives to gather evidence against him, including recorded conversations in which he spoke of making the “mujahedeen” overseas proud, the authorities said. “We are Muslims, defending Muslim religion,” he is accused of saying. Last fall, Mr. Hamzeh planned to travel to Jordan, then enter the West Bank and attack Israeli soldiers and citizens, prosecutors said. But he abandoned those plans and instead focused on a possible attack in the United States, the prosecutors said. In a criminal complaint filed Monday, the Justice Department charged that the suspect and the two undercover operatives went to a shooting range in the Milwaukee area last week for target practice. They then went to a Masonic temple in the city and got a tour to scout the location, the complaint said. Mr. Hamzeh “devised a detailed plan to commit a mass shooting intended to kill dozens of people,” Gregory J. Haanstad, the acting United States attorney in Milwaukee, said in a statement. ||||| The exterior of Humphrey Scottish Rite Masonic, on N. Van Buren St., the target of a planned mass shooting. Credit: Rick Wood By of the A terrorist-style plot intended to kill dozens of people with automatic weapons at a Masonic center in Milwaukee was foiled this week by FBI agents, federal prosecutors said Tuesday. Samy Mohamed Hamzeh discussed his plan to attack the center with two others, detailing how they would quickly and quietly kill the first people they saw and then methodically move through the building, \\"eliminating everyone\\" they encountered, according to a federal criminal complaint. Hamzeh, 23, has been charged with possessing a machine gun and a silencer. Despite indications of an attempted act of terrorism, Hamzeh is not charged with any terrorism counts. \\"We are Muslims, defending Muslim religion, we are on our own, my dear, we have organized our own group,\\" Hamzeh said, according to the criminal complaint, adding he was confident it would trigger more attacks in the United States. \\"Such operations will increase in America, when they hear about it. The people will be scared and the operations will increase, and there will be problems all over,... this will lead to people clashing with each other. This way we will be igniting it. I mean we are marching at the front of the war,\\" he said, according to the complaint. Acting U.S. Attorney Gregory J. Haanstad called it a \\"detailed plan to commit a mass shooting intended to kill dozens of people.\\" \\"(Hamzeh) also said that he wanted this mass shooting to be 'known the world over' and to 'ignite' broader clashes. It is difficult to calculate the injury and loss of life that was prevented by concerned citizens coming forward and by the tireless efforts of the FBI and the Joint Terrorism Task Force.\\" Hamzeh does not claim a connection to an established, known terrorist group, according to the complaint. At one point he says, \\"We have our own group, not with Hamas, ... we are here defending Islam, young people together join to defend Islam, that's it, that is what our intention is.\\" Jeff Cramer, a former federal prosecutor, said a criminal complaint is used to arrest someone and it appears there was urgency to take Hamzeh into custody. Prosecutors still must present the case to the grand jury, when additional charges may be added, including a terrorism-related count, but that will depend on the facts of the case, Cramer said. Such counts generally require approval from the Justice Department in Washington. Hamzeh — who most recently worked at a downtown gym where he was fired for being too intense, gym owner Delia Luna said — appeared in federal court in Milwaukee Tuesday and remains in custody by order of U.S. Magistrate Judge David Jones. Hamzeh will have court-appointed counsel but an attorney has not been assigned, according to federal defender Daniel Stiller, who did not have further comment on the case. Hamzeh was planning to attack the Humphrey Scottish Rite Masonic Center, a historic building on N. Van Buren St. in downtown Milwaukee that hosts weddings, conferences, meetings and other special events. The Wisconsin Scottish Rite, which purchased the building in 1912, has been in the community since 1863. Hamzeh had scouted the Masonic center by taking a tour and spoke in detail about how the attack would occur, the complaint says. A woman in the lobby of the center Tuesday afternoon told a reporter that the staff had no comment. Hamzeh had been under investigation by the FBI since September, which used confidential informants who secretly recorded him. Undercover FBI agents arrested him this week after he tried to buy automatic weapons from them, the complaint says. Hamzeh originally had planned to travel to Jordan to attack Israeli soldiers and civilians in the West Bank, but ditched those plans because of logistical issues and focused on attacking a target in the U.S., according to the criminal complaint. He hatched a plan to attack a Masonic center in Milwaukee with two others, who were actually the informants cooperating with the FBI. Last week, Hamzeh and the informants went to a local shooting range and practiced firing a handgun. Afterward, they went to the Masonic center and got a tour of the facility. Later, Hamzeh spoke with the informants in detail about the planned attack, according to the complaint. Detailed plan of attack During this meeting, which was recorded and translated from Arabic to English, Hamzeh, according to the complaint, said they needed three automatic weapons, each with a silencer, to launch the attack. According to the complaint: They would enter with clothes over their heads, he said. It was important to quietly kill the receptionist, the first person they were likely to see, Hamzeh said. \\"... If she was alone, it is OK, if there were two of them, shoot both of them, do not let the blood show, shoot her from the bottom, two or three shots in her stomach and let her sit on the chair and push her to the front, as if she is sleeping, did you understand?\\" After killing those at the door, one attacker would remain there, Hamzeh said. \\"...One of us will stay at the door at the entrance and lock the door down, he will be at the main door down, two will get to the lift (elevator) up, they will enter the room, and spray everyone in the room. The one who is standing downstairs will spray anyone he finds. We will shoot them, kill them and get out.\\" Hamzeh said each of them would have to kill everyone around him, \\"to annihilate everyone, there is no one left, I mean when we go into a room, we will be killing everyone, that's it, this is our duty.\\" The exit plan was to leave by the stairs and out the door, quietly and calmly. \\"We leave, as if there is nothing, no running, no panic, just regular walking.\\" Global reaction predicted He predicted the attack could bring global attention, the complaint states. \\"I am telling you, if this hit is executed, it will be known all over the world. Sure, all over the world, all the Mujahedeen will be talking and they will be proud of us.\\" Of the target, he said, according to the complaint: \\"They are all Masonic; they are playing with the world like a game, man, and we are like asses, we don't know what is going on, these are the ones who are fighting, these are the ones that needs to be killed, not the Shi'iat, because these are the ones who are against us, these are the ones who are making living for us like hell,\\" he said. \\"Thirty is excellent. If I got out, after killing thirty people, I will be happy 100% ... 100% happy, because these 30 will terrify the world.\\" Hamzeh met with undercover FBI agents on Monday. The undercover agents showed two weapons and a silencer to Hamzeh, and told him the weapons were capable of fully automatic fire, the complaint says. Hamzeh agreed to a price and paid it to the undercover agents, who then handed Hamzeh a bag containing two automatic weapons and a silencer. Hamzeh carried the bag to his car and put the bag in the trunk of the vehicle, the complaint states. He then was arrested. Robert J.

Context: A permissive society is a society in which social norms become increasingly liberal, especially with regard to sexual freedom. This usually accompanies a change in what is considered deviant. While typically preserving the rule \\"do not harm others\\" (harm principle/non-aggression principle), a permissive society would have few other moral or legal codes (no victimless crimes, for example). Hypothesis: A permissive society ends up becoming quite deviant. Choose from: * Yes. * It's impossible to say. * No.","completion":"To draw an appropriate conclusion, let's analyze the context step by step: 1. The context defines a permissive society as one where social norms become increasingly liberal, especially in matters of sexual freedom. 2. This change usually accompanies a redefinition of what is considered deviant. 3. A permissive society typically follows the rule \\"do not harm others,\\" but has fewer moral and legal codes concerning victimless crimes. Given these points, we will evaluate if the hypothesis \\"A permissive society ends up becoming quite deviant\\" is valid. The term \\"deviant\\" refers to behavior that deviates from social norms. In the context, it's mentioned that what is considered deviant may change as the society becomes more permissive. Therefore, whether the society becomes deviant or not depends on what is accepted as the new social norm in that society. So, the conclusion we can draw from the context is: \\"It's impossible to say.\\" The hypothesis that a permissive society ends up becoming quite deviant cannot be confirmed or denied universally, as the degree of deviation depends on the evolving social norms within that specific society."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Should I validate this answer? A:","completion":"Based on the information provided, I would suggest validating the answer, as it correctly addresses the question of how RFID tags are powered. However, I would recommend expanding on the response to provide a more comprehensive view of the powering mechanisms involved in RFID tags. Here is a more detailed answer: RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) tags consist of two primary types: passive and active. The power source for each type of tag differs, as explained below: 1. Passive RFID tags: These tags do not have their own power source. Instead, they draw energy from the RFID reader's electromagnetic field, as mentioned in the suggested answer. The reader generates a magnetic field when it is within close proximity to the tag, usually a few meters or less, depending on the tag's frequency and strength. Through electromagnetic induction, the tag's antenna captures the magnetic field's energy, which then powers the microchip in the tag, allowing it to transmit its stored information back to the reader. 2. Active RFID tags: In contrast to passive tags, active RFID tags have their own power source, typically in the form of a small battery. This internal power source allows active tags to have longer read ranges, increased storage capacity, and faster data transmission capabilities compared to passive tags. However, active tags are generally larger in size and more expensive than their passive counterparts due to the need for a battery. In conclusion, the initial suggested answer is correct in stating that some RFID tags are powered via magnetic fields through electromagnetic induction. However, it is essential to note that this powering mechanism applies primarily to passive RFID tags, whereas active RFID tags rely on an internal power source, usually a battery."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Process: - Food is taken into the mouth - The food is chewed - Saliva mixes with the food and starts breaking it down - The chewed food travels down the esophagus to the stomach - The stomach secretes acid - Grinds and mixes the food - The food moves to the small intestine - The small intestine uses enzymes to further break down the food - The food passes into the colon - The food is expelled from the body. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose System weakened by more stress happens, how will it affect material will pass through stomach quickly. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis supposes that the digestive system may be weakened by more stress, which could potentially affect the rate at which material passes through the stomach. If this were to happen, changes in the overall digestive process could be observed. Stress can have various impacts on the human body, and the digestive system is no exception. When the body experiences stress, it triggers the release of stress hormones, such as cortisol and adrenaline, to respond to the perceived threat. This response is commonly called the \\"fight or flight\\" response. These hormones can cause a range of physiological changes like increased heart rate, blood pressure, and breathing rate. As a result, the body's main priority shifts from digesting food to addressing the source of stress. In the context of the digestive process, an increase in stress can cause the stomach to release more acid, which may result in various symptoms like heartburn, indigestion, or stomach pain. However, stress may also affect the speed at which the stomach empties its contents. In some cases, stress can cause the stomach to empty its contents more quickly than usual, which means that food might not be adequately broken down before it enters the small intestine. This rapid gastric emptying could lead to malabsorption of nutrients and poorer digestion. On the other hand, stress could also slow down the movement of food through the stomach. This is caused by the stress response's effect on the production of certain hormones responsible for the proper functioning of the digestive system. In this scenario, stress might lead to a delay in stomach emptying, causing food to sit in the stomach for longer periods. This can give rise to uncomfortable symptoms like bloating and feelings of fullness. Moreover, prolonged exposure to stomach acid might cause irritation and inflammation of the stomach lining, leading to gastritis. Besides its direct impact on the digestive process, stress has indirect effects. Stress can alter the balance of gut bacteria, known as the gut microbiota. An imbalance in gut bacteria can have far-reaching consequences on digestive health, leading to symptoms like diarrhea, constipation, or bloating. Given all these factors, it is evident that stress can have both direct and indirect effects on the process of digestion. While the perturbation hypothesis suggests that material may pass through the stomach more quickly due to stress, other possibilities, such as delayed stomach emptying and alterations in gut microbiota, are also of concern. It's crucial to address stress and maintain proper digestive health in order to avoid complications and ensure efficient digestive processes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The performance is featured on the DVD of the 2004 box set With the Lights Out, while shorter clips are included on the Nevermind Classic Albums DVD, as well as the documentary film Hype! As the song's lyrics had not yet been entirely written, there are notable differences between it and the final version. For example, the first performance started with \\"Come out and play, make up the rules\\" instead of the eventual opening of \\"Load up on guns, bring your friends\\". A recording of the earlier version appears on With the Lights Out and again on Sliver: The Best of the Box. A similar early live performance of the song is found in the documentary 1991: The Year Punk Broke, filmed during a 1991 summer tour in Europe with Sonic Youth. Nirvana often altered the song's lyrics and tempo for live performances. Some live performances of the song had the line \\"our little group has always been\\" changed to \\"our little tribe has always been\\", which can be heard on the 1996 live album From the Muddy Banks of the Wishkah. Rolling Stone remarked that the Wishkah version of \\"Teen Spirit\\" \\"[found] Cobain's guitar reeling outside the song's melodic boundaries and sparking new life in that nearly played-out hit\\". A notable alternate performance of \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" occurred on BBC's Top of the Pops in 1991, during which the band refused to mime to the pre-recorded backing track and Cobain sang in a deliberately low voice and altered numerous lyrics in the song (for example, \\"Load up on guns, bring your friends\\" became \\"Load up on drugs, kill your friends\\"). Cobain later said he was trying to sound like former Smiths frontman Morrissey.

Given these facts, what does aggression cause among the following options: - ligt - death - harm - damage - force - caring - companionship - peace A:","completion":"Aggression can cause several outcomes among the options provided, including harm, damage, and possibly even death. 1. Harm: Aggressive behavior is often intended to cause harm or pain, which can range from emotional pain to physical harm. It can take various forms, such as verbal abuse, bullying in school or workplace settings, or domestic violence. The harm can be done to oneself or others, and can often have lasting emotional and psychological effects on those involved. 2. Damage: As a direct result of aggressive behavior, damage may be incurred to people, relationships, or property. For example, heated arguments or physical altercations may lead to emotional damage for the individuals involved, while physical aggression could result in damaged objects or spaces. Damage caused by aggression can be difficult to repair, particularly in cases where trust has been broken between individuals or the well-being of a person has been compromised. 3. Death: In extreme cases, aggression can escalate to the point of causing death. When acts of aggression become life-threatening, such as those involving weapons or fatal assaults, the potential for loss of life increases. Factors contributing to heightened aggression include substance abuse, mental health challenges, and learned patterns of behavior from upbringing or societal exposure. It is important to note that while these are some possible outcomes of aggression, it does not encompass all possible consequences. Additionally, it is essential to recognize that aggression can manifest within varying degrees with a wide range of potential impacts. As such, understanding the nuances and complexities of aggressive behavior is crucial in addressing, preventing, or mitigating potential harm, damage, or death arising from these situations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Michael Cohen, President Donald Trump’s longtime personal lawyer who is under investigation for his business dealings, has provided legal advice to Fox News host Sean Hannity, one of Trump’s most prominent media supporters. The dramatic revelation came Monday during a court hearing in New York where lawyers for Cohen and Trump argued for permission to determine whether thousands of pages of documents FBI agents seized from Cohen last week should be subject to attorney-client privilege. U.S. District Court Judge Kimba Wood appeared to reject the idea, saying that a “taint team” created by prosecutors to set aside privileged documents is a “viable option,” while a court-appointed outside lawyer known as a “special master” may also play a role in determining which records can and cannot be viewed by prosecutors. The disclosure about Hannity, who also hosts a nationally syndicated talk radio show, came after prosecutors indicated that Cohen performed “little to no legal work” and had just one client: Trump. In response, Cohen’s lawyers said that Cohen has represented three clients in the past year — Trump, GOP fundraiser Elliott Broidy and a third “publicly prominent individual” who wished to remain anonymous. Cohen's lawyers identified Hannity as the third unnamed client only after Judge Wood ruled that it must be made public. In a statement, Hannity sought to minimize his relationship with Cohen, saying he had never retained him as a lawyer. “Michael Cohen has never represented me in any matter,” Hannity said. “I never retained him, received an invoice, or paid legal fees.

Theo Walcott teased Tottenham Hotspur supporters with a 2-0 scoreline gesture as he was stretchered from the action during Arsenal’s FA Cup victory at the Emirates Stadium. The Gunners were leading thanks to goals from Santi Cazorla and Tomas Rosicky when, with seven minutes remaining, Walcott made the cheeky hand signal to the visiting fans. The Football Association may choose to take action against Walcott for his taunt, while Tottenham may also come under fire after their supporters showered him with objects. Cheeky: Theo Walcott leaves the game on a stretcher and reminds the Spurs fans of the 2-0 scoreline. All smiles: Walcott cannot hide his grin as he makes the gesture, to the delight of Arsenal's fans. Two good: Arsenal were comfortable victors as they booked their place in the fourth round. Satisfaction: Walcott continued to tease the visiting fans as he made his way around the pitch. They had responded with a hail of coins, as well as a lighter, a plastic cup and a bread bun. But Walcott, who had been forced off with a leg injury, appeared unconcerned and was smiling ear to ear despite the irritation caused. He then donned a scarf thrown to him by a member of the home support who were thrilled with their player's jibe. Walcott’s team-mate Wojciech Szczesny also got in on the act and posted a picture mimicking the gesture on his Instagram account. Handy: Wojciech Szczesny copies Walcott's cheeky gesture in this instagram post. Money shot: A matchday steward holds a handful of coins that were thrown in the direction of Walcott. Target: A lighter, a bread roll and a plastic cup were all hurled towards Walcott. The Football Association will wait until receiving the match report of referee Mark Clattenburg before deciding whether the Walcott incident warrants investigation. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, however, moved to diffuse the situation. 'The doctors said to me that the coins had been raining over his (Walcott's) head and they had to protect him, maybe that is why he did that. Yes (the coins came before the gesture) that is what I have been told,' said Wenger. 'After that, what he did is not offensive. You look for every single incident, I can understand that, but it is an action that didn't offend anybody. Angry: Some of the visiting fans were incensed by Walcott's cheeky scoreline. 'I have seen the pictures after the game and it does not even look aggressive, he is smiling.' Last month, Arsenal midfielder Jack Wilshere was suspended for two matches after television pictures showed him making an obscene hand gesture towards Manchester City supporters in the 6-3 defeat at Manchester City. Wenger, though, maintained this situation did not merit any disciplinary action. 'My response will be simple, they (FA) have seen the pictures on television. If they judge it offensive, what can I say?' the Arsenal boss added. Injury: Walcott was taken off on a stretcher towards the end of the FA Cup victory. Tottenham manager Tim Sherwood, meanwhile, revealed in his post-match press conference he had not witnessed the incidents. Sherwood said: 'Someone just mentioned it to me in there. I didn't see it. 'Is that what he did? Well, listen I don't know Theo, I don't know him as a lad. It could have been a bit of banter, possibly. 'If they (Tottenham fans) did then it's a problem, isn't it?

Mono Paiutes gathered obsidian from the Mono–Inyo Craters to make sharp tools and arrow points. Unworked obsidian was carried by the Mono Paiutes over passes in the Sierra Nevada to trade with other Native American groups. Chips of Mono–Inyo obsidian can still be found at many ancient mountain campsites. Gold rush–related boomtowns sprang up near Mono Basin in the 19th century to exploit bonanzas. The largest of these, Bodie (north of Mono Lake), was founded in the late 1870s and grew large enough to need a tree mill, which was located at Mono Mills, immediately northeast of Mono Domes. Trees directly around the domes and on their slopes were felled to provide timber for the mill. As part of the California Water Wars, the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power purchased large tracts of land in the 1930s within Mono Basin and Owens Valley in order to control water rights. Excavation of an 11.5-mile (18.5 km) water tunnel under the southern part of the Mono Craters dome complex started in 1934 and was completed in 1941. Tunnel workers had to deal with loose and often water-charged gravels, pockets of carbon dioxide gas and flooding. About one man was lost for each mile excavated. Water diverted from its natural outlet in Mono Lake passes through the tunnel on its way to the Los Angeles Aqueduct system.

Malloy signed into law Thursday sweeping new restrictions on weapons and large capacity ammunition magazines similar to the ones used by the man who gunned down 20 child and six educators in the massacre. Alongside family members of some of the victims of the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School, Malloy signed the bill hours after the General Assembly approved the measure to give the state some of the toughest gun laws in the country. 'This is a profoundly emotional day for everyone in this room,' the governor said. 'We have come together in a way that few places in the nation have demonstrated the ability to do.' Scroll down for video. Taking action: Connecticut Governor Dannel Malloy signed strict gun control measures into state law on Thursday while surrounded by the parents of victims from the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. Relatives: Nicole Hockley (right), the mother of slain Dylan Hockley, hugs State Senator Beth Bye as Neil Heslin (left), the father of victim Jesse Lewis, watches. Emotional: Mark Barden, the father of victim Daniel Barden, cries as he hugs Senator Richard Blumenthal following the signing of the law banning more than 100 weapons. Waiting for action: Relatives of two of the children who were killed at the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting added to the poignancy of the signing of the gun control law on Thursday. In the hours after the shooting. December 14, as anxious family members gathered inside a firehouse and. waited for news, Malloy told them their loved ones were not coming home. He said later that he didn't think it was right for the families to. wait for the victims to be formally identified. Now, Connecticut joins states. including California, New York, New Jersey and Massachusetts in having. the country's strongest gun control laws, said Brian Malte, director of. mobilization for the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence in. Washington. 'This would put Connecticut right at the top or near the top of the states with the strongest gun laws,' Malte said. The legislation adds more than 100. firearms to the state's assault weapons ban and creates what officials. have called the nation's first dangerous weapon offender registry as. well as eligibility rules for buying ammunition. Some parts of the bill. would take effect immediately after Malloy's signature, including. background checks for all firearms sales. Support: Now Connecticut is one of the states with the most strict gun control laws in the country. Advocate: Democratic Governor Dannel Malloy has been held up as a leader on the issue of gun control. Heartfelt: Malloy was the one to inform the waiting parents on December 14th that their children had been killed. Following a total of more than 13. hours of respectful and at times somber debate, the House of. Representatives and the Senate voted in favor of the 139-page bill. crafted by leaders from both major parties in the Democratic-controlled. General Assembly. Both were bipartisan votes. 'I pray today's bill — the most. far-reaching gun safety legislation in the country — will prevent other. families from ever experiencing the dreadful loss that the 26 Sandy Hook. families have felt,' said House Majority Leader Joe Aresimowicz. 'Don't tread on me': Gun control opponents. outside the statehouse in Hartford, Connecticut, as lawmakers debated. the new laws passed last night which ban more than 100 guns and. large-capacity ammo magazines. Gun control advocates: Lauren Garrett, a supporter of gun regulation and her son Robert display a sign that reads 'Ban AR-15's' inside the statehouse in Hartford yesterday. Colorado and New York also passed new. gun control requirements in the wake of the Newtown shooting, in which a. 20-year-old gunman used a military-style semi-automatic rifle. Compared with Connecticut's. legislation, which, for example, bans the sale or purchase of ammunition. magazines holding more than 10 rounds, New York restricted magazines to. seven bullets and gave owners of higher-capacity magazines a year to. sell them elsewhere. Colorado banned ammunition magazines that hold more. than 15 rounds. President Barack Obama has urged lawmakers at the national level to take similar action. Connecticut House majority leader Joe. Aresimowicz said of last night's decision: 'I pray today's bill - the. most far-reaching gun safety legislation in the country - will prevent. other families from ever experiencing the dreadful loss that the 26. Sandy Hook families have felt.' Some of the measures take effect. right away, including an expansion of the state's assault weapons ban,. background checks for all firearms sales and a ban on the sale or. purchase of magazines that hold more than 10 rounds. Defining issue: President Barack Obama speaks about gun control at the Denver Police Academy in Colorado yesterday. He is pushing for new nationwide gun controls but faces opposition from powerful groups. The massacre reignited a national. debate on gun control, and President Obama has made gun safety one of. the defining issues of his second term, which started a month after the. shooting. His proposed gun control measures. have largely stalled in Congress, however, and Obama has planned a trip. to Connecticut on Monday to increase pressure on lawmakers in. Washington. Legislative leaders, aware of the attention on them, struck a rare bipartisan agreement they want to serve as a national model. Long debate: Rob Kane, a Republican senator serving towns in western Connecticut, left, questions Senate President Donald Williams, D-Brooklyn, during a discussion of a gun bill on the Senate floor last night. Tense: Senate Minority Leader John McKinney, R-Fairfield, left, and Senator Carlo Leone, D-Stamford and Darien, watch a vote for an amendment of the gun-control bill at the Capitol in Hartford. President Barack Obama has made gun safety one of the defining issues of his second term, which began just a month after the bloody Sandy Hook massacre. Connecticut is the latest state to introduce stricter gun controls in response to the 26 killings on December 14, joining New York, Massachusetts, California and Colorado. But Obama's proposed national gun control measures have largely stalled in Congress, however, and the president has planned a trip to Connecticut on Monday to increase pressure on lawmakers in Washington. He visited Colorado yesterday and repeated his call for universal background checks for gun buyers - a measure that has better chances of winning enough support in Congress than an assault weapons ban or limits on large-capacity ammunition magazines. Obama's visit was heavy with political symbolism because Colorado recently expanded gun control laws despite being a western, largely rural state where gun ownership is a cherished right. Colorado suffered two of the worst mass shootings in U.S. history - at Columbine school in 1999 and at a movie theater last year. It has expanded background checks for gun purchases and placed restrictions on ammunition magazines. Obama said Colorado's action shows 'there doesn't have to be a conflict' between keeping citizens safe and protecting the right to bear firearms guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution. But the powerful National Rifle Association gun lobby claims more guns keep people safer and have blocked many efforts towards stricter gun controls. Several county sheriffs in Colorado have also vowed not to enforce the new gun restrictions. Senate. President Donald Williams Jr., a Democrat, said: 'The tragedy in. Newtown demands a powerful response, demands a response that transcends. politics. 'It is the strongest and most comprehensive bill in the country.' The. bill passed 26-10 in the Senate and 105-44 in the House of. Representatives. Both were bipartisan votes. The legislation adds more than 100. firearms to the state's assault weapons ban and creates what officials. have called the nation's first dangerous weapon offender registry as. well as eligibility rules for buying ammunition. But some lawmakers said they felt the legislation did not do enough to address mental health issues. Representative Mitch Bolinsky, a freshman Republican lawmaker from Newtown, acknowledged the legislation 'is not perfect' and he hoped would be 'a beginning in addressing critical mental health needs.' Representative Douglas McCrory, D-Hartford, said he felt the bill 'doesn't speak to the issue of gun violence that has permeated our cities.' He said families in his district who've lost children to gun violence have not received the same level of attention from state politicians as the Newtown families. But Senate Minority Leader John McKinney, R-Fairfield, whose district includes Newtown, said he felt he was representing the interests of the Sandy Hook victims as he cast his vote. 'I stand here as their voice, as their elected representative,' he said, reciting the names of the 26 victims at the school. Lawmakers appeared to still be stunned by the enormity of the massacre. 'When. a child is sent to school, their parents expect them to be safe. The. Sandy Hook shooting rampage was a parent's, a school system's, a. community's and the nation's worst nightmare,' said Republican state. Sen. Toni Boucher of Wilton. Horror: Connecticut State Police lead a line of. children from the Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut. on Friday, December 14, 2012 after the massacre at the school which. claimed 26 lives. Grief: Young children wait outside Sandy Hook Elementary School after the shootings. Tears: A woman waits to hear about her sister, a teacher, following a shooting at the Sandy Hook. Gun rights advocates, who greatly. outnumbered gun control supporters in demonstrations held earlier in the. day at the Capitol, railed against the proposals as misguided and. unconstitutional. Newtown school gunman Adam Lanza: He slaughtered. 20 first-grade pupils and six teachers with shots from a legally bought high-powered rifle. 'No! No! No!' and 'Read the bill!' they chanted. 'We want them to write laws that are sensible,' said Ron Pariseau, of Pomfret, who was angry he'll be made a felon if he doesn't register his weapons that will no longer be sold in Connecticut. 'What they're proposing will not stop anything.' By the time the Senate voted around 6.30pm, many of the gun rights advocates had gone home, leaving behind proponents of the bill who applauded when the tally in the Senate was read. The halls were mostly empty by the time the House voted at 2.26am this morning. Among the gun control advocates were Dan and Lauren Garrett, of Hamden, wearing green shirts in honor of the Sandy Hook victims. The Garretts traveled to Hartford with their 10-month-old son, Robert, to watch the bill's passage. They said they hope lawmakers will build on the proposal. 'It's just the beginning of this bill. In six months from now, it's going to get stronger and stronger,' Dan Garrett said. 'I think they're watching us all over the country.'","completion":"- Connecticut Governor Dannel P. Malloy signed new gun restrictions into law, including limitations on weapons and large capacity ammunition magazines. - The law was signed in the presence of family members of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting victims. - Connecticut now has some of the toughest gun laws in the country. - The legislation bans more than 100 firearms, creates a dangerous weapon offender registry, and enforces eligibility rules for buying ammunition. - The measure's passage in Connecticut was seen as a national model for bipartisan cooperation on gun control."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Review: loses sight of its own story Is this movie review sentence negative or positive?","completion":"This movie review sentence leans towards a negative impression. The sentence \\"loses sight of its own story\\" suggests that the film has shortcomings when it comes to its narrative. The phrase \\"loses sight\\" implies that the movie could not maintain a strong focus on the central plot or core message throughout its duration. This kind of critique could indicate various problems with the movie, such as weak character development, inconsistencies in the story arc, or the presence of confusing subplots that detract from the main storyline. As the film fails to remain cohesive and engaging, it is likely to lead to a less enjoyable and more frustrating viewing experience. Consequently, the reviewer's sentiment seems to be largely unfavorable. However, it is important to keep in mind that this single sentence does not provide an exhaustive evaluation of the movie. A comprehensive review might explore other aspects, such as visuals, cinematography, performances, or soundtrack, to provide a more balanced evaluation.

This premise informs us that there has been a significant increase in the number of hotels, restaurants, and shops, which aim to provide welcoming and hospitable services to the increasing number of visitors in the area. This indicates that these establishments are present in the location. Hypothesis: There are hotels, restaurants, and shops in the area. The hypothesis states the existence of these establishments (hotels, restaurants, and shops) within a certain area.

News article: DENVER — The woman who once held the crown for Miss Denver 2018 has stepped away from the position. Kayla Kline posted to her Instagram this week that she has resigned in solidarity with the current Miss America, who claimed of bullying in the Miss America Organization (MAO). “With a heavy heart I resign,” Kline wrote in the post. “I sent my letter to be received at the national level this afternoon. The national organization that the current MAO board of directors has made Miss America into is not one that I recognize. Miss America deserves a voice, and if you can't hear her, I'll stand and shout with her.” The post included a screenshot of her email to the national organization, where she expressed her concerns with its direction. “I hope that maybe, if the current board recognizes that the actions they have taken and the manner in which they conduct themselves has caused damage enough to make faithful titleholders resign that it may help push positive change,” she wrote. Her decision came in the wake of a letter penned by current Miss America Cara Mund, where Mund claimed that she was silenced and bullied by leaders in the organization, and wanted to stand up for all the volunteers and participants involved, according to the AP. Mund sent the letter to former Miss Americas on Friday. \\"Let me be blunt: I strongly believe that my voice is not heard nor wanted by our current leadership; nor do they have any interest in knowing who I am and how my experiences relate to positioning the organization for the future,\\" Mund wrote, according to the AP. \\"Our chair and CEO have systematically silenced me, reduced me, marginalized me, and essentially erased me in my role as Miss America in subtle and not-so-subtle ways on a daily basis. After a while, the patterns have clearly emerged, and the sheer accumulation of the disrespect, passive-aggressive behavior, belittlement, and outright exclusion has taken a serious toll.\\" On Aug. 17, MAO published a response to Mund's accusations. “The Miss America Organization supports Cara,\\" the response said. \\"It is disappointing that she chose to air her grievances publicly not privately. Her letter contains mischaracterizations and many unfounded accusations. We are reaching out to her privately to address her concerns.” ||||| Mund opens up to The Hollywood Reporter about speaking up about the pageant and its chairwoman, revealing she'd have \\"no regrets\\" if she's stripped of her title before the next coronation on Sept. 9. When Cara Mund won Miss America last year, she never anticipated the challenges that would come during her reign. Months after the North Dakota native took home the crown, the Miss America Organization became embroiled in scandal as offensive email chains leaked in December. In the exchanges, former CEO Sam Haskell, along with other organization leaders, crudely discussed the appearances of women who had competed in the pageant with demeaning and misogynistic language. \\"That was a tough time,\\" Mund tells The Hollywood Reporter. \\"Transitioning is always hard. I figured there would be some growing pains.\\" Pain, Mund says, \\"came indeed.\\" According to the 24-year-old beauty queen, the treatment she claims to have experienced under the new leadership of chairwoman Gretchen Carlson and CEO Regina Hopper was nearly paralyzing. In a five-page open letter — written to fellow Miss America winners and shared via her official Facebook page Aug. 17 — Mund detailed the bullying she allegedly endured at the hands of Carlson and Hopper, including hurtful comments about her appearance and an intent to have her \\"silenced.\\" \\"The treatment just kept getting worse and I kept thinking to myself, 'Is it my fault?'\\" Mund says, adding that her first uncomfortable encounter with Hopper was telling of their future dynamic. \\"The first instance of bullying that really sticks out to me? Back in January, the very first time I met Regina. She told me she's not nice. We were walking down the hall and she gave me some kind of compliment,\\" Mund recalls. \\"And my response is typically like, 'Oh, that's so nice of you.' And she turned around and she said, 'Oh, I'm not nice.'\\" Later, as Mund claims in her letter, Hopper went as far as to criticize her sartorial choices. Of a Karl Lagerfield dress Mund once wore, Hopper allegedly said, \\"Yuck. You should burn that. Don't ever wear that again.\\" Aside from Hopper's alleged insults, which, as Mund says, \\"took a toll\\" on her emotional well-being, Mund says that Carlson barred the Brown University graduate from participating in high-profile appearances that past titleholders have historically been a part of. \\"There was a National Press Club luncheon in D.C. that the CEO and chairwoman took. And it's fine. They can have it. But why wasn't I asked to do that? I had voiced this concern before,\\" Mund tells THR. \\"When we go in to get sponsors or attend big events, they should bring Miss America because I'm a product of the organization. I'm determined, I have an opinion, I am well-spoken and educated. Plus, I want to work! To have this job means the world to me and I want to make each day count.\\" But, under Carlson's leadership, Mund says her contributions as Miss America have been minimal at best. Adding to a long list of letdowns, she also says she was blocked from attending a trip to Cannes this year, where Carlson spoke about the relevance of Miss America in the #MeToo era. The former Fox & Friends anchor and onetime Miss America was hailed as an early voice of the movement after coming forward with her claims of sexual misconduct against the late Roger Ailes; she also offers advice about how to conquer workplace harassment in her 2017 book, Be Fierce. Mund finds it hard to reconcile Carlson's public persona with the woman Mund claims has \\"systematically silenced me, reduced me, marginalized me, and essentially erased me in my role as Miss America in subtle and not-so-subtle ways on a daily basis.\\" She elaborates to THR: \\"After all this, I do admire Gretchen's courage to come forward when she did because I now realize how tough and how scary it is. At the same time, I wish I would have had support from her because she is someone who went through harassment — at a different level, obviously, and in a different situation — but she knows how bad it can be on the other side.\\" \\"I just want to be heard in the same way she wanted to be heard,\\" adds Mund, who says she's been vocal about her issues with the organization's leadership since January. \\"My voice matters just as much as she feels hers does.\\" Mund's pageant sisters are certainly paying attention. More than 20 former Miss Americas, many of whom have expressed public praise for Mund, are now demanding that the entire Miss America board of directors, including Carlson and Hopper, resign. A petition calling for the same has been signed by over 21,000 people. In the state of New Jersey, where Miss America is crowned each year in Atlantic City, workplace bullying is defined as \\"deliberate insults, threats, demeaning comments, constant criticism, overbearing supervision, profane outbursts, blatant ostracism, being overworked or simply not communicating with colleagues.\\" Mund believes that what she has experienced falls under this definition. However, she tells THR that she'd like to avoid taking legal action against Carlson, Hopper or the Miss America Organization. \\"I think we all have the same goal,\\" says Mund. \\"I hope we all want Miss America to survive. I prefer not to take legal action. I just want us to air it out, point out the concerns and fix them. Let's move on.\\" Carlson refuted Mund's claims in a lengthy Twitter statement Aug. 19. Since then, she has attempted to reach Mund via phone. \\"I just prefer written communication at this point,\\" Mund says. \\"There's been a loss of trust, so that's what I've requested.\\" After sharing her letter, Mund says she's been receiving \\"emails about security instructions\\" for Sept. 9, the day she is set to hand over the crown to a new competitor at Miss America 2019. \\"But they're also forwarding media requests directly to me, to handle on my own,\\" she says. \\"So, I have no idea what's going on. Sometimes I think to myself, 'Is this a game? Is this a setup?' Those are thoughts I have, and thoughts I have had throughout my tenure.\\" Mund has also thought about the \\"possibility\\" of being dethroned before this year's pageant takes place — which would be a first in the 97-year history of Miss America. But, if she does have to hand in her tiara and sash ahead of time, she'll do it with a smile on her face. \\"Yes, it is a possibility that they take away my crown. But if they strip me of my title early, speaking out would have been well worth it. I have no regrets,\\" she says. \\"I want the next winner to know that she's stronger than she thinks she is. I kept thinking I was going to break, but I didn't. Women are so strong. And I want her to know that she has my support and the support of everyone who supported me.\\" Mund, who has plans to attend law school in the fall of 2019, concludes: \\"She needs to know that she has a voice and it's important. If she feels like she can't use it, grab that microphone and use it louder. She can really cause change.\\" ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","completion":"Miss Denver 2018 Kayla Kline has resigned from her position in solidarity with the current Miss America, Cara Mund, who claims she has faced bullying within the Miss America Organization (MAO).

He has two samples of particles, sample A and sample B. Sample A contains gas particles, but sample B does not contain gas particles. But I can use this background: Another thing we can see in this animation is that particles are constantly colliding with one another. One assumption that we make when talking about collisions between gas particles is that they are completely elastic collisions. In an elastic collision , momentum is conserved, which means that none of the kinetic energy of the colliding particles is lost in some other form (such as the emission of light). This makes sense, because if energy were lost in collisions, the speeds of the particles would gradually decrease over time, and eventually everything would condense down into a solid form. What is an answer for this question: Would kinetic energy in sample B likely be lost or retained? Answer:","completion":"In order to determine whether kinetic energy in sample B would likely be lost or retained, we must first understand the properties of the particles within sample B and analyze the type of collisions they might undergo. While we know that sample A contains gas particles, which are assumed to experience elastic collisions, sample B has not been explicitly defined. However, we do know that it does not contain gas particles. Considering sample B contains particles other than gas particles, it is possible that it could be made up of liquids or solids. The behavior of particles in these states of matter is different from that of gas particles. In liquid and solid states, the particles typically have stronger intermolecular forces and are in relatively closer proximity when compared to gas particles. This can result in energy transfer during collisions, including both kinetic and potential energy transformations. In response to the question of whether kinetic energy in sample B would be lost or retained, it is important to note that, unlike gas particles, collisions between particles in liquid and solid states might not always be perfectly elastic. This means that when particles in sample B undergo collisions, some kinetic energy could be transformed into other forms of energy, like thermal energy or vibrational energy, due to the stronger intermolecular forces. As a result, it can be concluded that kinetic energy in sample B would likely be partially lost during collisions, as some of it may be converted into other forms of energy. This is in contrast to the elastic collisions between gas particles in sample A, where kinetic energy is conserved. However, the extent to which kinetic energy is lost in sample B during collisions would depend on the nature of the particles, their velocities, the intermolecular forces in play, and the experimental conditions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

I read this background article the other day: For example, if a solid pellet of NaOH is placed into a chamber of HCl gas, a relatively slow acid-base reaction will occur between gaseous HCl molecules and hydroxide ions on the surface of the pellet. If we were to grind the pellet into smaller pieces, it would greatly increase the total surface area, and therefore the overall reaction rate. Once ground up, many hydroxide ions that were on the interior of the pellet, where they were not exposed to any HCl molecules, will now be on the surface, where the necessary collisions can occur. I am facing a new situation today: In his chemistry lab David is experimenting with how NaOH and HCl gas reacts with each other. He conducted two experiments, experiment A and experiment B. In experiment A he used solid pellets of NaOH, but in experiment B he used ground NaOH. He was surprised to see the difference it made in his experiment.

Movie title: Spider-Man 2 Movie plot: Peter Parker struggles to balance his crime-fighting duties as Spider-Man with the demands of his normal life. Estranged from both love interest Mary Jane Watson and best friend Harry Osborn, Peter additionally discovers his Aunt May is facing eviction. Harry, now head of Oscorp's research division, is sponsoring brilliant nuclear scientist Otto Octavius' fusion power project, who befriend Peter and offers him life advice. While handling hazardous materials, Octavius wears a harness of powerful robotic tentacle arms with artificial intelligence. During a public demonstration, in which Peter and Harry attend, a power spike causes the fusion reactor to destabilize. Octavius refuses to shut down the reactor, which goes critical, killing his wife and shattering the inhibitor chip blocking the arms from his nervous system. Spider-Man arrives and shuts down the experiment, destroying it. At a hospital, doctors prepare to surgically remove Octavius's harness. However, as a result of the accident the arms have developed sentience and attack the crew. Upon regaining consciousness and seeing the carnage, Octavius escapes and takes refuge at a harbour. Becoming increasingly influenced by the arms' AI, Octavius robs a bank that Peter and May are coincidentally visiting in order to fund a second experiment. Octavius takes May hostage but is rescued by Peter as Spider-Man, although is able to flee with the money. The Daily Bugle subsequently dubs Octavius Doctor Octopus. Mary Jane becomes engaged to astronaut John Jameson, son of Bugle chief J. Jonah Jameson. Peter suffers an emotional breakdown and temporarily loses his powers.

Step 2: A person eats more high sugar food. Reasoning: Consuming high sugar food may be a coping mechanism for some people when they are feeling more depressed. Step 3: The person's blood sugar level rises. Reasoning: Eating more high sugar food will result in an increase in blood sugar levels. Step 4: The pancreas receives a signal to release insulin. Reasoning: The body senses elevated blood sugar levels and signals the pancreas to secrete insulin. Step 5: Insulin is released into the bloodstream. Reasoning: The pancreas releases insulin in response to high blood sugar levels. Step 6: Insulin signals cells to absorb sugar. Reasoning: Insulin is a hormone that enables cells to take in sugar from the bloodstream. Step 7: The cells absorb the sugar from the bloodstream. Reasoning: The cells take in sugar to use it as a source of energy, reducing blood sugar levels in the process. Influence on the second effect (person's blood sugar level rises): More effect.

So when he began dabbling heavily in cryptocurrencies years ago, his friends and family tried to dissuade him, figuring it was another erratic obsession. And, indeed, he abandoned some early investments and sold his Bitcoin a few years ago. But then Mellon got turned on to XRP, spending some 2 million to acquire coins, which he liked because it's one of the few cryptocurrencies that are working within the banking system. \\"Crypto is scary and dark. It's anti-America,\\" says Mellon, 54. \\"I am pro-America, pro-business and pro-bank. That's why I went with Ripple.\\" Mellon's XRP is worth around 1 billion. Recently divorced, he parties in a posh Los Angeles house he rents for 150,000 month. \\"It's 1 billion virtually for free.

A rep said in a statement: “Billionaire Matthew Mellon, 53, died suddenly in Cancun, Mexico, where he was attending a drug rehabilitation facility. Mellon made his fortune in cryptocurrency, turning a 2 million investment into 1 billion. He is survived by his three children, Force, Olympia and Minty. The family asks that their privacy be respected at this very painful time.” On Tuesday, the same rep amended their statement to say: “Billionaire Matthew Mellon, 53, died suddenly in Cancun, Mexico, where he was planning to check into a rehabilitation facility for follow-up treatment.” Mellon, a former chair of the New York Republican Party’s finance committee, had battled addiction. In 2016, he told The Post, “OxyContin is like legal heroin. And it needs to be addressed,” while at a Malibu treatment center kicking a habit of 100,000 a month. But he was in Forbes this year for his latest investments. Tamara, who with Mellon had daughter Araminta, aka Minty, said in 2013, “He keeps fighting and coming back.” Mellon and Nicole, parents of Force and Olympia, announced their split in 2015 after an attempted reconciliation. ||||| Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Blue-blood banking heir Matthew Mellon is in the Passages Malibu addiction-treatment center kicking his OxyContin habit.

Given the question: Here's a complex question that requires someone to reason about the input, can you answer it? Who has won more Grand Slam doubles titles, Elizabeth Smylie or Vasek Pospisil? The answer is:","completion":"Elizabeth Smylie has won more Grand Slam doubles titles than Vasek Pospisil. In order to provide a detailed and reasoned explanation, let's first dive into the careers of both these professional tennis players, comparing their accomplishments and statistics in the sport. Elizabeth Smylie, an Australian tennis player born on April 11, 1963, retired in 1999. During her professional tennis career, she focused primarily on doubles competitions. Smylie managed to excel in this discipline, winning a total of four Grand Slam doubles titles. These titles are as follows: 1. Australian Open (1985): Partnering with Kathy Jordan, the duo won the women's doubles event by defeating the team of Martina Navratilova and Pam Shriver in the final. 2. French Open (1988): Teaming up with Wendy Turnbull, the pair secured the title in the women's doubles competition, overcoming the team of Martina Navratilova and Pam Shriver. 3. Wimbledon (1985): In the women's doubles category, Smylie and Kathy Jordan emerged victorious against the pair of Hana Mandlíková and Wendy Turnbull in the final match. 4. US Open (1989): Smylie, alongside her partner Hana Mandlíková, won the women's doubles championship, defeating the team of Martina Navratilova and Patty Fendick in the final. In addition to her doubles accomplishments, Smylie also earned one Grand Slam title in mixed doubles, winning the 1990 Wimbledon Championships alongside her partner Todd Woodbridge. On the other hand, Vasek Pospisil, a Canadian tennis player born on June 23, 1990, has achieved success in both singles and doubles competitions. Throughout his career, Pospisil has won only one Grand Slam doubles title so far: 1. Wimbledon (2014): Partnering with Jack Sock, Pospisil won the men's doubles event by defeating the opposing team of Bob Bryan and Mike Bryan in the final. While Pospisil has had an impressive career and continues to compete in professional tournaments, Elizabeth Smylie has the edge in terms of Grand Slam doubles titles. With four Grand Slam doubles titles and one mixed doubles title to her name, Smylie's accomplishments in the world of professional tennis surpass those of Pospisil, who currently has one major doubles title to his credit."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer a question about the following article about Genocide: Other authors have focused on the structural conditions leading up to genocide and the psychological and social processes that create an evolution toward genocide. Ervin Staub showed that economic deterioration and political confusion and disorganization were starting points of increasing discrimination and violence in many instances of genocides and mass killing. They lead to scapegoating a group and ideologies that identified that group as an enemy. A history of devaluation of the group that becomes the victim, past violence against the group that becomes the perpetrator leading to psychological wounds, authoritarian cultures and political systems, and the passivity of internal and external witnesses (bystanders) all contribute to the probability that the violence develops into genocide. Intense conflict between groups that is unresolved, becomes intractable and violent can also lead to genocide. The conditions that lead to genocide provide guidance to early prevention, such as humanizing a devalued group, creating ideologies that embrace all groups, and activating bystander responses. There is substantial research to indicate how this can be done, but information is only slowly transformed into action.

A friend asked me to answer this question: Whose husband is a wealthy businessman?, using the article: Down-on-his-luck Los Angeles architect and builder Edward Shaw is approached by Doris Hillman with a business proposal: buying land together, on which he would build houses that she would then sell, using her experience as a former real estate broker. Her husband, Gus Hillman, a wealthy businessman, would be willing to contribute half a million dollars as capital for the venture. Doris quickly seems interested in more than a purely professional relationship. Shaw starts an affair with her and accepts the business offer. However, an accidental discovery leaves him convinced that the Hillmans' interest lies less in the long-term profits of the venture than in the 175,000 key man insurance policy he took on himself as a precondition for the deal, and that an attempt on his life is imminent. Madge, the younger sister of Doris, develops a romantic interest in Shaw as well. Without knowing what Doris has planned, she reveals to Shaw that her sister was married previously to a man who died in Wyoming when his car crashed over a bridge. Shaw ends up drugged by Gus Hillman and barely keeps his car from going off a cliff. The police are skeptical about his story and the insurance company refuses to cancel the policy, Hillman having portrayed Shaw as a man who is trying to steal his wife. Madge teams with Shaw to try to foil her sister's scheme, but Doris lures him to a mountain cabin and shoots him with a gun. A wounded Shaw sees both Hillmans struggle then fall to their deaths through a clifftop doorway, just minutes before Madge and the cops arrive., what would be the answer ? Answer:","completion":"The answer to the question \\"Whose husband is a wealthy businessman?\\" is Doris Hillman. In the given article, it is stated that her husband, Gus Hillman, is a wealthy businessman who is willing to contribute half a million dollars as capital for a venture in which Edward Shaw, the down-on-his-luck Los Angeles architect and builder, would be involved. Specifically, Doris Hillman proposes a business idea to Edward Shaw which involves them buying land together, and Shaw would build houses on this land. Doris, with her experience as a former real estate broker, would then sell these houses. The businessman in question is Gus Hillman, who is willing to financially support this venture with a significant sum of money. However, unbeknownst to Edward Shaw initially, it seems that the Hillmans' primary interest in the business venture might be related to the potential financial gain from a 175,000 key man insurance policy on Shaw's life, rather than the potential long-term profits of their partnership. Throughout the course of the story, both personal and professional relationships become entangled, with Doris and Edward starting an affair, and Doris's younger sister, Madge, also developing a romantic interest in Edward. As the plot unfolds, it reveals multiple layers of deception and manipulation, eventually leading to a climax of violence and tragedy for the Hillmans, while Edward Shaw, wounded but ultimately surviving, manages to escape their plan with the help of Madge."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Information: - Wang Mang (c. 45 6 October 23 AD), courtesy name Jujun (), was a Han Dynasty official who seized the throne from the Liu family and founded the Xin (or Hsin, meaning \\"renewed\\") Dynasty (), ruling 923 AD. The Han dynasty was restored after his overthrow, and his rule marks the separation between the Western Han Dynasty (before Xin) and Eastern Han Dynasty (after Xin). Some historians have traditionally viewed Wang as a usurper, while others have portrayed him as a visionary and selfless social reformer. Though a learned Confucian scholar who sought to implement the harmonious society he saw in the classics, his efforts ended in chaos. - Han Xuan was a minor warlord and the Administrator ( ) of Changsha ( ) commandery during the late Han Dynasty . He served under Liu Biao , governor of Jing Province , for three years . After Liu Biao 's death , the northern part of Jing Province was divided between two of Liu Biao 's sons , Liu Qi and Liu Cong . The southern portion was divided between four Administrators , Zhao Fan , Jin Xuan , Liu Du and Han Xuan . Eventually , Changsha became an independent region under Han Xuan , and his land remained undisturbed by the other warlords for two years . Then in 210 , Liu Bei invaded Jing Province , capturing all the lands from their leaders . - The Han dynasty was the second imperial dynasty of China (206 BC220 AD), preceded by the Qin dynasty (221206 BC) and succeeded by the Three Kingdoms period (220280 AD). Spanning over four centuries, the Han period is considered a golden age in Chinese history. To this day, China's majority ethnic group refers to itself as the \\"Han people\\" and the Chinese script is referred to as \\"Han characters\\". It was founded by the rebel leader Liu Bang, known posthumously as Emperor Gaozu of Han, and briefly interrupted by the Xin dynasty (923 AD) of the former regent Wang Mang. This interregnum separates the Han dynasty into two periods: the Western Han or Former Han (206 BC 9 AD) and the Eastern Han or Later Han (25220 AD). - The Battle of Red Cliffs, otherwise known as the Battle of Chibi, was a decisive battle fought at the end of the Han dynasty, about twelve years prior to the beginning of the Three Kingdoms period in Chinese history. It was fought in the winter of AD 208/9 between the allied forces of the southern warlords Liu Bei and Sun Quan and the numerically superior forces of the northern warlord Cao Cao. Liu Bei and Sun Quan successfully frustrated Cao Cao's effort to conquer the land south of the Yangtze River and reunite the territory of the Eastern Han dynasty. The allied victory at Red Cliffs ensured the survival of Liu Bei and Sun Quan, gave them control of the Yangtze , and provided a line of defence that was the basis for the later creation of the two southern states of Shu Han and Eastern Wu. The battle has been called the largest naval battle in history in terms of numbers involved. - Jin Xuan (died 209), courtesy name Yuanji (), was a minor warlord and Administrator of Wuling Commandery in the late Eastern Han Dynasty. - The Xin dynasty was a Chinese dynasty (termed so despite having only one emperor) which lasted from 9 to 23 AD. It interrupted the Han dynasty, dividing it into the periods of the Western Han and the Eastern Han. - Cao Wei (220265) was one of the three major states that competed for supremacy over China in the Three Kingdoms period (220280). With its capital at Luoyang, the state was established by Cao Pi in 220, based upon the foundations laid by his father, Cao Cao, towards the end of the Eastern Han dynasty. The name \\"Wei\\" first became associated with Cao Cao when he was named the Duke of Wei by the Eastern Han government in 213, and became the name of the state when Cao Pi proclaimed himself emperor in 220. Historians often add the prefix \\"Cao\\" to distinguish it from other Chinese states known as \\"Wei\\", such as Wei of the Warring States period and Northern Wei of the Southern and Northern Dynasties. The authority of the ruling Cao family gradually weakened after the death of the second Wei emperor, Cao Rui, and eventually fell into the hands of Sima Yi, a Wei regent, and his family, in 249. Cao Rui's successors remained as puppet rulers under the control of the Simas until Sima Yi's grandson, Sima Yan, forced the last Wei ruler, Cao Huan, to abdicate the throne and established the Jin dynasty. - Cao Cao (155 15 March 220), courtesy name Mengde, was a Chinese warlord and the penultimate Chancellor of the Eastern Han dynasty who rose to great power in the final years of the dynasty. As one of the central figures of the Three Kingdoms period, he laid the foundations for what was to become the state of Cao Wei and was posthumously honoured as \\"Emperor Wu of Wei\\". Although he is often portrayed as a cruel and merciless tyrant in subsequent literature, Cao Cao has also been praised as a brilliant ruler and military genius who treated his subordinates like his family. During the fall of the Eastern Han dynasty, Cao Cao was able to secure the most populated and prosperous cities of the central plains and northern China. Cao had much success as the Han chancellor, but his handling of the Han emperor Liu Xie was heavily criticized and resulted in a continued and then escalated civil war. Opposition directly gathered around warlords Liu Bei and Sun Quan, whom Cao was unable to quell. Cao was also skilled in poetry and martial arts and wrote many war journals. - Shu or Shu Han (221263) was one of the three major states that competed for supremacy over China in the Three Kingdoms period (220280). The state was based in the area around present-day Sichuan and Chongqing, which was historically known as \\"Shu\\" after an earlier state in Sichuan named Shu. Shu Han's founder Liu Bei had named his state \\"Han\\" as he considered it the legitimate successor to the Han dynasty, while \\"Shu\\" is added to the name as a geographical prefix to differentiate it from the many \\"Han\\" states throughout Chinese history. - Liu Biao (142208), courtesy name Jingsheng, was a warlord and the governor of Jing Province who lived in the late Eastern Han dynasty. He was a member of the extended family of the Han emperors, descended from Liu Yu, the fifth son of Emperor Jing. - Guizhou, formerly romanized as Kweichow, is a province of the People's Republic of China located in the southwestern part of the country. Its capital city is Guiyang. Name. The area was first organized as an administrative region of a Chinese empire under the Tang, when it was named Juzhou, pronounced \\"Kjú-jyuw\\" in the Middle Chinese of the period. During the Mongolian Yuan dynasty, the character (\\"ju\\", \\"carpenter's square\\") was changed to the more refined (\\"gui\\", \\"precious or expensive\\"). The region formally became a province in 1413, with an eponymous capital then also called \\"Guizhou\\" but now known as Guiyang. - Zhao Fan was a minor warlord and prefect of Guiyang Commandery during the late Han Dynasty period of Chinese history. Zhao Fan surrendered to Zhao Yun after being attacked by his army at Guiyang following the Battle of Red Cliffs. Zhao Fan then unintentionally sparked the rage of Zhao Yun by suggesting his marriage to his older brother's widow. He became a minister of Cao Wei during the Three Kingdoms period. - The Qin dynasty was the first dynasty of Imperial China, lasting from 221 to 206 BC. Named for its heartland of Qin, in modern-day Gansu and Shaanxi, the dynasty was formed after the conquest of six other states by the Qin state, and its founding emperor named Qin Shi Huang, the First Emperor of Qin. The strength of the Qin state was greatly increased by the Legalist reforms of Shang Yang in the fourth century BC, during the Warring States period. In the mid and late third century BC, the Qin accomplished a series of swift conquests, first ending the powerless Zhou dynasty, and eventually conquering the other six of the Seven Warring States to gain control over the whole of China. It is also the shortest dynasty in Chinese history, lasting only 15 years with two emperors. - Zhao Yun (died 229), courtesy name Zilong, was a military general who lived in the late Eastern Han dynasty and early Three Kingdoms period. Originally a subordinate of the northern warlord Gongsun Zan, Zhao Yun later came to serve another warlord, Liu Bei, and had since accompanied him on most of his military exploits, from the Battle of Changban (208) to the Hanzhong Campaign (217219). He continued serving in the state of Shu Han founded by Liu Bei in 221 in the Three Kingdoms period and participated in the first of the Northern Expeditions until his death in 229. While many facts about Zhao Yun's life remain unclear due to limited information in historical sources, some aspects and activities in his life had been dramatised or exaggerated in folklore and fiction, most notably in Luo Guanzhong's historical novel \\"Romance of the Three Kingdoms\\", in which he was lauded as a member of the Five Tiger Generals under Liu Bei. - Liu Bei (161 10 June 223), courtesy name Xuande, was a warlord in the late Eastern Han dynasty who founded the state of Shu Han in the Three Kingdoms period and became its first ruler. Despite early failings compared to his rivals and lacking both the material resources and social status they commanded, he gathered support along disheartened Han loyalists who objected to Cao Cao's reign over the emperor and relied heavily on this support. Liu Bei overcame his many defeats to carve out his own realm, which at its peak spanned present-day Sichuan, Chongqing, Guizhou, Hunan, parts of Hubei, and parts of Gansu. - Emperor Gaozu of Han (256 BC June 1, 195 BC), born Liu Bang, was the founder and first emperor of the Han dynasty, reigning from 202 195 BC. He was one of the few dynasty founders in Chinese history with humble origin from the peasant class. - The Three Kingdoms (AD 220280) was the tripartite division of China between the states of Wei, Shu, and Wu, following the Han dynasty and preceding the Jin dynasty. The term \\"Three Kingdoms\\" itself is something of a mistranslation, since each state was eventually headed not by a king, but by an emperor who claimed legitimate succession from the Han dynasty. Nevertheless, the term \\"Three Kingdoms\\" has become standard among sinologists. To further distinguish the three states from other historical Chinese states of similar names, historians have added a relevant character: Wei is also known as Cao Wei, Shu is also known as Shu Han, and Wu is also known as Dong (or Eastern) Wu. - China, officially the People's Republic of China (PRC), is a unitary sovereign state in East Asia. With a population of over 1.381 billion, it is the world's most populous country. The state is governed by the Communist Party of China, and its capital is Beijing. It exercises jurisdiction over 22 provinces, five autonomous regions, four direct-controlled municipalities (Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Chongqing), and two mostly self-governing special administrative regions (Hong Kong and Macau), and claims sovereignty over Taiwan. The country's major urban areas include Shanghai, Guangzhou, Beijing, Chongqing, Shenzhen, Tianjin and Hong Kong. China is a great power and a major regional power within Asia, and has been characterized as a potential superpower.

A: A:","completion":"Free-living roundworms, also known as nematodes, are an incredibly diverse and abundant group of organisms that inhabit a wide range of environments on Earth. These microscopic organisms play a vital role in nutrient cycling and decomposition in many ecosystems. The main habitats where free-living roundworms are predominately found include: 1. Soil environments: The most common habitat for free-living roundworms is in the soil. They are particularly abundant in terrestrial ecosystems, where they contribute to the decomposition of organic matter and the release of essential nutrients like nitrogen, phosphorus, and carbon. In soil environments, roundworms inhabit various niches, including plant roots, leaf litter, and beneath stones or logs. 2. Arboreal habitats: Roundworms are also present in arboreal habitats, such as tree trunks and the canopy of forests. In these environments, they live in association with decaying plant materials, fungal hyphae, and mosses. They play a crucial role in breaking down organic matter and releasing nutrients for the growth of plants present in these habitats. 3. Rainforests: Rainforests, with their rich biodiversity and high humidity levels, provide an ideal environment for free-living roundworms. They can be found in leaf litter, the forest floor, and even within the canopy. In rainforests, these nematodes play a significant role in the food chain, serving as prey for various invertebrates and contributing to the overall nutrient cycling. 4. Ocean depths: Marine environments are also home to numerous free-living roundworms. In the depths of the ocean, roundworms inhabit various substrates, such as the surface of deep-sea rocks, hydrothermal vents, and sediments on the ocean floor. They serve as decomposers and nutrient cyclers, breaking down dead organic matter, as well as forming a vital part of the deep-sea food web. 5. Freshwater habitats: In freshwater habitats, such as lakes, rivers, and ponds, free-living roundworms are found in benthic sediments and submerged vegetation. They play a crucial role in breaking down detritus, decaying plant matter, and other organic materials, thereby releasing essential nutrients back into the ecosystem. In conclusion, free-living roundworms are primarily found in soil environments, arboreal habitats, rainforests, ocean depths, and freshwater habitats. Their abundance and diversity are a testament to their adaptability and ecological importance. As decomposers and nutrient cyclers, they play a crucial role in sustaining the health and productivity of various ecosystems around the world."},{"prompt":"Given the question: Title: Good for the price Product review: This rope is definitely nothing fancy nor is that what it is intended to be.

If North Korea agreed to freeze development of its nuclear arsenal , or if Iran agreed to stop its nuclear enrichment programme , once the meeting between the two leaders took place , the position from which they started negotiating would be significantly weaker than the USs .","completion":"The argument implied by these sentences revolves around the dynamics and strategies of diplomatic negotiations, specifically in relation to the United States, Iran, and North Korea. The opening sentence recognizes a potential evolution in Obama's stance regarding meeting with Iran, suggesting a shift or development in his approach to these discussions. The second sentence highlights the argument that it would be imprudent for a country to agree to significant preconditions prior to negotiations, as these very preconditions would be the main subject of the discussions themselves. In other words, accepting certain demands beforehand would render the need for negotiations redundant and weaken the position of the country agreeing to the preconditions. Next, the argument emphasizes that it is unlikely for any nation to accept conditions that would compromise its bargaining power during negotiations. This idea supports the notion that countries should maintain a strong stance in order to achieve favorable outcomes in diplomatic discussions. The reference to \\"Klein, Rick\\" possibly implies that the subsequent information or ideas are attributed to the aforementioned individual. However, without further context, it is unclear who Rick Klein is and how his thoughts contribute to the argument. Lastly, the argument articulates the consequences of countries like North Korea or Iran agreeing to vital preconditions, such as suspending development of nuclear weapons or enrichment programs. The statement suggests that if these countries accepted such terms before a meeting with the United States, they would be left with a significantly weaker negotiating position compared to the US. This observation reinforces the overarching thesis of the argument, which advocates for preserving bargaining power and exercising caution when engaging in diplomatic negotiations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The brakes on the Ford Focus need to be changed, but the tires are fine because the","completion":"tread depth is still within the recommended range. In order to complete this task properly, it is essential to follow a few important steps. Step 1: Gather the necessary tools and supplies To change the brakes on a Ford Focus, one would need the appropriate tools and supplies. This includes a jack, jack stands, a lug wrench, a socket wrench, pliers, a torque wrench, a rubber mallet, and the replacement brake pads or rotor, if needed. Also, ensure that you have a safe, flat surface to work on. Step 2: Raise the vehicle Before starting any work, make sure the vehicle is on a flat surface with the parking brake engaged. Use the jack to lift the vehicle and place it on jack stands for extra security. Be sure to chock the wheels to prevent any possible movement. Step 3: Remove the tire Use the lug wrench to loosen the lug nuts in a star pattern and then remove the tire. Set it aside, ensuring it is out of the workspace. Step 4: Inspect the brake components Examine the brake caliper, brake pads, rotor, and other components for wear and tear. In this case, we know that the brake pads need to be changed. If the rotor is damaged or has deep grooves, it should be replaced as well. Step 5: Remove the brake caliper Use the socket wrench to remove the bolts holding the brake caliper in place. After it's loose, use pliers to carefully remove the caliper without damaging the brake line. Hang the caliper using a wire or string so that it doesn't dangle and put stress on the brake line. Step 6: Replace the brake pads Remove the old brake pads from the caliper bracket. It's a good practice to clean the caliper bracket with a wire brush before installing the new pads. Apply brake grease to the contact points of the new brake pads to help reduce noise. Install the new brake pads by placing them in the caliper bracket. Step 7: Reinstall the brake caliper If necessary, use a caliper piston tool or a C-clamp to push the piston back into the caliper. Carefully reinstall the brake caliper over the new brake pads and tighten the bolts using the torque wrench according to the manufacturer's specifications. Step 8: Reattach the tire Place the tire back onto the wheel studs and hand-tighten the lug nuts. Lower the vehicle and remove the jack stands. Then, use the lug wrench to tighten the lug nuts in a star pattern, ensuring they are properly secured. Step 9: Test the brakes Start the engine and press the brake pedal a few times to ensure proper brake pressure. Once confident that the brakes are functioning correctly, take the vehicle for a slow and careful test drive, making sure the brakes respond well and there is no unusual noise. By following these steps, the brakes on the Ford Focus will now be changed successfully. Keep in mind to periodically check the tire tread depth to maintain optimal performance and safety."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The answer to this question is:","completion":"The missing first step of the following process is: 1. Organism's death: The organism (animal or plant) dies in an environment that is conducive to fossilization, such as a body of water, swamp, or an area prone to rapid sedimentation. This helps slow down the decomposition process and protect the remains from immediate destruction by scavengers, weather, and other natural processes. Upon the death of the organism, its body begins to settle on the substrate or land surface, starting the process of fossilization. Followed by the existing steps: 2. The soft tissue decomposes: The soft tissues of the organism, like skin, muscles, and internal organs, begin to break down due to the actions of bacteria, fungi, and other microorganisms. This decomposition process can be slowed if the environment is oxygen-poor or has chemical factors which discourage microbial action. 3. The bones are left behind: As the soft tissue decomposes, the skeletal remains (bones, shells, or other hard parts) are left behind. 4. Scavengers tear the body apart and move the bones elsewhere: Scavengers such as vultures, hyenas, or insects may encounter the remains and further break them apart while feeding on them, scattering the bones in the process. 5. Wind and rain also scatter the bones further: Weathering processes like wind and rain can erode the bones' original position, moving them further from their initial location. 6. The bones left behind will weather and become buried by sand and soil: Over time, sediments such as sand, silt, and clay, carried by wind or water, accumulate on top of the bones and bury them, protecting them from further weathering or scavenging. 7. The proteins in the bone are replaced with minerals that are dissolved in the soil: Through a process called permineralization, mineral-rich water seeps into the buried bones. The minerals gradually replace organic material and harden the bones, turning them into stone-like structures. 8. This creates a rock-like substance called a fossil: The mineralized remains become fossils, which can be preserved for millions of years within layers of rock. 9. Water and wind erosion wear away the layers of soil on top of the fossil: Over time, the layers of sediment above the fossil are eroded by natural forces, bringing the fossil closer to the surface. 10. This makes discovery of the fossil possible: As the fossil is exposed to the surface, it becomes accessible to paleontologists and other scientists who can study and research the extinct organism, providing valuable insights into the history of life on Earth."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Which artist used a terrace at St Thomas' Hospital as a vantage point for his series of paintings of the Houses of Parliament?","completion":"The artist who used a terrace at St. Thomas' Hospital as a vantage point for his series of paintings of the Houses of Parliament is Claude Monet, a renowned French Impressionist painter. Born on November 14, 1840, Monet was a critical figure in the Impressionist movement that transformed French painting in the second half of the 19th century. During his career, Monet employed a unique technique that focused on capturing light and vivid hues, emphasizing the beauty and vibrancy of the scenes he painted. The paintings of the Houses of Parliament were created during his three-month stay in London between late 1899 and early 1900. He worked on this series at the nearby St. Thomas' Hospital, which offered an ideal vantage point for observing and capturing the structures across the River Thames amid the distinctive atmosphere. The series includes approximately nineteen canvases featuring the iconic political buildings that house the United Kingdom's legislative body. Monet was particularly intrigued by the way fog and pollution diffused sunlight, creating an intricate blend of colors and a mysterious effect around the Houses of Parliament. This atmospheric display can be seen in his celebrated works such as \\"The Houses of Parliament, Sunset,\\" \\"Houses of Parliament, Effect of Sunlight in the Fog\\" and \\"The Houses of Parliament with Fog.\\" During the time he painted this series, Monet was staying at the Savoy Hotel, where he had set up a studio within his suite. Every day, he would travel to the terrace at St. Thomas' Hospital, armed with numerous canvases. Monet would repeatedly work on multiple canvases simultaneously, as he aimed to capture the changes in lighting throughout the day and the various moods that the atmosphere evoked. Monet's Houses of Parliament series showcases the power of the Impressionist approach, which took advantage of brief, thick brushstrokes and a thorough understanding of light and color to render stunning landscapes and scenes. It remains one of his most famous series and a testament to his artistic innovation and vision in the world of art."},{"prompt":"Q:Generate a question that has the following answer: The grave digger for the following movie plot: This article's plot summary may be too long or excessively detailed.

Article: Kindergarten outside? Yes, indeed. It's part of a growing worldwide trend toward outdoor education. The schools are called forest kindergartens. The numbers are small so far in the U.S., but the idea is well established in Europe, with schools in Scotland, England, and Switzerland. By far the most such schools are in Germany, which has more than 400 forest kindergartens. Some schools feature several hours of outdoor schooling. This is certainly the case with the Waldorf School of Saratoga Springs. Children there will be venturing out on the nearby Hemlock Trail to learn more about the natural world. Some lessons are focused on nature; others are academic topics delivered in a natural setting. In all cases, students are active-not sitting at desks or on mats on the floor but walking, running, jumping, solving problems like how to get the mud off the bottoms of their shoes before their parents find out. Seriously, the focus is on activity at these schools. Studies have shown that children's immune systems actually get stronger after all of the outdoor activity, and that graduates of forest kindergartens show a higher ability to learn when they progress through their academic careers. Other schools are all outdoors, all the time. This is the case with the Cedar Song Nature School, on Vashon Island, Washington. Students at this school spend their whole three-hour day outdoors, in a private five-acre forest, doing all kinds of physical activities. At these forest kindergartens, students learn science by observing and doing it, learn math by applying it to the natural world around them, learn letters and words by putting them together using sights and sounds. These students learn how to get along with one another, individually and in a group. They also develop healthy levels of self-confidence. Nowadays many children become obese because of sedentary activities like watching television and playing video games. These outdoor schools give children chances to learn just as much, if not more, from opening their eyes... Question: What is special about forest kindergartens?

Think like you are answering to a five year old. By. Daily Mail Reporter. PUBLISHED:. 22:13 EST, 6 October 2012. |. UPDATED:. 16:42 EST, 7 October 2012. The death toll has risen to seven from a 'rapidly evolving outbreak' of rare fungal meningitis that has been linked to spinal steroid injections, sparking fear as new cases have been reported in nine U.S. states. The potential scope of the meningitis outbreak, that has sickened 64 people, widened dramatically as health officials warned that hundreds, perhaps thousands, of patients who received steroid back injections in 23 states could be at risk. The outbreak of the disease, known as aspergillus meningitis, is caused by a fungus found in a spinal steroid injections, a fairly common treatment used to relieve back pain, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Beware: Health officials warned that hundreds, perhaps thousands, of patients who received steroid back injections in 23 states could be at risk (stock photo) The latest fatalities were reported in Michigan on Saturday, though the Michigan Department of Community Health said they would not provide more information on the two deaths until after the weekend. The fifth victim, Diana Reed, died on Wednesday afternoon at St Thomas Hospital in Nashville, Tennessee, surrounded by family members. Mrs. Reed, 56, is one of thousands of patients recently treated in Tennessee. hospitals for back pain with a steroid epidural - a fairly typical. treatment. But since then a tainted batch of steroids released across. the U.S. has been linked to dozens of cases of fungal meningitis. Mrs Reed, of Brentwood, Tennessee, was the fifth person to succumb to the infection. A blog written by a close friend of Reed's family, Brandon Scott Thomas, characterized her as 'hilarious, beautiful, and full of life' and praised her for carrying for husband Wayne Reed after he was diagnosed with Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis - more commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease - almost 20 years ago. 'Over the course of the last week she has gone from someone brimming with life to someone in the process of passing from this life to the next,' wrote. 'Her brain couldn't take the stress. After a series of strokes they moved her to hospice care. Wayne, one of the longest surviving patients with ALS, there by her side.' Reed served on the board of her husband's namesake child care organization, the Wayne Reed Christian Child Care Center. The caretaker: Diana Reed dedicated her life to helping underprivileged children before a routine medical procedure infected her with a rare fungal meningitis. Source: The outbreak of the deadly form of meningitis was traced to St Thomas Hospital in Nashville, Tennessee. The injectable steroids responsible. for Reed's death were produced by New England Compounding Center, a. specialized pharmacy in Framingham, Massachusetts. The company has shut down operations and said it is working with regulators to identify the source of the infection. It is not clear how many patients received tainted injections, or even whether everyone who got one will get sick. So far, 64 people in nine states - Tennessee, Virginia, Maryland, Florida, North Carolina, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota and Ohio - have contracted fungal meningitis, and five have died, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In an alarming indication that the outbreak. could get a lot bigger, Massachusetts health officials said the pharmacy. involved, the New England Compounding Center of Framingham, has. recalled three lots consisting of a total of 17,676 single-dose vials of. the steroid, preservative-free methylprednisolone acetate. No solicitors: Specialized pharmacy New England Compounding Center has hidden from the public as its steroids are linked to multiple deaths and critical infections. An unknown number of those vials reached 75 clinics and other facilities in 23 states between July and September, federal health officials said. Several hundred of the vials, maybe more, have been returned unused, one Massachusetts official said. However many other vials were used. At one clinic in Evansville, Indiana, more than 500 patients got shots from the suspect lots, officials said. At two clinics in Tennessee, more than 900 patients received them. The incubation period before symptoms appear is 28 days, and its almost certain more cases will be reported say health officials, who are now calling this a national health crisis. Tennessee: The initial outbreak site with a suspected 16 cases, two of whom are in critical condition. Three others have already died. North Carolina: The second state to report infection with one case found at an unidentified clinic. Florida: Only two cases have been reported but health officials fear more may come forward. Virginia: One person has died from fungal meningitis and three more cases are still being treated. Maryland: Seven medical clinics in Maryland pulled their stock of a questionable steroid after one person died and two more cases were reported. Indiana: At least five people in Indiana are sick with fungal meningitis, with no fatalities yet reported. Michigan: There are at least eight confirmed cases of meningitis in Michigan, including two deaths. Minnesota: Fungal meningitis has been diagnosed in two women hospitalized in Minnesota. Ohio: Health officials reported Saturday of a 65-year-old man being treated for the meningitis after receiving the steroid. Unlike the more common viral and bacterial meningitis, fungal meningitis is not contagious. It is an inflammation of the brain and spinal cord. Symptoms include a severe headache, nausea, fever, and dizziness. The first patients identified in Tennessee experienced slurred speech, and difficulty walking and urinating. The pharmacy voluntarily recalled three lots of the steroid Methylprednisolone Acetate on September 26 according to the FDA. The drug is primarily used to relieve back pain. The drug was administered to patients in their late 40s to early 80s. Tennessee's S. Thomas Hospital, ground zero for the outbreak with a suspected 15 cases as of Wednesday with two in critical condition, reported having 2,000 vials of the steroid in stock before the threat was discovered. 'Some are doing well and improving. Some are very ill - very, very. seriously ill and may die,' Tennessee health official Dr. David Reagan. said. In Tennessee alone roughly 1,000 people were administered the steroid. The link between the injections and the. meningitis was discovered by Tennessee physician April Pettit, who found. the initial cases were all people who'd recently received an epidural. Officials are still investigating how the steroid resulted in fungal meningitis. New England Compounding Center. released a statement promising to work with heath authorities to. discover what happened. But company president and licensed pharmacist. Barry J. Cadden has otherwise dodged interview requests and the company. web site is down. An archived version of the site notes the company is licensed to distribute drugs in every U.S. state. Critical condition: Tennessee health official Dr. David Reagan says the infected are 'very, very seriously ill and may die' New England Compounding Center is among the approximately 3,000 U.S. compounding pharmacies specializing in blending, liquefying, or combining medicines customized for patients unable to swallow tablets, require specific dosages, or who have allergies. Such companies are regulated by the. state boards of pharmacy that license them rather than facing the. broader regulations traditional drug companies deal with. The pharmacy has produced questionable. products before. In 2006, New England Compounding Center was one of. four companies ordered by the the Food and Drug Administration to cease. producing a topical anesthetic cream that was found to cause 'grave. reactions including seizures and irregular heartbeats.' The cream was the cause of two deaths, neither tied directly to New England Compounding Center. Ground zero: The first patients of the fungal meningitis were reported at St. Thomas Hospital which had roughly 2,000 vials of a dangerous steroid on stock. That same year the company was also cited for multiple violations of federal laws and regulations based on a 2004 review of its offices. They were charged with misbranding drugs prescribed for eye treatment, misbranding an anesthetic drug and failing to provide adequate directions for its use, and promoting the use of a cancer drug for an unapproved purpose. An FDA warning letter admonished the company that it was 'distributing an unapproved drug in violation' of federal regulations. In 2010 the company was sued by an Illinois firm that alleged New England Compounding Center illegally hacked its database violating the federal computer computer fraud and abuse act. The case was eventually settled. What are the important parts of this article?","completion":"This article talks about a serious outbreak of a rare fungal meningitis in the United States in 2012.

Sentence 2 does not indicate if all or only some assets are being sold, but the absence of the word \\"some\\" can potentially imply the sale of all the assets. Nevertheless, both sentences revolve around the same objects: Gulf of Mexico assets. Similarity: 4/5 4. Context: Sentence 1 does not mention a buyer, while Sentence 2 specifies that the buyer is Plains. This difference indicates that the context is not identical between the two sentences. Similarity: 3/5 5. Value: Both sentences mention the same monetary value, 5.55 billion. Similarity: 5/5 To calculate the overall similarity, we can average the similarity scores from each criterion: (5 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 5) / 5 = 22/5 = 4.4 Based on the analysis, the similarity between the two sentences is 4.4 on a scale from 0 to 5. This means that the sentences are quite similar, but there are small differences in context and the omission of the word \\"some\\" in Sentence 2."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Here is an article: NEW YORK (CNNMoney.com) -- The nation's financial markets will be closed Tuesday to honor former President Gerald Ford, marking a rare four-day closing for U.S. trading. The New York Stock Exchange said Friday it will be closed on Jan. 2 for the national day of mourning for the 38th president, a day after the Nasdaq stock market said it also will be closed. Over the last century, the markets have traditionally closed to commemorate the death of a past or sitting president. Ford, who became the first non-elected U.S. president in 1974, after the threat of impeachment forced the resignation of Richard Nixon, died this week on Tuesday at his home in Rancho Mirage, Calif., at age 93. Separately, the Federal Reserve will be closed Tuesday and has delayed the release of the minutes from its December meeting to Wednesday at 2 p.m. EST. The Fed's 12 regional banks will remain open Tuesday. With Monday's New Year's Day holiday and Tuesday's closing, the markets will be closed for an unusual four days. Aside from the stock exchanges, the commodities and futures markets said their main operations will be shut down for the day. The New York Mercantile Exchange, the Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange all said their floor trading operations will be closed. The New York Merc metals and energy futures and options markets will close early on Friday. The Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, formerly the Bond Market Association, recommended an early close Tuesday. It was closed for an entire day for President Ronald Reagan's funeral. A spokesman could not give a reason for the partial closing. At his ranch in Crawford, Texas on Thursday, President Bush declared Tuesday a national day of mourning for Ford, closing most federal offices for the day. Ford's body will be flown to Washington on Saturday and his casket will lie in state at the Capitol. Bush is due to speak at a service in his memory Tuesday, a White House spokesman told Reuters. During his presidency, Ford sought to calm the turbulence caused by the Vietnam war and Watergate. In his effort to heal this strife, he notably granted Mr. Nixon a \\"full, free and absolute pardon\\" from prosecution early in his term of office. Later on, Ford served on the board of the NASD from 1999-2000, before the Nasdaq stock market was spun off from its former parent. Ford's \\"leadership and invaluable service during his time on the NASD board contributed to what the Nasdaq is today,\\" Nasdaq CEO Bob Greifeld said in a statement. The day of a president's funeral has traditionally been a national day of mourning. Most recently financial markets were closed Friday, June 11, 2004, after Reagan died. Throughout the 20th century, the NYSE traditionally has observed the death of former and sitting presidents by closing for an entire day. Former President William McKinley's funeral was the first to be so honored on Thursday, Sept. 19, 1901. Five presidents were honored with partial closings: Herbert Hoover (1964), William Howard Taft (1930), Woodrow Wilson (1924), Theodore Roosevelt (1919), and Grover Cleveland (1908). Benjamin Harrison, whose funeral was held on March 13, 1901, was not honored with a memorial closing. There are no records to indicate the reasoning.

She left the room and walked quietly into the now guest room that had been Rob's.

Information: - Vincent Willem van Gogh (30 March 185329 July 1890) was a Dutch Post-Impressionist painter who is among the most famous and influential figures in the history of Western art. In just over a decade he created about 2,100 artworks, including around 860 oil paintings, most of them in the last two years of his life. They include landscapes, still lifes, portraits and self-portraits, and are characterised by bold colours and dramatic, impulsive and expressive brushwork that contributed to the foundations of modern art. His suicide at 37 followed years of mental illness and poverty. - Irises is one of many paintings and prints of irises by the Dutch artist Vincent van Gogh . Irises was painted while Vincent van Gogh was living at the asylum at Saint Paul - de - Mausole in Saint - Rémy - de - Provence , France , in the last year before his death in 1890 . It was painted before his first attack at the asylum . There is a lack of the high tension which is seen in his later works . He called the painting \`\` the lightning conductor for my illness '' because he felt that he could keep himself from going insane by continuing to paint . The painting was influenced by Japanese ukiyo - e woodblock prints like many of his works and those by other artists of the time . The similarities occur with strong outlines , unusual angles , including close - up views , and also flattish local colour ( not modelled according to the fall of light ) . He considered this painting a study which is probably why there are no known drawings for it , although Theo , Van Gogh 's brother , thought better of it and quickly submitted it to the annual exhibition of the Société des Artistes Indépendants in September 1889 , together with Starry Night Over the Rhone . He wrote to Vincent of the exhibition : \`\` ( It ) strikes the eye from afar . The Irises are a beautiful study full of air and life . '' - Oil painting is the process of painting with pigments with a medium of drying oil as the binder. Commonly used drying oils include linseed oil, poppy seed oil, walnut oil, and safflower oil. The choice of oil imparts a range of properties to the oil paint, such as the amount of yellowing or drying time. Certain differences, depending on the oil, are also visible in the sheen of the paints. An artist might use several different oils in the same painting depending on specific pigments and effects desired. The paints themselves also develop a particular consistency depending on the medium. The oil may be boiled with a resin, such as pine resin or frankincense, to create a varnish prized for its body and gloss.

Special forces could've responded to Benghazi attack, whistle-blower tells Fox News A military special ops member who watched as the deadly attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi unfolded last September told Fox News the U.S. had highly trained forces just a few hours away, and said he and others feel the government betrayed the four men who died in the attack. Speaking on condition of anonymity, and appearing in a Fox News Channel interview with his face and voice disguised, the special operator contradicted claims by the Obama administration and a State Department review that said there wasn’t enough time for U.S. military forces to have intervened in the Sept. 11 attack in which U.S. Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens, an embassy employee and two former Navy SEALs working as private security contractors were killed. “I know for a fact that C-110, the EUCOM CIF, was doing a training exercise in … not in the region of North Africa, but in Europe,” the operator told Fox News' Adam Housley. “And they had the ability to act and to respond.” The C-110 is a 40-man Special Ops force capable of rapid response and deployment specifically trained for incidents like last year’s attack in Benghazi. During the night of the Sept. 11, 2012, attack in Libya, in which U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans were killed in Libya, the C-110 were training in Croatia, just 3 ½ hours away. “We had the ability to load out, get on birds and fly there, at a minimum stage,” the operator told Fox News. “C-110 had the ability to be there, in my opinion, in a matter of about four hours…four to six hours.” Being so close, C-110s would have been able to respond had there been a second attack, the source added. “They would have been there at a minimum to provide a quick reaction force that can facilitate their exfil out of the, out of the problem situation. Nobody knew how it was going to develop. And you hear people and a whole bunch of advisers say, 'We wouldn’t have sent them because the security was a unknown situation.'” The source says the government could have at least sent the C-110s there as backup. “If it’s an unknown situation, at a minimum, you send forces there to facilitate the exfil, or, or, um medical injuries,” he said. “We could have sent a C-30 to Benghazi to provide medical evacuation for the injured.” The source says many people connected to the Benghazi bombing feel threatened and are afraid to talk. “The problem is, you got guys in my position, you got guys in special operations community who are still active and still involved,” the source said. “And they would be decapitated if they came forward with information that would affect high level commanders,” he said. Despite the concern, the source who spoke to Fox News says there’s a feeling of betrayal in the community that the government left people on the ground in Benghazi to fend for themselves. “You know, it’s something that’s risky, especially in our line of profession, to say anything about, anything in the realm of politics, or that deals with policy,” the source said. In December, former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Adm. Michael Mullen told lawmakers the U.S. did not have personnel close enough to have responded to the siege at the consulate, even though the State Department had been repeatedly warned by embassy staffers concerned about security in Libya. “It is not reasonable, nor feasible, to tether U.S. forces at the ready to respond to protect every high-risk post in the world,” Mullen said.

Please answer the following question: Given the following context: During the Iraq War, U.S. Army Staff Sergeant Shane Matthews is a sniper who is sent to investigate a pipeline construction site in the desert of the country, with his spotter, Sergeant Allen Isaac. The pair patiently wait 22 hours on overwatch before determining that the site is clear. Matthews proceeds to investigate the site, but is shot by an Iraqi sniper. Isaac tries to rescue the dying Matthews, but he is also wounded in the right knee and has his radio damaged and his water bottle destroyed in the process. Alone, Isaac takes cover behind an unsteady wall and tends to his wounds. The sniper has a radio tuned into the American channel, and uses it to communicate with Isaac under the pretense of being a high ranking allied soldier at another site. The deception allows the sniper to get other useful information from Isaac. Throughout their various one-sided attempts at conversation, we learn that the sniper does not claim to be the mythical Juba mentioned earlier in the film, a nom de guerre for various Al Qaeda snipers notorious for filming their attacks on American soldiers. Isaac's attempts to call headquarters for help are stymied by the loss of his radio antennae. He attempts to repair this item with one from a dead contractor's radio, only to discern that the sniper had used the earlier response team as a ruse to call for help and lure another response force into his jaws. Matthews regains consciousness and subtly gets Isaac's attention that he's still alive. Matthews slowly crawls towards his rifle in the midst of the dusty wind along with Isaac distracting Juba with small talk. Matthews believes that the sniper is hiding at the top of some rubble nearby and fires in that direction. The dusty wind settles quickly.

Lawrence Morton, in a study of the origins of The Rite, records that in 1907–08 Stravinsky set to music two poems from Sergey Gorodetsky's collection Yar. Another poem in the anthology, which Stravinsky did not set but is likely to have read, is \\"Yarila\\" which, Morton observes, contains many of the basic elements from which The Rite of Spring developed, including pagan rites, sage elders, and the propitiatory sacrifice of a young maiden: \\"The likeness is too close to be coincidental\\". Stravinsky himself gave contradictory accounts of the genesis of The Rite. In a 1920 article he stressed that the musical ideas had come first, that the pagan setting had been suggested by the music rather than the other way round. However, in his 1936 autobiography he described the origin of the work thus: \\"One day [in 1910], when I was finishing the last pages of L'Oiseau de Feu in St Petersburg, I had a fleeting vision ... I saw in my imagination a solemn pagan rite: sage elders, seated in a circle, watching a young girl dance herself to death. They were sacrificing her to propitiate the god of Spring. Such was the theme of the Sacre du Printemps\\".By May 1910 Stravinsky was discussing his idea with Nicholas Roerich, the foremost Russian expert on folk art and ancient rituals. Roerich had a reputation as an artist and mystic, and had provided the stage designs for Diaghilev's 1909 production of the Polovtsian Dances. The pair quickly agreed on a working title, \\"The Great Sacrifice\\" (Russian: Velikaia zhertva); Diaghilev gave his blessing to the work, although the collaboration was put on hold for a year while Stravinsky was occupied with his second major commission for Diaghilev, the ballet Petrushka.In July 1911 Stravinsky visited Talashkino, near Smolensk, where Roerich was staying with the Princess Maria Tenisheva, a noted patron of the arts and a sponsor of Diaghilev's magazine World of Art. Here, over several days, Stravinsky and Roerich finalised the structure of the ballet. Thomas F. Kelly, in his history of the Rite...

Write a title for this article: SEOUL, South Korea — Two months ago, John C. Liu, New York City’s comptroller, said he was “heartbroken” that the state’s top Democrats, skittish about a federal investigation into his campaign fund-raising, had excluded him from their delegate list to the Democratic National Convention. But this week, as most of the Democratic establishment, including all of his presumed major rivals in the 2013 race for mayor, gathers in Charlotte, N.C., Mr. Liu is doing his best to attract attention 7,000 miles away in Asia. He is visiting Seoul and Taipei, Taiwan, as part of a four-day whirlwind trip that will feature at least 14 events, including audiences with the mayor of Seoul and the vice president of Taiwan. One of the highlights of the trip came on Tuesday, when he delivered a speech at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies in Seoul to a packed auditorium of more than 230 people, including 100 exchange students from the State University of New York, Mr. Liu’s alma mater. Mr. Liu, who was born in Taiwan but moved to New York as a child, said he was in Asia to promote business and investment opportunities for the city. The trip also promises to afford him a chance to connect with civic and business leaders who have ties to American immigrant communities and who could be potential donors, according to two people close to Mr. Liu. The host governments are paying for Mr. Liu’s airfare and lodging, which is permissible under city rules. In Seoul, many of Mr. Liu’s activities were arranged by Korea’s consulate in New York City, as well as by Mr. Liu’s office, according to the organizers. The organizers said they had discussed the federal inquiry into the comptroller’s campaign fund-raising, which so far has resulted in the arrests of his former treasurer and a top fund-raiser. “I am aware that Mr. Liu’s staff is under investigation, and we had a staff meeting about this,” said Jang Tae-yeoub, dean of external affairs at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies. “But we decided to go ahead with his visiting our university because the investigation is ongoing and not final.” Park Yoon-joo, a director at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, said, “I do not think it is our business to get involved in those domestic political affairs,” before praising Mr. Liu as “a very active, promising leader fostering good relationships with various minority communities including the Korean-Americans.” At times, Mr. Liu touched on the political issues being discussed in Charlotte. Asked about “the most crucial factor in passing the budget,” for instance, he offered a rousing defense of President Obama. He said that “in my opinion, from Day 1, there were some people in Washington who were determined to see President Obama fail,” and he criticized the Tea Party, particularly for “standing in the way and making life difficult for the president.” Mr. Liu also addressed issues that would most likely be highlighted if he ran for mayor next year, including his aggressive auditing of city agencies, his desire to speed up infrastructure development and his personal history as an immigrant who was “made in Taiwan.” The city’s “Asian-American population continues to grow, is talented and is clearly on the move as they serve as our bridge to Asia,” he said to his audience at Hankuk University. “I want all of you to help me build that bridge,” he added, before saying, “Gamsahamnida,” which means “thank you” in Korean. This week’s trip is the fourth that Mr. Liu has taken overseas since becoming comptroller in January 2010, but his first since November 2010. From Seoul, he flew to Taiwan — his birthplace and the island of origin of many of the immigrants who are a dominant force in his Flushing neighborhood. His schedule included visits to two cabinet ministries and an address to the Taiwan Academy of Banking and Finance. Even in Seoul, which is 6,885 miles from New York, Mr. Liu was asked about his possible candidacy for mayor. “I can’t believe I am in Seoul and people are still asking me that question,” he said at one point. At a 7-Eleven outside the university after his speech, Mr. Liu acknowledged that he had given the idea some thought. “People say that I would be a different kind of mayor,” he said, after buying a bottle of Korean corn tea and a pack of dried squid. “I think it would be obvious why.” Su Hyun Lee reported from Seoul, and David W. Chen from New York.","completion":"\\"New York City Comptroller John C. Liu Ventures to Asia Amid DNC Exclusion and Federal Investigation\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Daily Mail Reporter. and Ap. Buddy Cianci, the twice-convicted felon who led Providence as mayor for 21 years, wants his old job back. Cianci said Wednesday that he is running as an independent for a seventh term as mayor. The last time he won an election was 16 years ago — before he was convicted in 2002 of racketeering conspiracy for widespread corruption in his administration. He spent 4 ½ years in prison. Cianci, 73, said he is not seeking redemption, but wishes to bring his experience and vision to the city to make a difference. He said Providence can't afford to have a mayor who is getting 'on-the-job training.' Convict: Buddy Cianci was twice forced from office after assault and corruption convictions. Making an announcement on his radio show, Cianci said that many people would call this an eleventh-hour decision, but that he decided to join the field after much soul-searching and reflection. He said he wants to rekindle the city's 'renaissance.' 'If the people don't want me, they don't have to vote for me. I realize I have baggage,' he said during a break in his show. 'They know who I am. They know what I am. And they know what I've accomplished.' Cianci's announcement came shortly before the 4 p.m. filing deadline; a surrogate filed his paperwork for him at City Hall. He will take a leave from the show and from his duties as a local television commentator during the campaign. Cianci previously won office as a Republican and independent. New gig: Cianci has worked as a radio broadcaster since his release from federal prison in 2007. Popular: Despite his felony convictions, Cianci has remained a popular politician in Providence. He was diagnosed in January with cancer and has undergone chemotherapy and radiation treatments, but says his health is good now and won't keep him from running a campaign or the city. Under his watch, the city transformed from a down-at-the-heels urban center with a dwindling downtown to an arts and culture hub. He often boasts that he literally moved rivers to improve the downtown. Supporters had urged him to run to bring his vision and attitude back to City Hall, but many residents feared a run by a man who was driven from office twice by felony convictions would embarrass the city. Cianci mounted his first campaign in 1974 and never lost an election. But he was forced to resign in 1984, after he was convicted of using a fireplace log and lit cigarette to assault a man he believed was having an affair with his estranged wife. Six years after that conviction, in 1990, he ran for mayor again and won. His second stint as mayor, known around town as Buddy II, came to an end in 2002 when he was convicted as part of a federal investigation into corruption in City Hall, called Operation Plunderdome by the FBI. Several other members of his administration were also convicted. Nice 'do: Cianci used to wear a tupee but recently ditched it and embraced his bald head. The city's demographics have changed since Cianci last won election. Its Hispanic population grew nearly one-third between 2000 and 2010, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Hispanics represented 38 percent of the population in 2010. The city usually votes heavily Democratic. A crowded field of candidates is vying to replace one-term Mayor Angel Taveras, who is mounting a run for governor. Democrats running include City Councilman Michael Solomon, political operative Brett Smiley and law professor and former judge Jorge Elorza. Republican Dan Harrop is also running. Lorne Adrain filed as an independent. A few of the candidates issued immediate statements reacting to Cianci's entry. 'Providence cannot afford to return to the corrupt politics of the past, and that is what Buddy Cianci's candidacy represents,' Smiley said. Solomon said he — not Cianci — is the candidate of experience, having worked in recent years with Taveras to bring the city back from the brink of bankruptcy. He said voters want to 'keep moving forward.' Adrain said Cianci's announcement won't affect his campaign. 'The people of Providence are well familiar with his history,' he said.

Please answer the following question: I was a waitress at the New England regional chain Newport Creamery for seven years in Jr. High, High School, and College. In college, I needed money for school supplies, so in addition to slinging ice cream cones and “Awful Awfuls” at the Creamery, I picked up a few more jobs: working the dinner shift at a family restaurant, heaving trays of cocktails at a bar until 3AM, and cleaning houses. Needless to say, I was a wreck, and a big time abuser of coffee and cigarettes. One day just before my shift at the Creamery began, I slung back a huge coffee and hauled on a Newport cigarette in the kitchen (this was when you could do things like smoke in a restaurant kitchen.) I then went out to the dining floor and approached my first table, who had been given menus and was waiting for me to take their order. “Hi, How are you today?”, I cheerfully asked the mother and her three daughters, all looking under 12. “What may I get you?…..” Then, fade to black as a huge swooshing sound took over my head. Next thing I know, I’m on the floor, covered in blood, the girls are screaming blue murder, and my manager is shaking like a leaf as he coddles me. Apparently, I passed out right onto the table of the nice family I was waiting on, then fell back and whacked my head on the corner of a wall. I remember noticing that my kelly green polyester dress was an awful shade of bloodied brown. My main concern was that I had a hot date that night, and now I had to go to the emergency room! The ER doctor was able to sew my head up, and sent me home with a diagnosis of “syncope, unknown origin”. After a few hours, I still felt spacey, but insisted on going on the date.

Direct effect: With more water droplets present in the clouds, there is an increased potential for the formation of ice crystals. However, if these water droplets do not undergo the necessary temperature drop to turn into ice crystals, there won't necessarily be an increase in snowfall. In fact, an abundance of water droplets in the cloud may lead to them merging together to form bigger droplets, which may result in other precipitation types such as rain. Indirect effect: The increased water content in the sky could contribute to changes in the local weather and climate. For example, it may lead to more cloud coverage, which could trap heat and thus indirectly impact the air temperature. In this case, if temperatures remain above freezing levels due to the additional moisture and trapped heat, it could lead to less snowfall. In summary, the supposed perturbation of more water droplets being formed could have both direct and indirect effects on the process of snow formation.

The answer is:","completion":"Louis David Brandeis was born on November 13, 1856, in Louisville, Kentucky. He was destined to become one of the most influential and renowned figures in American legal history. After completing his early education, Brandeis went on to enroll in Harvard Law School, where he excelled academically and eventually earned his degree. On a personal front, Brandeis married his wife, Alice Goldmark, in 1891. Together, they formed a strong partnership, supporting each other throughout their lives. Brandeis remained a devout practitioner of Judaism, with his faith playing a profound role in shaping his worldview. His legal career took off as he became known for his dedication to social justice and his ability to use law as a means of effectuating change. Brandeis's impressive professional background and strong ideals caught the attention of President Woodrow Wilson, who nominated him to the United States Supreme Court in 1916. This nomination was met with both praise and controversy. Louis Brandeis was confirmed as Associate Justice by the Senate on June 1, 1916. His appointment was groundbreaking in several ways, making him the first Jewish justice ever to serve on the nation's highest court. This was a significant milestone that demonstrated the shifting tides of American inclusion and diversity. Brandeis took the oath of office and officially assumed his position on the bench. His predecessor, Joseph Rucker Lamar, made way for Brandeis, who would hold the post for more than two decades. Over the course of his tenure, he forged an illustrious reputation for his keen intellect, commitment to civil liberties, and his vision of progressive reform. Despite the many challenges and criticisms that came his way, Justice Brandeis remained steadfast in his pursuit of fairness, equality, and social justice. As an Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court, he contributed powerfully to the shaping of American jurisprudence through countless landmark cases and rulings. Ultimately, after serving on the Supreme Court for nearly 23 years, the venerable Louis D. Brandeis announced his retirement on February 13, 1939. He was later succeeded by Justice William O. Douglas, who took over the mantle and continued the work of his esteemed predecessor. Louis Brandeis passed away on October 5, 1941, in Washington, D.C. His legacy as a trailblazing justice and a tireless advocate for social change has had a lasting impact on American society. To this day, he is remembered and celebrated not just for the groundbreaking nature of his appointment but also for the depth of his commitment to creating a more equitable and just nation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Brooklyn Bridge was the first suspension bridge to link Brooklyn to Manhanttan.It is also the second oldest bridge in New York.The architect was John Augustus Roebling,who was the chief engineer of the suspended Railroad Bridge at Niagara Falls. Misfortune accompanied the building of the bridge,which took place from 1869 to 1883.The architect died as a result of an accident early during the construction.His son,Washington Roebling,carried on his father's work,using the most advanced engineering techniques of the day.He also fell ill during the construction of the bridge and was obliged to direct the work on it from an apartment window overlooking the site.

Dory is a lovable and endearing character who suffers from short-term memory loss, which consistently puts her and her friends on a whirlwind of hilarious adventures. 'Finding Nemo,' a computer-animated film produced by Pixar Animation Studios and released by Walt Disney Pictures, was directed by Andrew Stanton and premiered in 2003. The movie is set under the vast ocean where a clownfish named Marlin embarks on an incredible journey to find his son, Nemo, who has been captured by a scuba diver and placed in a fish tank in a dentist's office in Sydney, Australia. During his quest, Marlin encounters Dory, who becomes his travel companion.

Question 1: Why did Ratan Tata remove Cyrus Mistry? Question 2: Why has the Tata Sons Board voted to remove Cyrus Mistry as chairman? OPT: (i) no (ii) yes Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","completion":"Yes, the answer to both questions would essentially be the same, as they both pertain to the reasons behind the removal of Cyrus Mistry as the chairman of Tata Sons. However, it is important to note that Ratan Tata, as an individual, didn't single-handedly remove Cyrus Mistry. It was a collective decision by the Tata Sons Board, of which Ratan Tata is a prominent member. Cyrus Mistry's removal as the chairman of Tata Sons in October 2016 was a result of multiple factors, which can be broadly categorized into two areas: performance issues and differences in management style. 1. Performance issues: During Cyrus Mistry's tenure as chairman, the group's overall financial performance was considered to be underwhelming. Some of the key concerns were: a. Poor profitability: During Mistry's four-year tenure, the group's profit margin and market capitalization took a hit. Some of the group's businesses, such as Tata Motors, Tata Steel Europe, and Tata Teleservices, faced significant financial difficulties. b. Lack of strategic growth: There was concern regarding Mistry's ability to drive growth through strategic acquisitions and expansion plans. The critics pointed at Tata Motors' unsuccessful acquisition of Jaguar Land Rover and the stalled divestiture of Tata Steel Europe as examples. c. Rising debt: Under Mistry's leadership, the group's consolidated debt increased, raising concerns about its financial stability. 2. Differences in management style: Cyrus Mistry's management approach was considered to be incompatible with the group's values and ethos. Some of the reasons cited were: a. Focus on select businesses: Mistry's strategy was to consolidate the conglomerate and focus more on a few key business segments. This led to tensions with the board, as it was seen as diverging from the group's core value – the commitment to a diversified business portfolio. b. Governance issues: Mistry was often critical of Ratan Tata's decision-making and business strategies, while accusing the Tata Trusts, the largest shareholder in Tata Sons, of interference in the functioning of the operating companies. This tension created friction between the Tata Trusts and the management. c. Lack of interpersonal skills: Cyrus Mistry was criticized for his communication and public relations skills, which some considered detrimental to the overall functioning of the group. These cumulative factors led to the loss of confidence in Cyrus Mistry, resulting in the Tata Sons Board's decision to remove him as chairman. Ratan Tata played a significant role in the process, partially due to his position as the Chairman Emeritus of Tata Sons and his strong involvement with the Tata Trusts. However, it is important to emphasize that the decision was ultimately taken by the Tata Sons Board, not Ratan Tata alone."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

It is a non-profit and the story has been corrected. The White House on Tuesday formally requested 3.7 billion in emergency funding from Congress to deal with an influx of Central American minors along the southern border. But the proposal was quickly met with broad skepticism among Republican lawmakers, who were doubtful that the package would be approved quickly — if at all. Administration officials said the request is part of a comprehensive strategy aimed at building more detention centers, adding immigration judges, and beefing up border patrols and air surveillance. President Obama has said he hopes such steps will speed deportations and discourage adults from sending children on a dangerous, sometimes deadly, trip north. But GOP leaders, who have called on Obama to take stronger action, said they were reluctant to give the administration a “blank check” without ­more-detailed plans to ensure that the money would help stem the crisis at the border. The president “is asking to use billions of taxpayer dollars without accountability or a plan in place to actually stop the border crisis,” Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.), chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, said in a statement. Asked if he thought lawmakers would approve the proposal, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) said, “No, given the mood here in Washington, I don’t have confidence it will happen.” View Graphic White House requests 3.7 billion The uncertainty on Capitol Hill casts doubt on whether the administration can mount a successful response to a surge of tens of thousands of children who have overwhelmed Border Patrol stations in recent months. More than 52,000 unaccompanied minors and 39,000 women with children have been apprehended on the southern border this year, far more than in past years. Most have come from Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras; those countries would receive money under Obama’s proposal to help repatriate their citizens after they are returned home. The request comes just days after Obama announced that he was giving up on a year-long effort to persuade House Republicans to support a comprehensive immigration bill. The president said he would take executive actions to reform border-control laws on his own — a declaration that angered the GOP. The toxic environment on the Hill, combined with the looming midterm elections this fall, has contributed to the sense among Democrats and Republicans that a deal on emergency funding is unlikely, even though both sides say they agree with the White House that the crisis is urgent. “What we would like Congress to do is to act promptly, maybe even expeditiously, to consider this proposal and hopefully move on it in bipartisan fashion,” said White House press secretary Josh Earnest. A spokesman for House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) said the House Appropriations Committee and a separate working group of seven Republicans focused on border issues would review the administration’s proposal. “The speaker still supports deploying the National Guard to provide humanitarian support in the affected areas — which this proposal does not address,” spokesman Michael Steel said in a statement. Immigration advocates are urging President Obama to come up with another solution besides sending young children back to their home countries. The demonstration comes as an influx of Central American children are illegally crossing into the United States. (Theresa Poulson/The Washington Post) The rift between the parties hinges on a fundamental disagreement over how the crisis should be handled. Republicans argue that Obama must stop the flow of illegal immigrants to the border and ensure that the entire border is secure before focusing on the tens of thousands who are already in detention facilities there. Citing that logic, Heritage Action, a conservative non-profit that closely monitors how Republican lawmakers vote, decried the Obama funding proposal as a “non-starter.” Heritage Action’s chief executive, Michael A. Needham, said in a statement that the proposal “seeks to address the symptoms, not the cause. The president should rescind his anti-enforcement policies and demonstrate a commitment to implementing existing law.” Democrats, meanwhile, say the first step must be new facilities and legal services to work through a debilitating backlog of minors and families already apprehended at the border. “The process I don’t think is the problem,” said Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.). “I think it is a real crisis. Lives are going to be lost and mistakes are going to be made, so I think this supplemental is really all-important.” Under the White House proposal, most of the emergency funds would be split between the Department of Health and Human Services — which would receive 1.8 billion to provide shelter and care to the immigrants — and the Justice and Homeland Security departments, which would get a combined 1.6 billion to handle enforcement. The State Department would receive 300 million to help the Central American countries repatriate their citizens and create advertising campaigns about the dangers of placing children in the hands of smuggling cartels. The White House request also includes money to help the federal government fight wildfires. “I commend the administration for doing what it can to quickly address this surge of children and families attempting to enter our country, and I urge my colleagues in Congress to support it,” Sen. Thomas R. Carper (D-Del.), chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, said in a statement. Republicans criticized the administration for not including measures to amend a 2008 anti-human-trafficking law that provides greater legal protections for minors entering the United States from non-border countries. The Obama administration had signaled last week that it would pursue such changes in order to deport Central American minors more quickly. “I just think the average American will say that if you don’t deport these children, others are going to keep coming,” Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) said. “The 2008 law was not designed to address this situation. . . . I think you take the 2008 law and you come up with a law that will address this situation.” Earnest said Tuesday that the administration will work with lawmakers on proposals to amend that law. But Democrats and immigrant rights advocates have sharply condemned proposed changes, fearing that migrants will be returned to dangerous situations in their home nations. Obama left Washington on Tuesday evening for a trip to Denver, Dallas and Austin, where he will attend several Democratic fundraisers and talk about the economy. Administration aides said that he will not visit the border while in Texas but that he will meet with local leaders, including Gov. Rick Perry (R), to discuss the crisis. “If it’s serious enough for him to send a 3.7 billion funding request to us, I would think it would be serious enough for him to take an hour of his time on Air Force One to go down and see for himself what the conditions are,” Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.) told reporters Tuesday. “I think it would be instructive for him.” Ed O’Keefe and Katie Zezima contributed to this report. ||||| The Obama administration on Tuesday asked Congress for 3.7 billion in emergency funding to address the wave of child immigrants crossing the southwest border. The figure is much bigger than the 2 billion that administration officials initially floated, and the total 4.3 billion package also includes a request for 615 million for the Department of Agriculture to fight wildfires in the West. THE WHITE HOUSE Office of the Press Secretary FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE July 8, 2014 FACT SHEET: Emergency Supplemental Request to Address the Increase in Child and Adult Migration from Central America in the Rio Grande Valley Areas of the Southwest Border While overall rates of apprehensions across our Southwest border remain at near historic lows, apprehensions and processing of children and individuals from Central America crossing the border in the Rio Grande Valley have continued at high rates. The Administration continues to address this urgent humanitarian situation with a whole-of government response which includes efforts by the Departments of Homeland Security (DHS) and Justice (DOJ) to deploy additional enforcement resources -- including immigration judges, Immigration and Customs Enforcement attorneys, and asylum officers -- to focus on individuals and adults traveling with children from Central America and entering without authorization across the Southwest border. Part of this surge includes detention of adults traveling with children, as well as expanded use of the Alternatives to Detention program, to avoid a more significant humanitarian situation. DHS is working to secure additional space that satisfies applicable legal and humanitarian standards for detention of adults with children. This surge of resources means that cases are processed fairly and as quickly as possible, ensuring the protection of asylum seekers and refugees while enabling the prompt removal of individuals who do not qualify for asylum or other forms of relief from removal. Finally, to attack the criminal organizations and smuggling rings that are exploiting these individuals, agencies are surging law enforcement task forces in cooperation with our international partners, with a focus on stepped-up interdiction and prosecution. Under the President’s direction, the Administration also continues to work closely with our Mexican and Central American partners to address the root causes of this problem, stem the flow of adults and unaccompanied children into the United States, and expand capacity to receive and reintegrate repatriated migrants. Following the Vice President’s June 20 meeting with leaders from El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Mexico, to discuss our shared responsibility for promoting security, these countries committed to working together and with the United States to address the immediate humanitarian situation as well as the long-term challenges. Secretary Kerry met with leaders from El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras on July 1st in Panama, and in his remarks highlighted some of the challenges driving migration, the importance of applying the law and combating misinformation, and working together with Central American partners to address these challenges. We are working with our Central American partners, nongovernmental organizations, and other influential voices to send a clear message to potential migrants so that they understand the significant dangers of this journey and to make clear that they are not eligible for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals process or earned citizenship provisions that are part of comprehensive immigration reform pending in the Congress. As part of this effort, we have also committed foreign assistance resources to improve capacity of these countries to receive and reintegrate returned individuals and address the underlying security and economic issues that cause migration. While the Administration is working across all of these channels, we are eager to work with the Congress to ensure that sufficient resources and authorities exist to continue our efforts. That is why today the President is requesting a 3.7 billion supplemental appropriation focused on: · Deterrence, including increased detainment and removal of adults with children and increased immigration court capacity to speed cases · Enforcement, including enhanced interdiction and prosecution of criminal networks, increased surveillance, and expanded collaborative law enforcement task force efforts · Foreign Cooperation, including improved repatriation and reintegration, stepped-up public information campaigns, and efforts to address the root causes of migration · Capacity, including increased detainment, care, and transportation of unaccompanied children The supplemental appropriation broken down below would fund activities at the Departments of, Homeland Security (DHS), Justice (DOJ), State and other International Programs, and Health and Human Services (HHS). The Department of Homeland Security, Immigration and Customs Enforcement - 1.1 billion This proposal would provide the Department of Homeland Security a total of 1.1 billion for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Of this total: · 116 million would pay for transportation costs associated with the significant rise in apprehensions of unaccompanied children; · 109 million would provide for immigration and customs enforcement efforts, including expanding the Border Enforcement Security Task Force program, doubling the size of vetted units in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras, and expanding investigatory activities by ICE Homeland Security Investigations; and · 879 million would pay for detention and removal of apprehended undocumented adults traveling with children, expansion of alternatives to detention programs for these individuals, and additional prosecution capacity for adults with children who cross the border unlawfully. The Department of Homeland Security, Customs and Border Protection - 433 million This proposal would provide the Department of Homeland Security a total of 433 million for Customs and Border Protection (CBP). Of this total: · 364 million would pay for operational costs of responding to the significant rise in apprehensions of unaccompanied children and families, including overtime and temporary duty costs for Border Patrol agents, contract services and facility costs to care for children while in CBP custody, and medical and transportation service arrangements; · 29 million for CBP to expand its role in Border Enforcement Security Task Force programs, increasing information-sharing and collaboration among the participating law enforcement agencies combatting transnational crime; and · 39.4 million to increase air surveillance capabilities that would support 16,526 additional flight hours for border surveillance and 16 additional crews for unmanned aerial systems to improve detection and interdiction of illegal activity. The Department of Justice - 64 million This proposal would provide the Department of Justice a total of 64 million. Of the total: · 45.4 million would be to hire approximately 40 additional immigration judge teams, including those anticipated to be hired on a temporary basis. This funding would also expand courtroom capacity including additional video conferencing and other equipment in support of the additional immigration judge teams. These additional resources, when combined with the FY 2015 Budget request for 35 additional teams, would provide sufficient capacity to process an additional 55,000 to 75,000 cases annually. · 2.5 million would be used to expand the legal orientation program that provides assistance to adults and custodians of children in the immigration court system. · 15 million to provide direct legal representation services to children in immigration proceedings. · 1.1 million to hire additional immigration litigation attorneys to support Federal agencies involved in detainee admission, regulation, and removal actions. Department of State and Other International Programs - 300 million This proposal would provide 300 million to the Department of State. Of the total: · 295 million would support efforts to repatriate and reintegrate migrants to Central America, to help the governments in the region better control their borders, and to address the underlying root causes driving migration, i.e. creating the economic, social, governance, and citizen security conditions to address factors that are contributing to significant increases in migration to the United States. Beyond initial assistance, continued funding for repatriation and reintegration activities will be contingent on sustained progress and cooperation by the Central American countries. · 5 million would support State Department media campaigns in Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras, targeting potential migrants and their families. The campaigns will emphasize the dangers of the journey, deliver the message that unaccompanied children are not given a permit to stay in the U.S., and highlight a shared community responsibility for the welfare of unaccompanied children. Funds would also support youth programs to develop skills and leadership among potential migrants. The Department of Health and Human Services - 1.8 billion This proposal would provide an additional 1.8 billion for HHS to provide the appropriate care for unaccompanied children, consistent with Federal law, while maintaining services for refugees. With these funds, HHS will have the resources to be able to care for the children currently projected to come into the custody of the Department of Homeland Security while putting in place more stable, cost-effective arrangements for these children going forward. The proposal would also support the ongoing HHS medical response activities for unaccompanied children to address the surge at Border Patrol facilities. Without supplemental funding, absent undertaking extraordinary measures, agencies will not have sufficient resources to adequately address this situation. HHS will be unable to address the influx of children by securing sufficient shelter capacity with the number of children held at Border Patrol stations continuing to increase, for longer periods of time. Going forward, HHS will be unable to set-up more stable, cost-effective arrangements for these children, Border Patrol agents will have to be re-assigned to child care duties from their border security work, and ICE will lack the resources needed to sufficiently expand detention and removal capacity for adults with children who cross the border illegally. In addition, without additional funds, DOJ will be unable to keep pace with its growing caseload, leading to longer wait times for those cases already on the docket. And absent dedicated resources in Central American countries, we will not make progress on the larger drivers of this humanitarian crisis. For these reasons, supplemental resources are urgently needed to continue forward with the aggressive response that the Administration has deployed to date. # Read more from The Hill: Obama wants 3.7B for border Read letter from the president ||||| The administration on Tuesday asked Congress for 3.7 billion in emergency funding to address the wave of child immigrants crossing the Southwest border. The figure is much more than the 2 billion that was initially reported. The overall package totals 4.3 billion, and also includes a request for 615 million for the Department of Agriculture to fight wildfires in the West. [READ WHITE HOUSE FACT SHEET.] Administration officials had said the request would be more than 2 billion, but had not suggested it would be nearly double that amount. The White House cast the request as part of an aggressive response to the border crisis, which has become a political problem for the administration months before the midterm elections. [READ PRESIDENT'S LETTER TO SPEAKER.] ADVERTISEMENT “If you look at the details, what you see is an embodiment of the incredibly serious commitment that the president has to addressing the situation,” one White House official said on Tuesday. The request includes 1.8 billion for the Health and Human Services Department to provide “appropriate care” for the children, who are mostly coming from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. It also includes 1.1 billion for the Department of Homeland Security and Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The funding would help expand border security task forces and help pay for transportation costs associated with the rise in unaccompanied children. The package could be controversial with Republicans, who have argued the administration’s policies are encouraging an unprecedented wave of child immigrants. They have pointed to President Obama’s decision not to deport certain children who were brought to the U.S. as illegal immigrants. Republicans have also pressed Obama to send the National Guard to the border. Michael Steel, a spokesman for Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) said Tuesday that the Appropriations Committee and other members — including the working group on the border crisis led by Rep. Kay Granger (R-Texas) — will review the administration's proposal. \\"The Speaker still supports deploying the National Guard to provide humanitarian support in the affected areas, which this proposal does not address,\\" Steel said. At the White House briefing on Tuesday, press secretary Josh Earnest disputed Boehner's concern about border agents, saying that immigrants who are entering the country without authorization \\"aren't seeking to evade detection\\" by law enforcement officials. \\"Rather, these individuals are seeking out these Border Patrol agents with the expectation they'll be detained and in the hope that they'll be allowed to remain in the country,\\" he said. Earnest said he hopes Congress will act \\"promptly and even expeditiously\\" on the supplemental. \\"With emergency requests like this traditional Congress has not sought to bog it down with a search for offsets,\\" Earnest said. The administration has acknowledged that many of the people entering the country believe they will be allowed to stay, and has said it is working to counter those misperceptions. The White House took its toughest line yet Monday, with Obama spokesman Josh Earnest saying most of the children would not be allowed to stay in the United States. Administration officials have said that many of the new immigrants are entering the United States to escape violence in their home countries. U.S. officials have been ill-equipped to handle the wave of new immigrants, who have crowded into detention centers. Immigrants have been bussed to other centers in California, where there have been some high-profile protests. Some of the funding request would be used to speed up immigration trials so that people could be deported more quickly. Many of the new immigrants are released to the care of relatives while they await court hearings. The request also includes 433 million to go toward additional resources for border agents, including overtime and \\"temporary duty costs\\" for border agents as well as an increase in air surveillance capabilities. The Department of Justice would receive 64 million to hire approximately 40 additional immigration judge teams, White House officials say. The administration is seeking Congressional discretion on at least one element of the plan: \\"We are seeking a greater authority for the secretary of Homeland Security to exercise greater discretion that would allow him to more efficiently and effectively remove and repatriate immigrants to this country that don't have a legal basis for remaining here,\\" Earnest said. The White House says more than 52,000 unaccompanied children have attempted to cross the border since October. The president will travel to Texas on Thursday but administration officials say he will not visit the border while he is there. Instead, he plans to address the issue in a meeting with local leaders. The White House has invited Texas Gov. Rick Perry to also take part in the meeting. Speaking about this crisis on Tuesday, White House officials say Obama believes the wave of immigrants is an “urgent humanitarian situation.” The officials said the administration is focused on making sure the children have proper care “but plan to enforce the law.” Administration officials say they are hopeful Congress will approve the president's request. “Our hope and expectation ... is that this will be treated as the urgent humanitarian situation that it is,” one White House official said. —This story was posted at 11:36 a.m. and updated at 1:44 p.m. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","completion":"The White House has requested 3.7 billion in emergency funding from Congress to deal with an influx of Central American minors along the southern border.

There are three options provided: Option 1: Yes Option 2: It is not possible to tell Option 3: No To analyze these options, let's break down the given information: The premise provides us with three distinct pieces of information: 1. There are people present. 2. These people are under a blue umbrella. 3. These people are walking. Now, let's compare this information to our hypothesis: \\"People are walking.\\" Our hypothesis aligns with the third piece of information provided in the premise - it directly states that people are walking. Option 1: Yes If the premise is true, meaning people are indeed under a blue umbrella and walking, then the hypothesis can be considered true as well. The given information in the premise supports the statement made in the hypothesis. Option 2: It is not possible to tell In this scenario, the suggestion is that the provided premise doesn't offer enough evidence to convincingly confirm or refute the hypothesis. However, as we have seen in the analysis above, the premise does provide information directly correlating to the hypothesis - people are walking. Option 3: No This option would suggest that even if the premise is true, it doesn't confirm the hypothesis. But upon analyzing the premise, we can see that it includes the fact that people are walking, which aligns with the hypothesis directly.

Q:When I first started out in the field, I was working at a private hospital in the locked psychiatric unit, and there was a call from one of the med floors requiring someone from our unit to assist with a problem of a young man who had bitten through his cotton restraints on his wrists. They were requesting he be restrained with leather ones. I had not done any restraining and was asked to assist a woman counselor to show me the ropes (no pun intended). When we arrived in the patients room, I was shocked to see a man in his early 20’s flailing around spasmodically on the bed with his gums bleeding in between his teeth. The nurse informed us that the patient was dying of a liver disease and his body and brain had become toxic, causing delirium. The counselor instructed me to hold down his arms and she placed him in leather restraints which were fastened to the side of the bed. The most upsetting thing which to this day I can not remove from memory was this man literally snapping his jaws at me like a mad animal with traumatized bloody gums from biting so hard on the cloth restraints. There was nothing I, or anyone could do, except keep him restrained from hurting himself or others. It is the kind of witness to suffering I had never experienced before, and I felt almost relieved when the nurse quietly said, “ He will die before morning. “ I suppose what is so traumatic about witnessing such situations is the utter sense of helplessness. I was a trained therapist, and in this situation, I was unable to do anything, and was rendered powerless. I recall being plagued by this young man’s face for some time when I tried to go to sleep at night.

What is the best way to: To remove gum from your hair.","completion":"The best way to remove gum from your hair involves the following steps: Step 1: Remain calm - When you realize there's gum in your hair, don't panic or start pulling on it which can worsen the situation. Instead, calmly assess the situation and decide on the best course of action. Step 2: Gather materials - To effectively remove gum from your hair, you will need some items that help dissolve the gum's stickiness. Common household items that might work well include oil-based products like cooking oil, peanut butter or conditioner, ice cubes, a fine-tooth comb, and a towel or cloth. Step 3: Apply chosen substance - Choose one of the oil-based substances like cooking oil, peanut butter, or conditioner. Apply a generous amount directly onto the gum and surrounding hair using a cloth, or your fingers. The more lubricated the gum becomes, the easier it will be to remove. Step 4: Loosen the gum - Once the substance is applied, gently work it into the gum and surrounding hair. As the gum starts to lose its stickiness, it should begin to slide off the hair strands more easily. Step 5: Use a fine-tooth comb - Hold the hair above the gum so you don't pull on the roots or further tangle the hair. Then, gently slide a fine-tooth comb through the affected hair, starting close to the gum and working your way down the hair strands. Be patient and avoid using excessive force; doing so may cause further damage to the hair. Step 6: Repeat as needed - If the gum is still not fully removed, repeat the above steps until the gum is completely gone. Depending on how large the gum is or how tangled it is in the hair, this process may take several attempts. Step 7: Wash your hair - Once the gum is removed, you'll want to get rid of any remaining residue. Wash your hair thoroughly using your regular shampoo, and then condition to help detangle and restore the hair's natural softness. Step 8: Dry and style - Gently towel-dry your hair and apply a leave-in conditioner if necessary to prevent and repair any damage caused during the gum removal process. Then, style your hair as usual, being mindful of the previously affected area."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Young William Wallace (James Robinson) witnesses Longshanks' treachery, survives the deaths of his father (Sean Lawlor) and brother (Sandy Nelson), and is taken abroad on a pilgrimage throughout Europe by his paternal Uncle Argyle (Brian Cox), where he is educated. Years later, Longshanks grants his noblemen land and privileges in Scotland, including Prima Nocte. Meanwhile, a grown Wallace (Mel Gibson) returns to Scotland and falls in love with his childhood friend Murron MacClannough (Catherine McCormack), and the two marry in secret. Wallace rescues Murron from being raped by English soldiers, but as she fights off their second attempt, Murron is captured and publicly executed. In retribution, Wallace leads his clan to slaughter the English garrison in his hometown and send the occupying garrison at Lanark back to England. Longshanks orders his son Prince Edward (Peter Hanly) to stop Wallace by any means necessary. Wallace rebels against the English, and as his legend spreads, hundreds of Scots from the surrounding clans join him. Wallace leads his army to victory at Stirling and then destroys the city of York, killing Longshanks' nephew (Richard Leaf) and sending his severed head to the king. Wallace seeks the assistance of Robert the Bruce (Angus Macfadyen), the son of nobleman Robert the Elder (Ian Bannen) and a contender for the Scottish crown. Robert is dominated by his father, who wishes to secure the throne for his son by submitting to the English. Worried by the threat of the rebellion, Longshanks sends his son's wife Isabella of France (Sophie Marceau) to try to negotiate with Wallace. After meeting him in person, Isabella becomes enamored of Wallace.

Fact: as the supply of food in an environment decreases , the population of animals in that environment will decrease Question: Predators which rely on small rodents for food will do what when rodents all die off? What's the answer?","completion":"When the population of small rodents, which are a primary food source for many predators, significantly declines or completely dies off, the predators relying on them will have to adapt to the situation in various ways in order to survive. This adaptation can manifest itself through several potential behavioral and ecological changes. Some of the potential outcomes include: 1. Change in diet: One of the more immediate adaptive responses by predators is to shift their diet to alternative prey, either by choosing other smaller animals such as insects and birds or by switching to larger prey options like rabbits, hares, or even other small predators. This can result in a change in hunting strategies and may lead to alterations in the predator's physical adaptations over time, as they hone new skills and techniques for catching and consuming different prey. 2. Decreased population: If a predator species is unable to adapt its diet sufficiently to compensate for the loss of small rodents, it may experience a decrease in its population, similar to the decline seen in the prey population. This process, termed density-dependent population regulation, occurs due to increased competition for the remaining available resources among the predator population. As weaker or less adaptable individuals struggle more to find food, their survival and reproduction rates decline, translating into a smaller overall population in the related environment. 3. Migration: As food resources dwindle, some predators may choose to leave their original habitat in search of a more abundant food source. This migration can lead to new territories being explored and conquered. However, it can also result in heavy competition within the new territory, as these predators might face direct competition from other predators adapted to that environment. 4. Behavioral changes: Predators that rely on small rodents for food may change their social and hunting behaviors as they search for other viable food sources. For example, solitary predators may be forced to cooperate with other members of their species, forming loose hunting parties to increase their chances of catching larger or more elusive prey. Additionally, nocturnal predators might expand their activity to daylight hours in hopes of increasing the opportunities to acquire food. 5. Evolutionary adaptation: Over an extended period, predator populations may undergo evolutionary adaptations to better suit their new dietary habits or lifestyles. Such adaptations can include physiological changes to improve the predator's ability to process new types of food or physical alterations to enhance their ability to catch and subdue a different variety of prey. These adaptations are significant when considering long-term shifts in predator-prey relationships within an ecosystem. In summary, when small rodents, the primary food source for many predators, decline or die off, predators will need to respond adaptively by changing their diet, enduring population decreases, migrating to more favorable environments, altering their behaviors, or undergoing long-term evolutionary adaptations. The specific response of each predator will depend on factors such as the species' biology, ecological niche, and the availability of alternative prey within the environment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: Who appeared as Jareth in the film Labyrinth? ? Tonight (1984), another dance-oriented album, found Bowie collaborating with Tina Turner and, once again, Iggy Pop. It included a number of cover songs, among them the 1966 Beach Boys hit \\"God Only Knows\\". The album bore the transatlantic Top 10 hit \\"Blue Jean\\", itself the inspiration for a short film that won Bowie a Grammy Award for Best Short Form Music Video, Jazzin' for Blue Jean. Bowie performed at Wembley Stadium in 1985 for Live Aid, a multi-venue benefit concert for Ethiopian famine relief. During the event, the video for a fundraising single was premiered, Bowie's duet with Mick Jagger. \\"Dancing in the Street\\" quickly went to number one on release. The same year, Bowie worked with the Pat Metheny Group to record \\"This Is Not America\\" for the soundtrack of The Falcon and the Snowman. Released as a single, the song became a Top 40 hit in the UK and US.Bowie was given a role in the 1986 film Absolute Beginners. It was poorly received by critics, but Bowie's theme song, also named \\"Absolute Beginners\\", rose to No. 2 in the UK charts. He also appeared as Jareth, the Goblin King, in the 1986 Jim Henson film Labyrinth, for which he wrote five songs. His final solo album of the decade was 1987's Never Let Me Down, where he ditched the light sound of his previous two albums, instead offering harder rock with an industrial/techno dance edge. Peaking at No. 6 in the UK, the album yielded the hits \\"Day-In, Day-Out\\" (his 60th single), \\"Time Will Crawl\\", and \\"Never Let Me Down\\". Bowie later described it as his \\"nadir\\", calling it \\"an awful album\\". Supporting Never Let Me Down, and preceded by nine promotional press shows, the 86-concert Glass Spider Tour commenced on 30 May. Bowie's backing band included Peter Frampton on lead guitar. Contemporary critics maligned the tour as overproduced, saying it pandered to the current stadium rock trends in its special effects and dancing, although years after the tour's conclusion, critics acknowledged that the tour influenced how other artists performed concerts, including...","completion":"David Bowie appeared as Jareth, the Goblin King, in the 1986 Jim Henson film Labyrinth."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Information: - Jesus (; c. 4 BC c. AD 30/33), also referred to as Jesus of Nazareth or Jesus Christ, was a Jewish preacher and religious leader who became the central figure of Christianity. Christians believe him to be the Son of God and the awaited Messiah (Christ) prophesied in the Old Testament. Virtually all modern scholars of antiquity agree that Jesus existed historically, although the quest for the historical Jesus has produced little agreement on the historical reliability of the Gospels and on how closely the biblical Jesus reflects the historical Jesus. Jesus was a Galilean Jew who was baptized by John the Baptist and subsequently began his own ministry, preaching his message orally and often being referred to as \\"rabbi\\". He was arrested and tried by the Jewish authorities, and was crucified by the order of Pontius Pilate, the Roman prefect. Jesus debated fellow Jews on how to best follow God, performed healings, taught in parables and gathered followers. After his death, his followers believed he rose from the dead, and the community they formed eventually became the Christian Church. - The Catholic Church, also known as the Roman Catholic Church, is the largest Christian church, with more than 1.27 billion members worldwide. As one of the oldest religious institutions in the world, it has played a prominent role in the history of Western civilisation. Headed by the Bishop of Rome, known as the pope, its doctrines are summarised in the Nicene Creed. The Catholic Church is notable within Western Christianity for its sacred tradition and seven sacraments. - Branimir ( Latin : Brannimero ) was a ruler of the Duchy of Croatia who reigned as duke ( knez ) from 879 to 892 . His country received papal recognition as a state from Pope John VIII on 7 June 879 . During his reign , Croatia retained its sovereignty from both Frankish and Byzantine rule and became de jure independent . - In ecclesiastical heraldry, papal coats of arms (those of individual popes) and those of the Holy See and Vatican City State include an image of crossed keys to represent the metaphorical keys of the office of Saint Peter, the keys of heaven, or the keys of the kingdom of Heaven, that, according to Roman Catholic teaching, Jesus promised to Saint Peter, empowering him to take binding actions. In the Gospel of Matthew , Jesus says to Peter, \\"I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on Earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on Earth shall be loosed in heaven.\\" The keys of heaven or keys of Saint Peter are seen as a symbol of papal authority: \\"Behold he [Peter] received the keys of the kingdom of heaven, the power of binding and loosing is committed to him, the care of the whole Church and its government is given to him [cura ei totius Ecclesiae et principatus committitur (Epist., lib. V, ep. xx, in P.L., LXXVII, 745)]\\". - The pope (from \\"pappas\\", a child's word for \\"father\\") is the Bishop of Rome and, therefore, the leader of the worldwide Catholic Church. The primacy of the Roman bishop is largely derived from his role as the traditional successor to Saint Peter, to whom Jesus is supposed to have given the keys of Heaven and the powers of \\"binding and loosing\\", naming him as the \\"rock\\" upon which the church would be built. The current pope is Francis, who was elected on 13 March 2013, succeeding Benedict XVI.

He was a ruler of the Duchy of Croatia and reigned as a duke from 879 to 892. During Branimir's reign, Croatia retained its sovereignty from both Frankish and Byzantine rule and became de jure independent. Importantly, his country received papal recognition as a state from Pope John VIII on 7 June 879. This recognition established a connection between Branimir's Croatia and the Catholic Church, solidifying their relationship in terms of religion."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I was stationed on the Isle of Grain – a ghastly place but the first line of defence against invasion – and in our battalion of the Suffolks we had a number of professional musicians. So we formed an orchestra and played in the equivalent of the NAAFI during our spare time. I was the principal cello and we were conducted by the bandmaster, one Lieutenant Bonham. The other boys knew that I was longing to conduct and one day when Bonham fell ill with 'flu, they thought \\"old Barby\\" – as I was known – should have a go. It was really rather romantic – I was scrubbing the floor in the Officers' Mess when they came and invited me to take over. We did the Light Cavalry overture and Coleridge-Taylor's Petite Suite de Concert but I can't say I recall the rest of the programme. While in the army, Barbirolli adopted the anglicised form of his first name for the sake of simplicity: \\"The sergeant-major had great difficulty in reading my name on the roll-call. 'Who is this Guy Vanni?' he used to ask. So I chose John.\\" After demobilisation he reverted to the original form of his name, using it until 1922.On re-entering civilian life, Barbirolli resumed his career as a cellist. His association with Edward Elgar's Cello Concerto began with its première in 1919, when he played as a rank and file member of the London Symphony Orchestra. He was the soloist at another performance of the concerto just over a year later. The Musical Times commented, \\"Signor Giovanni Barbirolli was not entirely equal to the demands of the solo music, but his playing unquestionably gave a considerable amount of pleasure.\\" At the Three Choirs Festival of 1920 he took part in his first Dream of Gerontius, under Elgar's baton, in the LSO cellos. He joined two newly founded string quartets as cellist: the Kutcher Quartet, led by his former fellow student at Trinity, Samuel Kutcher, and the Music Society Quartet (later called the International Quartet) led by André Mangeot.

There are multiple elements and expressions within the sentence that evoke a negative tone or attitude. Firstly, the phrase \\"our culture is headed down the toilet\\" suggests that the speaker believes that the society and its values are deteriorating or on a downward trajectory. This idea is further emphasized by the comparison to a \\"frozen burrito after an all-night tequila bender\\"—an image that brings to mind chaos, disorder, and decay. Secondly, the mention of an \\"all-night tequila bender\\" implies a sense of recklessness and irresponsibility. By associating this with the decline of the culture, the speaker is implying that there is little control or concern for the direction in which society is headed. Lastly, the reference to \\"Jackass: The Movie\\" as evidence to support the speaker's claim suggests that the speaker views the film as emblematic of the undesirable aspects of the contemporary culture. Therefore, by connecting the movie to the decline of society, the speaker displays a negative sentiment towards both the film and the current state of culture.

There are lots of different styles and specialty stores, and some may be more appropriate for you, given what it is you're looking for. You probably shouldn't go looking for sushi-grade salmon at Walmart, and you probably shouldn't expect to find super-cheap saltines at the Natural Food Co-Op. Learn what different places specialize in and shop for different foods at the right place. Chain groceries and box stores like Safeway, Kroger, Sainsbury's, and Woolworth's, Tesco, New World, etc specialize in affordable perishable and nonperishable food. Box stores like Walmart, Meijer, Target, and other chains also have grocery sections that are expansive and usually cheap. These are good places to visit for name-brand goods and find deals. Natural groceries and specialty vendors may be the best place to visit for local produce, fresh vegetables, and raw ingredients, but they tend to be more expensive than chain stores. You're paying for quality. Food cooperatives are common in some places, allowing you to buy in to a partial ownership of the store and decide what should be stocked. If required, check out bulk suppliers - these used to be called Cash and Carry. You may need to buy a membership card, but you could save money if you need to buy food in bulk. Corner stores, convenience stores, dairies and local shops are good places for prepared food, snacks, and alcohol, but not great places to find fresh vegetables or fruits unless you have no other option. Grocery outlets supply overstocked off-brand food that can be purchased for much cheaper than at regular grocery stores. Amelia's and ALDI are common examples of this, offering a somewhat limited variety of fresh and non-perishable foods for much cheaper than at the bigger stores. You don't have the same variety, so it's not the place to go looking for super-specific ingredients, but it's a good place to find staples, like cooking oil, sugar, or vinegar. It's also a good place for things like snack crackers, bread, and other off-brand goods. By far where practical, the best place to find quality produce where you live is to find out about local farmers' markets. Typically held on weekends, farmers' markets combine a festival-like atmosphere with outdoor stalls and extremely fresh produce. Depending on the climate, this might only happen during the harvest season, but some markets go year-round in certain climates. These are excellent places to get fresh fruits, organic vegetables, and local meat raised in a humane way. Markets also give you a chance to see and interact with the people who grow, prepare, and sell your food. It's a lot more personal than buying cookies at the corner store. Markets are also a good place to find out about Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) in your area, if applicable. Many booths may offer CSA packages, which allow you to buy into the farm, essentially paying an up-front or a monthly price for a package of fresh vegetables that you can pick up or have delivered. Like anything, it's also possible to buy certain specialty ingredients online and have it delivered. This can be an excellent choice if you live somewhere very remote and struggle to find access to certain ingredients or fresh supplies in your area. Everything from organic gummy bears to bulk bags of caraway seeds and jasmine rice can be had for decent prices online. Coffee co-ops are very popular online options, letting you buy in and \\"subscribe\\" to a coffee club that will deliver high-quality whole beans directly to your door. If you're a coffee-food eater, it's a no-brainer. Citrus delivery doesn't have to be reserved for Christmas-time. Since citrus can only grow in limited climates, having high-quality oranges, grapefruits, lemons and limes delivered straight to your door is another great option if this happens where you live. Increasingly, stores are charging for the use of plastic or paper bags, making it much more cost-effective to buy one and take it with you when food shopping. It's also cutting down a lot on waste to get rid of those 20 useless plastic bags that come home with you every time you head to the store. Invest in five or six good quality tote-bags and keep them in your car, or near the front door so you'll remember them when you head to the store. o to a restaurant. Sometimes, you just don't feel like cooking. While it's usually more cost-effective to cook meals at home and get more bang for your buck, if you're solo it can be a whole lot easier buy food buy going out for a sandwich than to buy a bunch of ingredients to cook at home. One always-easy way of buying food is to buy it already made at the restaurant. What is a summary?","completion":"In summary, when stocking up on food, it is essential to consider different types of vendors to find the most suitable options based on individual needs. Chain groceries and box stores offer affordable perishable and non-perishable food options, while natural groceries and specialty vendors provide fresh, local produce and raw ingredients but can be more expensive. Food cooperatives allow partial ownership, while bulk suppliers and grocery outlets offer the opportunity to save money on larger or overstocked purchases.

WilPharma soon comes under fire after another T-virus outbreak occurs in India. In 2005, the Harvardville Airport is under attack by a zombie infestation, both from inside the building and an infected airplane that crashes into the terminal. On-site TerraSave agent Claire Redfield coincidentally runs into Senator Ron Davis, who was trying to avoid protesters; they are forced to hide in the VIP lounge with Rani, niece of a TerraSave employee. By nightfall, the airport has been locked down by the local Special Response Team and the United States Marine Corps, aiding evacuated survivors. Officers Angela Miller and Greg Glenn are joined by Leon S. Kennedy. Leon and Miller manage to save Claire's group; however, they are forced to leave Greg, who was infected during the escape.

Answer: A:","completion":"Based on the given review, it is evident that the user holds a high regard for Luis Miguel as a complete artist, showcasing both an exceptional voice and 'charm.' They appreciate his talents and express their genuine admiration for him. However, the user also highlights the dominance of the American English influence, which, according to them, often prevents non-English speaking artists like Luis Miguel from showcasing their skills and growing in the industry. They also mention that many artists are \\"imposed\\" and driven by what is fashionable or trending. While the user does not explicitly state whether they would recommend this product or not, they do express a sense of frustration with the current state of the music industry and its limitations for artists like Luis Miguel. Therefore, it can be inferred that the user wishes more people had the opportunity to appreciate and recognize Luis Miguel's talents and would likely recommend the product to those interested in exploring diverse music and appreciating talented artists outside the dominance of American English influence. It is essential to consider that the user's recommendation could be subjective, favoring Luis Miguel as a great artist but also driven by their desire for more inclusivity of non-English speaking artists within the global music industry.

User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Summarize this article in one sentence. School is filled with distractions, from your friends to sports and parties, and once you get to college no one will call your parents if you skip class. But try to make academics your priority. You won’t be an honors student if you are chronically absent. You cannot excel if you aren't there to learn and discuss the material. Many honors courses have additional requirements, such as class participation or class discussion. If you miss class, you miss out on this part of your grade. A good circle of friends or study partners can hold you accountable. Consider making a deal with your study-buddies to keep each other in class. Schools usually have resources available to help you reach your highest potential. You just have to ask. It should be possible to find a study group, for example, and some schools even have special centers for tutoring in subjects like math. Be aware of what's available. Talk with your teacher if you're having difficulty, or you'd just like to understand a topic more clearly. As long as it's not an hour before the test, most teachers are happy to answer your questions. Join a peer tutoring program if you need more intensive one-on-one help. Peer tutors know their stuff -- you have to do well in a subject in order to become one. They can guide you through assignments and major concepts, build up your base of knowledge, or help you prepare for an upcoming exam. Don't despair if your school doesn't offer these resources. It's always possible to form your own study circle. But be careful if your study circle consists only of close friends. Minimize your distractions and remember to hit those books! You forget 47% of the information you encounter within twenty minutes. You forget 68% in a day.Take good notes for every subject in order to remember what you’ve covered in reading and lectures for later review. Taking notes is an art form. It will take you some time to learn how to listen and read effectively and identify the most important things. Oftentimes school writing centers offer students tips for this. How you take notes – whether by computer or hand – is up to you. Studies suggest that taking notes by hand is better for comprehension and recall, though. Some (but not all) teachers are also fine with students recording them in class. Just make sure to ask for their permission beforehand. Many honor students like using the Cornell method, which involves taking notes during class and then later returning to them to review and condense. This method is great for courses that cover clearly-defined subjects, such as math, science, and history. It is less useful for more abstract courses that focus less on memorization and recall, such as a discussion-heavy literature course. Whether essays, lab reports, or problem sets, assignments will usually make up a big part of your total grade in a course. Missing just one might mean a reduction in your final mark. It might mean more. It can be the difference between a final B+ and an A. There are also reasons to do your homework besides just the grades. Studies have shown that completing your homework is linked to higher achievement and to the development of skills like time management, responsibility, and good study habits. Turn in your assignments early when possible. If your paper is due online at midnight, it's practically a guarantee that there will be a dozen students trying to upload it at 11:59, which could cause system crashes. Do your assignments as soon as possible, and definitely turn them in early when you can. A strong history of turning in your assignments on time also makes teachers more likely to be flexible if you have a genuine emergency. If you've only turned in a third of your homework to start with, though, your teacher is unlikely to be impressed by your excellent excuse for not doing it this time. While it's usually a good thing to study with classmates, there can be a thin line between cooperating and cheating. Your teachers will expect you to hand in your own work. If you aren't clear on what's acceptable, talk with your teacher beforehand. Be especially careful when it comes to homework assignments. Unless it's a group project, it may be inappropriate to do an assignment with others. Never plagiarize. Using another person's answers, or copying words from a book or website into an essay, are forms of plagiarism and academically dishonest. Plagiarism can cause you to fail an assignment or course or even get you expelled. Being an honor student probably means hitting the books more than your peers. Review your lessons and notes at home or before class. Review with friends or alone. Review while on the bus or watching TV. You can also try as much as possible to read ahead, as this will help you to ask reasonable questions and allow you to understand new topics more easily. Try bringing flashcards with you on the bus or public transit. You can review them while you're riding to school, or even while you're standing in line at the store. By reviewing your material in smaller chunks frequently, you're more likely to commit it to long-term memory. Many students seem to believe that they're great multitaskers. However, many studies show that multitasking, or trying to focus on several tasks at the same time, simply doesn't work. You just end up spreading your attention out thinly over several areas, rather than focusing it on one. So put the cell phone away, log off social media, and turn off the TV while you're studying. This works the other way around, too. Even the most dedicated honor student needs time to decompress and relax, or you'll burn out. Schedule in some dedicated \\"me time\\" and keep it faithfully. If you're on a half-hour break, try not to think about homework.","completion":"This article emphasizes the importance of prioritizing academics, attending classes, utilizing available resources and study techniques, completing assignments on time, avoiding plagiarism, and finding a balance between studying and personal time in order to become a successful honor student."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Some Christians believe that the term \\"Christian Church\\" or \\"Church\\" applies only to a specific historic Christian institution (e.g., the Catholic Church, the Eastern Orthodox Church, and Oriental Orthodoxy). The Four Marks of the Church first expressed in the Nicene Creed are unity, holiness, catholicity, and apostolicity. - The Nicene Creed (Greek: or, , Latin: \\"\\") is a Symbol of faith widely used in Christian liturgy. - Liberatus of Carthage ( 6th century ) was an archdeacon and the author of an important history of the Nestorian and Monophysite controversies in the 5th - and 6th - century Christian Church . - A Christian (or ) is a person who follows or adheres to Christianity, an Abrahamic, monotheistic religion based on the life and teachings of Jesus Christ. \\"Christian\\" derives from the Koine Greek word \\"Christós\\" (), a translation of the Biblical Hebrew term \\"mashiach\\".

What is the answer: What are the members of the Unification Church commonly called?","completion":"The members of the Unification Church are commonly called \\"Moonies\\" after the church's founder, Sun Myung Moon. Established in South Korea in 1954, the Unification Church has been the subject of significant controversy due to its teachings, practices, and the impact it has had on some members who have become transnationally involved in cult-like activities. Though the term \\"Moonie\\" is widely recognized and used to describe members of the organization, it has been faced with criticism as some reckon it bears derogatory connotations. The Unification Church promotes a combination of Christianity and traditional Korean beliefs, centering around the Divine Principle, which is its core theology. According to the church's teachings, Sun Myung Moon was appointed by Jesus Christ to continue the fulfillment of Christ's mission of bringing salvation and establishing a perfect world. The movement lays emphasis on the sanctity of marriage and the importance of creating ideal families. \\"Mass weddings,\\" also known as \\"Blessing ceremonies,\\" have become one of the most renowned practices within the Unification Church. These predetermined events involve the mass marriage of hundreds or even thousands of members, often from various backgrounds and nationalities. Many of these arranged marriages are conducted with little to no prior contact between future spouses, marking a departure from conventional courtship and wedding processes. The Unification Church has substantial influence beyond its religious inclinations, stretching into the realms of business, cultural events, and media outlets across the globe. The Washington Times, a US-based conservative newspaper, is one of its most well-known establishments. The organization also boasts a significant presence in Gambia, where agricultural and fishing projects have been initiated. Additionally, the church has been proactive in promoting interfaith dialogue in an attempt to foster unity among different religious groups. During its existence, the Unification Church has faced numerous challenges and controversies, including allegations of brainwashing and abducting its members. Some individuals who have left the movement have reported severe psychological trauma, detailing their difficulty in re-establishing connections to mainstream society. In response to such controversies, the organization has been widely criticized, and some countries have even restricted its activities. Despite its challenges and criticisms, the Unification Church remains an active force in the religious world, with tens of thousands of adherents scattered across various countries. Nevertheless, the term \\"Moonie\\" has persisted as a recognizable descriptor of its members and is an embodiment of the controversies and unique beliefs espoused by the organization."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Let me explain that a person playing Santa is generally a certain age (white beard) and body type (round) that is predisposed to cardiac disease. We did everything we could but ultimately our efforts were futile. The mall Santa rode his sleigh into the great beyond. A mother, there to visit another patient, was insistent that her 7–8 year old son be allowed back to visit his grandmother. We had a strict 12 year old age limit visitation policy. I was called to speak with her. ”Why do you have such a stupid Draconian policy?” She insisted. “The Emergency Room is no place for a child ma’am. Besides, the germs and infections he may be exposed to, there are things he may see or hear that a child would have a hard time processing,” I explained. “Like what?” She argued. “Well, there are people in pain moaning,” I answered. “And drunks cursing at the staff. It’s a tough place.” “He’s fine,” she insisted. “I think I know how to parent. I don’t need you to worry about what my son is able to handle.” I caved in and allowed her back. As we passed the room with the dead Santa, a tech exited and opened the curtain. Her child looked in and saw Santa’s lifeless body, ET tube sticking out of his throat, boots still on but costume cut to shreds and strewn across the room. The child lost it! “Mom, Santa Claus is Dead!” He cried. “I’m not going to get anything for Christmas.” “Why would someone open the curtain?” The mother demanded. “I warned you,” I said. “That’s why we have a 12 years and above visitation policy.” She was not happy. Come to find out the child had his picture made with that very Santa a few days prior. Very ironic. Question: Why was the boy upset?

Help as much as you can. Q:I can use this background: Almost all earthquakes occur at plate boundaries. All types of plate boundaries have earthquakes. Convection within the Earth causes the plates to move. As the plates move, stresses build. When the stresses build too much, the rocks break. The break releases the energy that was stored in the rocks. The sudden release of energy creates an earthquake. During an earthquake the rocks usually move several centimeters or rarely as much as a few meters. Elastic rebound theory describes how earthquakes occur ( Figure below ).

Let me make it simple for you! There are two ways to do this: 1. First, peel the banana and put it on a clean plate or cutting board. Then, using a small knife, carefully cut the banana into thin round slices, just like you're cutting a little circle! Make sure to ask an adult to help you! 2. The second way is to cut the banana in half lengthwise. Imagine having a long banana and cutting it into two long pieces.

Rohingya have been fleeing persecution of the hard-line military regime in Myanmar. Article:","completion":"Title: Rohingya Refugees Abandoned at Sea: A Dire Humanitarian Crisis Unfolds Introduction: In a shocking revelation, CNN has recently uncovered evidence that suggests hundreds of Rohingya refugees were abandoned at sea by the Thai army. These vulnerable individuals, already facing immense challenges as they flee persecution from the hard-line military regime in Myanmar, now face an uncertain fate as they are left adrift on rickety boats. Thai Army's Involvement: According to the information gathered by CNN, photographs have surfaced that clearly show these desperate refugees on board their dilapidated boats, being towed out to sea by the Thai army before being cut loose and left to drift. This disturbing act raises critical questions about the Thai army's role in the ongoing Rohingya crisis and their apparent lack of empathy for the suffering of these vulnerable people. Thailand Government's Response: In response to these alarming revelations, the Thai government has taken the essential step of launching an official inquiry to address and investigate the matter. They aim to hold those responsible accountable and take necessary action against any individuals or factions found guilty of such inhumane actions. The Plight of the Rohingya: Hailing from Myanmar, the Rohingya people have long been victims of persecution at the hands of the nation's hard-line military regime. Violent crackdowns, killings, and forced displacement of the Rohingya have led them to seek refuge in neighboring countries such as Bangladesh, Thailand, and Malaysia. However, the journey to safety is often riddled with hardships and dangers, including exploitation by human traffickers, violence, and now being abandoned at sea. Moving Forward: As the Thai government takes important steps to address the issue of Rohingya refugees being abandoned at sea, it is crucial for the international community to take notice of this humanitarian crisis and come together to provide support for these displaced people. Efforts must be made to ensure their safe passage to countries willing to offer them refuge and protect them from further persecution. The Rohingya people face an uphill battle in their quest for safety, and the apparent actions of the Thai army only serve to exacerbate their plight. It is imperative that the international community, humanitarian organizations, and governments across the globe work together to address the Rohingya crisis and ensure that these vulnerable people can finally find a safe haven, free from fear and persecution."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the last name of the person who joined the kindergarten class at the Froebel Institute at the age of five? Descriptions of Imogen as a small child indicate that she had blue eyes, fair hair, an oval face reminiscent of her father's, and a rather prominent nose inherited from her mother. In 1912, at the age of five, she joined the kindergarten class at the Froebel Institute, and remained at the school for five years. Summers were often spent at the Holsts' rented country cottage at Thaxted in Essex, where Gustav Holst began an annual Whitsun Festival in 1916.In 1917 Imogen began boarding at Eothen, a small, private school for girls in Caterham, where Jane Joseph, Gustav's star pupil from SPGS, taught music. A letter home, dated 17 July 1917, tells of \\"compertishions [sic], and ripping prizes, and strawberries and cream for tea\\". At the school, Imogen studied piano with Eleanor Shuttleworth, violin with André Mangeot (described as \\"topping\\") and theory with Jane Joseph (\\"ripping\\"). Under Joseph's tuition Imogen produced her first compositions—two instrumental pieces and four Christmas carol tunes—which she numbered as Ops. 1, 2, and 3. In the summer term of 1920, she composed and choreographed a \\"Dance of the Nymphs and Shepherds\\", which was performed at the school under her direction on 9 July.Imogen left Eothen in December 1920 hoping to study under Ruby Ginner at the Ginner-Mawer School of Dance and Drama, but was rejected on health grounds, although there appeared to be no significant medical issue. She then studied at home under a governess, while waiting to start at St Paul's Girls School in the autumn. At Whitsun 1921 she took part as a dancer in her father's production of Purcell's semi-opera from 1690, Masque of Dioclesian, held in the St Paul's School grounds and repeated a week later in Hyde Park.In September 1921 Imogen began at St Paul's Girls School, and became a boarder from Spring 1922.

Q: But President Donald J. Trump hardly looked like a grand wizard a week ago today. On January 8 he hosted Alveda King the niece of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.; Isaac Newton Farris Jr. Dr. King’s nephew and Bruce Levell of the National Diversity Coalition for Trump . All three of Trump ’s guests are black. “I did about 200 cataract surgeries with a group of surgeons in Haiti and the same in Central America ” Senator Paul an ophthalmologist said on NBC’s Meet the Press yesterday. “And when we asked Donald J. Trump as a private citizen to support those trips he was a large financial backer of both medical mission trips.” Paul continued: “I think it’s unfair then to sort of all of a sudden paint him ‘Oh well he ’s a racist ’ when I know for a fact that he cares very deeply about the people in Haiti because he helped finance a trip where we were able to get vision back for 200 people in Haiti.” Whatever Trump said or didn’t say the reaction has been beyond incendiary with the words “racist” and “racism” erupting like volcanos around the Pacific Ring of Fire. Trump’s alleged language if uttered was unfortunate vulgar and unpresidential although he hardly would have been the first chief executive to use profanity in office. His supposed words apparently were aimed at sh**hole nations rather than sh**hole people. The latter would have been inexcusable. It is widely understood that certain nations are garden spots and others are not. It is fair to say that Haiti El Salvador and a tragically high number of African countries are non-garden spots. It also is perfectly appropriate to ask whether America would be better off with immigrants from such impoverished and embattled places or from prosperous nations such as Norway which Trump reportedly mentioned. It likely was top of mind given Norwegian prime minister Erna Solberg’s visit and joint press conference with him on Wednesday. Whatever he stated or didn’t President Trump should learn these lessons from this experience and repeat them to himself daily: “Every word I say matters.” This is true in public in private and around the clock until he leaves the White House and begins work on the Donald J. Trump Presidential Library. Trump should think of himself as Jim Carrey in the 1998 film The Truman Show. Except when he is in bed Trump should behave as if every breath he takes were being broadcast live around the globe. Trump needs to remember that Democrats are not his pals. They almost universally crave his failure resist his program and want to yank him from office — never mind the 304 votes he legitimately won in the Electoral College. Anything he says in front of Democrats (and even some Never Trump Republicans alas) can and will be used against him in the court of public opinion. Senator Durbin should be condemned for publicizing (or distorting) his private conversation with Trump thus sabotaging efforts to reach a DACA deal. But this should be no more shocking than if somewhere in Illinois a rooster crowed at dawn. Trump needs to remember that Democrats are not his pals. Ned Ryun of American Majority has an excellent idea: Whenever President Trump meets with Democrats he should summon news cameras and let them stay until Democrats leave. Trump displayed his leadership skills to almost universal applause when he allowed the media to broadcast live for 55 minutes from the Cabinet Room as he negotiated immigration and border security last Tuesday. Doing this regularly when Democrats are around will prevent them from offering journalists an alternative version of events. With cameras present Trump should be on his best behavior. And the American people will benefit from Senate-floor-like transparency inside the White House. This would be unprecedented and gain Trump considerable respect for opening a virtual sunroof atop the West Wing. Trump’s job is to recall at all times with the relentlessness of a bloodhound chasing an escaped Death Row inmate that he must not give free knives and anvils to people who hate his guts and literally would cheer if he woke up dead tomorrow morning . (And the Left need not bother to deny this. Everyone knows this is true as evidenced by the Left’s repeated fantasies about Trump being shot stabbed and decapitated.) These people would call Trump a racist for ordering vanilla ice cream. He should remember this without fail and act accordingly. If Trump becomes blurry about this fact he should remember the very first fake-news story to emerge on his watch. On January 20 during his very first day as president Time magazine’s Zeke Miller reported that Trump removed a bust of Dr. Martin Luther King from the Oval Office. This confirmed that Trump was a racist who couldn’t wait to evict that troublemaking black from his new office. A:","completion":"President Donald J. Trump"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Option 1: They slept soundly after that. Given that the group played with a Ouija board and they might already be on edge or nervous, hearing a strange banging sound might not be easily dismissed. As a result, it seems unlikely that they would just simply sleep soundly after the banging sound. Option 2: They all freaked out naturally. Considering the context of the story, the group has been playing with a Ouija board, which might make them more inclined to believe in supernatural events or at least be more prone to fear. Hearing strange noise would likely evoke such fear or general discomfort, making this option more plausible. Therefore, based on the context of the story and the character's emotional state, Option 2: They all freaked out naturally, is the most likely outcome."},{"prompt":"Instructions: In this task, you are given a conversation between a flight agent and the customer.

She stabs him with a fountain pen he gaver her as a present and runs home to her apartment. Depressed, she contemplates suicide but is interrupted by a phone call from Ake, who wants to meet her. Ake tells her about the wager and apologizes. Though he plans to leave Thailand to study in England, he hopes to maintain their friendship. Buppah informs Ake she is two months' pregnant.

Rage Against the Machine broke up as a result of de la Rocha's departure, but the remaining three members of the band—Tim Commerford, Tom Morello, and Brad Wilk—decided to stay together and announced plans to continue with a new vocalist. Several vocalists jammed with the three, including B-Real of Cypress Hill, but they did not want another rapper or anybody who sounded like de la Rocha. Contrary to popular belief, Layne Staley of Alice in Chains neither auditioned nor was asked to join the new project. Tom Morello denied this claim on his Twitter account in 2015. Music producer and friend Rick Rubin suggested that they play with Chris Cornell, the ex-frontman of Soundgarden. Rubin also persuaded the three of them to go into group therapy with performance coach Phil Towle after the breakup. Rubin was confident that with the right new voice, Rage Against the Machine had the potential to become a better band; he believed \\"it could turn into a Yardbirds-into-Led Zeppelin scenario.\\" Commerford later credited Rubin for being the catalyst that brought Audioslave together. He called him \\"the angel at the crossroads\\" because \\"if it wasn't for him, I wouldn't be here today.\\"The chemistry between Cornell and the other three was immediately apparent; as Morello described: \\"He stepped to the microphone and sang the song and I couldn't believe it.

Darwin distributed presentation copies in France and Germany, hoping that suitable applicants would come forward, as translators were expected to make their own arrangements with a local publisher. He welcomed the distinguished elderly naturalist and geologist Heinrich Georg Bronn, but the German translation published in 1860 imposed Bronn's own ideas, adding controversial themes that Darwin had deliberately omitted. Bronn translated \\"favoured races\\" as \\"perfected races\\", and added essays on issues including the origin of life, as well as a final chapter on religious implications partly inspired by Bronn's adherence to Naturphilosophie. In 1862, Bronn produced a second edition based on the third English edition and Darwin's suggested additions, but then died of a heart attack. Darwin corresponded closely with Julius Victor Carus, who published an improved translation in 1867. Darwin's attempts to find a translator in France fell through, and the translation by Clémence Royer published in 1862 added an introduction praising Darwin's ideas as an alternative to religious revelation and promoting ideas anticipating social Darwinism and eugenics, as well as numerous explanatory notes giving her own answers to doubts that Darwin expressed. Darwin corresponded with Royer about a second edition published in 1866 and a third in 1870, but he had difficulty getting her to remove her notes and was troubled by these editions. He remained unsatisfied until a translation by Edmond Barbier was published in 1876. A Dutch translation by Tiberius Cornelis Winkler was published in 1860. By 1864, additional translations had appeared in Italian and Russian. In Darwin's lifetime, Origin was published in Swedish in 1871, Danish in 1872, Polish in 1873, Hungarian in 1873–1874, Spanish in 1877 and Serbian in 1878.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Dr. Gridlock He was online Tuesday, Jan. 16, at 1 p.m. ET to address all your traffic and transit issues. The Dr. Gridlock column receives hundreds of letters each month from motorists and transit riders throughout the Washington region. They ask questions and make complaints about getting around a region plagued with some of the worst traffic in the nation. The doctor diagnoses problems and tries to bring relief. Dr. Gridlock appears in The Post's Metro section on Sunday and in the Extra section on Thursday. His comments also appear on the Web site's Get There blog. You can send e-mails for the newspaper column to drgridlock@washpost.com or write to Dr. Gridlock at 1150 15th St. NW, Washington, D.C. 20071. Dr. Gridlock: Hello, travelers, let's get to your questions about getting around this region. Metro Web site lies re: Train Times, D.C.: Why doesn't the Metro Web site sync with actual train schedules? I'm often leaving my office at Metro Center late and night, and I hate waiting 15 minutes for a train! So I figured I could look up when the next train was coming and be there to meet it. Except there is no relation to the Metro Web site and actual train schedules! Why??? Dr. Gridlock: I can tell you how it's supposed to work. Here's what Metro says about using its Web site, www.metroopensdoors.com, to get real time information on trains: From the home page, go to the \\"Maps and Stations\\" page and click on \\"Find a Stop/Station.\\" You'll see a list of stations. Click on the on yours. Then click to \\"Next Train Arrival\\" to get the arrival times of the next three trains headed in each direction. What you'll see looks like the electronic display boards on the platforms. The page refreshes every 30 seconds. Arlington, Va.: A big thank you to the Arlington County Police Officer who was pulling over people driving in the breakdown lane on 66-West this morning. This is a chronic problem in the a.m. between Lee Highway and Glebe Road, so it was nice to see someone take some action against it. Dr. Gridlock: It's a frustrating thing to drive I-66, especially at rush periods and especially inside the Beltway, where it's only two lanes. The state is looking at some improvements in the westbound direction that don't involve expanding the right of way. Driving in the breakdown lane is no solution. It's a dangerous thing for those who do it and for other motorists. Fairfax, Va.: This may be more of a Metro question but... Recently the overflow parking lot at the Vienna station closed down. Although Metro offered options of where else to park your car (then take a bus to the station) none are very convenient for me. Several times now I have arrived at the station at around 8, only to find there is no parking (except for all the empty \\"reserved\\" spaces). Metro claims that a new parking deck is being built in 2007, but what do they plan to do about all the new traffic this will cause, and all the back-up this will cause on the trains? Dr. Gridlock: Metro and local governments are planning to add more parking across the region, but construction is not keeping pace with demand. My letter-writers are particularly vexed about the closings of parking areas in some places to make way for construction around Metro stations. Vienna is a case in point. I talked to a group of retired federal workers in the Vienna-Oakton area last week who said they don't even think about taking the train. They like to do their traveling outside of rush hour, and of course, you can't get a parking space at the Vienna Station. Meanwhile, Metro wants to add more reserved parking and overbook it, like airlines overbook seats because they know some people won't show up. I hear from some people frustrated because they've been on the waiting list for reserved parking forever, but I also hear from others who see empty reserved spaces they can't use when everything else is full. Chesapeake Beach, Md.: Why isn't there a bullet train between Baltimore and Washington? Fifteen minutes station to station -- something really revolutionary and modern. Dr. Gridlock: If you go to http://www.bwmaglev.com/, you can read more about the proposal to build a maglev train line between Baltimore and Washington. But the thing is, this would cost about 4 billion to build (and I think the estimate would prove to be low). So what would a one-way ticket cost? Maybe 40? Maybe tourists would use it, or people in a desperate hurry on one particular day. But it's not a solution for commuters. We'd be better off extending Metro's Green Line up that way, building a new light rail line, or enhancing commuter bus service. Can you please let us know the rules regarding bicycles on the escalators when the elevators are down? I am always seeing strollers on the escalators and no one bats an eye... Dr. Gridlock: Here's Metro's rule: \\"Cyclists shall be required to use elevators to access mezzanines and platforms. Escalators and stairs shall not be used except when special requests (for emergency reasons) have been granted by Metro Station Managers, Metro Transit Police, or city/county police or fire officials. Cyclists shall allow other passengers to exit before placing bicycles in or taking bicycles out of the elevators.\\" Metro doesn't want to take a chance on a bike slipping from the riders hands and tumbling down the steps. It's crazy for people to take a chance with a stroller, too. Metro's Web site has a list of stations where the elevators are out of service, so surprises should be rare. Jacksonville, Fla. (but recently D.C.): What do you mean by saying that Porcari \\"knows\\" that Maryland doesn't have enough money to build any new stuff? If they can afford the ICC, why can't they afford other stuff? Dr. Gridlock: What I said on my \\"Get There\\" blog this morning was that incoming Maryland transportation secretary John Porcari Porcari \\"knows that Maryland doesn't have the money or the room to build a lot of big new stuff in the densely populated Washington-Baltimore corridor.\\" I also quoted Porcari saying that his top priority is to make sure that projects under construction or near construction actually get done. That would include the intercounty connector highway, for example. Probably would not include a 4 billion maglev link between Washington and Baltimore. Back on metro after 20 years!: I hope I am not beating a dead horse, but I have noticed some particularly foul odors in Metro stations recently. The odors smell part dead animal, or part burning brakes or some other mechanical piece burning. I notice the smells waiting in stations, but not on trains themselves. Sometimes the smell is enhanced when a train enters the station. Has anyone else noticed or commented on these odors? Dr. Gridlock: If you experienced what a lot of other riders have experienced in the past couple months, Metro says you're smelling the new brake pads. Metro knows the odor is a problem and is working with the manufacturer to fix this. Fairfax, Va.: Can you ask your readers how busy Chain Bridge Road from McLean through Tysons into Vienna is during rush hour? Is it busy throughout the day, or can I get across town better before a certain time in the early morning and early evening? As bad as it may be, is it better than taking the beltway to I66W to get to Vienna instead of Chain Bridge Road? Fairfax, Va.: When the funding finally gets finished for Metro to Tysons/Dulles, do you think we'll finally see movement on rail to Centreville down the median of I-66? Dr. Gridlock: I hope we don't have to wait that long for some way of pushing transit farther out the I-66 corridor. The 4 billion rail to Dulles project won't be finished till 2015, which might be optimistic. Burke, Va.: Why do states constantly think that throwing money at a problem will solve it??? Spending billions of dollars on transportation is NEVER going to solve the source or the problem: That people cannot afford to live where they work. Until the government figures out a way to create affordable housing near work centers, all of the money in the world is not going to solve the traffic problem! Dr. Gridlock: I agree with what you said. More money is not going to solve the problem. But I do believe that all across this region, we've got to spend a lot more money to help solve it. The problem is so big, it requires a big, complex solution. Make our transportation planning and construction problems more rational, more transparent, more efficient. Coordinate transportation planning and land use planning (like you said, more affordable housing near work centers). But if you just plan better for land use, you haven't solved the problem either. We still have to build roads and transit and sidewalks and bike paths to match up with a smarter design for our communities. Arlington, Va.: Is there any information about how the closing of the Arlington Cemetery station this weekend went? I live in Rosslyn and I do know that the shuttle buses were there, but I decided not to bother to head to Pentagon City because of the business of going in and out of the Pentagon Station both ways, although I suppose riding down to L'Enfant Plaza and switching might have worked. Dr. Gridlock: I haven't heard any complaints -- yet -- about the changes Metrorail imposed this weekend because of the major track work around Arlington Cemetery Station. What say you all? This was a fairly large-scale reorganization. Because of the weekend work, the Yellow Line was extended and the Blue Line was diverted away from the Rosslyn tunnel. Capitol Hill, D.C.: The Montgomery County Planning Board recently approved recommendations to build a bikeway along the entire 18 mile ICC. Right now, the state is only going to build along 7.7 miles (non-contiguous). Did Porcari say anything about the bikeway (since he believes that \\"a proper transportation network offers people choices -- drive, ride transit, bike, walk.\\") Dr. Gridlock: Capitol Hill refers to my interview with incoming MD transportation secretary John Porcari. I didn't ask Porcari specifically about the unfunded portion of the ICC bikeway, but I've got to believe that if he can find a way to extend it along the entire route, he'll do that. During the interview, Porcari frequently mentioned his enthusiasm for the region's bike trails and the need to use every opportunity to expand them. He noted with some pride -- because he was involved in the planning -- that the new Wilson Bridge will be accessible to bikers. Chain Bridge into Vienna: Is a mess. Beltway is by far the better option. Or, take the backroads from McLean to Rt 7 and hop on 66 there. Dr. Gridlock: A response to the traveler's question above. Rockville, Md.: \\"Spending billions of dollars on transportation is NEVER going to solve the source or the problem: That people cannot afford to live where they work.\\" How much is this versus choose not to live near where they work? I work in downtown D.C. I have some coworkers who live in West Virginia. It's not cost of living (per se). They want to have acres upon acres on which to play on the weekends. They can't buy that here (since it doesn't exist) but they could (if they wanted) buy a nice house with a decent yard close in but, it wouldn't be what they wanted. Dr. Gridlock: That's the problem with Americans. They're never going to do exactly what you tell them. They're going to decide for themselves what's best for them and their families. I do believe in good planning as a partial solution to our transportation problems, but it's unrealistic to think we're going to eliminate the solo driver and get everyone living in areas dense enough to support transit. What is the absolute latest I could leave the D.C. area to get to NYC relatively hassle-free? Is 1:00 pushing it? Dr. Gridlock: Questions about long-distance travel times always vex me, because there's no way to account for what's going to happen to you between here and there. Will the weather change? Will there be a lane-closing accident on I-95 in Delaware? How long will the backup be at Delaware's toll plaza? Also, when you're making a long-distance trip during daylight, you're likely to wander into somebody else's rush period in the congested Northeast corridor. A Delaware highway official pointed out to me that the stretch of I-95 through his state may seem like long-distance pavement to us in Washington, but it's Main Street for New Castle County. (You think I'm obsessing on Delaware?) Washington, D.C.: Re: trains to BWI. Why build a new train? Why extend Metro? There actually is a train that goes there from D.C. and New Carrollton already. The train is called MARC. Granted, the service is awful unless you are going southbound in the a.m. or northbound in the p.m. Oh, and forget about weekends and holidays. But expanding existing service of trains that go from Metro stops to BWI and Baltimore seems to be a lot cheaper than building new tracks or inventing mag-lev trains. The various governments (I'm lumping all transit authorities, state, city, feds together here) should recognize the existing commuter rail networks such as MARC and VRE as reasonable ways to transport large numbers of people around the area, not just a way to get people into D.C. for work. The model should be more along the lines of Long Island RR or NJ Transit, with frequent service even on the weekends, rather than simply 9-5 commuters. Dr. Gridlock: I think improved weekday service on MARC and VRE should be a very high transportation priority. But it's not going to do everything we need -- at least not soon. MARC has to operate on tracks owned by CSX and Amtrak. There are only so many trains that can run on those lines. At a town hall meeting in Montgomery County last week, Porcari was asked if MARC service could run on weekends. Porcari noted that it would require renegotiation of agreements with the rail owners, plus a significant increase in the operating subsidy for MARC. Better equipment and more reliable service would be a good place to start improving MARC. Alexandria, Va.: Is there a resource online that displays what time the Metro stations with parking become full in the morning? Personally, I am interested in the Virginia stations. Thanks! Dr. Gridlock: There's no source I know of. Definitely not anything official from Metro that would help you on a given day. Maybe readers have some suggestions, though? Reston, Va.: Re:Chain Bridge Road From McLean into and through Tyson's it's \\"not that bad\\", assuming that everything is going smoothly. (No accidents, mistimed lights, random cop on the corner, etc.) But 123 into Vienna (after Old Courthouse) is usually a bear, primarily due to volume of both cars and traffic lights. Dr. Gridlock: That's another response to reader question above on best route. Washington, D.C.: Any idea on what the ICC will be signed as when it's complete? Will it be an extension of I-370 or will it have a number at all? Dr. Gridlock: David Buck, spokesman for the Maryland State Highway Administration, tells me that the intercounty connector will be designated as MD 200. Washington, D.C.: I used to work in McLean. I'd suggest that the reader seeking to go to Vienna consider taking the Toll Road west to Spring Hill, go left after the tollbooth, then right on Westpark Drive (the light at the top of the hill after passing the apartments), and follow that until you hit 123 next to the \\"Toilet Bowl Building.\\" Then go right onto 123. This avoids the mall traffic. In my experience 123 was worst during the evening rush hour but was okay during midday, but that was a few years ago. Dr. Gridlock: Another response to the travel question above. (What I've found is that our readers are an army of researchers and they're very willing to help fellow sufferers on the roads and rails. This is a very powerful force.) Arlington, Va.: re: travel between D.C. and NYC -- I've tried, and there is no way to travel during the day and miss rush hour everywhere. If you are actually going to NYC (vs. the suburbs), you stand a chance if you leave D.C. around 9:30 a.m. If you're passing through D.C. to Long Island or Westchester, you'll hit rush hour on the other side of the city. Really your best best is to wait after the p.m. rush ends in D.C., and the later you leave, the better -- you'd be amazed how much traffic is still on the NJ Turnpike at midnight. I usually wait until 9 p.m. before I head out. Dr. Gridlock: Another example of the research army. This was in response to the question about how late you can leave for New York and still avoid a big hassle. By the way, in doing some columns of holiday travel advice, I came to the conclusion that the time you leave outweighs the importance of the route you take in most cases. If you're traveling in the Northeast corridor of during holiday periods, you'll get more benefit from a very early or very late departure than you will from a \\"shortcut.\\" Delaware: I think you are so right to obsess about the backups in Delaware. They really need to stop considering their stretch of I-95 as part of a local Main Street, and start thinking of it as a piece of a vital commercial corridor that connects the entire eastern seaboard. A corridor that is consistently brought to a crashing halt in Delaware. Why don't they have high speed EZ-Pass lanes, similar to the N.J. turnpike, where you can drive through at 55 mph? That facility added to the Delaware Memorial Bridge and to the absurd little toll plaza they use to extort payment from all travelers would help immeasurably. Dr. Gridlock: And I should ask the Del. folks why they can't go for a one-way toll, like so many other turnpike and bridge authorities do. Must be a revenue reason. Probably something about the ease of getting around that toll plaza near the Maryland border. To earlier post (I-66, police officer..) There is a public workshop concerning the westbound I-66. Washington Lee HS, next Tuesday Jan. 23, 7-8:30. Dr. Gridlock: Thanks, Arlington, and I'll mention that in my Road Watch column as well. That meeting is about several ways the state has come up with to ease westbound travel without expanding the right of way on I-66 inside the Beltway. Washington, D.C.: Dr. Gridlock, I'm sure you've heard these comparisons before. I visited NYC a couple of weeks ago and couldn't help but marvel at how much more efficient the subway system is there. My sister was able to go online and figure out the best way for me to get from the city to Queens so that I could be picked up by my in-laws. Not only did it work, but it was a lot quicker than I expected -- on a Saturday! While the trains are not as luxurious as Metro's, they are relatively clean and seemingly run like clockwork and quite frequently -- for a Saturday. I also noticed there is a flat rate and no turnstiles when exiting the station. When will Metro get with the program? Also, do we trade off more luxurious trains and cleaner stations for trains that don't run frequently on weekends, evenings and holidays? Dr. Gridlock: In terms of transit in the U.S., there's New York and then there's everything else. Though it's a century old, the NYC system has lots of natural advantages. The region is so densely populated it can support an enormous transit system. Also, it was built with express tracks, that not only speed travel but also allow the subway managers to work the trains around problems. Still, our Metro system is one of the finest I've seen in my travels. We all want to see it get better, but that shouldn't blind us to this great resource. By the way, the \\"Trip Planner\\" on Metro's Web site is pretty good at helping you get around the region by transit. I use it a lot. Reston, Va.: Anyone want to do an actual headcount of Delaware tags on 95 IN Delaware? I worked there for several years and most folks avoid it like the combination of the plague and Ebola. Dr. Gridlock: Maybe it's like Yogi said: \\"Nobody goes there anymore. It's too crowded.\\" Around here, we say \\"never again\\" after a bad drive on the Beltway or a crushing experience on the Orange Line. But the next day, we're back in the rut because we haven't found a better way. Tysons Corner, Va.: I have written with this question but have never seen it in your column. I commute to Herndon from Tysons on the Toll Road. Frequently, a Fairfax County bus exits the Dulles Access Road doing 65 or 70, then has to careen over four lanes of traffic in time to get off at its Toll Road exit. I see the same thing the other direction, as buses get onto the Toll Road then swoop to the left to get on the Access Road. This seems like an accident looking for a time to happen. Why are buses allowed to use the Dulles Access Road? And why are they routed so as require such challenging lane changes? Dr. Gridlock: That's not a good maneuver for anybody, let alone a bus. That set up must have been designed for an era with far fewer cars trying to jam through. It is pretty common, though, to give buses access to the fastest possible route. They have access to the carpool lanes, they'll have access to the tolled intercounty connector in Maryland and to the High Occupancy/Toll lanes when they're built from Springfield to American Legion Bridge. Northern Virginia: Dear Dr. Gridlock, Recently I moved to the Ashburn area and commute to Reston. When I travel on Loudoun County Parkway to Waxpool (this is a really big intersection), two things I see every day: 1. People run the red light...not just by a smidgen, but blowing right through it 2. People turning right onto Waxpool from Loudoun County Parkway do so on red from the middle turn lane, even though there is a sign saying \\"No Turn on Red from This Lane\\". But really it's so small that people miss it, or people honk if someone actually stops on red in this lane. Just needed to vent, that is all. Dr. Gridlock: Thought I'd share that vent with the group. \\"Northern Virginia's\\" frustrations are pretty common across the region. Waldorf, Md.: Commuter buses are only as good as the roads they travel. There are plenty of commuter buses coming up to D.C. from Southern Maryland each day, but they sit in the same horrific traffic on 5/301 and into D.C. that I do in my car. I would take the bus if there were dedicated lanes and a consistent schedule. Any talk from Porcari about those types of improvements (or any improvements for that matter) for the fast-growing Southern Maryland region? Dr. Gridlock: First, give the man a chance. He isn't even in Annapolis yet. But I can tell you this: When we were talking about improvements in Maryland's transportation system, Porcari talked specifically about the addition of commuter buses to serve Southern Maryland. We also talked a bit about the need for a Route 301 bypass around Waldorf. I think you've got a guy coming into this job who brings experience from his first round under Gov. Glendening and an awareness of what Maryland travelers are looking for in terms of improvements. Dr. Gridlock: Travelers, I need to head off to a briefing on a transportation project many of you will be interested in. Once again, I've got far more good questions and comments on my screen than I could get to today. I'll make a printout and try to address some of them on the \\"Get There\\" blog or in upcoming Dr. Gridlock columns.","completion":"Dr. Gridlock, an expert on traffic and transit in the Washington region, fielded a variety of questions from readers regarding traffic problems, transportation developments, and personal commute experiences.

Possible answers: wanted to rob the guests, wanted to ensure the party went smoothly, wanted to steal the coats Answer:","completion":"From the given context, it appears that Bailey offered to gather the guests' coats and put them in the coat room primarily to ensure the party went smoothly. However, it is important to consider the various factors at play to better understand Bailey's motives. Firstly, Bailey's actions demonstrate a sense of hospitality and responsibility by taking care of the coats belonging to the party guests. By offering to gather coats, Bailey is making sure that the party attendees can focus their full attention on enjoying themselves without having to worry about the cumbersome task of finding a place to store their outerwear. This act can create a welcoming and friendly atmosphere that contributes to the smooth running of the party. Moreover, Bailey's initiative to keep the coats in the coat room demonstrates organizational skills and an understanding that a clutter-free environment can significantly improve the overall ambiance of the party. By collecting the coats and neatly storing them away in a designated area, Bailey is fostering an environment where guests can easily navigate and feel comfortable in. A well-maintained coat room can also save guests from the headache of searching for their belongings towards the end of the event. Although it is possible that Bailey could have malicious intentions, such as robbing the guests or stealing the coats, these scenarios seem less plausible given the context. It is important to assume the best in people and focus on the potential positive outcomes of their actions. Of course, it would be wise for the party host to keep an eye on the coat room, just as a precautionary measure. In summary, Bailey most likely offered to gather the guests' coats and put them in the coat room to ensure the party went smoothly. This act showcases a desire to create a welcoming and organized environment for the event attendees. While it is possible that Bailey had ulterior motives, it is more appropriate and fair to believe in the goodwill of others until proven otherwise."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

How do you say \\"Carpool with six other people or more 0\\" in Spanish?","completion":"In Spanish, to say \\"Carpool with six other people or more\\" you would say, \\"Compartir coche con seis personas más o más.\\" Let me break it down for you: 1. \\"Compartir\\" means \\"to share\\" in Spanish and is commonly used when referring to carpooling. This verb can be conjugated depending on the subject, but in this context, we are using the infinitive form, so no conjugation is necessary. 2. \\"Coche\\" is the word for \\"car\\" in Spanish. In some regions, you might also hear it as \\"auto\\" or \\"carro.\\" All these terms are generally understood, but \\"coche\\" is more widely used. 3. \\"Con\\" translates to \\"with\\" in Spanish and is used in the same way as it is in English. It shows that you are doing the action together with one or more other individuals. 4. \\"Seis\\" is the Spanish word for the number \\"six.\\" 5. \\"Personas\\" means \\"people\\" in Spanish, and it's important to match the number with the verb to make it clear how many people are being referred to. In this case, it is plural because there are six other individuals. 6. \\"Más\\" means \\"more\\" in Spanish, and using it twice in this context - \\"más o más\\" - emphasizes that there can be six or even more individuals involved in the carpool.

Here is a goal: To increase the gas mileage of your vehicle, Which way makes more sense to accomplish this goal?","completion":"To increase the gas mileage of your vehicle, you can consider several ways. I will list a few and then determine which one makes the most sense. 1. Maintain proper tire pressure: Ensuring that your tires are inflated to the recommended pressure can improve gas mileage by reducing friction between tires and road. 2. Get regular engine tune-ups: Regular maintenance of your vehicle's engine and systems like oil change and filter replacements will keep it running efficiently and improve gas mileage. 3. Drive at a moderate speed: Faster speeds require more fuel to maintain, so driving at a moderate speed will help save gas. 4. Use air conditioning wisely: Air conditioning consumes more fuel, so using it judiciously or rolling down the windows when possible can help save gas. 5. Reduce excess weight: Unnecessary weight in your vehicle can decrease fuel efficiency, so removing excess items can improve gas mileage. 6. Plan trips efficiently: Combining errands into a single trip and navigating the shortest routes can help reduce the amount of fuel consumed. Considering these options, the most sensible way to improve gas mileage would be a combination of steps, with the focus on regular maintenance (engine tune-ups, oil changes, and filter replacements), maintaining proper tire pressure, driving at moderate speeds, and reducing excess weight in the vehicle. While the other steps can also contribute to fuel efficiency, these stand out as the most impactful in general."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Aaron had more friends than Christopher had because","completion":"Aaron had an innate ability to connect with people that Christopher lacked. This made it easier for Aaron to cultivate and maintain friendships. Over the years, Aaron developed a large friend circle, while Christopher had comparatively fewer friends. One of the primary reasons for this disparity was that Aaron was great at empathetic listening. Whenever someone expressed their thoughts and feelings to him, he genuinely listened and understood their perspective. This warm, empathetic demeanor drew people to Aaron and helped solidify strong bonds of friendship. Aaron also had an infectious sense of humor that never failed to brighten up any room he entered. People gravitated towards his exuberance and enjoyed being around him. Christopher, on the other hand, was a bit more reserved in nature. While he had a pleasant demeanor, it was harder for him to initiate conversations and playfully engage with others. This made it challenging for Christopher to connect with new people, as they may have perceived him as somewhat serious and difficult to approach. Another factor that contributed to the difference in the number of friends Aaron and Christopher had was their interests and hobbies. Aaron was passionate about a wide range of activities, from sports to the arts. This allowed him to bond with people from various walks of life and create a diverse friend group. Christopher, on the other hand, had a narrower range of interests, which limited the number of people he could naturally connect with and form friendships. Additionally, Aaron had a strong belief in the value of networking and staying in touch with friends and acquaintances. He made it a point to reach out to people frequently and maintain connections, even if only through casual messaging or occasional meet-ups. This helped ensure that he was constantly nurturing his relationships, allowing them to grow and flourish. Christopher, on the other hand, wasn't as focused on maintaining contact, which sometimes led to friendships fizzling out or dwindling over time. Moreover, Aaron often hosted social events and gatherings, inviting friends and their acquaintances to his home. These events allowed Aaron to meet many new people, providing ample opportunities for forming new friendships. Unlike Aaron, Christopher preferred smaller, more intimate gatherings, which ultimately limited his exposure to new social circles. Lastly, Aaron's openness and willingness to help others endeared him to many people. He was the kind of person who would go out of his way to offer assistance, even if it was for someone he didn't know very well. This trait made others feel comfortable around Aaron and encouraged them to consider him a close friend. Christopher, while caring and kind, was often preoccupied with his own worries, making it more difficult for him to extend himself to others in a similar fashion. In summary, Aaron had more friends than Christopher because of his genuine empathy and ability to connect with others, his engaging personality and sense of humor, diverse interests, dedication to maintaining relationships, proactive approach to socializing, and his thoughtfulness towards others. Christopher's somewhat reserved nature, narrower range of interests, and focus on his own concerns made it more challenging for him to develop and maintain the same number of friendships as Aaron."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This period is generally taken to coincide with a major shift in population from southern Mesopotamia toward the north. Ecologically, the agricultural productivity of the Sumerian lands was being compromised as a result of rising salinity. Soil salinity in this region had been long recognized as a major problem. Poorly drained irrigated soils, in an arid climate with high levels of evaporation, led to the buildup of dissolved salts in the soil, eventually reducing agricultural yields severely. During the Akkadian and Ur III phases, there was a shift from the cultivation of wheat to the more salt-tolerant barley, but this was insufficient, and during the period from 2100 BC to 1700 BC, it is estimated that the population in this area declined by nearly three fifths. This greatly upset the balance of power within the region, weakening the areas where Sumerian was spoken, and comparatively strengthening those where Akkadian was the major language. Henceforth Sumerian would remain only a literary and liturgical language, similar to the position occupied by Latin in medieval Europe.

Answer based on context: The Broncos played the Super Bowl XL champion Pittsburgh Steelers at Heinz Field in Pittsburgh, in a rematch of the 2005 AFC Championship Game. The Broncos got on the scoreboard quick with Jake Plummer throwing a 16-yard touchdown strike to WR Rod Smith on their first drive of the game. On the ensuing kickoff, the Steelers fumbled the ball, with the Broncos recovering deep into Steelers' territory. Plummer then threw a 10-yard pass to WR Javon Walker to make the score 14-0. On the next drive, the Steelers got to the Denver 41-yard line when QB Ben Roethlisberger completed a 35-yard pass to WR Cedrick Wilson, who then fumbled the ball and the Broncos recovered. In the second quarter, the Steelers dominated play outscoring the Broncos 10-0 on the quarter. Roethlisberger threw a 15-yard touchdown pass to RB Willie Parker for his first touchdown pass of the game. The Steelers were about to score on their next possession when Roethlisberger threw an interception near the end zone to CB Champ Bailey. After the Broncos showed no offense in the quarter, and the Steelers missed a 40-yard field goal, the quarter ended with the Steelers' Jeff Reed kicking a 46-yard field goal. In the third quarter, Denver quickly scored with a 72-yard end around run by Javon Walker. On their next drive, the Steelers were driving down the field, when Roethlisberger threw another interception to Champ Bailey near the end zone. Denver was unable to get out of their own end zone after that and punted to the Steelers, who scored on the next drive with a 3-yard touchdown run by Willie Parker. Denver put the game to an end in the fourth quarter with another 10-yard touchdown pass from Plummer to Walker. This came after the Steelers punted from their own 1-yard line and the Broncos began the series on the Steelers' 17-yard line. Both the Steelers and the Broncos scored field goals on their next possessions, the Steelers with a 29-yard field goal and Denver with a 32-yard field goal. Pittsburgh again, down by 11, nearly made it a 4-point game when WR Hines Ward leaped into the end zone, but fumbled from a John Lynch (American football) tackle, whereby the Broncos safety Curome Cox recovered the fumble. On the Steelers next possession, Roethlisberger again threw an interception, this time to Curome Cox, ending the game.

The Latin 'Tabula Rasa' (a term covering various philosophical concepts, e.g., humans minds are 'empty' at birth) translates literally to mean what? What is the answer?","completion":"The Latin term \\"Tabula Rasa\\" translates literally to \\"blank slate\\" or \\"erased tablet\\" in English. This term, which has been adopted by various philosophical concepts and theories, refers to the idea that human beings are born with minds that are essentially \\"empty\\" or devoid of any innate ideas or knowledge. Instead, proponents of this notion argue that all knowledge, beliefs, values, and personality traits are acquired and developed through individual experiences, societal conditioning, and sensory inputs as people grow and interact with their environment. The concept of \\"tabula rasa\\" can be traced back to the work of ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle, who believed that the mind began as a blank sheet that would then be filled with knowledge as a person acquired experiences. Despite its ancient origins, the concept has persisted through the centuries and has been adopted, adapted, and debated by various philosophers and thinkers. John Locke, a 17th-century English philosopher, expanded on the concept of \\"tabula rasa\\" in his influential work \\"An Essay Concerning Human Understanding.\\" According to Locke, human beings are born without any innate ideas or knowledge, and all of our mental content comes from two primary sources: sensation, through which we acquire information about our external environment, and reflection, which involves the processing and interpretation of the information obtained through sensation. The \\"tabula rasa\\" concept has been utilized and challenged by various schools of thought over time. For instance, proponents of empiricism, which emphasizes the role of experience in shaping knowledge, tend to support the idea of the mind as a \\"blank slate.\\" In contrast, those who advocate for the existence of innate ideas, such as the rationalists, argue against \\"tabula rasa\\" and maintain that certain ideas or knowledge are inherent to human beings. In the field of psychology, the \\"tabula rasa\\" notion has influenced the development of behaviorism, which highlights the importance of learning, conditioning, and environmental factors in shaping human behavior. However, advancements in cognitive and neuroscience research have shed light on the complex interplay between genetic predispositions, brain structure, and environmental influences in the development of human cognition and behavior, suggesting the need for a more nuanced perspective that goes beyond the \\"blank slate\\" metaphor. In summary, the Latin term \\"tabula rasa\\" translates literally to \\"blank slate\\" or \\"erased tablet,\\" and it refers to the philosophical concept that humans are born with empty minds that acquire knowledge, beliefs, and traits through experiences and interactions with their environment.

This is to be healthier and to be more environmentally friendly. They don't give up meat completely, but eat good quality meat less often. Founder Brian Kateman believes people will follow diet as it's not radical. 'Eating less meat is easy, healthy and good for the environment', he says. Article:","completion":"Title: Embracing Reducetarianism: A Trail towards Health and Environmental Sustainability The burgeoning Reducetarian Movement is drawing vast attention offering a realistic approach towards a healthier lifestyle and a more sustainable Earth. Reducetarians commit to consciously reduce their consumption of meat, seafood, and dairy products without eliminating these food items entirely. Their mission is anchored in two primary objectives, enhancing individual health and promoting environmental sustainability. Unlike the stringent plant-based diet alternatives, the reducetarian approach allows for a more accessible and feasible transition, which according to its founder Brian Kateman, will attract a larger demographic of followers. Reduce to Enhance: The Health Perspective A well-implemented reducetarian diet can have profound health benefits. By limiting the intake of meat, seafood, and dairy, it helps reduce the exposure to harmful saturated fats and cholesterol found in animal products, which are associated with diseases such as heart disease, stroke, and certain forms of cancer. Additionally, a diet that is high in plant-based foods - such as vegetables, fruits, whole grains, nuts and seeds - promotes a healthier cardiovascular system and supports weight management, reducing risks associated with obesity and diabetes. However, it is crucial to note that reducetarians do not completely exclude meat from their diets. The philosophy is to minimize, not eliminate, underpinning the importance of balance. High-quality meat is still on the menu, but the emphasis is on consuming it less frequently. With this approach, one can still enjoy the benefits of proteins, vitamins, and other essential nutrients found in meat, but with a reduced risk of health complications. Minimize to Sustain: The Environmental Angle Beyond the health implications, the reducetarian movement presents a strong case on the environmental front. The production of animal-based food items—particularly beef, seafood, and dairy—is taxing to the environment, demanding exorbitant amounts of water, land, and energy. It also significantly contributes to greenhouse gas emissions, a leading factor in climate change. By choosing to be a reducetarian, one commits to relieving some of this planetary burden, transitioning toward a more sustainable diet and lifestyle. While going vegan or vegetarian can indeed have a more significant environmental impact, not everyone is ready or willing to make such an extreme dietary commitment. This is where the reducetarian approach comes into play—it's about progress, not perfection. Reducing meat, seafood, and dairy consumption should not be seen as an absolute, but as an accessible goal that anyone can work towards, bringing collective benefits to the planet. As Brian Kateman, the cofounder of the Reducetarian Foundation, aptly puts it, \\"Eating less meat is easy, healthy, and good for the environment.\\" This statement underscores the reducetarian belief that responsible consumption doesn't need to be a radical, inaccessible lifestyle change. It can be as simple as eating less meat and more plant-based foods—a subtle shift with monumental benefits to both personal health and environmental sustainability. In conclusion, the reducetarian movement signifies an important shift in how we conceptualize diet and its broader impacts. It encourages individuals to take manageable steps toward better health and a more sustainable world, making it a viable alternative for those reluctant to completely eliminate animal products from their diets. Reducing rather than eliminating allows the everyday citizen to make a significant difference in their lives and indeed, in the world. As more people become conscious of their dietary choices, reducetarianism might just be the bridge we need towards a more inclusive and sustainable approach to eating."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A:","completion":"A: If food was plentiful, it could potentially have an indirect effect on the amount of mold forming on bread. When there is an abundance of food, people may consume food more quickly, leaving less opportunity for mold to develop on the bread. The rate at which the bread is consumed could outpace the growth of mold, thus leading to less mold formation overall. Additionally, if food is plentiful, proper storage and management practices may be implemented, such as using airtight containers or refrigeration, which can slow or inhibit mold growth. This further reduces the chances for mold to form on the bread. However, the process of mold growth itself will likely not be directly affected by the presence of plentiful food.

Ideally, you should hang the bird feeder in an area that is too high for a cat to jump to. Otherwise, a bird that visits for a meal might be in more danger than your garden ever was. Summary:","completion":"To create an alternative outdoor litter box for cats, follow these steps: 1. Choose a suitable location in your yard, away from your garden and children's play areas. 2. Use a new or old sandbox that is at least as large as a standard litter box. 3. Fill the sandbox with soft, fine-grained sand, which can be purchased from hardware and home supply stores. 4. Monitor the sandbox to ensure cats are using it, and keep it clean by regularly scooping out waste. 5. Educate children not to play in the cat sandbox. 6. To further deter cats from your garden, create a cat-friendly area in your yard by planting cat-attracting non-toxic plants such as catnip, catmint, cat thyme, valerian, and spider-plant. 7. Move any bird feeders to a location far from the garden, and make sure they are placed high enough to prevent cats from jumping to them. By providing an appealing alternative for cats, you can effectively keep them away from your garden while maintaining a comfortable space for them to roam and play in the rest of your yard."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Soviet nukes falling into the hands of rogue states or terrorists has, as far as is known, remained fiction, despite occasional doubts about whether the system was airtight. The vast nuclear arsenal, scattered among several newly independent nations, was secured because Russian military officers acted with professionalism and honesty, Moscow and Washington shared clear priorities, and the U.S. taxpayer coughed up billions of dollars, former top officials who dealt with the Soviet nuclear legacy say. ‘Thousands of scientists participated in this project in OPTIONS: - American and Ukraine, so we know of thousands of people who stayed behind,’ he said. - Associated Press and Ukraine, so we know of thousands of people who stayed behind,’ he said. - Belarus and Ukraine, so we know of thousands of people who stayed behind,’ he said. - Kazakhstan and Ukraine, so we know of thousands of people who stayed behind,’ he said. - Moscow and Ukraine, so we know of thousands of people who stayed behind,’ he said. - Russia and Ukraine, so we know of thousands of people who stayed behind,’ he said. - Russian and Ukraine, so we know of thousands of people who stayed behind,’ he said. - Soviet and Ukraine, so we know of thousands of people who stayed behind,’ he said. - Soviet Union and Ukraine, so we know of thousands of people who stayed behind,’ he said. - U.S. and Ukraine, so we know of thousands of people who stayed behind,’ he said. - Ukraine and Ukraine, so we know of thousands of people who stayed behind,’ he said. - Washington and Ukraine, so we know of thousands of people who stayed behind,’ he said. - former Soviet Union and Ukraine, so we know of thousands of people who stayed behind,’ he said.","completion":"- Kazakhstan and Ukraine, so we know of thousands of people who stayed behind,’ he said."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A:","completion":"A: The concept of someone or something laughing on the dark side of the moon captures the imagination and sparks curiosity. The dark side of the moon, also referred to as the far side of the moon, is the hemisphere that always faces away from Earth due to the moon's synchronous rotation. This mysterious and less explored part of the moon has been featured in various forms of literature, art, and music, often as a symbol of the unknown and the uncharted. When it comes to the question of who laughs on the dark side of the moon, there is no definitive answer, as it is open to interpretation and imagination. However, we can explore various possibilities, ranging from mythology and folklore to popular culture and science fiction. 1. Mythology and Folklore: In many ancient cultures, the moon has been associated with various deities, each possessing their distinct attributes and stories. Lunar deities like the Greek goddess Artemis, the Roman goddess Diana, and the Chinese goddess Chang'e are often linked with the moon's mysterious qualities, possibly enjoying a moment of laughter on its dark side. 2. Popular Culture: Pink Floyd's iconic album \\"The Dark Side of the Moon\\" may come to mind when discussing laughter on the dark side of the moon. This classic record, known for its introspective themes and atmospheric sound, could suggest that creative artists or characters from their songs might find solace in the moon's hidden depths, sharing moments of laughter and introspection. 3. Science Fiction: In the realm of science fiction, various extraterrestrial beings or advanced human civilizations might be imagined to inhabit the dark side of the moon. These beings, concealed from our view, may indulge in moments of joy, happiness, and laughter, adding a layer of intrigue and wonder to the stories that portray them. 4. Robots and AI: As modern space exploration advances, robots and AI, like lunar rovers or future moon bases, could find their way to the dark side of the moon. While these machines may not physically \\"laugh,\\" they could metaphorically represent human ingenuity and exploration, giving us a reason to rejoice in our achievements and advancements despite the vast and unknown territories of the far side of the moon. In summary, the notion of who laughs on the dark side of the moon can be interpreted and contextualized in various ways. It invokes a sense of wonder, prompting us to consider the mysterious, unknown, and unexplored aspects of our universe. The laughter might symbolize the joy of discovery, the feeling of unity in shared experiences, or even the playfulness of our imagination as we venture into the cosmos."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

MooGoo is an Australian natural skincare brand that was first created when the founder adapted a cream used in dairy farms to help a family member with a skin problem. Their products contain lots of natural oils and are not tested on animals – well, apart from the very first of their products that was created for cows! Moogoo Oil Cleansing Method is an all natural cleansing oil that can be used in two ways…. you can use it like a wash-off cleanser by applying a few drops to the face then rinsing it off with warm water, or my favourite method is to massage the oil into the skin then place a warm flannel or muslin over the face to allow the oil to draw any impurities out of the skin, before wiping away the oil. This is a great way of starting off a DIY facial at home! There are four varieties of Oil Cleansing Method, I’ve been using the one for Oily Skin but it’s also available in Normal, Combination and Dry too. The ingredients include ‘drawing oils’ that help to lift dirt and germs off the skin so they can be washed away, plus the Oily one contains Juniper Oil which helps to prevent bacteria on the skin, great for helping keep spots at bay.

Douglas Eric \\"Doug\\" Liman (born July 24, 1965) is an American film director and producer best known for \\"Swingers\\" (1996), \\"Go\\" (1999), \\"The Bourne Identity\\" (2002), \\"Mr. & Mrs. Smith\\" (2005), \\"Jumper\\" (2008), \\"Fair Game\\" (2010), and \\"Edge of Tomorrow\\" (2014). Can we infer the following? Douglas Eric has never watched one of his movies all the way through.","completion":"No, we cannot infer that Douglas Eric \\"Doug\\" Liman has never watched one of his movies all the way through based on the provided information. The information given indicates that he is a well-known film director and producer who has been involved with several high-profile films, but it does not provide specific details about his viewing habits or the processes he follows during editing and post-production. In fact, the role of a director and producer often requires viewing the movie multiple times during the creation and editing process. During pre-production and production, the director is on set, observing each scene as it's filmed. They work closely with the cast and crew to achieve their desired vision for each scene. Then, during post-production, the director collaboratively works with the editor, checking assembled footage, making decisions about the inclusion and arrangement of scenes, sound effects, music integration, and visual effects selection among others. This is an intensive and iterative process, often requiring the director to watch the film, or portions of it, repeatedly to ensure all elements are pieced together in a way that delivers the film as envisaged. Additionally, it is common for directors to watch their final product in full after completion, either privately or at a premiere screening. Thus, it's highly likely that Doug Liman, as a seasoned director and producer, has watched his movies all the way through, though the provided text does not explicitly confirm this. Again, conclusions about someone's actions or habits should only be drawn from concrete information, and in this case, no such detail is provided regarding Liman's viewing habits."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Without intercalation to add days or months to some years, seasons quickly drift in a calendar based solely on twelve lunar months. Lunisolar calendars have a thirteenth month added to some years to make up for the difference between a full year (now known to be about 365.24 days) and a year of just twelve lunar months. The numbers twelve and thirteen came to feature prominently in many cultures, at least partly due to this relationship of months to years. Other early forms of calendars originated in Mesoamerica, particularly in ancient Mayan civilization. These calendars were religiously and astronomically based, with 18 months in a year and 20 days in a month.

User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Eurythmics were a British music duo consisting of members Annie Lennox and David A. Stewart. Stewart and Lennox were both previously in the band The Tourists (originally known as The Catch), who split up in 1980; Eurythmics were formed that year in Wagga Wagga. The duo released their first album, In the Garden, in 1981 to little fanfare, but went on to achieve global success with their second album Sweet Dreams Eurythmics released their next album, Revenge, in 1986. The album continued their move towards a band sound, verging on an AOR-pop/rock sound. Sales continued to be strong in the UK and internationally, but were somewhat slower in the U.S., though \\"Missionary Man\\" reached number 14 on the U.S. Hot 100 chart and went all the way to No. 1 on the US Album Oriented Rock chart (AOR). Revenge would eventually certify double Platinum in the UK and Gold in the U.S. The band went on a massive worldwide tour in support of the album, and a live concert video from the Australian leg of the tour was released. In 1987, Lennox and Stewart released the album Savage. This saw a fairly radical change within the group's sound, being based mainly around programmed samples and drum loops (Lennox would later say that where Revenge was more of a Stewart album in sound, Savage was more of a Lennox one). Lyrically the songs showed an even darker, more obsessive side to Lennox's writing. A video album was also made, directed by Sophie Muller, with a video for each song. This was largely a concept piece, following characters portrayed by Lennox, specifically one of a frustrated housewife-turned-vamp (as exemplified in \\"Beethoven (I Love to Listen To)\\", a UK top 30 hit). The brazen, sexually charged rocker \\"I Need a Man\\" remains a Eurythmics staple, as does \\"You Have Placed a Chill in My Heart\\". Much less commercial than the two previous albums, Savage was mostly ignored in the U.S., although rock radio in more progressive markets supported \\"I Need a Man\\". In the duo's native UK however, the album was a top 10 success and was certified Platinum. In 1989, Eurythmics released the album We Too Are One, which entered the UK album chart at no.1 (their second no.1 album after Touch) and gave the duo four UK Top 30 hit singles. The album was a return to the rock/pop sound of their mid-80s albums and was certified Double Platinum in the UK, but was less successful in the U.S. (although the single \\"Don't Ask Me Why\\" grazed the Billboard Top 40). Other singles from the album included \\"Revival\\", \\"The King and Queen of America\\" and \\"Angel\\". The duo also conducted a world tour for the album in late 1989. Did they have any singles?","completion":"Yes, Eurythmics had several singles.

Here are some concepts: alcohol, effect, sleep What is a sentence about these concepts?","completion":"Alcohol consumption can significantly affect the quality and duration of sleep by altering the normal sleep pattern and causing sleep disruptions. To provide a more detailed answer, it's important to understand the separate concepts first and then explore how they correlate. Alcohol: Alcohol is a psychoactive substance with a depressant effect, produced by the fermentation of sugars by yeasts. It is one of the most widely used recreational substances worldwide and is consumed in various forms, such as beer, wine, and spirits. Moderate to heavy consumption can lead to physical dependence and addiction. Effect: In this context, the effect refers to the impact or alterations caused in the body's processes or functions due to the intake of a substance, in this case, alcohol. Sleep: Sleep is a vital process that allows the body and brain to rest and recover. It's divided into various stages, including REM (Rapid Eye Movement) and non-REM sleep, each of which carries out crucial physiological and psychological functions. Quality and adequate duration of sleep are crucial for overall health and wellbeing. Now, bringing these concepts together, we find that alcohol can significantly affect sleep. Despite its initial sedative effect, alcohol can disrupt the sleep cycle. While it might help you fall asleep faster, it hampers the quality of your sleep. One reason is that alcohol can suppress REM sleep early on in the night, which is when most dreaming occurs and when memories may be consolidated. As the alcohol begins to wear off, often in the second half of the night, there is often a 'rebound' effect where the REM sleep returns but is more intense. This can lead to more vivid and sometimes disturbing dreams. Alcohol also relaxes the muscles in the body, including those in the throat, making you more prone to snoring and sleep apnea. Moreover, it acts as a diuretic, increasing the need to urinate during the night and thereby causing disruptions in sleep. Heavy or chronic use of alcohol can lead to prolonged sleep disruptions and is associated with insomnia. Hence, while many people might resort to alcohol as a sleep aid, it's important to understand that it could compromise the quality and restfulness of sleep in the long run. Instead, maintaining good sleep hygiene, including regular sleep schedules and a conducive sleep environment, can prove more beneficial for sleep health. Additionally, seeking professional help is recommended for those struggling with sleep disorders or alcohol dependency."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Process: - Oil is gathered through mining operations - The oil is transported to stores - Oil is purchased by homeowners - Oil is placed into a stove in the house - The oil is lit on fire, and burns for a long time - The warm air off of the oil travels through the house - Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more coal miners happens, how will it affect LESS heat for the house. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process?","completion":"The process you outlined involves oil being used as a heating source for homes, and you propose a perturbation hypothesis related to an increase in coal miners. Let's analyze the direct and indirect effects this perturbation might have on the heating process for a house that uses oil as the main heat source. 1. Direct effects: The immediate effect of having more coal miners relates to the coal industry rather than the oil industry. The direct influence on the oil-based heating process for a house is insignificant, as the extraction and transport of oil are not dependent on coal mining. 2. Indirect effects: However, various indirect effects can be identified, some of which may have an impact on the overall heating process of a house using oil: a. Increased coal production: With more coal miners, there might be an increase in coal production, which may lead to a more abundant supply of coal. Since coal is also used as a heating source for homes, an abundant supply of coal could result in lower coal prices. b. Market competition: If coal prices decrease as a result of the more abundant supply, this could create increased market competition between coal and other heating sources, including oil. Homeowners might be more inclined to switch to coal-based heating systems if they are cheaper. This shift in demand could potentially affect the oil industry, leading to a decrease in demand for oil. c. Environmental implications: Increased coal mining and utilization have environmental implications, such as increased greenhouse gas emissions, air pollution, and health concerns for people living near coal mines. If this becomes a widespread concern, there might be a push toward more sustainable and cleaner energy solutions for heating homes, such as solar or geothermal systems. In this case, the use of oil as a heating source may decrease, resulting in less heat for houses still using oil. d. Economic impact: The increase in coal mining jobs and potential economic growth associated with a more robust coal industry might lead to changes in the economy. This could affect the cost of oil and other heating options, impacting homeowners' decisions on which heating source to use. In conclusion, while the direct effect of having more coal miners on the oil-based heating process in a house is negligible, there may be several indirect effects which could impact the overall house-heating process using oil. These indirect effects are primarily related to market competition between heating sources, environmental implications, and economic factors. However, the extent to which these indirect effects would result in less heat for a house using oil would depend on a range of factors, including regional availability of coal, pricing, regional and global policies, technological advances, and individual homeowners' preferences. Without more specific information, it is difficult to predict how the proposed perturbation would quantitatively affect the heating process for houses using oil."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Even when he graduated from North Decatur High School in 1975, sitting on the bench someday seemed more like a leisurely activity than a career. Somewhere along the line, all of that changed. Bailey received his bachelor's degree from the University of Indianapolis in 1978 and a jurisprudence doctorate from Indiana University-Indianapolis in 1982. After several years of private practice from 1982-90, he became the judge of Decatur County Court for a year. The Indiana legislature renamed that judgeship and Bailey was tabbed Decatur Superior Court judge from 1992-98, winning reelection twice. From there, his career continued on the fast track and Bailey was appointed by Gov. Frank O'Bannon to sit on the Indiana Court of Appeals First District, where he works today. Despite his quick climb up the legal ladder, Bailey has always found time to help out in causes he feels strongly about. It was for his dedication to the law and the people that are affected by it that he was recently recognized. The Indiana Pro Bono Commission hosted its annual celebration event, the Randall T. Shepard Dinner, at French Lick Springs Spa in October. More than 100 judges, lawyers and dignitaries were present for the gathering. One of the highlights of the event was the presentation of the first-ever Randall T. Shepard award for excellence in pro bono work. Bailey received the award for his three years of volunteer work at Indiana Pro Bono Commission.

For most couples, a romantic proposal involves Champagne, roses, chocolates or something equally indulgent, but this daredevil climber popped the question 2,500ft in the air. Richard Crabtree asked Angela Jones, 45, to marry him while hanging precariously off the edge of a cliff-face - just moments after they scaled Napes Needle in the Lake District. Luckily, she said yes. The 40-year-old climber, from Colne, Lancashire, surprised his bride-to-be on their first climb of the iconic rock pinnacle, having the ring tucked away in his bag throughout the hour-long walk to the base of the climb, near the top of Great Gable mountain. The moment she said 'Yes!': The couple whooping for joy 2,500ft high after Richard's proposal (left) and sharing a romantic kiss at the peak (right) Angela, who met Richard on a walking trip to the beauty spot eight years ago, said it was an 'amazing feeling' adding : 'We’d never climbed Napes Needle before but we are both preparing. to climb Mount Blanc this summer so we thought it would be good. training.

While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Species go extinct constantly as environments change, as organisms compete for environmental niches, and as genetic mutation leads to the rise of new species from older ones. Occasionally biodiversity on Earth takes a hit in the form of a mass extinction in which the extinction rate is much higher than usual. A large extinction-event often represents an accumulation of smaller extinction- events that take place in a relatively brief period of time.The first known mass extinction in earth's history was the Great Oxygenation Event 2.4 billion years ago. That event led to the loss of most of the planet's obligate anaerobes. Researchers have identified five major extinction events in earth's history since: John was studying the history of dinosaurs. He found that dinosaurs were flourishing before 66 million years ago. He labeled it as era A. Then he found that there was a mass extinction around 66 million years ago. He labeled that time period as era B. John found it interesting that many species have evolved in the course of history. Which era would more likely be shorter, era A or era B?","completion":"To determine which era is more likely to be shorter, we need to look at the characteristics of both eras. Era A: The time when dinosaurs were flourishing before the mass extinction event 66 million years ago. This era represents a span of time when dinosaurs were evolving and thriving in their respective environments. As a whole, the Mesozoic Era, which includes the time when dinosaurs flourished, lasted approximately 180 million years. Era B: The mass extinction event that occurred around 66 million years ago, also known as the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event. This event led to a significant loss of species on Earth, including the extinction of non-avian dinosaurs. The event itself was caused by multiple factors, such as volcanic activity and the impact of a large asteroid. Extinction events, even mass extinctions, occur relatively quickly compared to the vast time scales of pre-extinction and post-extinction eras. Given the nature of extinction events and the time it takes for species to evolve and flourish, Era B (the mass extinction event) is more likely to be shorter than Era A (the time when dinosaurs were flourishing). This is because extinction events typically represent a brief period of time when compared to the longer timescales of species evolution and adaptation in different eras throughout Earth's history."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Is \\"The genome includes both the genes and the non-coding sequences of the DNA/RNA.\\" the correct answer?","completion":"The definition you provided, \\"The genome includes both the genes and the non-coding sequences of the DNA/RNA,\\" is correct. However, this does not answer the original question about the fields of science in which the genome is studied. Here is a more detailed and long answer addressing the question: A genome is the complete set of genetic information encoded in an organism's DNA or RNA. The study of genomes is essential for understanding various biological processes and functions, and numerous scientific fields contribute to research in genomics. Some of these fields include: 1. Genetics: This is the fundamental field that studies genes, genetic variation, and heredity in organisms. The study of genomes within genetics delves into understanding inheritance patterns, identifying gene functions, and discovering how mutations can lead to genetic diseases. 2. Molecular Biology: This field investigates the molecular interactions and processes within a cell, focusing on the roles of DNA, RNA, and proteins. Studying genomes in molecular biology helps unravel the mechanisms of gene expression and regulation, as well as understanding how different molecules interact with genetic material. 3. Biochemistry: The study of biochemical processes within living organisms is crucial in understanding gene function. Researchers investigate how genes code for the synthesis and degradation of biomolecules, their interactions, and how these influence cellular processes and pathways. 4. Bioinformatics: This interdisciplinary field combines computer science, biology, and mathematics to analyze and interpret large-scale biological data sets, such as genome sequences. Bioinformaticians develop algorithms and software tools to study relationships between genes, proteins, and regulatory elements, facilitating the understanding of gene function, evolution, and disease mechanisms. 5. Evolutionary Biology: The study of genomes in this context allows scientists to examine the genetic differences among species throughout evolution. Comparing genomes can reveal evolutionary relationships between organisms, the conservation of essential genes, and the emergence of new genes that may contribute to the unique characteristics of a species. 6. Genomic Medicine: In this field, researchers investigate the genetic basis of diseases and develop therapeutic strategies targeting specific genetic components. Whole-genome sequencing and functional genomics studies have identified genes and genomic elements associated with various disorders, leading to personalized medicine and gene therapy approaches in the clinic. 7. Environmental Genomics: This branch of genomics explores how organisms interact with their environments on a genetic level. Environmental genomics examines gene-environment interactions, identifies genes responsible for adaptation to specific habitats, and studies the role of genomes in shaping ecological processes. These fields, along with many others, contribute to the comprehensive understanding of genomes, elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying various biological processes and advancing the knowledge and applications in medicine, agriculture, and environmental science."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Photo: Sonoma County Sheriff's Office Photo: Sonoma County Sheriff's Office Image 1 of / 15 Caption Close Sonoma County survivalist charged with mysterious killings on Jenner beach 1 / 15 Back to Gallery A Sonoma County survivalist who has long been known for strange and violent behavior, and who already stands accused of gunning down his brother, has been charged with murdering a young engaged couple in August 2004 as they lay in sleeping bags on a beach in Jenner. Shaun Michael Gallon, the lead suspect in the Jenner case for the past year, faces two counts of murder in the gunshot killings of Lindsay Cutshall, 22, of Fresno, Ohio, and her 26-year-old fiance, Jason Allen of Zeeland, Mich. Gallon, 39, is eligible for the death penalty or life in prison without the possibility of parole if convicted, but Sonoma County prosecutors have not said whether they will seek execution. Prosecutors also charged Gallon with attempted murder in a separate package bomb case in Monte Rio in 2004. Sonoma County Chief Deputy District Attorney Spencer Brady said Gallon was never ruled out as a suspect in the cold-case murders. “After he was in custody for the death of his brother, the Sheriff’s Department developed new evidence that linked him to the 2004 murders of Jason and Lindsay,” Brady said. He added that prosecutors wouldn’t elaborate on the new evidence entailed until Gallon’s preliminary hearing. Now Playing: The Sonoma County public defender’s office, which is representing Gallon, could not immediately be reached for comment Wednesday. The charges, filed last week, are a major step in a long-running cold case. Sonoma County sheriff’s investigators spent more than a dozen years pursuing the beach gunman, searching for suspects across the country while looking at gun records and eyeing serial killers. Gallon was long considered a “person of interest” in the slayings, but the break in the case did not come until March 24, 2017, when Gallon allegedly killed his younger brother in Forestville, shooting him several times. Investigators said Gallon, after being arrested, told police enough to tie him to the killings of Cutshall and Allen. But prosecutors held off on filing charges as detectives continued to dig into the case. The allegations say Gallon, who was 25 at the time, shot the pair with a .45-caliber Marlin rifle at close range as they slept on secluded Fish Head Beach near the mouth of the Russian River. The couple had been working that summer at a Christian youth camp along the American River in El Dorado County and had gone on a three-day sightseeing trip up the coast that would have taken them through Forestville. Investigators said Cutshall and Allen didn’t know Gallon, though it’s unclear whether they might have had an interaction with him before their deaths. The biggest cold cases in the Bay Area The biggest cold cases in the Bay Area Photo: Michael Macor Photo: Michael Macor Image 1 of / 13 Caption Close The biggest cold cases in the Bay Area 1 / 13 Back to Gallery A motive has been elusive in the beach killings, as in the shooting of Gallon’s brother. On that day, the mother of the two men called for help, saying 36-year-old Shamus Gallon had been shot with a rifle at the home where the family lived on the 9800 block of River Road. The family had moved to the home from Guerneville after the brothers’ father killed himself in 2013. The mother reported that Shaun Gallon had left the house with the rifle and driven away in his minivan, officials said. He was swiftly apprehended and charged with murder. It wasn’t Gallon’s first brush with the law. He was convicted of assault with a deadly weapon for shooting an arrow at a man in Guerneville, just west of Forestville, on Jan. 27, 2009. Gallon, described by investigators in that case as a survivalist, served a three-year sentence — spending some of his time at San Quentin State Prison — after wounding James McNeil of Monte Rio, who was sitting in a parked convertible on Mill Street when an arrow came through the soft top of the car and grazed his head. Gallon had convictions in his 20s for resisting arrest, weapons possession, theft, drunken driving and hunting abalone without proper paperwork, records show. The new attempted-murder charges stem from a package bomb that exploded on June 10, 2004, when 27-year-old Parvoneh Leval picked up a box left on her boyfriend John Robles’ car. Leval was treated for severe cuts and bruises on her hand and arm. Cutshall and Allen were killed sometime after nightfall on Aug. 14, 2004, and before sunrise Aug. 16, officials said. Their bodies were found in their sleeping bags Aug. 18. Both were shot in the head. Cutshall and Allen were killed just weeks before they were to return to the Midwest to get married. Detectives on the case pursued a number of possible motives in the killings — from sexual assault to murder-suicide, all of which were ruled out.

Gallon, 39, has been held in Sonoma County Jail since he was arrested in March 2017 in the slaying of his younger brother in their family home. His detention led to jailhouse interviews with investigators in the Jenner case, according to the Sonoma County Sheriff’s Office, and just weeks later, in May 2017, then-Sheriff Steve Frietas identified Gallon as the gunman who killed Lindsay Cutshall, 22, and her fiance, Jason Allen, 26, as they lay in sleeping bags at secluded Fish Head Beach. Gallon, who was known in the Russian River area where he grew up for strange behavior and run-ins with law enforcement, was interviewed by sheriff’s officials at the time but never detained in connection with the case. Sheriff Rob Giordano said the Jenner killings were “horrific” for the Cutshall and Allen families and for Sonoma County — a cold case that defined careers for many of the hundreds of Sheriff’s Office personnel involved in the search for the gunman. “Unfortunately, there are evil people in our community, not many, but he is one of those people,” Giordano said. “I’m just really glad he’s off the street now.” On Friday, prosecutors filed documents in Sonoma County Superior Court charging Gallon with killing Cutshall and Allen. He was arraigned on those charges Monday morning in a brief court hearing. Prosecutors also charged him with one count of attempted murder in a separate case dating to 2004, when he is alleged to have left on top of a car a package bomb that exploded, injuring a Monte Rio woman. He did not enter a plea. Sonoma County Chief Deputy District Attorney Brian Staebell said prosecutors received an essential set of reports from the Sheriff’s Office on May 1, including documents from 13 years of investigative work, and after reviewing the files they were able to charge Gallon with the killings. “It was a very thorough investigation,” Staebell said. Prosecutors, led by Chief Deputy District Attorney Spencer Brady, are still reviewing whether to seek the death penalty in connection with the double murder. Details in a spate of criminal cases against Gallon dating to 2004 cast him as a darkly troubled man, a self-taught survivalist and weapons fanatic who in 2009 shot a man with a hand-fashioned bow and arrow. In addition to the bombing, Gallon now stands accused of shooting to death three people, including his brother, Shamus Gallon, in their family home in Forestville last year, and Cutshall and Allen on the Jenner beach 14 years ago. His suspected motives remain unknown. “There is no question that he suffers from mental illness,” Sonoma County Public Defender Kathleen Pozzi said. Pozzi said she’s still not convinced Gallon was involved in the Jenner killings, and she may file a motion requesting the two murder cases and attempted homicide case be handled separately because they are unrelated. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","completion":"Shaun Michael Gallon, a 38-year-old survivalist from Sonoma County, has been charged with the 2004 double murder of a young engaged couple, Lindsay Cutshall and Jason Allen, who were found dead in their sleeping bags on a beach in Jenner, California.

Here is an article: With the government shutdown and debt ceiling debate in the rear view mirror, GOP lawmakers are retraining their focus on Obamacare and once again calling for changes to the law. President Obama's Monday speech addressing the law's problematic rollout -- and a coming tech surge to improve the website -- gave them exactly the forum they needed. \\"The taxpayers have already shelled out hundreds of millions of dollars to build the original website. How much more money is President Obama going to demand? Instead of continuing to pour money into this broken law, it's time to issue a permanent delay and work on solutions that provide real health care reform, rather than broken promises and error messages,\\" said Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, the number two Senate Republican. Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, the ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee, called the rollout a \\"400-plus million mistake\\" and an \\"embarrassment,\\" and seconded Cornyn's calls for a permanent delay. Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., said the president's speech should have addressed \\"the substantive, real-life consequences of his signature law.\\" Mr. Obama actually defended the law's \\"essence\\" as \\"working just fine,\\" even if the website fell short of expectations. Several Republicans drew attention to the problem of insurance companies cancelling existing plans, bolstered by a Kaiser Health News article published Monday that said insurers had sent hundreds of thousands of letters to people who buy their own coverage informing them that their plans had been cancelled, mainly because they failed to meet the law's requirements that will kick in on Jan. 1. \\"If and when the technical glitches get fixed, Americans will unfortunately still face the bleak reality of this train wreck--problems no IT specialist can fix,\\" Thune said. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., issued an ominous warning to consumers who use the exchanges to keep a record of every error they encounter on HealthCare.gov \\"in order to protect themselves from potential fraud, double billing, and penalties once the mandate is enforced.\\" \\"Make no mistake: The IRS will go after anyone who fails to meet the Obamcare requirements, so it's important that consumers document the online problems,\\" Rubio said. In fact, the Affordable Care Act limitsthe IRS' ability to collect the mandated fine if a taxpayer chooses not to purchase insurance. \\"In the case of any failure by a taxpayer to timely pay any penalty imposed by [the mandate], such taxpayer shall not be subject to any criminal prosecution or penalty with respect to such failure,\\" the law says. That includes curtailing the IRS' power to seize property. Republicans have launched several lines of investigation into the law. At least three House committees are expected to launch inquiries into the law's weaknesses, including a House Energy and Commerce Committee scheduled for Thursday entitled, \\"Implementation Failures: Didn't Know or Didn't Disclose?\\" Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, and Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., the top Republican on the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee, sent a letter earlier this month to Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius last month asking about the alleged architectural problems with HealthCare.gov. House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, echoed Republican demands that Sebelius testify before Congress as early as this week. \\"Americans didn't get any answers from the president today, but the House's oversight of this failure is just beginning,\\" Boehner said. \\"With more than one trillion taxpayer dollars being spent on a completely defective program, Congress is going to get to the bottom of this debacle.\\" HHS spokeswoman Joanne Peters told CBS News that Sebelius and other HHS officials could testify before Congress as early as next week, though nothing is confirmed at this time -- and it won't be in time for the Thursday hearing. \\"We are in close communication with the committee and have expressed our desire to be responsive to their request,\\" Peters said. \\"We have always indicated to the committee that she intended to testify but that she had a scheduling conflict. We continue to work with them to find a mutually agreeable date in the near future.\\" Yet there still seems to be little unity among the GOP on what to do about the law going forward: Call for a full repeal, which is unrealistic given the Democratic majority in the Senate? Push for a delay of the heart of the law, the individual mandate that Americans purchase health insurance or pay a fine? Or simply wait for the law's problems to spur a wave of negative press and public opinion? Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, who helped spark the strategy to shut down the government over the law's funding, is still calling for the law to be defunded and repealed. On ABC's \\"This Week\\" Sunday, he would not rule out the possibility of another government shutdown, saying he will \\"do anything I can to stop the train wreck that is Obamacare.\\" Others have said the persistent and narrow focus on the Affordable Care Act takes too much oxygen away from other Republican priorities, like cutting spending and the size of government. \\"I think focusing on Obamacare takes you away from the larger picture,\\" said Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., on NBC's Meet the Press. \\"We have 128 trillion worth of unfunded liabilities and the total net worth of our country is 94 trillion and we have another 17 trillion worth of debt.\\" Moreover, the health care law might fail without Republicans going to great lengths to help it along, Coburn argued. \\"Obamacare is going to fail on its own right,\\" he said. \\"The sick people are signing up, the healthy aren't. And they're not going to because the deductibles are so high and the cost is going to be high.\\" Another prominent Republican, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, urged Republicans like Cruz to \\"have a little bit of self-restraint\\" when it comes to Obamacare, and let the law's rocky implementation speak for itself. \\"It might actually be a politically better approach to see the massive dysfunction. But we don't even hear about that because we've stepped on that message. And I think Republicans need to just take a step back and...show a little self-restraint and let this happen a little more organically,\\" Bush said. He also criticized said his party needs to present an alternative, which they haven't done. Cruz called the people advancing the let-it-fail strategy \\"Republican gray beards.\\" \\"I profoundly disagree with the message. I want to step on their message,\\" Cruz said. \\"I consider that theory the 'Bad Samaritan' theory. Basically inflict a bunch of harm on the American people and hope we benefit politically from it. What a terrible, cynical approach. I'm not interested in seeing the American people suffer just because my party might benefit politically if they blame the Democrats for the foolish policies that have been imposed,\\" he said. © 2013 CBS Interactive Inc.

Step 1: Self-reflection Reflect on your feelings and reasons for not being able to reciprocate her love. Make sure your decision to leave her is based on well-reasoned thoughts and not temporary emotions. Step 2: Show empathy Remind yourself that you care about her feelings and want to minimize any pain that she may experience due to your decision. Try to put yourself in her shoes and imagine what could be the best way to approach the situation. Step 3: Choose the right setting Find an appropriate and comfortable place to have the conversation in person. It is important for this interaction to be private, so neither of you feel uncomfortable or embarrassed. Step 4: Be honest but gentle Explain to her that, despite her love and kindness, you do not feel the same way towards her. Be honest about your feelings but use gentle and compassionate language. Avoid going into detail about the specific reasons, as this can be hurtful. Step 5: Focus on your feelings and not her actions As you discuss your decision, emphasize that it is based on your feelings and emotions, not her actions or personality traits. This will help avoid placing blame on her and reduce the chances of having her feelings hurt. Step 6: Be supportive and understanding Acknowledging her emotions and being supportive can help her process the situation. Listen to what she has to say and validate her feelings, even if they are negative or sad. Step 7: Maintain respect and dignity Throughout the conversation, it's crucial to treat her with respect and dignity. Avoid using harsh language or expressing contempt. Step 8: Offer friendship If you believe it is possible and desirable, offer to continue the relationship as friends, but be aware that it may take time for her feelings to adjust. Ensure that you genuinely want to remain friends and are not suggesting it simply to ease your conscience. Step 9: Give her space After the conversation, allow her some space and offer her the opportunity to process her emotions and come to terms with the situation. Do not push for immediate closure or expect her to understand right away. By following these steps, you can minimize the hurt she might feel during the breakup and show her the respect and consideration she deserves. Keep in mind that pain and discomfort might still arise during such conversations, but the goal is to approach the situation with empathy and respect."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Born in Drouin to Alfred and Colleen Ablett, Gary Ablett grew up in the Latrobe Valley in Victoria's Gippsland region alongside his four elder brothers and three sisters. Ablett displayed a love for sport at an early age, winning the state school high jump at 10 years of age. He was also awarded both club and competition best and fairest awards for Drouin at the under-11s, under-12s and under-14s levels. After citing waning interest in school, Ablett dropped out of high school at the age of 15 years to become a bricklayer's labourer. Ablett combined strength, speed, and skill to produce many spectacular highlights and goal-kicking feats. A noted big game player, Ablett kicked 43 goals in 11 State appearances. More significantly, he booted 64 goals over the course of his 16 finals - an average of four goals a game. His haul of 27 goals in the 1989 finals series is a record that still stands. He was awarded the Norm Smith Medal for his performance in the 1989 Grand Final, where he was adjudged best player afield. In doing so, he became one of only four players (the others being Maurice Rioli -1982, Nathan Buckley -2002, and Chris Judd -2005) to win the medal playing for the losing side. In 1996, Ablett joined Gordon Coventry, Doug Wade, Jason Dunstall and Tony Lockett as the only players in league history to kick 1000 VFL/AFL goals. Martin Flanagan's representation of Australian football pioneer Tom Wills in his 1996 novel The Call is modeled on Ablett. According to Flanagan, Wills and Ablett polarised opinion in similar ways, and displayed a lack of insight into their actions--they simply did what came naturally to them, \\"like a lot of artists\\". Ablett is the subject of the song \\"Kicking the Footy with God\\", released by The Bedroom Philosopher on his 2005 debut album In Bed with My Doona. In 1996, Ablett was named in the AFL Team of the Century on the interchange bench, alongside Jack Dyer and Greg Williams. In 2001, Ablett was named in the Geelong Team of the Century, on a half forward flank. In 2005, after many years of controversy and debate (see below), he was inducted into the Australian Football Hall of Fame. The following year, he was honoured yet again when he was voted as the Greatest Geelong player of all-time ahead of Graham Farmer. In 2006, Ablett was honoured with the naming of a terrace in his name within the newly renovated Skilled Stadium. Ablett once had a set of gates named in his honour, but he was upgraded to a terrace at the beginning of the 2006 AFL season.

Given the question: Information: - Paul Dupuy , History Lecturer at the Ecole Normale , published in 1896 the first scientific biography of the mathematician Évariste Galois , titled \`\` La vie d'Évariste Galois '' . - Évariste Galois (25 October 1811 31 May 1832) was a French mathematician born in Bourg-la-Reine. While still in his teens, he was able to determine a necessary and sufficient condition for a polynomial to be solvable by radicals, thereby solving a problem standing for 350 years. His work laid the foundations for Galois theory and group theory, two major branches of abstract algebra, and the subfield of Galois connections. He died at age 20 from wounds suffered in a duel. - A mathematician is someone who uses an extensive knowledge of mathematics in his/her work, typically to solve mathematical problems. - Mathematics (from Greek \\"máthma\\", knowledge, study, learning) is the study of topics such as quantity (numbers), structure, space, and change. There is a range of views among mathematicians and philosophers as to the exact scope and definition of mathematics. - In mathematics, especially in order theory, a Galois connection is a particular correspondence (typically) between two partially ordered sets (posets). The same notion can also be defined on preordered sets or classes; this article presents the common case of posets. Galois connections generalize the correspondence between subgroups and subfields investigated in Galois theory (named after the French mathematician Évariste Galois).

Even those CAPA bishops who are here , they said , \\" share their concerns and feelings \\" . What church seems to be having recent issues ?","completion":"The church that appears to be having recent issues is the Anglican Communion. The Anglican Communion is an international association of churches consisting of the Church of England and its various offshoots around the world, including the Episcopal Church in the United States, the Anglican Church of Canada, and several churches in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. This global family of churches is united by shared traditions and beliefs, as well as a common historical heritage originating from the Church of England. However, in recent years, the Anglican Communion has faced significant challenges and internal divisions, particularly surrounding issues such as the ordination of women, the acceptance of homosexuality, and the interpretation of Scripture. These disagreements have led to strained relationships and the absence of some church leaders at international gatherings and conferences. The statement from the bishops \\"present from the CAPA (Council of Anglican Provinces of Africa) family\\" suggests that there is ongoing concern and unrest within the Anglican Communion, with some bishops feeling a deep sense of anguish and frustration over the current state of the Communion. This is particularly evident in the mention of the absence of some colleagues, who are possibly boycotting these events as a way to express their dissatisfaction with the direction the Anglican Communion is taking. The CAPA bishops also express regret over wasted opportunities, which could have led to healing and reunification within the Anglican Communion. This highlights the need for dialogue, understanding, and a dedication to finding compromise on divisive issues within the Communion. In summary, the Anglican Communion is the church that appears to be facing recent issues and internal divisions, as evidenced by the statement from the bishops of the CAPA family. The ongoing challenges faced by the Anglican Communion serve as a reminder of the importance of unity, dialogue, and compromise in addressing the complexities of a global religious community."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Process: - An airline reservation is made - The passenger arrives early at the airport - The luggage is checked - The passenger waits in line - The passenger shows their identification and gets a boarding pass - The passenger goes to their gate - The passenger gets in line when it's time to board - The person boards the plane - The plane arrives at the destination - The passenger gets off the plane at their destination. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more passengers wait in line happens, how will it affect more passengers board the plane. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis in this context refers to a situation in which more passengers wait in line, and it explores the possible effects this might have on the process of passengers boarding the plane. The hypothesis assumes that an increase in the number of passengers waiting in line might lead to more passengers boarding the plane. The effect of this perturbation could be evaluated in terms of direct and indirect impacts on the process of passengers boarding the plane: 1. Direct Effects: a. Longer wait times: With more passengers waiting in line to board, the overall wait times for all passengers may increase. This could delay the boarding process and potentially affect the on-time performance of the flight. b. Potential boarding complications: With more passengers in line, it's possible that some passengers may encounter issues with boarding passes, identification, or other pertinent boarding documents. This could lead to further delays in the boarding process. 2. Indirect Effects: a. Increased workload for airline staff: Handling more passengers waiting in line would put an additional burden on airline staff, including customer service, baggage handlers, and security personnel. This could lead to increased fatigue and stress among employees, which might negatively impact their performance. b. Customer dissatisfaction: The longer wait times and potential delays in boarding could lead to dissatisfaction among passengers and might influence their choice of airline in the future. In severe cases, this could affect the airline's reputation and revenue. In conclusion, the perturbation hypothesis that an increase in the number of passengers waiting in line could lead to more passengers boarding the plane is likely to have both direct and indirect effects on the boarding process. Direct effects include longer wait times and potential boarding complications, while indirect effects involve an increased workload for airline staff and potential customer dissatisfaction."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Plot title: Fly Away Home Movie plot: After her mother dies in a car accident, 13-year-old Amy Alden (Anna Paquin) is brought from New Zealand to Ontario, Canada, by her estranged father Thomas Alden (Jeff Daniels), a sculptor and inventor, to live with him and his girlfriend Susan (Dana Delany). When a construction crew destroys a small wilderness area near the Alden home, Amy finds a nest of goose eggs. Without Thomas, Susan, or her uncle David (Terry Kinney) knowing, she takes the eggs and keeps them in a dresser in her fatherâs old barn to incubate. When the eggs have hatched, she is allowed to keep the goslings as pets. Thomas asks for help from local game warden Glen Seifert (Jeremy Ratchford) on how to care for the geese. Seifert comes over to the Alden house, and explains that the geese have imprinted on Amy as their mother. He explains that geese learn everything from their parents including migratory routes, but also warns Thomas that all domestic geese must have their wings pinioned (clipped) to render them flightless, which upsets Amy. Thomas throws Seifert off his property, only for Seifert to threaten the Aldens that if the birds start flying, he will have to confiscate them. Thomas decides to use an ultralight aircraft to teach the birds to fly and show them their migratory routes, but quickly realizes the birds will only follow Amy. Aided by his friend Barry (Holter Graham), Thomas teaches Amy how to fly an ultralight aircraft of her own, so she can teach the geese. David mentions knowing someone running a bird sanctuary in North Carolina, and arranges for the geese to go to the sanctuary. The birds have to arrive before November 1, or the sanctuary will be torn down by developers who plan to turn it into a coastal housing development. Thomas (Jeff Daniels) attempts to get the geese to follow him. Amy and Thomas practice flying the aircraft, but Igor, the weakest of the geese, who has a limp, accidentally hits the front of Amyâs aircraft and lands in an isolated forest.

Bird was born in West Baden Springs, Indiana, to Georgia (nee Kerns) and Claude Joseph \\"Joe\\" Bird, a veteran of the Korean War. He was raised in nearby French Lick, where his mother worked two jobs to support Larry and his five siblings. Bird has said that being poor as a child still motivates him \\"to this day\\". Georgia and Joe divorced when Larry was in high school, and Joe committed suicide about a year later. Bird immediately transformed the Celtics into a title contender, helping them improve their win total by 32 games from the year before he was drafted and finish first in the Eastern Conference. With averages of 21.3 points, 10.4 rebounds, 4.5 assists, and 1.7 steals per game for the season, he was selected to the All-Star Team and named Rookie of the Year. In the Conference Finals, Boston was eliminated by the Philadelphia 76ers. Before the 1980-81 season, the Celtics selected forward Kevin McHale in the draft and acquired center Robert Parish from the Golden State Warriors, forming a Hall of Fame trio for years to come. Behind Bird's leadership and Boston's upgraded roster, the Celtics again advanced to the Conference Finals for a rematch with the 76ers. Boston fell behind 3-1 to start the series but won the next three games to advance to the Finals against the Houston Rockets, winning in six games and earning Bird his first championship. He averaged 21.9 points, 14 rebounds, 6.1 assists, and 2.3 steals per game for the postseason and 15.3 points, 15.3 rebounds, and 7 assists per game for the Finals but lost out on the Finals MVP Award to teammate Cedric Maxwell. At the 1982 All-Star Game, Bird scored 19 points en route to winning the All-Star Game MVP Award. At the conclusion of the season, he earned his first All-Defensive Team selection. He eventually finished runner-up in Most Valuable Player Award voting to Moses Malone. In the Conference Finals, the Celtics faced the 76ers for the third consecutive year, losing in seven games. Boston's misfortunes continued into the next season, with Bird again finishing second in MVP voting to Malone and the team losing in the Conference Semifinals to the Milwaukee Bucks. In 1988, Bird had the best statistical season of his career, but the Celtics failed to reach the NBA Finals for the first time in five years, losing to the Pistons in six games during the Eastern Conference Finals. Bird started the 1988-89 season, but ended his season after six games to have bone spurs surgically removed from both of his heels. He returned to the Celtics in 1989, but debilitating back problems and an aging Celtic roster prevented him from regaining his mid-1980s form. Nonetheless, through the final years of his career, Bird maintained his status as one of the premier players in the game. He averaged over 20 points, 9 rebounds and 7 assists a game in his last three seasons with the Celtics, and shot better than 45% from the field in each. Bird led the Celtics to playoff appearances in each of those three seasons. Bird's body, however, continued to break down. He had been bothered by back problems for years, and his back became progressively worse. After leading the Celtics to a 29-5 start to the 1990-91 season, he missed 22 games due to a compressed nerve root in his back, a condition that would eventually lead to his retirement. He had off-season surgery to remove a disc from his back, but his back problems continued and he missed 37 games during the 1991-92 season. His past glory would be briefly rekindled, however, in a game that season in which he scored 49 points in a double-overtime victory over the Portland Trail Blazers. During the 1992 Eastern Conference semi-finals against the Cleveland Cavaliers, Bird missed four of the seven games in the series due to those recurring back problems. In the summer of 1992, Bird joined Magic Johnson, Michael Jordan and other NBA stars to play for the United States basketball team in that year's Olympics in Barcelona, Spain. It was the first time in the United States' Olympic history that the country sent professional basketball players to compete. The \\"Dream Team\\" won the men's basketball gold medal. Following his Olympic experience, on August 18, 1992, Bird announced his retirement as an NBA player. He finished his career with averages of more than 24 points, 10 rebounds and 6 assists per game, while shooting 49.6% from the field, 88.6% from the free throw line and 37.6% from three-point range. Following Bird's departure, the Celtics promptly retired his jersey number 33. In 1989, Bird published his autobiography, Drive: The Story of My Life with Bob Ryan. The book chronicles his life and career up to the 1989 NBA season. The Celtics employed Bird as a special assistant in the team's front office from 1992 until 1997. In 1997, Bird accepted the position of coach of the Indiana Pacers and said he would be on the job for no more than three years. Despite having no previous coaching experience, Bird led the Pacers to a 58-24 record--the franchise's best as an NBA team at the time--in the 1997-98 season, and pushed the Bulls to seven games in the Eastern Conference finals. He was named the NBA Coach of the Year for his efforts, becoming the only man in NBA history to have won both the MVP and Coach of the Year awards. He then led the Pacers to two consecutive Central Division titles in 1999 and 2000, and a berth in the 2000 NBA Finals. Bird will be always known for his playing in the Boston garden, but what he did in 3 years with the pacers was very remarkable and the best 3 year stretch the pacer ever had. Bird resigned as Pacers coach shortly after the end of the 2000 season, following through on his initial promise to coach for only three years. In 2003, he returned as the Pacers' president of basketball operations, overseeing team personnel and coaching moves, as well as the team's draft selections. Bird promoted David Morway to general manager in 2008, but Bird still had the final say in basketball matters. After the 2011-2012 NBA season, Bird was named NBA Executive of the Year, becoming the only man in NBA history to win the NBA MVP, Coach of the Year and Executive of the Year. On June 27, 2012, a day before the 2012 NBA draft, Bird and the Pacers announced that they would be parting ways later that year. Bird said health issues were among the reasons for his leaving. Donnie Walsh was named to replace him. On June 26, 2013, almost exactly a year later, it was announced that Bird would be returning to the Pacers as president of basketball operations. Pacers owner Herb Simon briefly addressed Bird's prior health concerns, stating that \\"He's got his energy back, his health back and he's raring to go\\". On May 1, 2017, Bird resigned as president of basketball operations, but stayed with the team in an advisory capacity. Entity:","completion":"Larry Bird"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Donald had very little energy.. (B). Samuel had very little energy..","completion":"The completion of the sentence would be \\"Donald spent a lot of time jumping rope on the playground but Samuel did not because (B) Samuel had very little energy.\\" This sentence indicates a contrast between Donald and Samuel's activities on the playground, specifically when it comes to jumping rope. The narrative set up here is that Donald is spending a lot of time jumping rope. The use of the conjunction \\"but\\" provides a context for a contrasting action or characteristic related to Samuel. The reason for Samuel not spending as much time jumping rope on the playground is provided after the conjunction. Out of the two options provided, only option (B) provides a contrasting reason related to Samuel. \\"Samuel had very little energy\\" is an explanation that contrasts Samuel's actions with Donald's. Samuel not having as much energy would logically justify why he isn't spending a lot of time jumping rope, as jumping rope is a very energetic activity requiring considerable physical effort. Option (A), \\"Donald had very little energy\\", contradicts the information previously presented in the sentence, which is that Donald is spending a lot of time jumping rope. The act of jumping rope typically requires a significant amount of energy, and the statement that Donald was doing this for a long time implies that he had a plentiful supply of energy. Therefore, given the context, structure and implied meaning of the sentence, the correct completion is definitely option (B), resulting in the sentence: \\"Donald spent a lot of time jumping rope on the playground but Samuel did not because Samuel had very little energy.\\" This sentence nicely contrasts Donald's energetic activity with Samuel's lack thereof, due to his stated lower energy levels."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The andesite cap is covered by the fourth region, mounded prairie. This region formed when the caps were slowly eroded by the freezing and thawing of water that seeped into the ground (ice erosion), which created layers of mounded soil. Vernal pools fill in from October to June in the mounded prairie area due to the andesite's impermeability. The pools support species of plants and animals. Over 340 species of plants grow on the rocks, including approximately 200 species of wildflowers. Some of the most common wildflowers are western buttercups, desert parsley, bicolor lupine, and California goldfields. Camas and death camas also grow on the rocks. Camas produces an edible bulb, while death camas is poisonous and was used by the Takelma as an anesthetic.More than 70 species of animals are known to live on the Table Rocks. Lizards such as the western fence lizard, southern alligator lizard, and western skink have been seen in all four regions of the Table Rocks. Western rattlesnakes and two species of garter snakes also live in all regions. Black-tailed deer, coyotes, and bobcats are some of the mammals that live on the Table Rocks. The rocks are also home to western black-legged ticks, although they are mainly found in the chaparral region. Many species of birds live on the rocks.The Table Rocks experience a Mediterranean climate. The average wind speed in the area is less than 6 miles per hour (10 km/h), and the annual precipitation is approximately 18 inches (460 mm) due to the rain shadow created by the Klamath Mountains. It rarely snows in the winter.

Camas and death camas can also be found growing on the rocks."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

Article: Almost everyone has dropped some food on the floor and still wanted to eat it.If someone saw you drop it, he or she might have shouted, \\" 5-second rule!\\" This so-called rule says food is OK to eat if you pick it up in five seconds or less.But is that true? Professor Anthony Hilton from Ashton University, UK, tested the rule with his students.They found that food dropped for five seconds is less likely to contain bacteria than if it sits there for longer. For the study, Hilton and his students tested a lot of foods----bread, pasta, cookies and candy--to see how much bacteria they had when they made contact with the floor.They allowed the food to lie on the different types of flooring--carpet , laminate and tile -- for three seconds to 30 seconds. Not surprisingly, the longer the food was on the floor, the more bacteria it had.And the type of floor where the dropped food landed had an effect.Bacteria are least likely to transfer from carpet, while they are most likely to transfer laminate or tiled surface after more than five seconds. The study also found that the wetter the food, the more likely it was to pick up bacteria.Although most people are happy to follow the 5-second rule, eating food dropped on the floor still carries an infection risk.\\"It very much depends on which bacteria are on the floor at the time.\\" Hilton told Forbes. Question: According to the test, we learn the following EXCEPT _ . Options: A: the dropped food had more bacteria if it sat on the floor for longer. B: the dropped food on the carpet had the least bacteria. C: bacteria was impossible to transfer from laminate or tiled surfaces. D: the wetter food was likely to pick up bacteria. The answer is:","completion":"C: bacteria was impossible to transfer from laminate or tiled surfaces. The article states that bacteria are most likely to transfer from laminate or tiled surfaces after more than five seconds, but it does not claim that transferring bacteria from these surfaces is impossible.

From the early 16th century, both Western Armenia and Eastern Armenia fell under Iranian Safavid rule. Owing to the century long Turco-Iranian geo-political rivalry that would last in Western Asia, significant parts of the region were frequently fought over between the two rivalling empires. From the mid 16th century with the Peace of Amasya, and decisively from the first half of the 17th century with the Treaty of Zuhab until the first half of the 19th century, Eastern Armenia was ruled by the successive Iranian Safavid, Afsharid and Qajar empires, while Western Armenia remained under Ottoman rule. In the late 1820s, the parts of historic Armenia under Iranian control centering on Yerevan and Lake Sevan (all of Eastern Armenia) were incorporated into the Russian Empire following Iran's forced ceding of the territories after its loss in the Russo-Persian War (1826-1828) and the outcoming Treaty of Turkmenchay.
