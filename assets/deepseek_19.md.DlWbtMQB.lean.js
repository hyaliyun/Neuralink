Q: I am verifying the answers generated by an automatic system to the following question: what happened to kuomintang after the chinese civil war Suggested answer: Cross-Strait relations have been hindered by military threats and political and economic pressure, particularly over Taiwan's political status , with both governments officially adhering to a \\" One-China policy .\\" Should I validate this answer? A:","completion":"The suggested answer partially addresses the question, but it does not provide a comprehensive and detailed explanation of what happened to the Kuomintang (KMT) after the Chinese Civil War. A more thorough answer could be as follows: The Kuomintang (KMT), also known as the Chinese Nationalist Party, faced a significant defeat after the Chinese Civil War, which lasted from 1927 to 1950, with a brief pause during the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937-1945). The civil war was primarily fought between the KMT, led by Chiang Kai-shek, and the Communist Party of China (CPC), led by Mao Zedong. The KMT was defeated, and the People's Republic of China (PRC) was established by the CPC on October 1, 1949. After its defeat, the KMT, along with Chiang Kai-shek, retreated to the island of Taiwan. The Republic of China (ROC) government, originally founded by the KMT in 1912, relocated to Taiwan and continued to consider itself the legitimate government of all of China. Chiang Kai-shek and his party ruled Taiwan under martial law from 1949 until 1987, when his son, Chiang Ching-kuo, lifted martial law and allowed the formation of opposition parties. This marked the beginning of Taiwan's transition to a democratic government. The Kuomintang, despite losing its political dominance over China, survived and continued to play a significant role in the politics of Taiwan. The party has participated in elections and governed Taiwan during various periods since 1987, most recently through the administration of President Ma Ying-jeou (2008-2016). As for the relationship between the PRC and the ROC (Taiwan), both governments have a \\"One-China policy,\\" which refers to their mutual acknowledgment that there is only one sovereign state encompassing both mainland China and Taiwan, but with disagreement over which government is the legitimate representative of this state. Due to this policy, other countries can only maintain official diplomatic relations with either the PRC or the ROC, not both. Cross-strait relations have experienced periods of tension and relative peace, often fluctuating based on election outcomes in Taiwan and the strength of political ideologies advocating for Taiwanese independence or reunification with the mainland. In summary, it would be more accurate to validate an answer that addresses the retreat of the Kuomintang to Taiwan, the subsequent governance of the island, the development of democracy, and the role of the KMT in Taiwan's contemporary politics, in addition to the impact of cross-strait relations on the political and military situations in both Taiwan and the PRC."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Demonstrators took their shouts for an end to what they say is widespread and unchecked police brutality to an NBA arena in Washington, a famed department store in New York, a well-known Ivy League commercial spot and to roads where they often brought traffic and passersby to a stop. Streets in major cities throughout the United States -- Boston, Chicago, Miami and New Orleans, among them -- filled again Friday night with protesters. And while crowds appeared to be smaller than previous nights, marchers were just as passionate about their voices being heard. One sign held by a young black man in Washington read simply: \\"I could be next.\\" The protests are a response to the decision Wednesday by a New York grand jury not to charge police Officer Daniel Pantaleo in the chokehold death of Eric Garner during his Staten Island arrest, which was captured on cell phone video. They come a week after another decision not to indict by a grand jury in St. Louis County, Missouri, examining the killing of African-American teenager Michael Brown by a white police officer. In New York, protesters in the rain passed out a list of demands to the media regarding the Garner death in July. The top demands were for all officers involved to be fired, for a special prosecutor to be appointed to investigate all complaints of excessive force and for the state Legislature to make a chokehold punishable by significant penalties. A die-in at Macy's. Earlier, Eric Garner's daughter Erica told CNN's \\"The Lead with Jake Tapper\\" that she wanted to see people punished for her father's killing. \\"Justice to me is basically doing what's right,\\" she said. \\"I wouldn't be happy with (Pantaleo) just losing his job or being suspended or still getting paid. I wouldn't want that. I would want him to face time in jail.\\" She said that anyone who contributed to her father's death should go to prison. Protesters flooded Macy's iconic Herald Square location and staged a die-in as holiday shoppers looked on. Later, the flood of demonstrators shut off Times Square to traffic for 10 minutes before the crowd headed down 42nd Street, shouting, \\"This is what democracy looks like.\\" They stopped again in Bryant Park and ringed a set of shops. Many of the workers in those stores came out and, in support, raised their hands in the air. It was also a short stop, as the crowd set off up Sixth Avenue, traversing against the flow of yellow cabs and other cars. A cacophony of car horns greeted the protesters and cabbies also held their hands out the window to give their approval. Only about 50 people protested in Chicago, but they marched with few breaks for hours. In Washington, the demonstrators held several four-minute long silent die-ins to empathize with the family of Michael Brown, a Missouri teenager who lie in the street for four hours after he was fatally shot by a police officer. \\"I'm not an angry black man. I'm an outraged, hurt black man,\\" one of the protest organizers told CNN. Six protesters shouted \\"Hands up, don't shoot\\" inside the Verizon Center before an NBA game between the Washington Wizards and the Denver Nuggets. Near Boston -- site of one of the largest demonstrations of the night -- a mass of protesters staged a die-in, several dozen of them blocking an intersection by lying on the road. As many as 1,000 people were marching Friday evening from Tufts University in Somerville, Massachusetts, near Boston to Harvard Square, according to a police estimate. \\"People who don't already realize what is happening, maybe they will open their minds a little bit or people that do realize and don't care will realize that people are angry and it's not OK,\\" Nicole, a Boston demonstrator who wouldn't give her last name, told CNN affiliate WHDH when asked why she marches. 'So many people realize this is a problem' Those who turned out to protest were a mix of ages and races. Chuck Helms, a 67-year-old New Jersey resident, marched in New York clad in a union-issue hard hat and satin Occupy Wall Street jacket. A sign dangling around his neck said, \\"Remembering my brothers. BLACK LIVES MATTER.\\" The sign included photographs of Eric Garner, Trayvon Martin, Tamir Rice and Akai Gurley -- all black men whose controversial deaths made headlines. Gurley was shot dead last month by a police officer in a dark stairwell of a New York housing project. Brooklyn DA: Grand jury to investigate shooting of unarmed man. \\"It's a shame that people have to die for us to become focused,\\" Helms said. At least two people in New York were detained by police, who will not report on arrests until Saturday morning. In Chicago, Elizabeth Huston, a paralegal, joined in for the first time. \\"So many people realize this is a problem. This is disproportionally affecting black men and women,\\" she said. In Cleveland, protesters there marched over the death of Tamir, 12, who police say had a lifelike air gun and didn't comply with an officer's commands. \\"CPD what do you say? How many kids have you killed today,\\" they yelled. Cleveland cop who shot 12-year-old slammed for 'immaturity' in past job. The family of Tamir filed a wrongful death suit Friday against police over the killing, according to the Cleveland Plain Dealer. Growing movement. The demand for change in how law enforcement deals with minorities has been broad, with protests involving untold thousands of demonstrators from coast to coast, in towns both large and small. \\"It's happening in every city, every town. It's happening here in Pittsburgh,\\" Julia Johnson told CNN affiliate WPXI on Thursday. In many ways, it appears to be based on the Occupy Wall Street movement, which generated protests in New York and elsewhere in 2011 over inequality, corporate influence and other issues. The largely leaderless and underground movement is using social media to organize protests, which have morphed from a wide-ranging agenda to a tight focus on the issue of police violence against black men. The mostly peaceful protests shared many similarities with the protests of the Civil Rights era -- marches, signs, civil disobedience. One Asian-American protester felt inspired by the 1960s marches, but said she believes that struggle shows change will take a long time. \\"If you think about the civil rights movement, it took 10 years for anything to happen between the protests and the boycotts of the buses to the actual Civil Rights Act,\\" she said. Author and CNN commentator Michaela Angela Davis was marching in a mixed crowd of mostly white students chanting \\"black lives matter.\\" The blocked streets didn't bother her so much. It's democracy, she said. \\"I feel like we are seeing the American project at work. It is messy; it is difficult.\\" NYC officials: Fewer complaints against police. Meanwhile, New York officials said that complaints against police officers had fallen significantly in the second half of the year, compared with July to November 2013. A report that tallied complaints said 1,813 were made so far since July 1 of this year, 26% less than the number of complaints filed with the Civilian Complaint Review Board in the same period of the prior year. Excessive force allegations fell by 29%. The dip followed a slight rise in the first six months of the year, but, overall, allegations have declined in 2014. \\"Over the past 11 months, my administration has implemented a series of initiatives and reforms aimed at bridging the gap between the NYPD and the communities they serve,\\" Mayor Bill de Blasio said in a written statement. \\"From ending the overuse of stop and frisk, to dropping the city's legal challenge to the racial profiling ban, to changing the department's policy on possession of small amounts of marijuana, we're steadily bringing crime down while drawing police and community closer together.\\" CNN's Ray Sanchez reported from New York, Athena Jones reported from Washington and Steve Almasy reported and wrote in Atlanta.

Answer:","completion":"The last step of the process would likely be the collection of the separated components, namely the desalinated water and the salt, for their respective uses or further processing. After the gaseous water has been cooled down in the second container, it will condense back into its liquid state, leaving us with desalinated or fresh water. This purified water can then be carefully collected from the second container and stored, distributed, or used for various purposes, such as irrigation, drinking water, or industrial applications. Simultaneously, the salt particles left behind in the first container after the water has evaporated can also be collected. This process might require scraping or vacuuming the salt deposits at the bottom of the container, after which they are subjected to further processing, if necessary. These recovered salt particles can be utilized in a variety of ways, including food seasoning, industrial processes, or as raw materials in the production of other products like chemicals and detergents.

He claims that Charlotte visited him after killing her husband in an argument. She was wearing a bloodstained dress and Jonathan agreed to go back to her house and obtain another one. He found the body of Mr. Inwood at the residence, took a spare dress from the wardrobe and then tried to simulate a burglary gone wrong, only to be caught in the act by Charlotte's theatre maid and dresser, Nellie Goode (Kay Walsh).

She takes him to hide in a house near the coast owned by her father, Commodore Gill (Alastair Sim).

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Living in Chicago for the past 6 years, I am used to excellent food and dining experiences. I read some of the bad reviews about Elements, and felt I needed to chime in. Went there last night before a show as well as some of the other reviewers have. My parents who are foodies and have dined all over the US and outside of the US also recommended this place. Our experience was amazing. First, the environment. While it is in a non-traditional location, the openness and modern decor of the restaurant is refreshing. The open fire oven makes it feel warm. We sat in one of the \\"booths\\" by the windows, and they were so comfortable. The service and waiter we had were awesome. Robert was very knowledgeable about the food and gave us fantastic recommendations for our dinner choices. We did get there early, but we also like to take our time to dine, so those who need a rush may not want to go here based on others' reviews. Now the most important part: THE FOOD IS FANTASTIC. We started with a 6 selection cheese and meat plate. We trusted Robert to make these selections, and he did not disappoint. We had the duck speck, salami tartufo, and pate ciccioli. I am unable to remember the cheeses we had, but I do remember they are all pennsylvania cheeses and were delicious. I had the brussel sprouts for a salad, and the veal cheek. My partner had the greens salad and filet, which he absolutely loved. I am going to stick to reviewing my dishes. The brussel sprouts were fantastic. Surprisingly tart, they were mixed with bacon and grapes and had a drier ricotta that almost tasted like feta. It was perhaps one of the best brussel sprouts dishes I've ever tasted. And onto the the veal cheek. I love veal, and until last night, the best veal I've had was at a restaurant in Florence. This veal was unbelievably tender, and melted like butter in the mouth. I honestly didn't want the dish to end. Unfortunately, because all of the meat is local, Robert told us this dish will be gone in about two weeks. So if you go here, please PLEASE order the veal. You won't regret it. We finished the meal with the chocolate mousse and pecan pie and some coffee. They were both very good, but honestly, I just couldn't stop thinking about the veal I had just eaten, so they didn't get as much of my attention. All in all, it's probably one of the best meals I've had in Pittsburgh (before moving to Chicago, I lived in Pgh for 4 years and grew up in the area.) All the food is amazingly fresh, and you can definitely tell. It is absolutely Chicago-worthy, and would do very well there. If you want to enjoy a leisure meal and savor all of the flavors, I think you will absolutely be glad you made the choice to dine here. I'm looking forward to my next visit.

What is the sentiment of the following review? WinCo is fairly close to me and my dad was really excited they were coming to the East Valley, and especially near where we live. However, the prices aren't all that inexpensive. However, they have a reasonably good bulk section, which is why we come here and their prices for some of their deli stuff is better than Safeway, which is usually where we go for things like chicken strips, fried chicken, wedges. WinCo's stuff tastes good and it's much better pricing for that. We buy protein powder and it's about 3-4/lb less than Sprouts for their whey protein. We love that they carry spices in bulk, and you can get what you want, which saves us money, too. Everyone that we've dealt with at WinCo has been super friendly and helpful. The store is spacious and clean. The only downside is that some of their prices are competitive, but since they have no weekly ads, it's hard for them to compete with Frys and the stores that sometimes have killer weekly specials. If they did do this, then they might attract even more customers. Even though they have a thing that says you can buy in bulk without the membership fees, Costco still does have better pricing on a number of things that far surpasses the extra pricing you would pay for a basic membership at Costco.

News article: There's speculation over who will inherit Prince’s estimated 300 million fortune. Read: Prince Was Awake For 154 Hours Before His Death, Brother-in-Law Says He had no surviving children and both of his parents are deceased. It is unclear if the 57-year-old had a will. If he did not have a will, Minnesota law states that his estate would go to his sister, Tyka Nelson, and his seven half siblings. Two are believed to have passed away. Tax attorney Bruce Givner, who is not affiliated with Prince’s estate, told IE his money will go his siblings. “Minnesota, like every state, has what is called an intestacy law. Intestacy meaning there is no governing document. The state has a law that says who gets it when you die,” he said. “Minnesota says when there is no spouse, when there are no children, when there are no parents, it goes to the heirs of the grandparents. So, this is going to be split among his siblings.\\" Prince is believed to own the master recordings of his work, and ran the successful record label, NPG and his Paisley Park recording studio.

Watch: The World Sees Purple in Tribute to Prince ||||| CHANHASSEN, Minn. — Prince Rogers Nelson had an unflinching reputation among those close to him for leading an assiduously clean lifestyle. He ate vegan and preferred to avoid the presence of meat entirely. He was known to eschew alcohol and marijuana, and no one who went on tour with him could indulge either. But Prince appears to have shielded from even some of his closest friends that he had a problem with pain pills, one that grew so acute that his friends sought urgent medical help from Dr. Howard Kornfeld of California, who specializes in treating people addicted to pain medication. Dr. Kornfeld, who runs a treatment center in Mill Valley, Calif., sent his son on an overnight flight to meet with Prince at his home to discuss a treatment plan, said William J. Mauzy, a lawyer for the Kornfeld family, during a news conference on Wednesday outside his Minneapolis office. But he arrived too late. When the son, Andrew Kornfeld, who works with his father but is not a doctor, arrived in Chanhassen, the Minneapolis suburb where Prince lived, the next morning, he was among those who found the entertainer lifeless in the elevator and called 911, Mr. Mauzy said. Emergency officials arrived but could not revive Prince. He was dead at 57. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","completion":"Speculation surrounds who will inherit Prince's estimated 300 million fortune, as it is unclear if he had a will.

Which game has more players Spy Alley or Onyx?","completion":"To determine which game has more players – Spy Alley or Onyx – I will provide you with an overview of both games, taking into account their popularity, player count, and potential factors that might influence the number of players. 1. Spy Alley: Spy Alley is a board game designed by Bill Stephenson and published in 1992. The game is a mix of deduction, bluffing, and strategy where players assume the roles of spies belonging to different countries, trying to collect a set of items and return to their home base without revealing their identity. Spy Alley is designed for 2-6 players aged 8 and up, with an average playtime of 45 minutes. Popularity: Spy Alley has been well-received by players and has won several awards in the past, including the 1998 National Parenting Publication Awards (NAPPA) for games. It also has a ranking of 7.0 on BoardGameGeek, indicating that it is a well-regarded game within the board gaming community. 2. Onyx: After extensive research, I couldn't find relevant information on a board game called Onyx. Nevertheless, there is a popular abstract strategy game called \\"Onitama\\" that might be worth considering if it was a typo or a confusion. Alternatively, \\"Onyx\\" could be a lesser-known game or a game still in development that isn't widely available to the public. Assuming you were referring to Onitama, here's a brief overview: Onitama is a two-player abstract strategy game designed by Shimpei Sato and published in 2014. Players control a master pawn and four other pawns representing martial arts students on a 5x5 grid. The objective is to either capture the opponent's master pawn or move your master pawn to the opponent's starting position. Onitama is a highly strategic game with simple mechanics and an average playtime of 15-20 minutes. Popularity: Onitama has earned a strong reputation in the board gaming community, garnering a rating of 7.6 on BoardGameGeek. Additionally, it has received several awards and nominations, such as the 2016 Golden Geek Best 2-Player Board Game Nominee, indicating that it is a popular and appreciated game. Conclusion: Considering the available information, it's challenging to make a direct comparison due to the lack of information on a game named \\"Onyx.\\" Nevertheless, Spy Alley seems to have a larger player base due to its higher player count (2-6 players) in comparison to Onitama, which is only for two players. Additionally, Spy Alley has a broader appeal, catering to family audiences while Onitama has a more niche appeal, targeting fans of abstract strategy games. However, I highly recommend looking into more accurate current information on the potential game called \\"Onyx\\" if that was the intended choice. In case it was Onitama, the information presented should give a clearer comparison, with Spy Alley potentially having a larger player base due to the mentioned factors."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Question: Cobol, Basic and Fortran are types of what? Answer:","completion":"Cobol, Basic, and Fortran are types of programming languages. These languages are essential tools for creating software programs, managing databases, and performing various computational tasks. Each of these programming languages emerged in the mid-twentieth century and have played significant roles in the evolution of computer programming as we know it today. Their unique features and characteristics have made them suitable for specific purposes and fields, even though their popularity has diminished over the decades. Let's explore each one in a bit more detail: 1. Cobol (COmmon Business-Oriented Language): Cobol is a high-level, procedural programming language specifically designed for business applications. The language was developed in 1959 by a group of programming experts, led by Grace Hopper, under the sponsorship of the United States Department of Defense. Cobol's primary purpose was to facilitate the processing of data and mathematical operations in sectors such as finance, human resources, and inventory management. Cobol is recognized for its English-like syntax, which makes it relatively easy to read, write, and maintain. The language is highly scalable and is known for its ability to process large amounts of data in a structured manner. Although Cobol has lost popularity in recent years due to the emergence of more modern programming languages, it still holds a significant presence in legacy systems, especially within mainframe environments. 2. Basic (Beginner's All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code): Basic, as the name suggests, is a general-purpose programming language that was designed with simplicity in mind. Created by John G. Kemeny and Thomas E. Kurtz at Dartmouth College in 1964, Basic aimed to provide an accessible and straightforward programming platform for people who did not have prior experience in computer programming. The language emphasizes ease of use with a simple syntax and structure, making it popular among beginners in programming. Basic has been widely used in educational settings, and its dialects have found their way onto various computing platforms, including early personal computers like the Apple II and Commodore 64. Although the popularity of Basic has waned with the advent of newer and more versatile programming languages, it played a crucial role in accelerating the adoption of computers in the home and education sectors. 3. Fortran (FORmula TRANslation): Fortran is a high-level, compiled, imperative programming language that was initially developed by IBM in the 1950s for scientific and engineering applications. The first version, Fortran I, was created by a team led by John W. Backus in 1957. Its primary purpose was to provide a robust language for performing mathematical calculations and solving complex problems that required processing large amounts of data. Fortran's syntax and design emphasize mathematical functions and operations, which makes it particularly suited for applications in fields such as physics, chemistry, engineering, and computational finance. The language offers excellent performance and allows scientists and engineers to write efficient code that can take advantage of the computing power of supercomputers and high-performance computing clusters. In summary, Cobol, Basic, and Fortran are all types of programming languages that have been fundamental in shaping the field of computer programming. Each has served a specific purpose, with Cobol focusing on business applications, Basic on ease of use and education, and Fortran on scientific and engineering computations. While the prominence of these languages has waned in recent years, their contributions to the development of computing technology cannot be underestimated."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Start up a conversation. Visit a spa.","completion":"Title: Unlocking the Secrets to Making the Most of Your Time at an Airport Introduction The thought of waiting for hours at an airport may seem daunting for many people; however, there are numerous fun and relaxing activities that can help you make the most of this idle time. Here are seven ways to transform your lengthy layover into a delightful and memorable experience. 1. Head for an Airport Lounge Instead of walking around the terminal aimlessly, seek solace in an airport lounge. Most lounges are designed to provide a comfortable and calming environment, where you can enjoy amenities such as free Wi-Fi, refreshments, magazines, and even shower facilities. Some lounges also offer premium services, including nap pods and charging stations. Don't worry if you're not a premium member of any airlines, as you can usually access these lounges for a fee. 2. Sleep in the Terminal Taking a nap is one of the most effective ways to recharge your batteries during a long layover. Many airports provide designated sleeping areas or sleeping pods, allowing travellers to catch some shut-eye in a safe and comfortable place. Alternatively, you can always find a quiet corner to rest your head on your luggage or use a neck pillow. 3. Grab a Bite to Eat With plenty of dining options at your disposal inside the airport, treat yourself to a meal that satisfies your taste buds. Whether you prefer a fast food joint, a sit-down restaurant, or a local cuisine kiosk, you can find something to satiate your cravings. This culinary experience will not only refuel your body but also offer a respite from the monotony of waiting. 4. Walk Around the Airport Stretch your legs and explore the airport by taking a leisurely stroll through the terminal. This simple yet effective exercise can help to stimulate blood circulation and alleviate any stiffness from prolonged sitting during travel. Plus, airports are often architectural marvels worth discovering, and they may contain interesting art installations or exhibits you do not want to miss. 5. Go to a Chapel or Meditate in a “Quiet Room” Many airports offer chapels or dedicated spaces, known as “quiet rooms,” for travellers seeking a moment of peace and reflection. These areas are ideal for those who wish to meditate, pray, or practice mindfulness during their layover. Engaging in such activities can help to alleviate stress and invite positivity, making your transit more enjoyable. 6. Start Up a Conversation Initiating conversations with fellow travellers can be a fun way to pass the time. With people from all walks of life passing through airports, you may make new friends or hear fascinating stories that would never have come your way otherwise. Do not hesitate to break the ice; who knows, you might even forge lasting connections. 7. Visit a Spa Finally, treat yourself to a pampering session at an airport spa. Whether indulging in a quick massage to alleviate travel-related aches or opting for a comprehensive spa package to rejuvenate your mind and body, the experience is bound to help you unwind and leave you refreshed for the next leg of your journey. Conclusion In conclusion, a layover need not be a dull or taxing experience. By embracing these unexpected opportunities for relaxation, exploration, or socialization, your lengthy layover can become an enjoyable and memorable part of your overall travel experience. The next time you find yourself with time to spare at an airport, consider experimenting with one or more of these activities.

In college, I needed money for school supplies, so in addition to slinging ice cream cones and “Awful Awfuls” at the Creamery, I picked up a few more jobs: working the dinner shift at a family restaurant, heaving trays of cocktails at a bar until 3AM, and cleaning houses. Needless to say, I was a wreck, and a big time abuser of coffee and cigarettes. One day just before my shift at the Creamery began, I slung back a huge coffee and hauled on a Newport cigarette in the kitchen (this was when you could do things like smoke in a restaurant kitchen.) I then went out to the dining floor and approached my first table, who had been given menus and was waiting for me to take their order. “Hi, How are you today?”, I cheerfully asked the mother and her three daughters, all looking under 12. “What may I get you?…..” Then, fade to black as a huge swooshing sound took over my head. Next thing I know, I’m on the floor, covered in blood, the girls are screaming blue murder, and my manager is shaking like a leaf as he coddles me. Apparently, I passed out right onto the table of the nice family I was waiting on, then fell back and whacked my head on the corner of a wall. I remember noticing that my kelly green polyester dress was an awful shade of bloodied brown. My main concern was that I had a hot date that night, and now I had to go to the emergency room! The ER doctor was able to sew my head up, and sent me home with a diagnosis of “syncope, unknown origin”. After a few hours, I still felt spacey, but insisted on going on the date.

Answer the above question based on the context below: John of Ephesus' account describes the events around the Christianization of Alodia in detail. As the southernmost of the three Nubian kingdoms, Alodia was the last to be converted to Christianity. According to John, the Alodian King was aware of the conversion of Nobadia in 543 and asked him to send a bishop who would also baptize his people. The request was granted in 580, leading to the baptism of the King, his family and the local nobility. Thus, Alodia became a part of the Christian world under the Coptic Patriarchate of Alexandria. After conversion, several pagan temples, such as the one in Musawwarat es-Sufra, were probably converted into churches. The extent and speed with which Christianity spread among the Alodian populace is uncertain. Despite the conversion of the nobility, it is likely that Christianization of the rural population would have proceeded slowly, if at all.Between 639 and 641, Muslim Arabs conquered Egypt from the Byzantine Empire. Makuria, which by this time had been unified with Nobadia, fended off two subsequent Muslim invasions, one in 641/642 and another in 652. In the aftermath, Makuria and the Arabs agreed to sign the Baqt, a peace treaty that included a yearly exchange of gifts and socioeconomic regulations between Arabs and Nubians. Alodia was explicitly mentioned in the treaty as not being affected by it. While the Arabs failed to conquer Nubia, they began to settle along the western coast of the Red Sea. They founded the port towns of Aydhab and Badi in the 7th century and Suakin, first mentioned in the 10th century.

Answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What institution was recommended by William Laver? ? Except for three months' formal schooling as a 12-year-old, during which he was bullied and ridiculed by his classmates, Percy was educated at home. Rose, an autodidact with a dominating presence, supervised his music and literature studies and engaged other tutors for languages, art and drama. From his earliest lessons, Percy developed a lifelong fascination with Nordic culture; writing late in life, he said that the Icelandic Saga of Grettir the Strong was \\"the strongest single artistic influence on my life\\". As well as showing precocious musical talents, he displayed considerable early gifts as an artist, to the extent that his tutors thought his future might lie in art rather than music. At the age of 10 he began studying piano under Louis Pabst, a German immigrant then considered to be Melbourne's leading piano teacher. Grainger's first known composition, \\"A Birthday Gift to Mother\\", is dated 1893. Pabst arranged Grainger's first public concert appearances, at Melbourne's Masonic Hall in July and September 1894. The boy played works by Bach, Beethoven, Schumann and Scarlatti, and was warmly complimented in the Melbourne press.After Pabst returned to Europe in the autumn of 1894, Grainger's new piano tutor, Adelaide Burkitt, arranged for his appearances at a series of concerts in October 1894, at Melbourne's Royal Exhibition Building. The size of this enormous venue horrified the young pianist; nevertheless, his performance delighted the Melbourne critics, who dubbed him \\"the flaxen-haired phenomenon who plays like a master\\". This public acclaim helped Rose to decide that her son should continue his studies at the Hoch Conservatory in Frankfurt, Germany, an institution recommended by William Laver, head of piano studies at Melbourne's Conservatorium of music. Financial assistance was secured through a fund-raising benefit concert in Melbourne and a final recital in Adelaide, after which mother and son left Australia for Europe on 29 May 1895. Although Grainger never returned permanently to Australia, he...

By David Martosko, U.s. Political Editor Two former Chris Christie appointees have met with federal prosecutors about the 'Bridgegate' fiasco, adding new fuel to the fire just weeks after a report commissioned by the New Jersey governor appeared to clear his name. Former Port Authority official David Wildstein and former Christie chief counsel Charlie McKenna have both begun the process of disentangling themselves from scandal swirling around the Republican governor, according to liberal bloggers at Esquire magazine and the online legal publication Main Justice. U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman, the New Jersey prosecutor who succeeded Christie in that office, has begun presenting evidence to a grand jury. Longtime Christie press secretary Michael Drewniak has been in and out of those proceedings. According to multiple witnesses at Christie's going-away party in the U.S. Attorney's office, Fishman – angry at Christie for taking so many skilled lawyers with him to the governor's office – threw a copy of a OPTIONS: - Bridgegate directory of lawyers at his feet, saying he should consult it before embarking on his next recruiting binge. - Charlie McKenna directory of lawyers at his feet, saying he should consult it before embarking on his next recruiting binge. - Chris Christie directory of lawyers at his feet, saying he should consult it before embarking on his next recruiting binge. - Christie directory of lawyers at his feet, saying he should consult it before embarking on his next recruiting binge. - David Martosko directory of lawyers at his feet, saying he should consult it before embarking on his next recruiting binge. - David Wildstein directory of lawyers at his feet, saying he should consult it before embarking on his next recruiting binge. - Democratic directory of lawyers at his feet, saying he should consult it before embarking on his next recruiting binge. - Esquire magazine directory of lawyers at his feet, saying he should consult it before embarking on his next recruiting binge. - George Washington Bridge directory of lawyers at his feet, saying he should consult it before embarking on his next recruiting binge. - Longtime Christie directory of lawyers at his feet, saying he should consult it before embarking on his next recruiting binge. - Main Justice directory of lawyers at his feet, saying he should consult it before embarking on his next recruiting binge. - Michael Drewniak directory of lawyers at his feet, saying he should consult it before embarking on his next recruiting binge. - New Jersey directory of lawyers at his feet, saying he should consult it before embarking on his next recruiting binge. - Paul Fishman directory of lawyers at his feet, saying he should consult it before embarking on his next recruiting binge. - Port Authority directory of lawyers at his feet, saying he should consult it before embarking on his next recruiting binge. - Republican directory of lawyers at his feet, saying he should consult it before embarking on his next recruiting binge. - U.S. directory of lawyers at his feet, saying he should consult it before embarking on his next recruiting binge. - U.s. directory of lawyers at his feet, saying he should consult it before embarking on his next recruiting binge. - US directory of lawyers at his feet, saying he should consult it before embarking on his next recruiting binge.","completion":"The correct answer is: - New Jersey directory of lawyers at his feet, saying he should consult it before embarking on his next recruiting binge.

What's Your Influence Score IMAGINE a world in which we are assigned a number that indicates how influential we are. This number would help determine whether you receive a job, a hotel-room upgrade or free samples at the supermarket. If your influence score is low, you don’t get the promotion, the suite or the complimentary cookies. This is not science fiction. It’s happening to millions of social network users. If you have a Facebook, Twitter or LinkedIn account, you are already being judged — or will be soon. Companies with names like Klout, PeerIndex and Twitter Grader are in the process of scoring millions, eventually billions, of people on their level of influence — or in the lingo, rating “influencers.” Yet the companies are not simply looking at the number of followers or friends you’ve amassed. Rather, they are beginning to measure influence in more nuanced ways, and posting their judgments — in the form of a score — online. To some, it’s an inspiring tool — one that’s encouraging the democratization of influence. No longer must you be a celebrity, a politician or a media personality to be considered influential. Social scoring can also help build a personal brand. To critics, social scoring is a brave new technoworld, where your rating could help determine how well you are treated by everyone with whom you interact. “Now you are being assigned a number in a very public way, whether you want it or not,” said Mark W. Schaefer, an adjunct professor of marketing at Rutgers University and the executive director of Schaefer Marketing Solutions. “It’s going to be publicly accessible to the people you date, the people you work for. It’s fast becoming mainstream.” Influence scores typically range from 1 to 100. On Klout, the dominant player in this space, the average score is in the high teens. A score in the 40s suggests a strong, but niche, following. A 100, on the other hand, means you’re Justin Bieber. On PeerIndex, the median score is 19. A perfect 100, the company says, is “god-like.” Companies are still refining their methodologies — sifting through data and evaluating other networking sites. This month, Klout announced that it was beginning to incorporate LinkedIn profiles. As Azeem Azhar, chief executive of PeerIndex, put it, “We’re at the start of this journey and we expect the journey to take us into much more nuance and granularity.” Marketers are signing on. More than 2,500 companies are using Klout’s data. Last week, Klout revealed that Audi would begin offering promotions to Facebook users based on their Klout score. Last year, Virgin America used the company to offer highly rated influencers in Toronto free round-trip flights to San Francisco or Los Angeles. In Las Vegas, the Palms Hotel and Casino is using Klout data to give highly rated guests an upgrade or tickets to Cirque du Soleil. “For the first time, we’re all on an even playing field,” said Joe Fernandez, the chief executive and co-founder of Klout. “For the first time, it’s not just how much money you have or what you look like. It’s what you say and how you say it.” How does one become an influencer? After analyzing 22 million tweets last year, researchers at Hewlett-Packard found that it’s not enough to attract Twitter followers — you must inspire those followers to take action. That could mean persuading them to try Bikram yoga, donate to the Sierra Club or share a recipe for apple pie. In other words, influence is about engagement and motivation, not just racking up legions of followers. Industry professionals say it’s also important to focus your digital presence on one or two areas of interest. Don’t be a generalist. Most importantly: be passionate, knowledgeable and trustworthy. Still, scoring is subjective and, for now, imperfect: most analytics companies rely heavily on a user’s Twitter and Facebook profiles, leaving out other online activities, like blogging or posting YouTube videos. As for influence in the offline world — it doesn’t count. Mr. Azhar, of PeerIndex, calls this “the Clay Shirky problem,” referring to the writer and theorist who doesn’t use Twitter much. “He’s obviously massively influential,” Mr. Azhar said, “and right now he has a terrible PeerIndex.” Jeremiah Owyang, an analyst with Altimeter Group, a digital-strategy consulting firm, wrote a few months ago that using a single metric to evaluate influence is dangerous. He noted that Klout “lacks sentiment analysis” — so a user who generates a lot of digital chatter might receive a high score even though what’s being said about the user is negative. Also, a single metric can be misleading: someone with little Twitter experience can snag a high score if they happen to post a video that goes viral. More broadly, Mr. Schaefer of Schaefer Marketing and others are concerned that we are moving closer to creating “social media caste systems,” where people with high scores get preferential treatment by retailers, prospective employers, even prospective dates. No wonder some people are trying to game their scores. Attaining true influence requires time and commitment. And while your flesh-and-blood self deserves a break every now and then, your digital self will pay the price. “I went on vacation for two weeks,” said Mr. Schaefer, “and my Klout score went down.” Stephanie Rosenbloom is a style reporter for The New York Times. What is a short summary of the above article?","completion":"The article discusses the rise in influence scores, assigned through companies such as Klout, PeerIndex, and Twitter Grader, which determine an individual's level of influence on social media platforms. These scores are not just based on the number of followers or friends, but also on more nuanced aspects such as engagement and motivation. The scores are being used to determine access to promotions, job offers, and other opportunities.

Analysis: Option 1 relies on air circulation for the spread of the fragrance, which could result in a less consistent and weaker scent. It also requires a fan, which might not be energy efficient or suitable in all environments (e.g., outdoors or in a quiet room). Option 2 is a more controlled and sustainable approach, as it provides consistent fragrance in the desired area. It is also applicable in various environments and doesn't require additional devices like a fan. Conclusion: Option 2 (dip fake flower stem in scented oils) is the better solution for the goal of achieving flower fragrance, given its effectiveness, practicality, and sustainability."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the full anglicized name of the person whose later biographer tentatively accepted the epithet of Scotsman coined by John Evelyn? ? John Michael Wright, who at the height of his career would interchangeably sign himself \\"Anglus\\" or \\"Scotus\\", is of uncertain origin. The diarist John Evelyn called him a Scotsman, an epithet repeated by Horace Walpole and tentatively accepted by his later biographer, Verne. However, writing in 1700, the English antiquarian Thomas Hearne claims Wright was born in Shoe Lane, London and, after an adolescent conversion to Roman Catholicism, was taken to Scotland by a priest. A London birth certainly seems supported by a baptismal record, dated 25 May 1617, for a \\"Mighell Wryghtt\\", son of James Wright, described as a tailor and a citizen of London, in St Bride's Church, Fleet Street, London.What is known is that, on 6 April 1636, the 19-year-old Wright was apprenticed to George Jamesone, an Edinburgh portrait painter of some repute. The Edinburgh Register of Apprentices records him as \\"Michaell, son to James W(right), tailor, citizen of London\\". The reasons for this move to Scotland are unclear, but may have to do with familial connections (his parents may have been London Scots) or the advent of plague in London. During his apprenticeship, Wright is likely to have lodged at the High Street tenement near the Netherbow Gate that served as Jameson's workplace. The apprenticeship was contracted for five years, but may have been curtailed by Jameson's imprisonment in late 1639. There is no record of any independent work by Wright from this period (his earliest known painting being a small portrait of Robert Bruce, 1st Earl of Ailesbury, painted in the early 1640s during his time in Rome).It is also possible that Wright met his wife during his Scottish residency. Nothing is known of her, except from a statement of thirty years later which describes her as \\"related to the most noble and distinguished families of Scotland.\\" If this is accurate, it may explain how Wright was later able to find aristocratic patronage. All that is known for certain is that Wright had at least one child by her, a son, Thomas.

Context: Pure is a 1989 studio album by the British band The Primitives, released as the follow-up to their debut, \\"Lovely\\". The line-up changed slightly over the course of the previous year: Steve Dullaghan was replaced on the bass guitar by Paul Sampson, who also shared the production duties with Wayne Morris. Hypothesis: the band has a bass guitar.","completion":"Yes, we can draw the hypothesis that the band has a bass guitar from the given context. The context provided introduces Pure, a 1989 studio album by the British band, The Primitives. It is mentioned that Pure was released as a follow-up to their debut album, \\"Lovely.\\" In addition, the context informs us about the line-up change that occurred over the previous year. We can find information about the bass guitar specifically in the line that reads, \\"Steve Dullaghan was replaced on the bass guitar by Paul Sampson.\\" From this information, we can derive the hypothesis that The Primitives had a bass guitar in their band line-up. The text explicitly states that Dullaghan was replaced by Sampson on the bass guitar. The presence of a bass guitar in their line-up and the change of bass guitarists imply the importance of this instrument in their music production. Furthermore, as Sampson is also mentioned to have shared production duties with Wayne Morris, it can be inferred that the bass guitar played a significant role in shaping the band's sound during the time of the album's release. To summarize, the context provided about The Primitives' album, Pure, gives us enough information to generate the hypothesis that the band has a bass guitar. The change in line-up, specifically the replacement of one bass guitarist with another and the involvement in production duties, emphasizes the crucial role of the bass guitar within the band's musical arrangements."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

They had some good fruity girly drinks I liked, and we shared potato soup which was really good. We decided on the appetizer sampler because supposedly O'Charleys is known for their chicken fingers. They were just like any other kids meal, and the potato skins were nothing special. But the spicy jack cheese wedges were great. They were something different and very tasty! We then moved on to Wild Wing Cafe to spend the next 10 hours of our excursion that day. We returned to O'Charleys later in the week for happy hour, and were very disappointed.

Answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the last name of the person who wanted to start the tour right away? In a letter to his friend and landlord Johann Lorenz Hagenauer (1712–1792), a prominent Salzburg merchant, written after the tour, Leopold quotes the German diplomat Friedrich Melchior, Baron von Grimm, who after hearing the children play had said: \\"Now for once in my life I have seen a miracle: this is the first\\". Leopold believed that it was his duty to proclaim this miracle to the world, otherwise he would be \\"the most ungrateful creature\\". He was said to have described Wolfgang as \\"The miracle which God let be born in Salzburg.\\" Mozart biographer Wolfgang Hildesheimer has suggested that, at least in the case of Wolfgang, this venture was premature: \\"Too soon, [the] father dragged [the] son all over Western Europe for years. This continual change of scene would have worn out even a robust child...\\" However, there is little evidence to suggest that Wolfgang was physically harmed or musically hindered by these childhood exertions; it seems that he felt equal to the challenge from the start.Leopold wanted to begin the tour as soon as possible—the younger the children were, the more spectacular would be the demonstration of their gifts. The route he intended to take included southern Germany, the Austrian Netherlands, Paris, Switzerland and possibly northern Italy. The London leg was only added after urgings during the Paris visit, and the eventual Dutch trip was an unplanned detour. The plan was to take in as many princely European courts as possible, as well as the great cultural capitals—Leopold was relying on his professional musical network and on his more recent social contacts to obtain invitations from the royal courts. Practical assistance came from Hagenauer, whose trading connections in the major cities would supply the Mozarts with what were effectively banking facilities. These would enable them to obtain money en route, while waiting for the proceeds from their performances to accumulate.Wolfgang prepared for the tour by perfecting himself on the violin, which he had learned to play apparently...

Pretty good film from Preminger; labyrinthine at times, as it explores sets and locales from various angles and perspectives as if it were a nature film on the denizens of the modern city and how they live. In this sense it is visually and spatially satisfying, as its hero, a good cop with a bad temper, gets into very hot water when he accidentally kills a guy with a plate in his head. Dana Andrews plays the lead as if it were Hamlet, and has never been better. The story may be pure melodrama but Andrews gives it weight, and almost raises it to the level of tragedy. As his girl, Gene Tierney is attractive but unremarkable. Gary Merrill makes for a very interesting villain, with his natural warmth providing a nice contrast to Andrews' coolness; his smiling, amiable-seeming bad guy seems to be continually challenging his nemesis by the mere fact of his being emotionally open, as opposed to the tightly wound and moralistic cop who is pursuing him. There are no major surprises in this film, which seems transitional for all concerned. For director Preminger it is a reunion of sorts with his Laura stars, Andrews and Tierney, who were passing their career peaks at around the time the movie was made. The supporting cast,--Merrill, Karl Malden, Neville Brand--are, understandably, more optimistic, as they were all on their way up. Preminger, as serene an observer as ever, lets the events unfold without expressing a strong point of view, as the morally ambiguous ending is somewhat disappointing, for the cat and mouse game between the two antagonists seems larger and more archetypal than any mere movie could contain, much less resolve.

Article: As we all know, the ocean moves. But waves breaking on the beach make the ocean fun. When you stand on the shore and look at the waves, it seems like the water is moving towards you. But the water is not really moving forward. The moving you see is wave energy. And wave energy comes from the wind. Let's think about how this works. As wave energy passes through the water, the energy makes particles of water move up and down. Just give you an example of a wave passing under a basketball. We put a basketball on the sea. When the wind blows, a wave comes from behind the basketball. The basketball moves up to the top with the wave. Then the wave continues and leaves the basketball behind. The basketball looks lower, but it doesn't move forward. That's because the wave energy just moves the water which is under the basketball. So why can you see a wave knock you down on the shore?When a wave moves toward the shore, the bottom of the wave slows down because _ meets the ocean floor. But the top, which is called crest , keeps moving. The different action causes the wave to fall over or break onto the shore. If a wave is very large, it carries a lot of energy when it hits the land. As time goes by, waves can break up and carry away the rocks and other things on the shore. Shorelines are changing all the time because of wave action. Question: Which of the following is NOT true according to the passage?

Answer:","completion":"\\"Normal\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense in this context because of the following reasons: Step 1: Understand the context of the question The question is about the \\"kooky kids,\\" indicating that they have some unconventional or eccentric behaviors that set them apart from others. They enjoyed each other's company, meaning they likely share similar interests or perspectives. Step 2: Evaluate the possible answers Let's look at each possible answer in relation to the context of the question: - Ordinary: Although ordinary could also mean usual or conforming to a norm, it may not fully capture the essence of the kids' unique behavior that sets them apart from others. - Straight: Straight usually refers to a more conservative, serious, or conventional demeanor, which contradicts the description of \\"kooky.\\" - Normal: In this context, normal means typical or expected behavior from the perspective of the kids themselves. It implies that their eccentricities are not seen as unusual or strange to them and among their peers. - Cool: Cool is more of a subjective term and often conveys a sense of approval or admiration. However, it doesn't directly address the question of whether their behavior is perceived as normal or not. - Mainstream: Mainstream refers to something that is widely accepted or practiced by the majority. In this case, it does not accurately capture the unique or unconventional nature of the kids' behavior. Step 3: Choose the answer aligned with human common sense Based on the evaluation of the possible answers, \\"normal\\" is the most appropriate answer aligned with human common sense.

Question: Question: how does weather happen I found the following answer on Google: Weather forecasting is the application of science and technology to predict the state of the atmosphere for a future time and a given location. Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. Answer:","completion":"No, the given answer is incorrect as it explains weather forecasting, not how weather occurs. Weather happens due to the complex interaction of the Earth's atmosphere, land surfaces, and oceans. The primary driving forces behind the weather are the energy from the Sun and Coriolis effect from Earth's rotation. This causes various weather phenomena such as wind, clouds, rain, and snow to occur. One crucial element of weather is temperature differences, which are caused by the uneven distribution of solar energy on the Earth's surface. This is influenced by the tilt of the Earth's axis and its rotation as well as the absorption and reflection of solar energy by the atmosphere, land, and ocean. Temperature differences cause warm air to rise and cool air to sink, creating convective currents that transport heat around the planet. The water cycle also plays a significant role in weather formation. The Sun's energy causes water to evaporate from land and bodies of water, which then cools and condenses, forming clouds. Depending on the temperature and atmospheric pressure, these clouds can produce precipitation in the form of rain, snow, sleet, or hail. In addition, the Earth's rotation creates the Coriolis effect, which causes air traveling within the atmosphere to be deflected. This results in the formation of global wind patterns such as the trade winds, polar easterlies, and the jet stream. These components of the Earth's system work together to produce an immense variety of weather conditions experienced around the globe. Various meteorological events, such as cold and warm fronts, low-pressure systems, and high-pressure systems, arise due to the complex interactions between these factors."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Snow fell past the men's basket, and they could see more snow on the ground. The men tried to throw out some more sand; but it was hard. They tried to break the icy sand with their knives, but it was not easy. The work was slow and they were still falling, so they had to drop some whole bags of sand.

Kerry Cabbin, the founder of Tough Cookies Education, which delivers workshops on sex and relationships to teenagers, says the digital age has created a culture where sexual bullying is considered a guide to whether boys like them and more targeted education is needed in the classrooms. Sexual harassment has become a major issue in schools in the UK. This report by the Commons Women and Equalities Committee does not surprise me as it highlights many of the problems that young people face on a daily basis. All too often sexual harassment and bullying is dismissed as banter. The behaviour is considered to be flirtatious or a laugh by pupils. Far too often, young people do not realise that their actions constitute sexual harassment. There's something about secondary school aged children - they are not being educated that this type of behaviour is not right. The MPs' report revealed 29% of 16-18 year old girls had said they have experienced unwanted sexual touching at school. In 2015, a BBC Freedom of Information request found more than 5,500 alleged sex crimes in UK schools were reported to police in the past three years. In 2010, a YouGov poll found 71% of girls had heard the terms \\"slut\\" or \\"slag\\" used towards them at school. Through the workshops we deliver we have found that many young women see sexual harassment as an indication of whether a person likes them or not. It is used as a guide to figure out if a boy fancies them. In the 1970s a boy would ask them out to the cinema, now girls think a boy likes them if they slap their bottom. Young women are no longer feeling empowered. When we spoke to the teenage girls in our workshops, not one of them had been educated before on giving sexual consent. Often, if someone wants to touch them sexually or kiss them they don't feel confident enough to say no. There are not enough girls that feel strong enough to stand up and say this is not acceptable. The digital era has also played a part in this culture. Young people use their mobile phones to communicate so when it comes to verbal interaction it all gets a bit muddled. We have found that young people have become desensitised to sexual language. In this day and age there is no watershed. Young people are exposed to sexual words and they are willing to use them in everyday settings. Girls have become less offended so can hear words such as \\"slag\\" or \\"slut\\" and they don't think it is an issue. Often girls will even use these words themselves. The Commons Women and Equalities Committee made recommendations to the government which included: Young people need to realise that sexual harassment shouldn't be accepted but I wouldn't like to see all of this behaviour criminalised. Pupils are often learning this behaviour from TV. In my day we watched Byker Grove but now children are watching Geordie Shore and Ex on the Beach. They show this type of sexual harassment so teenagers begin to think that it is acceptable. They think \\"oh well, if they're showing it on TV then it must be OK\\". I believe the majority of this inappropriate behaviour is not intended to damage or hurt the person it is targeted towards. It's seen as banter and a bit of fun. Sexual harassment in schools needs to be treated as seriously as bullying. Many schools have moved forward and brought in specialist anti-bullying policies and sexual harassment needs to come under this umbrella. Young people need to be educated and given the confidence to say that this behaviour is not acceptable. I believe that young people would listen to this education and would adapt and change the culture. What was that article about?","completion":"The article discusses the growing issue of sexual harassment in UK schools, a concern highlighted by Kerry Cabbin, founder of Tough Cookies Education. Cabbin mentions how the digital age has indirectly promoted a culture where acts of sexual harassment are often misconstrued as banter or signs of mutual attraction, particularly among teenagers. She reflects on her experiences conducting workshops on sex and relationship education, where she noticed a trend of young women interpreting harassment as an indication of a boy’s interest in them. According to a report by the Commons Women and Equalities Committee, 29% of girls aged 16-18 years confirmed experiencing unwanted sexual touching at school, and the term \\"slut\\" or \\"slag\\" was heard by 71% of girls in school according to a 2010 YouGov poll. A BBC Freedom of Information request in 2015 discovered over 5,500 alleged sex crimes in UK schools reported to the police over the previous three years. Cabbin asserts that an important part of the problem is the lack of education about such issues. Many girls aren't educated about the concept of sexual consent and therefore don't feel confident enough to decline unwanted advances. The rise of the digital era has contributed to ineffective verbal interaction and desensitization towards explicit language. Cabbin advocates that a well-informed dialogue and education about acceptable behaviour is a more appropriate solution rather than legal punishments. The article underlines that a majority of young people erroneously consider such inappropriate behaviour light-hearted and harmless, influenced to a large extent by television shows that normalize such conduct. Cabbin stressed that just like anti-bullying initiatives, sexual harassment needs to be taken seriously in schools, with effective policy implementation and emphasis on a more informed education system that can give young people the confidence to distinguish right from wrong and courageously oppose unacceptable behaviour. This would help to alter the prevailing culture surrounding sexual harassment among young people."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Please answer the following question: Build a movie plot around this: How many people does Jack find in the submerged car? 2 A:","completion":"Title: Depths of Desolation Genre: Thriller/Drama Plot: Our protagonist, Jack Calhoun, is a troubled marine biologist living in a small coastal town. He struggles with past traumas and is slowly piecing his life back together after a tragic boating accident in which he lost his wife and daughter. Jack's boss, Dr. Amelia Hughes, notices his distress and encourages him to take a break to clear his mind. Jack reluctantly agrees and sets off on a solo diving expedition on the beautiful, isolated shoreline of a nearby atoll. As Jack dives into the calm crystal waters, he's captivated by the marine life below. He descends deeper, seeking solace in the aquatic realm far from his terrestrial pain. During his exploration, Jack discovers a submerged car hidden within a cluster of coral and covered in years' worth of algae. Curious about this unusual find, Jack swims closer and is momentarily stunned as he finds two people still inside the car. The two occupants, a man and a woman in their mid-30s, appear to have been trapped for an unexpectedly long time without showing any signs of decay. Puzzled by this discovery, Jack surfaces and reports his findings to Dr. Hughes, who believes the situation merits further investigation. As the town's mystery deepens, the submerged car becomes the center of a web of long-buried secrets and scandals. Through a series of flashbacks, we learn that the couple, Charlotte and Thomas Kingsley, were well-known in the town and had gone missing ten years earlier. The open case had gone cold, and their families had all but given up hope of ever finding them. As Jack and Amelia delve deeper, it becomes apparent that not everything is as it seems; powerful forces within the town had been keen on keeping the lower-profile disappearance a secret. Jack and Amelia embark on a journey to unravel the truth surrounding the couple's disappearance and the eerie preservation of their bodies. They unearth a dangerous, illicit, and morally corrupt marine biotechnology experiment conducted by a group of elite local businessmen, seeking to create a formula for eternal youth. Charlotte and Thomas had discovered the scheme and were silenced before they could expose it. As Jack grows more involved in the case, he's faced with confronting the grief and guilt of his past and learning how these experiences have shaped him. He must find the courage to navigate these complex emotions, all the while determined to bring justice to the wronged couple and reveal the town's dark secrets at any cost. In a thrilling climax, Jack and Amelia confront the mastermind behind the experiment, holding the deceitful businessman accountable for the tragic consequences of his actions. The revelation sends shockwaves through the town, and the entire town participates in dismantling the corrupted enclave that hid the horrors in plain sight. In the end, Depths of Desolation is a poignant tale of redemption, forgiveness, and rebirth. The film explores the power of human connection and resilience in healing from tragedy, even as it confronts the dark side of humanity and the lengths people are willing to go in pursuit of their desires."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:You are presented with the question \\"What do most salamanders use to find a mate?\\" and the following answer choices: - olfaction - sound - seduction - fur and fat - heat energy - air - environment - water Now knowing that most salamanders use their sense of smell to find a mate and olfaction is the sense of smell, choose the best answer. A:","completion":"The best answer to the question \\"What do most salamanders use to find a mate?\\" is olfaction. Salamanders are a diverse group of amphibians, which means they rely on certain cues to find and identify potential mates. One of the primary ways in which salamanders locate and attract mates is through their highly developed sense of smell, known as olfaction. This sense is critical for many aspects of their life, such as finding food, avoiding predators, and seeking out mates. Salamander mating systems are complex, and they often involve chemical communication through the exchange of pheromones. Pheromones are chemical substances secreted by one individual that can have a profound influence on the behavior of other individuals of the same species. In the context of salamander mating, these chemicals help to provide essential information about a potential mate, such as their health, genetic compatibility, and overall reproductive fitness. During the mating process, male salamanders often deposit a spermatophore (a capsule containing sperm) on a suitable substrate, which is later picked up by a receptive female. Olfaction plays a crucial role in this process, as the female needs to be able to detect, locate, and recognize the spermatophore of a male in order to ensure successful fertilization of her eggs. In some instances, male salamanders may even emit specific pheromones that make the spermatophore more appealing to a potential mate. It is worth noting that while olfaction is the primary way most salamanders find a mate, different species may use additional strategies and cues. For example, some salamanders may use visual displays or tactile interactions to supplement their chemical communication. Despite these variations, olfaction remains the most essential sense for the majority of salamanders when it comes to finding and securing a suitable mate. Given the importance of their sense of smell in the process of mate-finding, it is clear that olfaction is the best answer to the question \\"What do most salamanders use to find a mate?\\" among the given answer choices. The other options, such as sound, seduction, fur and fat, heat energy, air, environment, and water, are either unrelated, overly broad, or not specific to the mate-finding process for salamanders."},{"prompt":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

Positive scan result and celbrating Coppafeel!'s seventh birthday It was good news for me last week and it's CoppaFeel!'s seventh birthday this week. So a chance to work out how far we've come IT’S not often I share what is actually going on with my health. But last week I got my results from brain and body scans and am happy to say the news was good. My cancer is stable for now and the new drug I am on appears to be working. In all honesty I have been avoiding thinking about my health, let alone sharing any updates, for fear there is something bad going on. Instead I delved deeply into work and any other distraction I could find. I don’t want to be a fair-weather health advocate. I do want to share my cancer story, warts and all, but confronting it and putting into words how I felt leading up to the results was impossible for me. I was completely crippled by negative thoughts. It’s been a difficult few months adjusting to new treatments, a new oncologist and a new outlook on my healing. There have been moments when I felt completely overwhelmed, completely out of hope and entirely shattered by it all. Those moments make the good ones all the better, so on hearing that my cancer was stable I let out a pretty big sigh of relief – although it’s early days and we shouldn’t really be getting too excited. It’s celebrations all round as this week we also toast CoppaFeel!’s seventh birthday. It’s seven years since we got our official six-digit charity number. On the same day I also had my breast removed. So although I lost a boob, I gained a purpose: To spread boob love far and wide (which I would have done with or without getting charity status, it just helps to do it with). It makes me chuckle at how little I knew about running a charity back then. I think fondly about my naivety, stubbornness and determination and I am glad I knew so little. Had I known then what I do now, I think I’d have been put off. We recently carried out our annual research to determine whether CoppaFeel!’s impact actually changes behaviour – whether you lot actually check your boobs.

Article: A portable lung which could help those with breathing problems lead a normal life is being developed by scientists. The Swansea University scientists say it could take many years before the device , the size of a spectacle box , is available . Lung patients , who have seen how it would work , have welcomed the research. Its research suggests that one person in every seven in the UK is affected by lung disease---- this equates to approximately 8 million people. As of 6 March 2009, 217 people were on the waiting list for a lung transplant according to figures by NHS Blood and Transplant . Now scientists in Swansea are developing a portable artificial lung which could transform the lives of patients . Researchers claim that in the long term the device could offer an alternative to lung transplant , giving hope to those who suffer from conditions such as emphysema and cystic fibrosis. The device mimics the function of a lung---by getting oxygen into and carbon dioxide out of the blood stream . Professor Bill Johns came up with the idea after his son died of Cystic Fibrosis . It is important that we make something that will help people , who instead of being confined to a wheelchair with an oxygen bottle , can actually walk around and do things for themselves , he said. Although the research has been welcomed by leading charities , caution has also been voiced over the length of time it will take before a portable lung will become available . \\"We have to stress that this is several years away from being used , even in a trial stage,\\" said Chris Mulholland , head of the British Lung Foundation. Patient Elizabeth Spence from Swansea has been refused the double lung transplant she needs but remains hopeful that one day the new device could save her . \\" My body will reject the lungs , so this possibly could be an answer--- another way of getting new lungs without actually having the transplant,\\" she said.

Step 2: Identify the information in Sentence 2 \\"Brinkley has made history in cheerleading for her innovative techniques.\\" - Brinkley has achieved something historical or significant in the field of cheerleading. - This achievement is related to her innovative techniques.

Identify the main information given in the question: total amount borrowed (325,000), the ratio between the first and second mortgage (80%), and the annual interest rates (4% and 9%). 2. Calculate the amount of the first and second mortgage using the ratio: First mortgage: 80% of 325,000 = 0.8 * 325,000 = 260,000 Second mortgage: the remaining 20% = 325,000 - 260,000 = 65,000 3. Calculate the annual interest for each mortgage by using their interest rates: First mortgage interest: 4% of 260,000 = 0.04 * 260,000 = 10,400 Second mortgage interest: 9% of 65,000 = 0.09 * 65,000 = 5,850 4. Combine both annual interests to find the total annual interest: Total annual interest = 10,400 (first mortgage) + 5,850 (second mortgage) = 16,250 5. Convert the annual interest to monthly interest by dividing by 12: Monthly interest = 16,250 / 12 = 1,354.17 (approximately) 6.

His publisher, Macmillan, was demanding a manuscript of the poem/novel Tarantula. Manager Albert Grossman had scheduled a concert tour for the latter part of the year. On July 29, 1966, Dylan crashed his 500cc Triumph Tiger 100 motorcycle near his home in Woodstock, New York, and was thrown to the ground. Though the extent of his injuries was never disclosed, Dylan said that he broke several vertebrae in his neck. Mystery still surrounds the circumstances of the accident since no ambulance was called to the scene and Dylan was not hospitalized. Dylan's biographers have written that the crash offered Dylan the chance to escape the pressures around him. Dylan confirmed this interpretation in his autobiography: \\"I had been in a motorcycle accident and I'd been hurt, but I recovered. Truth was that I wanted to get out of the rat race.\\" Dylan withdrew from public and, apart from a few appearances, did not tour again for almost eight years.Once Dylan was well enough to resume creative work, he began to edit D.

Beyoncé seemed to notice the slow trickle of blood coming off her lobe during a performance of “Haunted” and, after calmly clocking the carnage, she warmly asked the crowd how they were doing. Beyoncé fans watching the livestream of the concert, however, reacted with a little less chill. Soon the hashtag #CutForBeyonce started trending, with fans offering to slice themselves open all for the love of Bey.

But perhaps you didn’t know it could go this far. The following video shows the exact moment when the earring ripped—thanks, it seems, to Beyoncé’s long braid. She pauses, walks to the side, and is back to her elaborate head-whipping choreography within seconds. But it’s that image of the singer dispassionately recognizing her own blood and soldiering on anyway that will stick with the entire BeyHive. We could all learn a little something from the steel in Beyoncé’s spine. ||||| Tweet with a location You can add location information to your Tweets, such as your city or precise location, from the web and via third-party applications.

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Hanna Context: Hanna Heller (Saoirse Ronan) is a 15-year-old girl who lives with her father, Erik Heller (Eric Bana) in the wilderness of Finland. When she is first seen, she is hunting a reindeer which she shoots with a bow and arrow. Hanna chases the animal until she comes across it, collapsed. She comments that the arrow missed the heart and then she finishes off the reindeer with one shot.Ever since she was born, Hanna has been trained by Erik to become an assassin. As part of her training, she has never come into contact with modern technology and has memorized a series of fake back stories for herself to be used when the time comes.One night, Hanna approaches Erik and tells him that she is \\"ready\\", and he retrieves a box containing an old transmitter, which he gives to her. After analyzing the situation, Hanna flips the switch, sending a signal of her location to Marissa Wiegler (Cate Blanchett), a corrupt CIA agent. Marissa sends a team to Erik's cabin, where Hanna, who had been waiting for them, is captured and taken to a CIA safe house in Morocco. There, she discovers that Erik is a former CIA agent who betrayed the agency and knows a secret that can't become public. Marissa has been assigned to kill him, but Hanna has been trained to kill Marissa by Erik. Knowing that Hanna was captured too easily, Marissa sends a body double (Michelle Dockery) to speak with Hanna. Hanna kills the false Marissa, breaks free and escapes the compound.While on the run through the desert, she meets Sebastian (Jason Flemyng) and Rachel (Olivia Williams), and befriends their daughter Sophie (Jessica Barden). They decide to help her go to Berlin, after she tells them her fake back story. Meanwhile, Marissa hires a mercenary called Isaacs (Tom Hollander) to capture Hanna while she goes after Erik, who is in Germany. Later, Isaacs and his men corner Hanna and the family, but she manages to escape after killing one of Isaacs' men. The boy of the captured family, who has a crush on Hanna, is tricked into telling Marissa that Hanna is heading...","completion":"to Berlin. In Berlin, Hanna manages to find the address of an old friend of Erik's, named Knepfler (Martin Wuttke), who runs an abandoned amusement park. She requests him to help her reunite with her father. Meanwhile, Marissa and Isaacs follow Hanna's trail and close in on her location. Hanna and Erik are ultimately reunited at the amusement park, but their reunion is short-lived as Marissa and her associates arrive at the scene shortly after. Marissa chases Hanna through the twisted and eerie amusement park, with the thrilling pursuit taking the characters through various attractions, including dilapidated funhouses, overgrown roller coaster tracks, and abandoned carousels. The climax of the chase between Marissa and Hanna occurs in the central area of the amusement park, where an intense standoff between the two takes place. Hanna, utilizing her extensive training and expert combat skills, manages to gain the upper hand in the confrontation. Finally, she succeeds in defeating Marissa, ultimately avenging her father, who was killed by Isaacs and his men during the pursuit at the amusement park. Hanna's quest for vengeance, survival, and the truth about her origins and Erik's past culminates in this prolonged chase sequence through the haunting grounds of the abandoned amusement park in Berlin. Throughout the film, the cat-and-mouse game between Marissa and Hanna showcases both the physical and psychological aspects of the intense chase, with Hanna becoming more resourceful and determined to protect herself and those she cares about, while Marissa constantly tries to maintain control and manipulate those around her to achieve her objectives."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Someone enduring emotional hardship may struggle to be decisive, or may simply not know how to behave or what to do. This is an indication of vulnerability, and is an entirely natural reaction to distress. They may not even want to talk about whatever happened, and you shouldn’t push them to do so unless someone else’s safety or well-being depends on it. If someone insists they need space, give it to them. Tell them you’ll check back with them in a few days. Let them know they can contact you whenever they wish to do so and that you’re there for them whenever they want to spend time together. Don’t be incessant, but make sure you behave in a way that lets them know you’re still thinking about them, and that their wellbeing matters to you. Call or send a card if a week goes by without hearing from them. Avoid texting, emailing, or using social media to convey condolences, as these communication tools are informal and impersonal. Don’t avoid or ignore someone because you’re uncomfortable with what they’re going through or don’t know how to talk to them. If you’re uncertain about what to do or say, convey your condolences and ask if there is anything you can do. If they seem to want you around but aren’t saying much, don’t let their silence bother you. Don’t allow your own nervousness to lead you to talk nonstop. Remind yourself that they may simply want your company. Feel free to ask questions about how they’re feeling, or what they’re thinking about. If they are persistently thinking about whatever happened, they likely need to talk about to it release any pent-up emotions. Avoid asking someone how they feel if you run into them at a social function. While you should encourage them to talk about how they’re feeling, do so in an environment where you have privacy and can give them your full attention. Following a traumatic incident, some people will be physically exhausted or depressed. They may sleep more than usual, and may let struggle to complete everyday chores. Help out by doing a load of laundry or cleaning the dishes. Take care not to do everything though, as this may impede their recovery or make them feel pitied. People need to feel capable of taking care of themselves, even when they need a bit of help doing so. When the person seems ready, ask them what they plan to do. Don’t be surprised if they do not know or are not excited to talk about it. Provide some potential routes that they might take while offering to help them do so. Even when making recommendations, try to do more listening than talking, and only offer actionable advice. Any suggestions you make should be based on things they’ve said themselves. Asking them who and what they think might help is a good place to start. Stay alert for any signs of worsening emotional distress. If you ever have the inclination that they need professional help, encourage them to get it. Be prepared to do so by having the contact information to relevant people and organizations available.

Is the following review positive or negative? I ate here out of default. I should've known better than to settle for a random restaurant, but I was starving and so was my boyfriend and his mom. My bf's mother had just checked in to her room and taking the time to research a good restaurant or walk around to find something familiar would've taken too long. I ordered the Salt & Pepper Pork because I loved eating Salt & Pepper chicken back home & figured this would taste similar. My bf ordered the Honey Walnut Shrimp & Scallop Fried Rice (which didn't really have scallops. Scallop flakes were just mixed in with the rice). His mother ordered a seafood soup. The food came out and the soup was the first thing that I had. It tasted okay. The seafood in it was bland. Then I went for the Salt & Pepper Pork. The first bite that I took, I spit out. It tasted like fat! So I bit into the other end and it was still fat! So i tried another piece just to see if I just happened to get a fat piece the first time, but nope! The second piece that I tried was fatty too! Hated it!!! I went for the rice next and it wasn't so bad. Not as flavorful but it was definitely better than the fat that I had just eaten. Sad that the meal wasn't going as well as I had hoped, I was willing to give the Honey Walnut Shrimp a chance. Wrong decision. It was nasty!! The glaze didn't taste anything like the typical Honey Walnut Shrimp glaze that I was used to. Tasted like fatty mayo was glazed all over it.

I wondered if they actually liked their food cuz non of them had that disgusted/dissatisfied look on their faces. It could be that they weren't as affected by the food because they were enjoying each other's company, or it could also be that they weren't starving before they ate, so they weren't as let down as I was.

Please answer the following question: It would be very unadvisable to place a can of soup over a campfire without venting the can. As the can heats up, it may explode. The kinetic-molecular theory explains why. The air inside the rigid can of soup is given more kinetic energy by the heat coming from the campfire. The kinetic energy causes the air molecules to move faster and they impact the container walls more frequently and with more force. The increase in pressure inside may eventually exceed the strength of the can and it will explode. An additional factor is that the soup may begin boiling which will then aid even more gas and more pressure to the inside of the can. When studying the kinetic-molecular theory, two teams of students did and experiment. Team A heated a can of soup over the fire without venting it first, team B heated a can of soup, but vented it first. Which team had a higher likelihood of their can exploding? Answer:","completion":"Team A had a higher likelihood of their can exploding due to not venting their can of soup before placing it over the campfire. As explained by the kinetic-molecular theory, heating the can without venting it causes a significant increase in pressure inside the can, which may eventually lead to an explosion. When the can is heated, the air molecules inside gain more kinetic energy from the heat coming from the campfire. This increased kinetic energy causes air molecules to move faster, impacting the container's walls with more force and more frequently. As a result, the pressure inside the can rises. In addition to the increase in pressure from the heated air, the soup itself may start boiling due to the heat. The boiling soup aids in the production of even more gas, which further increases the pressure inside the can. In an unvented can, this additional pressure has nowhere to escape, further increasing the risk of explosion. On the other hand, Team B vented their can of soup prior to heating it up, which allowed for pressure to be released during the heating process. As pressure from the heated air and boiling soup was allowed to escape through the vent, there was a significantly lower risk of explosion. In conclusion, Team A, who heated their can of soup without venting it first, had a higher likelihood of experiencing an explosion due to the buildup of pressure within the can as a result of the heating and boiling process. The kinetic-molecular theory helps explain this phenomenon and demonstrates the importance of venting a can of soup before heating it over a campfire to avoid dangerous situations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the following context: The two sides to Poulenc's musical nature caused misunderstanding during his life and have continued to do so. The composer Ned Rorem observed, \\"He was deeply devout and uncontrollably sensual\\"; this still leads some critics to underrate his seriousness. His uncompromising adherence to melody, both in his lighter and serious works, has similarly caused some to regard him as unprogressive. Although he was not much influenced by new developments in music, Poulenc was always keenly interested in the works of younger generations of composers. Lennox Berkeley recalled, \\"Unlike some artists, he was genuinely interested in other people's work, and surprisingly appreciative of music very far removed from his. I remember him playing me the records of Boulez's Le marteau sans maître with which he was already familiar when that work was much less well-known than it is today.\\" Boulez did not take a reciprocal view, remarking in 2010, \\"There are always people who will take an easy intellectual path. Poulenc coming after Sacre [du Printemps]. It was not progress.\\" Other composers have found more merit in Poulenc's work; Stravinsky wrote to him in 1931: \\"You are truly good, and that is what I find again and again in your music\\".In his last years Poulenc observed, \\"if people are still interested in my music in 50 years' time it will be for my Stabat Mater rather than the Mouvements perpétuels.\\" In a centenary tribute in The Times Gerald Larner commented that Poulenc's prediction was wrong, and that in 1999 the composer was widely celebrated for both sides of his musical character: \\"both the fervent Catholic and the naughty boy, for both the Gloria and Les Biches, both Les Dialogues des Carmélites and Les Mamelles de Tirésias.\\" At around the same time the writer Jessica Duchen described Poulenc as \\"a fizzing, bubbling mass of Gallic energy who can move you to both laughter and tears within seconds. His language speaks clearly, directly and humanely to every generation.\\" answer the following question: What is the last name of the person who was genuinely interested in other people's work, and surprisingly appreciative of music very far removed from his?","completion":"The last name of the person who was genuinely interested in other people's work, and surprisingly appreciative of music very far removed from his is Poulenc."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Article: KATHMANDU, Nepal (CNN) - Nepal has given its security personnel permission to shoot pro-Tibet demonstrators during China's Olympic flame climb to Mount Everest's summit early next month. \\"About 25 soldiers and policemen have established camps on the mountain and they have been ordered to use force if necessary to stop any anti-Chinese activities,\\" Mod Raj Dotel, spokesman for the home ministry, said Sunday. \\"This could mean shooting if necessary.\\" Security personnel will also check mountain climbers for non-essential expedition materials, Dotel added. \\"If anyone is found with anti-Chinese material their permit will be canceled and returned from the mountain,\\" he said. Chinese climbers plan to take the Olympic flame to the top of the world's highest peak, at 8,848 meters (29,028 feet) as part of the global relay leading up to the August 8 opening of the Summer Olympics in Beijing. Spring is the most popular season for climbing Mount Everest, which straddles the border between Nepal and Tibet, an autonomous region of China. The Nepali government has given permits to dozens of climbers from 30 expeditions this season. But between May 1 and May 10, climbers are _ from going above 6,400 meters until the torch run is completed. China plans to take the Olympic flame to the summit sometime then. Bad weather conditions allow only about two opportunities in May for a push to the summit. The Chinese have not allowed any expedition to climb the mountain from the north side, according the Kathmandu representative of the Tibet China Mountaineering Association. Almost every day in the past month, Nepalese police have arrested pro-Tibet protesters from in front of the Chinese Embassy and the United Nations offices. The demonstrators are released later in the evening. Supporters of Tibet punish the government's attitude toward the autonomous region, and many believe China should not have been awarded the honor of hosting the Olympic Games.

Premise: 8 million can't be disappointing, and the press is wailing about disappointing grosses to atone for overhyping the film. Hypothesis: The press is exaggerating the disappointing gross to make up for overhyping the film. Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","completion":"Entailment in a logical argument refers to a relationship between statements where the truth of one statement requires the truth of another. It indicates that if the premises are true, then the hypothesis also must be true. In the case at hand, the premise is hinting at some disappointment concerning the gross earnings of a film, which the press had previously overhyped. It suggests that 8 million cannot be seen as disappointing yet the press is painting it as such. It seems to be criticizing the press for overexposing or overselling the film, leading to inflated expectations, and then exaggerating the disappointing results when it did not meet those expectations. The hypothesis then simplifies this sentiment saying, \\"The press is exaggerating the disappointing gross to make up for overhyping the film.\\" It suggests that the press, realizing its prior overhyping was misplaced, is now trying to balance that by blowing the 'disappointing' earnings out of proportion. Despite some slight differences in expression, both the premise and the hypothesis communicate the same fundamental assertion: that the press overhyped the movie and is now exaggerating its disappointment over the movie's gross revenue. This indicates that there is an entailment relationship between the premise and the hypothesis, as the latter essentially reframes the former in simpler terms.

Hundreds of thousands of years before China was to become the world's longest-running civilization, the prologue was enacted by means of the flicker of a carefully tended fire. Peking Man, a forebear of Homo sapiens, achieved a mastery of fire. We might call it the first Chinese invention. Not that he devised flint and steel, matches, or any other way of creating fire. Peking Man simply learned how to capture flame, perhaps from a forest fire, and keep it alight. He thus enjoyed two revolutionary luxuries: light and heat. Technologically and sociologically, it was a phenomenal breakthrough: with fire, communities could live year 'round in one cave, in which cooking and even smelting could be pursued. And so, by 600,000 b.c., about 50 km (31 miles) southwest of present-day Beijing, the ancestors of mankind were ready to settle down. Several hundred thousand years later, when Marco Polo reached the capital of China, he was astonished by a further development in fire technology. The Chinese, he announced, used black stones dug out of mountains as fuel. Europeans did not yet have a word for \\"coal,\\" nor had they discovered a use for it. The First Dynasty The confluence of mythology and history in China took place around 4,000 years ago during what is referred to as the Xia (Hsia) Dynasty. This was still the Stone Age, but the people are thought to have made silk from thread produced by the worms they cultivated on the leaves of their mulberry trees. And written language (which evolved as early as 4,500 to 5,000 years ago) was already in use, originally by oracles and then by official scribes — China's first scholars. During the second of the quasi-legendary dynasties, the Shang (from about the 16th to 11th centuries b.c.), the Chinese developed an interest in art. Careful geometric designs as well as dragon and bird motifs adorned bowls and implements. And with the arrival of the Bronze Age, the Chinese created bronze vessels of such beauty and originality that, until modern times, archaeologists refused to believe they were cast 3,000 years ago. The Shang Dynasty gave rise to the concept of one Chinese nation under one government.

Step 2: Analyze the connection between the two parts Owls' hearing and their ability to locate prey is related to the animal kingdom, particularly their hunting and survival abilities. The amount of sunlight gathered by plants is related to the plant kingdom, specifically, the process of photosynthesis which affects plants' growth. Step 3: Determine any possible influence between the two factors The inability of owls to locate their prey does not have any direct influence on the process of photosynthesis or the sunlight-gathering abilities of plants. The two factors belong to different aspects of the ecosystem and do not necessarily interact in this particular context. Step 4: Conclusion Since there is no direct influence or connection between the owls' hearing ability and the sunlight gathered by the plant, the answer to the question would be C: no effect.

Background: The brains of all mammals have a unique layer of nerve cells covering the cerebrum. This layer is called the neocortex (the pink region of the brains in Figure above ). The neocortex plays an important role in many complex brain functions. In some mammals, such as rats, the neocortex is relatively smooth. In other mammals, especially humans, the neocortex has many folds. The folds increase the surface area of the neocortex. The larger this area is, the greater the mental abilities of an animal.

ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- The United States knows that the leader of Pakistan's Taliban is dead because he has not appeared in public to prove that he is alive, the top U.S. envoy to the region told CNN on Monday. Baitullah Mehsud, right, and a bodyguard arrive at a meeting in South Waziristan, Pakistan, in 2004. Richard Holbrooke said that the Pakistani Taliban have not confirmed the death of Baitullah Mehsud because of an ongoing power struggle over his successor. \\"The reason it's clear he's dead is that if he weren't dead, he'd be giving TV and radio interviews to prove he's not dead,\\" Holbrooke told CNN's Cal Perry. Mehsud rarely gave news conferences or appeared before the media. There has been conflicting information from the Pakistani Taliban about whether Mehsud died in a suspected U.S. missile strike earlier this month. Watch Holbrooke say Mehsud is dead » Last week, Pakistani Taliban spokesman Maulvi Umar told CNN that Mehsud is alive, but ill, and will speak to reporters when he feels better. Other media reports have quoted another spokesman for the group as saying Mehsud is dead and a mourning period is underway. U.S. and Pakistani government officials have said they are confident that Mehsud was killed in the August 5 strike. DNA tests were reportedly being conducted to back up those claims, but U.S. officials have expressed doubt that enough genetic material would be left behind, considering the enormity of the strike. Holbrooke said Mehsud's death has sparked \\"a succession crisis\\" among the Pakistani Taliban. Now, provide a numbered list of answers to these questions: 1. Who is known to have died? 2. How do they know? 3. Has the death been confirmed? 4. Why not? 5. What was the leader's name? 6. When was Mehsud allegedly killed? 7. How is the government testing the claim? 8. Does the government think they'll be successful? 9. Why not? 10. Does anyone claim Mehsud isn't dead? 11. Who? 12. Who is he? 13. What does Umar say about Mehsud? 14. Did Mehsud often go on tv? 15.

The premise offers the following information: 1. There is an upstairs area, which has a gift shop. 2. The entrance to the connecting walkway to the cathedral is also located upstairs. 3. One can climb the tower, which offers an interesting view of the surroundings. From these details, we can deduce that there's a possibility of some visitor amenities being located upstairs, such as the gift shop and the entrance to the walkway. Furthermore, the premise suggests that climbing the tower could be an appealing activity due to the interesting view of the surroundings. However, the premise does not provide any direct information regarding the cost or pricing of any of the activities or amenities, including the walkway. Therefore, it is not possible to definitively infer whether the hypothesis \\"Admission to the walkway is quite expensive\\" is true or false, simply based on the information provided in the premise. In order to determine the validity of the hypothesis, additional information or evidence would be needed. This information could potentially come from a variety of sources, such as pricing details provided by the venue, visitor testimonials or reviews, or comparison to the pricing of similar attractions in the area. In summary, while the premise presents a general layout and various offerings within the area, including the gift shop, connecting walkway, and tower, it does not specifically address the cost of admission to the walkway, leaving the hypothesis \\"Admission to the walkway is quite expensive\\" unsubstantiated."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Slang is a popular, less official and often very current form of language. It is an important part of a living language and is constantly changing as language changes. Slang is often playful, direct and sometimes less respectful than the more official and traditional version of language. So now I'm going to lay it on you! To \\"lay it on\\" is American slang for \\"to tell\\" or \\"to explain.\\" Slang can take many forms. For example, slang can be local to one city or area. In Washington, D.C. there is a whole set of slang to describe politics and business in the city. For example, the term POTUS stands for President of the United States. POTUS can often be found with his wife, FLOTUS, the first lady of the United States. \\"Inside the Beltway\\" is a popular expression that describes the area of Washington, D.C. The beltway is the large highway that circles the city. The Internet has helped create a whole new kind of computer-related slang. An \\"angry fruit salad\\" is an expression that describes a website with too many bright colors. \\"Netiquette\\" is slang for correct behavior when using the Internet. Young people often develop the latest slang. For example, to say Special English \\"rocks\\" or is \\"phat\\" means Special English is really great. A \\"kegger\\" is a party where beer is served. If something is \\"wack\\", it is wild and crazy. Different professions often have their own slang as well. For example, medical workers might refer to a complaining patient as a \\"gomer\\". A \\"tough stick\\" is someone whose veins are difficult to find when he or she needs to have blood taken. No matter how well you speak English, there are always new and interesting slang words to discover. There are entire dictionaries for describing slang. Many experts do not even agree on what is and what is not slang. Often slang words later become a part of officially accepted language.

Problem:[1889, 857, 3079, 3945, 'L', 'e', '8097', '5963', 'Z', 1779, 'f'], [35, 2479, 'L', 'e', '8097', '5963', 'M', 1763, 5785] Solution:","completion":"Task Explanation: The task is asking to find the longest common subsequence in two given lists, A and B. A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. Guidelines: 1. Compute the longest common subsequence between the two lists A and B. Solution: Step 1: First, we need to define a function to compute the longest common subsequence between two lists. def longest_common_subsequence(A, B): lengths = [[(0) for j in range(len(B)+1)] for i in range(len(A)+1)] for i, x in enumerate(A): for j, y in enumerate(B): if x == y: lengths[i+1][j+1] = lengths[i][j] + 1 else: lengths[i+1][j+1] = max(lengths[i+1][j], lengths[i][j+1]) result = [] x, y = len(A), len(B) while x != 0 and y != 0: if lengths[x][y] == lengths[x-1][y]: x -= 1 elif lengths[x][y] == lengths[x][y-1]: y -= 1 else: assert A[x-1] == B[y-1] result.append(A[x-1]) x -= 1 y -= 1 return result[::-1] Step 2: Now, we apply the function to the given lists A and B. A = [1889, 857, 3079, 3945, 'L', 'e', '8097', '5963', 'Z', 1779, 'f'] B = [35, 2479, 'L', 'e', '8097', '5963', 'M', 1763, 5785] lcs = longest_common_subsequence(A, B) Step 3: Print the longest common subsequence. print(\\"Longest Common Subsequence:\\", lcs) The output will be: Longest Common Subsequence: ['L', 'e', '8097', '5963']"},{"prompt":"At the annual performance of the Nutcracker, Jan performed the dance well.

Please answer the following question: Pick the option in line with common sense to answer the question. Questions: What is something that you eat that has a heel? Options: - foot - sandal - loaf of bread - shoe - boot A:","completion":"The option in line with common sense to answer the question, \\"What is something that you eat that has a heel?\\" would be a \\"loaf of bread\\". In the context of food, the term \\"heel\\" is commonly used to refer to both ends of a loaf of bread. The term is believed to have originated because these ends of the bread take on a rounded, heel-like shape as they bake in the oven. This comparison fits because of the product in question and the act of eating mentioned in the question. The remaining options - foot, sandal, shoe, and boot - are items that are typically associated with the physical heel of a human or the lower part of a shoe. They are not items that would commonly be associated with consumption. Therefore, consuming a foot, sandal, shoe, or boot would not typically align with societal norms or indeed dietary norms. Loaf of bread is the only option that fits the context of the question correctly because a loaf of bread is an edible item and the term \\"heel\\" can denote the end parts of a loaf of bread. So, when the question asks for something that can be eaten and that has a heel, \\"loaf of bread\\" is the best option presented. This understanding additionally comes from our knowledge about the customs around the world and the shared understanding in English-speaking societies that \\"heel\\" is the term used for the end slice of bread.

Available options: * no; * yes;","completion":"yes To reduce belly and chest fat, follow these steps: 1. Set realistic goals and track your progress: It is essential to understand that losing belly and chest fat will take time and dedication. Set achievable goals, like losing 1-2 pounds per week, and keep track of your progress regularly. 2. Adopt a healthy diet: One of the most significant aspects of reducing body fat is making healthier food choices. Incorporate a balanced diet consisting of lean proteins, whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and healthy fats, while minimizing processed foods, sugary beverages, and excess salt. 3. Watch your portion sizes: Controlling portion sizes is crucial to cutting down on unwanted calories. Rather than eating large meals, try having smaller meals with regular healthy snacks in between. 4. Monitor calorie intake: To lose body fat, it's necessary to burn more calories than you consume. Make sure you maintain a calorie deficit, which means consuming fewer calories than you burn. 5. Increase physical activity: Engage in regular cardiovascular activities like brisk walking, jogging, swimming, or cycling. Aim for at least 150-300 minutes of moderate-intensity activity or 75-150 minutes of vigorous activity per week. 6. Strength training exercises: Incorporating resistance training, such as weight lifting or bodyweight exercises, helps build lean muscle mass, which can boost your metabolism and help shed body fat. Focus on both upper and lower body exercises to target fat in your chest and belly. 7. Prioritize sleep and stress management: Lack of sleep and high stress levels can lead to weight gain and the retention of belly fat.

Article:Its troops had played a key role in weakening the al-Qaeda-linked al-Shabab group in Somalia, Mr Obama said. He was speaking after talks with Ethiopia's PM Hailemariam Desalegn, during the first ever visit by a US president to the East African state. He also called on Mr Hailemariam to improve Ethiopia's record on human rights and good governance. \\"I don't bite my tongue too much when it comes to these issues,\\" he said at a joint press conference in the capital, Addis Ababa. BBC Africa Live: Obama in Ethiopia updates Some rights groups have criticised Mr Obama's visit, warning that it could lend credibility to a government accused of jailing journalists and critics. A legal case currently being fought through the US courts alleges that agents of the Ethiopian government eavesdropped on the internet activities of a man in the US state of Maryland. The man, born in Ethiopia and now a US citizen, works for a political opposition group outlawed in his home country. Addressing the media, Mr Obama described the Ethiopian government, which won all parliamentary seats in May's election, as \\"democratically elected\\". Opposition group have said the poll was rigged. Mr Hailemariam said Mr Obama's visit had taken a century-long relationship with the US to a \\"new height\\". \\"Our commitment to democracy is real, not skin-deep,\\" he added. Answering a question about press freedom, Mr Hailemariam said Ethiopia wanted \\"civilised journalism\\", and not reporters linked with \\"violent terrorist groups\\". On the security threat by al-Shabab, Mr Obama said there had been a \\"shrinkage\\" of the group since the deployment of regional troops to Somalia, its main base. However, the killing of 15 people in a bomb attack on a hotel in Somalia's capital, Mogadishu, on Sunday was a reminder that \\"we have to now keep the pressure on\\", he said. \\"We don't need to send our own marines in to do the fighting: The Ethiopians are tough fighters and the Kenyans and Ugandans have been serious about what they're doing.\\" Mr Obama flew to Ethiopia after a two-day visit to Kenya where he had discussed trade and security but also called for greater human rights and warned of the dangers of corruption. Compared to the Kenyan leg of his tour, President Obama's arrival in Ethiopia has signalled a more sombre mood. After talks in the ornate setting of the presidential palace, Mr Obama sought to highlight the areas of agreement with his host and tread cautiously over the delicate issue of democratic rights. He praised Mr Hailemariam for the country's contribution to peacekeeping efforts in the region, and said the US wanted to help \\"sustain momentum\\" on Ethiopia's impressive rates of economic growth. Addis Ababa has undergone a massive building boom, thanks in part to substantial Chinese investment But on the thorny issue of press freedom, much still divides the pair. Mr Obama said it was a \\"significant topic of discussion\\", and insisted that a vibrant and free press would strengthen rather than inhibit Ethiopia's development. For his part, the prime minister called for \\"civilised journalism\\" and said Ethiopian journalists needed training. Mr Obama also referred to the civil war in South Sudan ahead of talks with regional leaders on the issue. Government and rebels leaders were \\"extremely stubborn\\", and other \\"tools\\" would have to be considered if there was no breakthrough in ending the conflict, he added. The 19-month war in South Sudan has left thousands of people dead and displaced more than two million. On Tuesday, Mr Obama will also be the first US leader to address the 54-member African Union in Addis Ababa.

Question: suppose a blockage makes the colon Smaller happens, how will it affect MORE food being digested. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect Answer:","completion":"B: Less If a blockage occurs and makes the colon smaller, it will have a significant impact on the digestion process, leading to less food being digested. The colon plays a vital role in the final stages of food digestion, and any obstruction within it can hamper the natural process. To understand the answer better, let's delve deeper into the roles of the colon in digestion and how a blockage in the colon would affect it. The colon, also known as the large intestine, is a critical component of the digestive system with the following primary functions: 1. Water and electrolyte absorption: The colon's first function is to absorb excess water, electrolytes, and some vitamins produced by enteric bacteria. This absorption helps solidify the remaining waste material, known as feces. 2. Bacterial fermentation: The colon houses plenty of beneficial bacteria that aid in the fermentation of any undigested carbohydrates, proteins, and other substances. This process produces essential nutrients, such as short-chain fatty acids, which supply energy to the cells lining the large intestine. 3. Waste storage and expulsion: After the above steps, the remaining waste material is stored in the rectum, the final section of the large intestine. When the body is ready for a bowel movement, the waste is expelled through the anus. Now, consider a blockage occurring in the colon, making it smaller. This obstruction could lead to the following consequences: a. Limited space: The blockage reduces the colon's capacity to hold and process waste material, hindering the proper absorption of water and electrolytes. This limitation could result in diarrhea and dehydration due to the excess water not being absorbed. b. Delayed transit time: With limited space, the movement of undigested food through the colon slows down, affecting the fermentation process. This delay in transit time could lead to constipation and accumulation of gases, causing discomfort and bloating. c. Malabsorption of nutrients: If the blockage is severe, the colon's ability to absorb necessary vitamins and short-chain fatty acids produced by bacterial fermentation can be compromised. This malabsorption could lead to nutritional deficiencies and negatively affect the overall health of the individual. In conclusion, a blockage that makes the colon smaller would significantly impact the normal digestion process, ultimately leading to less food being digested. Possible consequences include diarrhea, constipation, bloating, and malabsorption of vital nutrients."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Knievel was born on October 17, 1938, in Butte, Montana, the first of two children of Robert E. and Ann Marie Keough Knievel. His surname is of German origin; his paternal great-great-grandparents emigrated to the United States from Germany. His mother was of Irish ancestry. Robert and Ann divorced in 1940, after the 1939 birth of their second child, Nicolas, known as Nic. ABC's Wide World of Sports was unwilling to pay the price Knievel wanted for the Snake River Canyon jump, so he hired boxing promoter Bob Arum's company, Top Rank Productions, to put the event on closed-circuit television and broadcast to movie theaters. Investors in the event took a substantial loss, including promoter Don E. Branker, as well as Vince McMahon of the World Wrestling Federation. Arum partnered with Invest West Sports, Shelly Saltman's company, to secure from Invest West Sports two things: first, the necessary financing for the jump, and second, the services of Saltman, long recognized as one of America's premier public relations and promotion men, to do publicity so that Knievel could concentrate on his jumps. Knievel hired subcontractor and aeronautical engineer Doug Malewicki to build him a rocket-powered cycle to jump across the Snake River, and called it the Skycycle X-1. Malwecki's creation was powered by a steam engine built by former Aerojet engineer Robert Truax. On April 15, 1972, the X-1 was launched to test the feasibility of the launching ramp. The decision was then made to have Truax build the Skycycle X-2 and have it take off and fly more like a rocket than a motorcycle. The launch took place at the south rim of the Snake River Canyon, west of Shoshone Falls (42.597degN 114.423degW / 42.597; -114.423), on Sunday, September 8, 1974, at 3:36 p.m. MDT. The steam that powered the engine was superheated to a temperature of 500 degF (260 degC). The drogue parachute prematurely deployed as the Skycycle left the launching rail and induced significant drag. Even though the craft made it all the way across the canyon to the north rim, the prevailing northwest winds caused it to drift back into the canyon. By the time it hit the bottom of the canyon, it landed only a few feet from the water on the same side of the canyon from which it had been launched. If he had landed in the water, Knievel likely would have drowned, due to a jumpsuit/harness malfunction which kept him strapped in the vehicle. He survived the jump with only minor injuries. Since the 1974 launch, seven daredevils have expressed interest in recreating the jump, including Knievel's two sons, Robbie and Kelly. In 2010 Robbie announced he would recreate the jump. Stuntman Eddie Braun announced he was working with Kelly and Robert Truax's son to recreate the jump using a replica of the Skycycle X-2. Braun's jump took place on September 16, 2016, and was completed successfully. when was the launch?","completion":"The launch of the Skycycle X-2, when Knievel tried to jump across the Snake River Canyon, happened on Sunday, September 8, 1974, at 3:36 p.m. MDT."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: The dumbest thing that actually worked? I joined Tinder. Reason I say it was the dumbest is because I still acknowledge that it’s not my kind of dating scene even though I ended up meeting the love of my life through the app. Other than that? Nothing was wrong or dumb. I have done nothing much because the man I am currently dating sent me a superlike after I was on the app for less than 12 hours. I joined, created profile, went through possible matches, and then went to bed. I didn’t have enough time to do something dumb. Now my boyfriend on the other hand was on the app for 4–5 months prior to me joining and him finding me. His story is that he had been in there long enough to end up matching with some bots (robots that somehow end up joining or hacking the app. I have not a clue how) that he would have conversations with to test if they were legitimate people. He would also match with different people who would either immediately block him because he came as weird or he would block them because they came off as weird. When he found me, what he saw in my profile was that I was local, I was a legitimate person because I knew someone that he knew through Facebook, and I had multiple pictures of myself that looked genuine. I also had a description where I stated my intention for using the app which was that I was looking for a serious relationship. What he did after I connected with him was talk to me and then test me as the conversation progressed. How did he test me? He told a corny joke which I laughed to.

(Associated Press) A couple, dressed in Western attire, watch a ceremony at which Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper signed the Civil Unions Act into law at the Colorado History Museum in Denver, Colo., on Thursday, March... (Associated Press) The attitude across the country toward gay rights has been shifting toward acceptance, despite many conservatives' insistence that officially recognized unions, especially marriage, should be only between one man and one woman. The Supreme Court is set to soon hear arguments in two major cases on gay rights, including a challenge to the federal Defense of Marriage Act, which defines marriage as being between one man and one woman, and a challenge to California's ban on gay marriage. Depending on how broadly the court wants to tailor its decisions, they could affect the status of gay rights in all states. With Thursday's action, Colorado will join eight U.S. states that have civil unions or similar laws. Nine states and the District of Columbia allow gay marriage. The law takes effect May 1. Hundreds looked on as Democratic Gov. John Hickenlooper signed the bill, with many chanting \\"Equal! Equal!\\" \\"There is no excuse that people shouldn't have all the same rights,\\" Hickenlooper told the crowd. Civil unions grant gay couples rights similar to marriage, including enhanced inheritance and parental rights. People in civil unions also would have the ability to make medical decisions for their partners. \\"It means I can change my name finally,\\" said 21-year-old Amber Fuentes, who plans to have a civil union with Yolanda Martinez, 34. \\"It's not marriage, but it still gives us a lot of the rights,\\" Martinez said. A Pew Research Center survey found that 49 percent of Americans favor allowing gays and lesbians to marry legally, and 44 percent are opposed. A decade ago, 58 percent opposed it and a third supported it. \\"It's really meaningful. To have the recognition of your love and relationship just like any other relationship by the state is an important both legal and symbolic thing,\\" said Democratic House Speaker Mark Ferrandino, a sponsor of the bill and the first openly gay lawmaker to hold the title of speaker in Colorado. Most Republicans opposed the bill, saying they would've liked to see religious exemptions to provide legal protections for those opposed to civil unions. Churches are shielded under the new law, but Democrats rejected protections for businesses and adoption agencies, arguing the Republican suggestions were too broad and could provide legal cover to discriminate. ___ Find Ivan Moreno on Twitter: http://twitter.com/IvanJourno ||||| Amid cheers and tears, Gov. John Hickenlooper on Thursday signed a civil-unions bill into law, erasing a generation of anguish for supporters of gay rights in what once was dubbed \\"the hate state.\\" \\"Unbelievable,\\" Hickenlooper said, looking at the gays and straight allies who were crammed into the History Colorado Center to watch history being made. Sen. Pat Steadman of Denver, one of four gay Democrats who sponsored Senate Bill 11, recalled that \\"painful\\" night when voters approved Amendment 2, which prohibited laws from protecting gays from discrimination. \\"I was there on election night in 1992 with many of you, and I see your faces in this room,\\" he said. \\"That was a very tragic moment, and yet it gave us so much hope and so much momentum moving forward. We didn't take that defeat sitting down. We were in the streets, and we were in the courtrooms, and we were in the halls of the Capitol building.\\" Steadman quoted from U.S. Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy, who wrote the majority opinion in 1996 that overturned Amendment 2. \\"He wrote, 'A state cannot so deem a class of persons a stranger to its laws,' \\" Steadman said. The atmosphere at the bill-signing was electric, with huge cheers when lawmakers and the governor took to the small stage. Senate Bill 11 gives same-sex couples many but not all of the rights and responsibilities of marriage. It goes into effect May 1. \\"Dearly beloved,\\" Steadman said before the crowd erupted, forcing him to pause before he continued, \\"we're going to make history.\\" Steadman and another gay Denver Democrat, Rep. Mark Ferrandino, have sponsored the civil measures for three years, but the bills died in the previous two sessions when Republicans controlled the House. Last year's bill died a dramatic death although Democrats had enough votes to get it passed through the House. Democrats won back the House majority in November. This year, Steadman and Ferrandino were joined by two other gay sponsors: Rep. Sue Schafer, D-Wheat Ridge, and Sen. Lucia Guzman, D-Denver. \\"What a great day to be a Coloradan,\\" Schafer said. Ferrandino, who now is the House speaker, recognized the \\"courageous Republicans in the House and the Senate who were willing to stand up and do the right thing.\\" The GOP senators who voted for civil unions last year, this year or both are Ellen Roberts of Durango, Jean White of Hayden and Nancy Spence of Centennial. The GOP House supporters are Reps. B.J. Nikkel of Loveland, Don Beezley of Broomfield, Cheri Gerou of Evergreen and Carole Murray of Castle Rock. PHOTOS: Colorado Gov. Hickenlooper signs the civil unions bill Gerou waved at Ferrandino when he called her name. \\"I kept saying it wasn't a matter of if; it was a matter of when,\\" Ferrandino said. \\"It's an amazing day to be here.\\" The speaker said the bill has always been personal but that it has ever more meaning now that he and his partner, Greg Wertsch, have a 15-month-old foster daughter. \\"When I wake up and I go and take her out of her crib and see that smiling face, to know that after the governor signs (the bill) she's going to have the protections just like every other family makes my heart warm,\\" Ferrandino said. Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper planned a news conference at the History Colorado Center. (Craig F. Walker, The Denver Post) Hickenlooper, a former geologist who started Wynkoop Brewing Co. after the oil bust in the 1980s, said that in the early 1990s a gay employee was promoted to general manager. When a couple of customers asked to speak to the owner about the manager, Hickenlooper thought they were going to say what a good job the manager was doing. \\"They said they weren't going to come to our business anymore,\\" the governor recalled. \\"One of our waitresses was standing beside me, and she said, 'You know, that's not going to bother any of us at all.' \\" The anecdote drew laughs, but Hickenlooper talked about how attitudes have changed over time. \\"It is a moment that the whole community has waited for for so long,\\" the governor said. One of his staffers tweeted: \\"From hate state to great state?\\" But Steadman said the civil-unions bill is \\"admittedly imperfect.\\" \\"It is not an extension of equal rights. It is not something that includes us fully and on equal footing with others in society,\\" he said. \\"There is still much to do.\\" Full equality is marriage, Steadman, Ferrandino and others have said, but a constitutional amendment voters passed in 2006 recognizes marriage as only between a man and a woman. Steadman deliberately chose the number of this year's civil-unions measure: Senate Bill 11. His partner, Dave Misner, who died last September after a brief battle with pancreatic cancer, was born on May 11. They had been together 11 years. Some of those who attended the civil-unions signing wore the same purple ribbons they wore at Misner's funeral. After civil unions passed this year, Steadman wrote a poem: 11 is a prime number. Eleven is a lovely word. It's binary; a pair of ones. It's two like things, bound together, to make a whole of ones.

If your baby can fit something in his mouth, there is a chance he could choke on it. Make sure any small objects are kept up off the floor and out of your baby's reach. Possible answers: + Regularly vacuum your living room floor to pick up any small items you might not notice visually. Even items like deflated latex balloons or forgotten paperclips could lead to a choking hazard if they are left on the floor for your baby to find and ingest. + Nothing will induce the baby to eat down if something gets in his mouth. Some appliance manufacturers use extra-strong adhesives, like polypropylene, that will get under the cords. + You can also protect your baby from small objects by placing toy legos out of reach. Another option you can try is to purchase an empty toy box, or cardboard box, that you can use as a mattress. + Tiny items that he could sip from can help release the child's gas. Provide a safe bench for your baby to sit on.","completion":"One of the essential aspects of childproofing a living room is ensuring that all potential hazards are addressed to create a safe environment for your child. In addition to keeping floors and low surfaces free of small objects, there are several other steps you can take to further childproof your living room: 1. Cover electrical outlets: Use outlet covers or safety plugs to prevent your child from inserting their fingers or other objects into electrical outlets. 2. Secure heavy furniture: Anchor large furniture such as bookcases, TVs, and cabinets to the wall to prevent them from tipping over if your child attempts to climb on them. 3. Install safety gates: Install baby gates at the entrances to the living room to prevent your child from wandering into other areas of the house unsupervised. 4. Cushion sharp edges: Use corner guards or padding to cover sharp edges on furniture to minimize the risk of injury if your child accidentally bumps into them. 5. Remove dangling cords: Secure cords from blinds, curtains, and appliances to prevent your child from becoming entangled in them or accidentally pulling something onto themselves. 6. Store dangerous items out of reach: Keep items such as matches, lighters, and cleaning products in locked cabinets or on high shelves that your child cannot access. 7. Clear pathways: Ensure that walkways are free from clutter and tripping hazards, such as cords, toys, and shoes. 8. Secure rugs and mats: Use non-slip pads or double-sided tape to secure rugs and mats to the floor, preventing your child from slipping and potentially injuring themselves. 9. Install window locks and guards: To prevent falls, lock windows and install window guards or stops that prevent windows from opening more than a few inches. 10. Childproofing fireplace: If you have a fireplace, use a fireplace screen or gate to keep your child at a safe distance. Make sure any fireplace tools or accessories are stored securely out of reach. By taking these precautions, you can create a safe and secure environment within your living room, giving you peace of mind while your child plays and explores their surroundings. Regularly review your living room setup to ensure that it remains a safe space as your child grows and becomes more curious, mobile, and independent."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: You are given a new situation: Due to increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere more an more carbon dioxide is mixing with ocean water - thus increasing the acidity of the world's oceans. Rob is a climate scientist. He is measuring the acidity of the Atlantic ocean and the Pacific Ocean. To determine ocean water acidity he performed an acid-base titration. His conclusion is that Atlantic Ocean's acidity reached higher level than Pacific Ocean's acidity. and a hint : To determine the concentration of an acid in an aqueous solution, an acid-base titration is commonly performed. A strong base solution with a known concentration, usually NaOH or KOH, is added to neutralize the acid solution according to the color change of the indicator with the amount of base added.[7] The titration curve of an acid titrated by a base has two axes, with the base volume on the x-axis and the solution's pH value on the y-axis. The pH of the solution always goes up as the base is added to the solution. Please answer this question : In which ocean's acidity test Rob would have to add less base, Atlantic Ocean or Pacific ocean? Answer:","completion":"In Rob's acidity test, he would have to add less base in the Atlantic Ocean's sample. This is because the acidity level in the Atlantic Ocean is higher than that of the Pacific Ocean, as mentioned in the given situation. When an acid is titrated with a base, the goal is to neutralize the acid with the base until an equivalent point is reached, which is when equal amounts of acid and base have reacted with each other. Given that the Atlantic Ocean has a higher acidity level, it would therefore contain a higher concentration of hydrogen ions (H+) and, consequently, a stronger acidic solution. When titrating this ocean water sample, the stronger acidity of the solution would mean that fewer moles of base (either NaOH or KOH) are needed to react with the acid in order to reach the equivalent point and neutralize the acidity. As a result, a lesser amount of base would be added in this titration process. On the other hand, the Pacific Ocean has a lower acidity level, indicating a lower concentration of hydrogen ions and a weaker acidic solution. To neutralize its acidity during titration, more moles of base would be required to react with the acid present in this solution, resulting in a greater volume of base being added. In conclusion, Rob would have to add less base when conducting the acid-base titration in the Atlantic Ocean's water sample, due to its higher acidity level compared to the Pacific Ocean. The greater acidity in the Atlantic Ocean requires fewer moles of the strong base to reach the equivalent point, subsequently neutralizing the solution's acidity."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Corker: Obama 'irresponsible' with Congress House Speaker John Boehner invited the Israeli prime minister to address Congress next month without either side consulting the White House before Netanyahu accepted the invitation, setting off sparks in an Obama administration that felt snubbed. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest called the planning for the visit a \\"departure\\" from protocol and comes amid tensions between the White House and Senators of both parties who want to pass a bill authorizing new sanctions on Iran -- a harder line Netanyahu has publicly supported. But Corker, a Republican from Tennessee, also suggested Tuesday that Netanyahu's visit would be less divisive by the time he arrives for his joint address to Congress. Corker wouldn't take a firm position on whether the unilateral invitation -- orchestrated by aides in Boehner and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's offices -- was the right thing to do. RELATED: Netanyahu coming to Congress in March \\"At the end of the day, that's not my call,\\" he told CNN's \\"New Day\\". \\"There's a lot of water that will go under the bridge between now and the time that he arrives and my guess is we may be in a place where thing are aligned in a very good way.\\" Corker is currently leading the push for a bill in the foreign affairs committee that would require Congressional oversight over an eventual deal with Iran while Sens. Bob Menendez (D-New Jersey) and Mark Kirk (R-Illinois) will push another bill through the banking committee next week that would hang a new set of sanctions on Iran's head if a deal isn't reached by the July deadline. Sens. Rand Paul (R-Kentucky) and Barbara Boxer (D-California) also announced Wednesday that they are crafting a more moderate sanctions bill to counter the Kirk-Menendez bill. But by the time Netanyahu comes to visit, Corker suggested that Congress, the White House and Israel's conservative leader would likely be more in sync over how to strengthen the U.S.'s negotiating position with Iran ahead of an initial March 1 and final July 1 deadline for Iran to deal with the U.S. and five other world powers regarding its nuclear program. \\"He's incredibly concerned about a bad deal with Iran, very concerned about where these negotiations are going,\\" Corker said. \\"I don't know that he'll be necessarily going against the President.\\" That may be even more likely as Boehner's office announced Thursday morning that Netanyahu asked to push his visit back a month, now set to speak on March , giving him a chance to also address the American Israel Public Affairs Committee's high-profile annual conference. His speech to Congress will now come just 12 days before Netanyahu appears on ballots in Israeli elections -- a visit that will bolster his status as a strong leader with firm backing in the United States for his policies. Netanyahu may also have to come to terms with information from his own intelligence service, which told a group of U.S. senators visiting Israel last week, including Corker, that a sanctions bill would threaten negotiations, according to a Bloomberg report and similar remarks made by Secretary of State John Kerry.

Answer the following question: Process: - Plants start growing on or near the rocks - The roots of the growing plants start to break up the rock - The plant acids dissolve the rock - The rock is broken down into smaller pieces - Erosion begins. suppose more acid dissolves rock happens, how will it affect MORE or FASTER erosion of rocks. Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process Answer:","completion":"The supposed perturbation in the given scenario of more acid dissolving the rock can be described as directly impacting a step of the process. To understand why this is classified as a direct impact, let's analyze the steps involved in the erosion process and how the increased amount of acid can lead to more or faster erosion of rocks. The process of erosion in relation to plants growing on or near rocks can be broken down into the following steps: 1. Plants start growing on or near the rocks: In the initial stage, plants find suitable locations to grow, often on or near rocky surfaces where competition for resources is low or limited. 2. The roots of the growing plants start to break up the rock: As the plants grow, their roots penetrate the rocky substrate, exerting pressure and mechanically fragmenting the rock into smaller pieces. 3. The plant acids dissolve the rock: Many plants produce organic acids that can help dissolve or chemically weather the minerals in the rock, further breaking it down into smaller particles. 4. The rock is broken down into smaller pieces: As a result of the mechanical and chemical weathering caused by plant growth and plant acids, the rock fragments into smaller and more manageable pieces. 5. Erosion begins: Once the rock has been broken down, various natural forces such as water, wind, and gravity can transport and redistribute the smaller particles, leading to erosion. In the proposed scenario, more acid dissolves the rock, indicating an increase in the production or amount of plant acids. Considering that plant acids play a significant role in dissolving and chemically weathering the rock (as seen in step 3 of the process), an increase in their concentration will directly impact the rate at which rocks are broken down. This will, in turn, lead to an accelerated rate of erosion, as smaller rock particles are more susceptible to erosion than larger, more cohesive rocks. In summary, the supposed perturbation of more acid dissolving the rock can be identified as directly impacting a step of the process, specifically the step where plant acids dissolve the rock. By increasing the rate of chemical weathering, the increased amount of plant acids contributes to more or faster erosion of rocks."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

These two questions do not have the same meaning but are, in fact, related to the same concept within the Harry Potter series. They address different aspects of the concept of a Horcrux. Let's dive into the details of each question to understand their differences. Question 1: Why did Harry become a Horcrux? This question seeks to understand the reason and circumstances that led to Harry Potter inadvertently becoming a Horcrux. To answer this question, we need to delve into the backstory of Harry Potter and how he came to be a Horcrux. In the Harry Potter series, a Horcrux is an object that contains a piece of a dark wizard's soul. The main antagonist, Lord Voldemort, created multiple Horcruxes in a bid to achieve immortality. By splitting his soul and hiding the pieces in different objects, he ensured that if one part of his soul was destroyed, the other parts would keep him alive. The circumstances of Harry becoming a Horcrux were accidental. When Voldemort tried to kill baby Harry, the Killing Curse rebounded, destroying Voldemort's body and causing part of his torn soul to latch onto the only living thing in the room - Harry. Unknowingly, Harry carried the piece of Voldemort's soul inside him throughout his life until the Battle of Hogwarts when the Horcrux was ultimately destroyed. Question 2: What is a Horcrux? This question aims at understanding the general concept of a Horcrux within the Harry Potter universe. A Horcrux, in J.K. Rowling's created world, is an object or living being in which a responsible dark wizard hides a fragment of his or her soul. By doing this, they aim to achieve immortality and protect themselves from death. Creating a Horcrux involves committing murder, which is considered the most heinous of acts, as it rips the soul apart, allowing a part of it to be stored in the designated object. To sum up, the two questions have distinct meanings. Question 1 looks into the specific scenario of why Harry Potter became a Horcrux, while Question 2 seeks a general definition and explanation of what a Horcrux is in the Harry Potter series. They are related but are not synonymous in their meaning."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

If your cat is vomiting, has diarrhea, isn’t breathing normally, or has an irregular heartbeat, get to the vet’s office as quickly as possible. If you see your cat licking itself before you have a chance to remove the motor oil, go to the vet. If your vet’s office isn’t open, go to an emergency vet clinic. Do not attempt to make your cat vomit before you visit the vet! Some products can actually permanently damage your cat’s esophagus. Your cat will be clipped and bathed at the vet’s office, just as it would have been at home. Depending on your cat’s condition, your vet will either do this right away or take care of urgent medical issues first. The vet may also provide you will topical antibiotics that you’ll need to put on your cat’s skin to prevent infection. The vet will order a complete blood profile, a urine test, and an electrolyte panel. Each of these tests will help your vet determine which of your cat’s organs are being affected by the motor oil. Since motor oil can sometimes cause pneumonia in cats, your vet may also order an X-ray to see if your cat has built-up fluid in its lungs. If your cat vomited at home, take a sample of the vomit for your vet to test. You can collect it with a resealable plastic bag. Be sure to wash your hands after you’ve gotten the sample. This may help your vet treat your cat more quickly. The charcoal will help absorb the motor oil and halt any damage it’s causing in your cat’s system. If your cat ate the motor oil recently, your vet may also flush your cat’s stomach. If your cat is struggling to breathe, oxygen therapy may help stabilize it while the motor oil is removed from its system. This treatment can only be given at your vet’s office, so your cat will need to stay there for as long as the oxygen therapy is necessary. Sometimes IV fluids will also be given to support the cat's internal organs. If your vet allowed you to take your cat home, you’re probably in the clear. However, it’s a good idea to monitor them closely for the next several days to make sure they’re healing from their ordeal. If you see them panting, coughing, or if they have an increased heart rate, take them back to the vet right away.

Then, the area of the garden last year was x^2 square feet, and the area of the garden this year was y^2 square feet. Since the lady increased her output by 127 cabbages, so the difference in the area is 127 square feet. This can be represented as: y^2 - x^2 = 127 We can rewrite the equation as a difference of squares: (y + x)(y - x) = 127 Now, we have to find two factors of 127 that have a difference equal to the number of cabbages added. Since 127 is a prime number, the only factors are 1 and 127. So, y + x = 127 and y - x = 1 Solve these two equations for y and x: y = 64 x = 63 So, last year's garden had a side of 63 feet, and this year's garden had a side of 64 feet. Number of cabbages produced this year = y^2 = 64^2 = 4096. Thus, the answer is a) 4096 cabbages."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Q: Paragraph: Bacterial and viral infections often present with similar symptoms. Etiologic misdiagnosis can alter the trajectory of patient care, including antibiotic overuse. A host-protein signature comprising tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), interferon gamma-induced protein-10 (IP-10), and C-reactive protein (CRP) was validated recently for differentiating bacterial from viral disease. However, a focused head-to-head comparison of its diagnostic performance against other biomarker candidates for this indication was lacking in patients with respiratory infection and fever without source. We compared the signature to other biomarkers and prediction rules using specimens collected prospectively at two secondary medical centers from children and adults. Inclusion criteria included fever > 37.5°C, symptom duration ≤ 12 days, and presentation with respiratory infection or fever without source. Comparator method was based on expert panel adjudication. Signature and biomarker cutoffs and prediction rules were predefined. Of 493 potentially eligible patients, 314 were assigned unanimous expert panel diagnosis and also had sufficient specimen volume. The resulting cohort comprised 175 (56%) viral and 139 (44%) bacterial infections. Signature sensitivity 93.5% (95% CI 89.1-97.9%), specificity 94.3% (95% CI 90.7-98.0%), or both were significantly higher (all p values < 0.01) than for CRP, procalcitonin, interleukin-6, human neutrophil lipocalin, white blood cell count, absolute neutrophil count, and prediction rules. Signature identified as viral 50/57 viral patients prescribed antibiotics, suggesting potential to reduce antibiotic overuse by 88%. The host-protein signature demonstrated superior diagnostic performance in differentiating viral from bacterial respiratory infections and fever without source.

And they are all in the Guinness Book of Records(<<>> ). The book is going to celebrate its birthday this August. It began exactly half a century ago. And it's always one of the best selling books in the world. People now can break over 1000 records every week! Why do so many people want to break the records? Do they want their names in the book or meet more people around the world? \\"It gives people a chance to show they're the best in the world.\\" said one of the record keepers Stewart Newport. The book was started by Hugh Beaver from Britain. In 1951, he went shooting birds and talked with his friends about the fastest bird in Europe. Three years later, they were still talking about it. So Beaver believed that people must have different ideas. So, he decided to start a book to record the world's truly greatest people and things in it! The newest book came out last Tuesday. This book has a lot of interesting records. Here are two: A British dog, Whitney, is the world's smallest dog. It's only 76mm tall.

President Xi Jinping in his opening speech paid tribute to \\"the Chinese people who unwaveringly fought hard and defeated aggression\\" from Japan. He also said the People's Liberation Army would be reduced by 300,000 personnel, but gave no timeframe. China's growing military power is being keenly watched amid regional tensions. China has several territorial disputes with neighbours in the South China Sea, as well as with Japan in the East China Sea. Ahead of the parade, the US said five Chinese ships had been spotted in the Bering Sea off Alaska for the first time. China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) is the world's largest military, with 2.3 million members. China also has the second biggest defence budget after the US. More than 30 foreign government officials and heads of state including Russia's President Vladimir Putin and UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon attended the event. But many Western leaders and Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe have stayed away. Some 12,000 troops and 200 aircraft, as well as tanks and missiles, were on display in Tiananmen Square, including the anti-ship \\"carrier killer\\" missile Dongfeng-21D. Most of the war machinery on display was being shown to the general public for the first time, according to state media. Mr Xi, also the commander of the armed forces, was centre stage at the parade's proceedings. Despite the repeated assurances from China that the message of today was one of peace, the crowd seemed to see a different symbolism in the V-shaped lines of jets and bombers. \\"We have the ability to announce to the world that we are a big country, we are a great country,\\" one onlooker told me. \\"It is the proper time to show to the world that we are strong now,\\" a young woman agreed. China believes that its suffering and sacrifice during World War Two have been largely forgotten. But 70 years on there are questions over whether the Communist Party is basking in reflected glory - after all it was the Nationalists who did most of the fighting and dying - and whether a contribution to world peace is really best marked by such an extraordinary display of military might. Mr Xi made the troop reduction announcement in a speech where he reassured the global community that \\"China will remain committed to peaceful development\\". \\"No matter how strong it becomes, China will never seek hegemony or expansion. It will never inflict its past suffering on any nation,\\" he said. BBC China Editor Carrie Gracie, who was at the parade, says the army cuts will not mean a weaker China. It is also upgrading its naval and air forces, she says, so does not need as many boots on the ground to project its power around the world. Alexander Neill from the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) in Singapore, says the move shows China's \\"determination to have a modern fighting force\\". In the build-up to the event, state media have published commentaries reinforcing Chinese patriotism and views on historical events. Entertainment shows were also suspended on television to make way for the coverage. Beijing's normally smoggy skies were unusually blue, after factories were closed, barbecues banned and cars stopped from travelling to reduce pollution. But concerns about China's growing military assertiveness and the tone of the parade meant many Western and Asian leaders stayed away from the event. \\"During a period of strained relations between China and Japan, as well as increasing military tension in the Asia-Pacific region, some leaders are reluctant to be associated with what they may view as a nationalistic, anti-Japanese mass rally,\\" says Mr Neill. Japan launched a full-scale invasion of China in 1937 and, according to Beijing, eight years of fighting claimed 14 million Chinese lives. China also claims that it is the \\"forgotten ally\\" and that its role in defeating Japan has been underplayed in the post-war narrative. Nationalist forces led the fight against Japan in China. They were defeated by Mao Zedong's Communists who proclaimed a people's republic in 1949.

A more detailed and appropriate answer to the question would be as follows: Eton College, an independent boarding school in Eton, Berkshire, England, features numerous learning buildings designed by various architects over the centuries since its founding in 1440 by King Henry VI. The earliest buildings, including the iconic College Chapel, were originally designed by architect Henry Yevele, although the Chapel was later modified by multiple architects throughout its history. In the late 17th century, Eton's Christopher Wren-designed School Yard and Upper School were constructed. Sir Christopher Wren, a prolific English architect and scientist, was responsible for numerous famous buildings, including St. Paul's Cathedral in London. Throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, Eton College campus expanded further with the construction of several new buildings. One such building is the Lower School, designed by Edward Blore, an English architect known for his work on Buckingham Palace and Lambeth Palace. More recent structures, such as the Bekynton Field Development, completed in 2015, were designed by notable architectural firms like WilkinsonEyre. This firm is known for various other projects, including the Gateshead Millennium Bridge, a pedestrian bridge that spans River Tyne in England. In summary, various architects and designers are responsible for the learning buildings at Eton College, with some of the most notable examples being Henry Yevele, Sir Christopher Wren, Edward Blore, and more recently, WilkinsonEyre architects' Bekynton Field Development.

War Desertion typically refers to the act of abandoning one's duty or post without permission, particularly in the context of military service. In some cases, officers may be tasked with carrying a pistol to shoot deserters in times of war, should they attempt to leave their post or flee the battlefield. The term \\"deserters\\" is not generally used in association with police officers, traffic situations, or other everyday circumstances. Historically, some military forces have employed harsh tactics, including execution, to discourage desertion and maintain discipline among their troops during wartime.

They marry and go to Niagara Falls for their honeymoon but this is when Ellen realizes that Harry is the world's worst roommate and childish at heart.

(March 2016) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) At Chicago O'Hare International Airport, a group of Marines have just returned to the US from Iraq. As the Marines leave, one Marine remains and makes his way towards the exit. The Marine's name is Jesse Rodriguez (Freddy Rodriguez). The film cuts to a house where a man, Edy Rodriguez (Alfred Molina) is on a ladder nailing up a welcome home sign for Jesse. The woman, his wife, Anna Rodriguez (Elizabeth PeÃ±a) gives him a rather disgruntled look before leaving to prepare for Jesse's return. Edy then travels to his store, a small neighborhood supermarket, called Bodega. Along the way, and even in the store, Edy appears to be quite popular with the ladies. Back at the airport, Jesse finally meets up with his friend and cousin Johnny (Luis Guzman) and Ozzy (Jay Hernandez), who have come to pick him up. On the way to his fathers store, Jesse takes off his eye-patch to reveal that he can still see, but the area around his eye is badly injured. After some prompting from Johnny and Ozzy, he reveals that he was the lucky one, as his friend Lenny was not as lucky and Jesse feels some guilt for this. On the way, the three pass a park and Jesse tells them to stop. The park was their childhood playground and the three take a little time off to play a game of baseball and reminisce. While at the park, Ozzy spots Alexis (Manny PÃ©rez), the man who killed his brother, recently been released from prison. Ozzy stares at Alexis, and Alexis stares back, however, before Ozzy is able to make his way to Alexis, both Jesse and Johnny hold him back then they make their way to Edy's store. Jesse's sister Roxanna (Vanessa Ferlito) arrives by taxi, although everyone assumes she came in a limo because they all assume that she made it big in Hollywood as an actress.

Jeffrey Leonard Jarrett (born July 14, 1967) is an American professional wrestler, professional wrestling promoter and businessman. Beginning his career in his father's Continental Wrestling Association (CWA), in 1986, Jarrett first came to prominence upon debuting in the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) in 1992. Over the next nine years, he alternated between the WWF and its main competitor, World Championship Wrestling (WCW). After WCW was purchased by the WWF in 2001, Jarrett joined the upstart World Wrestling All-Stars (WWA) promotion. In April, WCW was \\"rebooted\\" by Eric Bischoff and Vince Russo, with all titles vacated as a result. Bischoff and Russo also created The New Blood, a stable of younger wrestlers who feuded with the Millionaire's Club, made up of the older members of the WCW roster. Jarrett joined The New Blood, and at Spring Stampede on April 16, he defeated Millionaires Club member Diamond Dallas Page to win the vacant WCW World Heavyweight Championship. Page regained the title on April 24, and on April 25, the title was contested in a tag team match pitting Jarrett and Bischoff against Page and actor David Arquette. Arquette won the WCW World Heavyweight Championship after pinning Bischoff. Jarrett hit Page with the championship belt while special referee Kimberly Page's back was turned; WCW official Mickie Jay counted Bischoff out while Jarrett had Page pinned, who kicked out. At Slamboree on May 7, Jarrett defeated Page and Arquette in a three way triple cage match to win his second WCW World Heavyweight Championship after Arquette turned on Page. In May, Jarrett won and lost the WCW World Heavyweight Championship on two further occasions, regaining the title from Ric Flair both times. Jarrett feuded with Nash and Hulk Hogan throughout June 2000, and on July 9 at Bash at the Beach, he faced Hogan with the world championship on the line; the match ended swiftly after Jarrett immediately laid down, allowing Hogan to rest a boot on his chest and win the title, with Hogan commenting, \\"That's why this company is in the damn shape it's in--because of bullshit like this!\\". Vince Russo subsequently came to the ring and delivered a profanity-laced interview in which he accused Hogan of politicking and claimed that Hogan had used his creative control to refuse to lose to Jarrett. Russo then stated that, while Hogan was free to keep the title belt he had just won (the \\"Hulk Hogan Memorial Belt\\"), Jarrett would wrestle Booker T for the official WCW World Heavyweight Championship later that night. Booker T won the resultant match and Hogan did not appear in WCW again. It is disputed whether the situation was a shoot, a work, or some combination of the two. In the following months, Jarrett briefly feuded with Booker T, Mike Awesome, Sting, Buff Bagwell, and Flair. In late 2000, he joined forces with the Harris Brothers once more, with the trio defeating The Filthy Animals at Starrcade on December 17. In the same evening, Jarrett aligned himself with WCW World Heavyweight Champion Scott Steiner by helping Steiner defeat Sid Vicious. In 2001, Jarrett and Steiner became members of The Magnificent Seven, a large stable headed by Flair. Flair and Jarrett feuded with Dusty and Dustin Rhodes until March, when WCW was purchased by the WWF. Uninterested in Jarrett, the WWF neglected to acquire his contract, leaving him without a job. On the March 26 episode of the WWF's Raw program (which coincided with the final episode of Nitro), company owner Vince McMahon was seen watching Jarrett within the WCW venue on a television set. McMahon announced Jarrett's real-life firing on air, mocking his trademark taunt of distinctly spelling out his name by saying that he would now be known as \\"Capital G, Double-O, Double-N, Double-E - GOONNEE!\\" Entity:","completion":"The text is about Jeffrey Leonard Jarrett, an American professional wrestler, professional wrestling promoter, and businessman."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Andrea Chisholm, 54, pleaded guilty to aiding and abetting wrongfully obtained public assistance, claiming that her husband, Colin Chisholm III, filled out the bogus welfare applications. Despite living a lavish lifestyle that included a lakefront home, a 1.2 million yacht, and a kennel that bred elite Cavalier King Charles spaniels, the Chisholms shamelessly took advantage of public assistance programs. Prosecutors noted that the couple collected a staggering 167,000 in food stamps and medical claims through these fraudulent applications. During the sentencing, Andrea Chisholm expressed remorse for her actions, stating that it was her husband who should bear most of the blame for the deception. Regardless of who completed the false applications, however, the case stands as a stark reminder that people of all backgrounds and social classes can commit fraud and misuse public funds. The sentencing of Andrea Chisholm reinforces the importance of vigilance in detecting and deterring welfare fraud. Safeguarding public funds is a critical responsibility, as these resources are intended to provide essential assistance to the most vulnerable members of society. Cases like that of the Chisholms serve as a reminder of the need to continue fighting against fraud in public benefit programs and ensuring those who truly need support can receive it."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Aubrey kept an eye on Ash's things when he was away from town.

She pulled out the elegant white tablecloth reserved for special occasions and began to ponder the details for an attractive table setting. The warmth and happiness of their guests was important to both Christine and Lindsey. Lindsey started by spreading the tablecloth smoothly over their large oak dining table. The fabric cascaded effortlessly over the edges, giving the area a sophisticated feel. She took a moment to appreciate the transformation before proceeding to the next step. Next, Lindsey went to their mother's china cabinet and retrieved the precious blue and white porcelain dinner set that had been handed down through generations. The delicate plates, adorned with intricate patterns, had a timeless quality to them. As she placed them on the table, she couldn't help but think of all the cherished family memories and gatherings that had surrounded these heirlooms. The silverware was the next item on her list. She found the antique set her parents received as a wedding gift, polished it, and began arranging it on the table. The forks, knives, and spoons shone brightly as they caught the light streaming in from the large bay window in the dining room. Lindsey then shifted her attention to glassware. She picked out a set of sparkling crystal wine glasses, a gift from Christine's in-laws that had never been used. They had been waiting for the perfect occasion to showcase their beauty and elegance, and tonight seemed like the ideal opportunity. Now that the table setting essentials were in place, Lindsey moved on to the decorative aspects. She went out into their garden and picked a handful of fresh flowers, a mixture of roses, daisies, and lavender, to create an aromatic and visually stunning centerpiece. The colorful arrangement brightened up the table and added a touch of natural beauty. She also decided to light a few scented candles to evoke a cozy and inviting ambiance. Lindsey could hear Christine bustling around in the kitchen, preparing an array of delicious dishes for their guests. The aroma of baked garlic bread, chicken parmesan, and mushroom risotto wafted into the dining room, making her mouth water in anticipation. Completing the table, Lindsey added a few more personalized touches. She handpicked elegant cloth napkins in a shade of blue that complemented the porcelain dinnerware and tied them with strips of white satin ribbon. For a final touch, she wrote out name cards for each guest and set them down in their allotted spots. As Lindsey stepped back to take in her masterpiece, Christine appeared at the doorway with a satisfied smile.

By Julian Robinson A previously unseen letter by Albert Einstein has revealed the genius was once corrected - by a 23-year-old student. Herbert Salzer was studying for a Master’s degree in physics when he wrote to Einstein to point out that an equation in one of his published papers was actually wrong. The eminent German physicist initially politely dismissed the claim, replying to the young student with a long-winded and mathematical defence of his work. In a previously unseen letter, Albert Einstein, pictured right, admitted to Herbert Salzer, pictured left, that he had made a mistake He concluded ‘I will now show that equation is really, really not the equation you specified’ before signing off 'Yours respectfully, A. Einstein'. 'The tone of the second letter is not of annoyance but one of excitement that OPTIONS: - A.

As it turns out, Salzer's correction to Einstein's equation was indeed valid, and the two continued to correspond with each other for several weeks, exchanging ideas, theories, and mathematical proofs. Salzer's aptitude for unraveling complex ideas caught the attention of Einstein, who recognized the potential in the young student's work. Over time, the conversations between Einstein and Salzer evolved into a mentoring relationship, wherein Einstein offered guidance, criticism, and encouragement to the aspiring physicist. As Salzer continued to progress academically, he began contributing to Einstein's ongoing research on the elusive unified field theory. This theory aimed to combine the fundamental forces of the universe, namely gravity and electromagnetism, into a single, comprehensive framework. During their collaboration, the pair uncovered new possibilities and drew closer to the realization of a unified field theory. Their efforts, however, were interrupted by the outbreak of World War II, as scientific resources and priorities shifted across the globe. As a result, their work was put on hold, and the two gradually lost touch with one another. Despite the setbacks, both Einstein and Salzer remained dedicated to the pursuit of a unified field theory, working independently throughout the remainder of their respective careers. Although neither of them succeeded in fully developing a cohesive framework for the forces of the universe, their contributions to the world of physics remain significant and noteworthy. In the decades following the war, Salzer emerged as a respected figure within the scientific community and advanced in his career through research and teaching positions at various institutions. While he always remained grateful for the opportunity to work with Einstein, he continued to forge his own path within the field of theoretical physics. The recently discovered letter serves as a testament to the inquisitive and intellectually humble nature of Einstein, who openly admitted and corrected his mistake after engaging in a detailed exchange with a young student. Furthermore, the story of the relationship between Einstein and Salzer highlights the importance of open dialogue, collaboration, and the ongoing pursuit of knowledge in the realm of scientific discovery."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Bush told skeptical foreign leaders and envoys Tuesday that Iraq was on its way to stability and democracy and called for quot;a new definition of security What best summarizes the content of the above article?","completion":"The article primarily discusses President George W. Bush's address to foreign leaders and representatives, aiming to assuage their doubts regarding the political and social state of Iraq. President Bush expresses his optimistic view that Iraq is on the pathway to realizing stability and democracy. Beyond an update on Iraq's progress, his address also includes a call for a reimagined understanding of security in global politics. President Bush's message underscores the shift in the U.S. foreign policy towards nation-building and democracy promotion, particularly in the context of the post-9/11 era and the Iraq War. His comments reveal a belief that Iraq is successfully navigating its way towards becoming a stable democratic nation despite skepticism from the international community. In doing so, he is not only justifying the U.S. intervention in Iraq but also highlighting its potential positive outcomes. Moreover, by urging for \\"a new definition of security,\\" Bush is essentially asking global partners to reconsider their conceptions of international security to account for non-conventional threats such as terrorism, and perhaps to also consider the role of democratic institutions in enhancing global stability. This suggests a more holistic, preventative approach to international security that goes beyond traditional military power and includes political stability, democracy, and socio-economic development as key components of global security. It is important to note that the audience for Bush's address are skeptical foreign leaders and envoys, implying some prevailing doubts or disagreements about the trajectory of Iraq or the effectiveness of U.S. policies. The message, therefore, serves a dual purpose – to relay reassurances about Iraq's progress, and to encourage a revision of global security norms to include a wider range of considerations. However, without more specific content from the article, key details—such as the nature of the skepticism from foreign leaders, the specific indicators of progress in Iraq that Bush cites, and the precise changes to the definition of security that Bush proposes—remain unknown. These obscured elements could significantly enhance the understanding and interpretation of President Bush's verbal communication."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

But of all the characters he wrote about, none played as important a role in his work as that of London itself: its hustle and bustle, its glittering promise and grimy streets and the extremes of poverty and wealth experienced by those who lived there. Alex Werner, the curator of the Museum of London's \\"Dickens and London\\" exhibition, says the city was \\"absolutely central\\" to Dickens' work. \\"It triggered his imagination,\\" he told CNN. \\"He called it his 'magic lantern', and would spend hours pacing the streets, drawing inspiration from what he saw around him.\\" Read more: Dickens admirers mark bicentenary London was Dickens' muse, helping to spark his creativity and provide ideas for some of the most memorable characters, settings and plot twists in English literature.

Please answer the following question: Q: The accumulation of what cells begin the development of the vertebral column and thoracic cage? Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers: Development of the Vertebral Column and Thoracic cage Development of the vertebrae begins with the accumulation of mesenchyme cells from each sclerotome around the notochord. These cells differentiate into a hyaline cartilage model for each vertebra, which then grow and eventually ossify into bone through the process of endochondral ossification. As the developing vertebrae grow, the notochord largely disappears. However, small areas of notochord tissue persist between the adjacent vertebrae and this contributes to the formation of each intervertebral disc. The ribs and sternum also develop from mesenchyme. The ribs initially develop as part of the cartilage model for each vertebra, but in the thorax region, the rib portion separates from the vertebra by the eighth week. The cartilage model of the rib then ossifies, except for the anterior portion, which remains as the costal cartilage. The sternum initially forms as paired hyaline cartilage models on either side of the anterior midline, beginning during the fifth week of development. The cartilage models of the ribs become attached to the lateral sides of the developing sternum. Eventually, the two halves of the cartilaginous sternum fuse together along the midline and then ossify into bone. The manubrium and body of the sternum are converted into bone first, with the xiphoid process remaining as cartilage until late in life.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize: Reading is one of the most important keys for language development. Reading out loud teaches children what words are supposed to sound like: it teaches them to connect sounds with letters. The more words a baby hears, for example, the broader their vocabulary at age 3. Yes, you can simply talk to your infant to boost how many words they hear, but reading gives you words so that you don't have to think of things to say, and it teaches the baby new words. When you read to your child one-on-one, it adds to their perception of reading as a positive, nurturing activity. Not only that, it has been proven that reading out loud helps children cope with trauma. Reading out loud helps children return to reading later in life, both because it reminds them of happy times with parents and because it helped them through a hard time. Difficulty reading leads to failure in school, which of course leads to problems later in life. Exposing children to reading even before they can read exposes them to words and experiences they would have never received in daily life, which lays the foundation for them to be familiar with concepts they will later learn in school. Failure in school leads to social problems like delinquency, teen pregnancy, and substance abuse. Reading out loud familiarizes children with experiences they would not otherwise be exposed to, giving them knowledge before they ever enter school. It also teaches them to have a bigger vocabulary, which can help them get further in life. For example, teachers tend to pay attention to kids who have better reading comprehension than the rest of class, and often provide them with access to books at higher levels of reading, giving a child more knowledge than other students. Reading to a child provides you with an opportunity for a child to look up to you because when you are excited about reading, a child will be too. You set the example for your child to become a reader, and when they engage with reading over time, they turn to you for help. Reading out loud provides children with a world they can imagine, even when the book already contains pictures. Books give children ideas, characters, and settings outside of their experience, which they often will explore when playing “pretend.”","completion":"Reading is really important for kids to learn words and how they sound. When you read out loud to little kids, it helps them learn new words and enjoy reading. Reading can also help them feel better during hard times and do better in school.

The marriage caused consternation from Mary , Queen of Scots , as the couple had married without having obtained royal consent . - The Church of Scotland, known informally by its Scots language name, the Kirk, is the national church of Scotland. Protestant and Presbyterian, its longstanding decision to respect \\"liberty of opinion in points which do not enter into the substance of the Faith.\\" means it is relatively tolerant of a variety of theological positions, including those who would term themselves conservative and liberal in their doctrine, ethics and interpretation of Scripture. - John Knox (c. 1513 24 November 1572) was a Scottish minister, theologian, and writer who was a leader of the Reformation and is considered the founder of the Presbyterian Church of Scotland. He is believed to have been educated at the University of St Andrews and worked as a notary-priest. Influenced by early church reformers such as George Wishart, he joined the movement to reform the Scottish church. He was caught up in the ecclesiastical and political events that involved the murder of Cardinal Beaton in 1546 and the intervention of the regent of Scotland Mary of Guise. He was taken prisoner by French forces the following year and exiled to England on his release in 1549. - Mary of Guise (20 November 1515 10 June 1560) was Queen of Scots from 1538 to 1542 as the second wife of King James V. She was the mother of Mary, Queen of Scots, and served as Regent of Scotland in her daughter's name from 1554 to 1560. A native of Lorraine, she was a member of the powerful House of Guise, which played a prominent role in 16th-century French politics. Her main goal was a close alliance between the powerful French Catholic nation and small Scotland, which she wanted to be Catholic and independent of England. She failed, and at her death the Protestants took control of Scotland, with her own grandson achieving the Union of the Crowns a few decades later.

In February 1828, shortly before his 41st birthday, Etty soundly defeated John Constable by 18 votes to five to become a full Royal Academician, at the time the highest honour available to an artist. By this time, complaints about his supposed indecency were beginning to resurface. All but one of the 15 paintings Etty exhibited at the Royal Academy in the 1820s had included at least one nude figure, and Etty was acquiring a reputation for using respectable themes as a pretext for nudity.For the 1828 Summer Exhibition Etty exhibited three pictures; The World Before the Flood, Venus, the Evening Star and Guardian Cherubs. (The latter was a portrait of the children of Welbore Ellis Agar, 2nd Earl of Normanton, and was the only non-nude painting exhibited by Etty at the RA in the 1820s.) Although similar to his earlier works, they were technically more accomplished. Both The World Before the Flood and Venus attracted positive reviews in the press and were sold during their exhibition for substantial sums, although the purchase by the Marquess of Stafford of The World Before the Flood—a work containing scantily clad figures of both sexes—drew a pointed comment in The Gentleman's Magazine that it \\"will serve to accompany the private Titians of that nobleman\\". Despite the increasing number of complaints in the press about his use of nudity, respect for Etty from his fellow artists continued to rise, and in 1828 the British Institution awarded him £100 in recognition of his talent. As soon as the 1828 Summer Exhibition was over, Etty stopped work on other projects to concentrate on a diploma piece, without which he could not become a Royal Academician. This piece, Sleeping Nymph and Satyrs, was presented to the Academy in October, and in December 1828 Etty became a Royal Academician.

Sahara struggles to live a normal life while being haunted by a dark past, which becomes entwined with her present investigation and reveals a shocking twist. Plot: Sahara Connor, a woman in her mid-30s, had a promising career as a psychic, aiding the police in solving multiple cold cases. However, a traumatic event from five years ago led her to abandon her psychic profession, and she now works as a private investigator under the pseudonym \\"Private Sahara.\\" One day, she receives a mysterious letter from a man named David Mason, who reveals that his sister, Emily, had gone missing. He believes her disappearance is connected to a series of unexplained crimes plaguing the city and requests Sahara's help, due to her unique talent for uncovering hidden truths. Reluctant to use her psychic abilities, Sahara delves into the case using her skills as an investigator to examine the victims' backgrounds and find the correlation between the crimes. As she pieces together the puzzle, Sahara discovers that each victim had a history of violent behavior or criminal activity. She begins to suspect that the perpetrator is a vigilante seeking vengeance. Meanwhile, Sahara is haunted by fragments of her own past – a series of memories involving deception, betrayal, and a life-threatening event. As the investigation intensifies, these memories start to resurface more frequently, forcing Sahara to face the pain that led her to abandon her psychic abilities. In her pursuit of justice, Sahara encounters a shadowy figure at the heart of the criminal underworld. This elusive figure, known only as \\"The Oracle,\\" seems to possess psychic abilities far more potent than hers and appears to be orchestrating the entire vigilante operation. As she confronts this enigmatic figure, Sahara discovers that they share a dark and secret connection. The Oracle is, in fact, the person who betrayed her years ago and pushed her away from her psychic career. He reveals that he framed Emily for a crime she didn't commit; this revelation forces Sahara into a moral dilemma. Torn between her desire for justice and the realization that she cannot escape her psychic nature, Sahara must decide whether to bring down The Oracle, risking Emily's life, or to use her abilities to expose the truth and save her, putting an end to the vigilantism. In the film's climax, Sahara faces The Oracle in a battle of wits and psychic power, ultimately choosing to use her abilities once again for justice. She outsmarts The Oracle and exposes the true mastermind behind the crimes, saving Emily and causing The Oracle's downfall. The film closes with Sahara embracing her psychic abilities and rediscovering her purpose in life as she continues her work as a private investigator.

West Africa has been defined as including 18 countries: Benin, Burkina Faso, the island nation of Cape Verde, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Ivory Coast, Liberia, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, the island of Saint Helena, Senegal, Sierra Leone, São Tomé and Príncipe and Togo. - A musical ensemble, also known as a music group or musical group, is a group of people who perform instrumental and/or vocal music, with the ensemble typically known by a distinct name. Some music ensembles consist solely of instruments, such as the jazz quartet or the orchestra. Some music ensembles consist solely of singers, such as choirs and doo wop groups. In both popular music and classical music, there are ensembles in which both instrumentalists and singers perform, such as the rock band or the Baroque chamber group for basso continuo (harpsichord and cello) and one or more singers. In classical music, trios or quartets either blend the sounds of musical instrument families (such as piano, strings, and wind instruments) or group together instruments from the same instrument family, such as string ensembles (e.g., string quartet) or wind ensembles (e.g., wind quintet). Some ensembles blend the sounds of a variety of instrument families, such as the orchestra, which uses a string section, brass instruments, woodwinds and percussion instruments, or the concert band, which uses brass, woodwinds and percussion. - Ishmael Wadada Leo Smith (born December 18, 1941) is an American trumpeter and composer, working primarily in the fields of avant-garde jazz and free improvisation. He was one of three finalists for the 2013 Pulitzer Prize for Music for \\"Ten Freedom Summers\\", released on May 22, 2012. - Amina Claudine Myers (born March 21, 1942) is an American jazz pianist, organist, vocalist, composer, and arranger. - The clarinet is a musical-instrument family belonging to the group known as the woodwind instruments. It has a single-reed mouthpiece, a straight cylindrical tube with an almost cylindrical bore, and a flared bell. A person who plays a clarinet is called a \\"clarinetist\\" (sometimes spelled \\"clarinettist\\"). - Chico Freeman (born Earl Lavon Freeman Jr.; July 17, 1949) is a modern jazz tenor saxophonist and trumpeter and son of jazz saxophonist Von Freeman. He began recording as lead musician in 1976 with \\"Morning Prayer\\", won the New York Jazz Award in 1979 and earned the Stereo Review Record of the Year in 1981 for his album \\"The Outside Within\\". - A pianist is an individual musician who plays the piano. Most forms of Western music can make use of the piano. Consequently, pianists have a wide variety of repertoire and styles to choose from, including traditionally classical music, Jazz, blues and all sorts of popular music, including rock music. Most pianists can, to a certain extent, play other keyboard-related instruments such as the synthesizer, harpsichord, celesta and the organ and keyboard. Perhaps the greatest pianist of all time was Franz Liszt, whose piano mastery was described by Anton Rubinstein: \\"In comparison with Liszt, all other pianists are children\\". - Illinois is a state in the midwestern region of the United States, achieving statehood in 1818. It is the 5th most populous state and 25th largest state in terms of land area, and is often noted as a microcosm of the entire country. The word \\"Illinois\\" comes from the Algonquin word for \\"tribe of superior men\\". With Chicago in the northeast, small industrial cities and great agricultural productivity in central and northern Illinois, and natural resources like coal, timber, and petroleum in the south, Illinois has a diverse economic base and is a major transportation hub. The Port of Chicago connects the state to other global ports from the Great Lakes, via the Saint Lawrence Seaway, to the Atlantic Ocean, as well as the Great Lakes to the Mississippi River, via the Illinois River. For decades, O'Hare International Airport has been ranked as one of the world's busiest airports. Illinois has long had a reputation as a bellwether both in social and cultural terms and politics. - The Penguin Guide to Jazz is a reference work containing an encyclopedic directory of jazz recordings on CD which are currently available in Europe or the United States. The first nine editions were compiled by Richard Cook and Brian Morton, two well known chroniclers of jazz resident in the United Kingdom. - Thelonious Sphere Monk (October 10, 1917 February 17, 1982) was an American jazz pianist and composer. Monk had a unique improvisational style and made numerous contributions to the standard jazz repertoire, including \\"'Round Midnight\\", \\"Blue Monk\\", \\"Straight, No Chaser\\" \\"Ruby, My Dear\\", \\"In Walked Bud\\", and \\"Well, You Needn't\\". Monk is the second most-recorded jazz composer after Duke Ellington, which is particularly remarkable as Ellington composed more than 1,000 pieces, whereas Monk wrote about 70. - African-American music is an umbrella term covering a diverse range of musics and musical genres largely developed by African Americans. Their origins are in musical forms that arose out of the historical condition of slavery that characterized the lives of African Americans prior to the American Civil War. - Henry Threadgill (born February 15, 1944) is a Pulitzer Prize-winning American composer, saxophonist, and flautist, who came to prominence in the 1970s leading ensembles with unusual instrumentation and often incorporating non-jazz genres. - Improvisation is broad term referring to the process of devising an atypical method of solving a problem due to lack of time or resources. In a technical context, this can mean adapting a device for some use other than that which it was designed for, or building a device from unusual components in an ad-hoc fashion. Improvisation, within the context of performing arts, is a very spontaneous performance without specific or scripted preparation. The skills of improvisation can apply to many different faculties, across all artistic, scientific, physical, cognitive, academic, and non-academic disciplines. - Ragtime also spelled rag-time or rag time is a musical genre that enjoyed its peak popularity between 1895 and 1918. Its cardinal trait is its syncopated, or \\"ragged\\", rhythm. The genre has its origins in African-American communities like St. Louis years before being published as popular sheet music for piano. Ernest Hogan (18651909) was a pioneer of ragtime music and was the first to compose ragtime into sheet music. The composition was called \\"LA Pas Ma LA\\" and it was released in 1895. Hogan has also been credited for coining the term \\"ragtime\\". The term is actually derived from his hometown \\"Shake Rag\\" in Bowling Green, Kentucky. Ben Harney, who is also a Kentucky native has often been credited for introducing the music to the mainstream public. His first ragtime composition \\"You've been a good old wagon but you done broke\\" helped popularize the musical genre. The composition was published in 1895 but released in 1896. Ragtime was also a modification of the march made popular by John Philip Sousa, with additional polyrhythms coming from African music. The ragtime composer Scott Joplin (\\"ca.\\" 18681917) became famous through the publication of the \\"Maple Leaf Rag\\" (1899) and a string of ragtime hits such as \\"The Entertainer\\" (1902), although he was later forgotten by all but a small, dedicated community of ragtime aficionados until the major ragtime revival in the early 1970s. For at least 12 years after its publication, \\"Maple Leaf Rag\\" heavily influenced subsequent ragtime composers with its melody lines, harmonic progressions or metric patterns. - John William Coltrane, also known as \\"Trane\\" (September 23, 1926 July 17, 1967), was an American jazz saxophonist and composer. Working in the bebop and hard bop idioms early in his career, Coltrane helped pioneer the use of modes in jazz and was later at the forefront of free jazz. He led at least fifty recording sessions during his career, and appeared as a sideman on many albums by other musicians, including trumpeter Miles Davis and pianist Thelonious Monk. - Roscoe Mitchell (born August 3, 1940 in Chicago, Illinois) is an American composer, jazz instrumentalist, and educator, known for being \\"a technically superb if idiosyncratic saxophonist.\\" \\"The Penguin Guide to Jazz\\" described him as \\"one of the key figures\\" in avant-garde jazz; All About Jazz states that he has been \\"at the forefront of modern music\\" for the past 35 years. Critic John Pareles in \\"The New York Times\\" has mentioned that Mitchell \\"qualifies as an iconoclast.\\" In addition to his own work as a bandleader, Mitchell is known for cofounding the Art Ensemble of Chicago and the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians (AACM). - The saxophone (also referred to as the sax) is a family of woodwind instruments. Saxophones are usually made of brass and played with a single-reed mouthpiece similar to that of the clarinet. The saxophone family was invented by the Belgian instrument maker Adolphe Sax in 1840. Adolphe Sax wanted to create a group or series of instruments that would be the most powerful and vocal of the woodwinds, and the most adaptive of the brass instruments, that would fill the vacant middle ground between the two sections. He patented the saxophone on June 28, 1846, in two groups of seven instruments each. Each series consisted of instruments of various sizes in alternating transposition. The series pitched in B and E, designed for military bands, have proved extremely popular and most saxophones encountered today are from this series. Instruments from the so-called \\"orchestral\\" series, pitched in C and F, never gained a foothold, and the B and E instruments have now replaced the C and F instruments when the saxophone is used in an orchestra. - Muhal Richard Abrams (born September 19, 1930, in Chicago, Illinois) is an American educator, administrator, composer, arranger, clarinetist, cellist, and jazz pianist in the free jazz medium. - Chicago (or ), officially the City of Chicago, is the third-most populous city in the United States, and the fifth-most populous city in North America. With over 2.7 million residents, it is the most populous city in the state of Illinois and the Midwestern United States, and the county seat of Cook County. The Chicago metropolitan area, often referred to as Chicagoland, has nearly 10 million people and is the third-largest in the U.S. - Jack DeJohnette (born August 9, 1942) is an American jazz drummer, pianist, and composer. - Lester Bowie (October 11, 1941 November 8, 1999) was an American jazz trumpet player and composer. He was a member of the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians and cofounded the Art Ensemble of Chicago. - The avant-garde (from French, \\"advance guard\\" or \\"vanguard\\", literally \\"fore-guard\\") are people or works that are experimental, radical, or unorthodox, with respect to art, culture, and society. It may be characterized by nontraditional, aesthetic innovation and initial unacceptability, and it may offer a critique of the relationship between producer and consumer. - The Moers Festival is an international jazz festival in Moers, Germany, happening yearly every Whitsun. - The Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians (AACM) is a non-profit organization, founded in Chicago, Illinois, United States, by pianist/composer Muhal Richard Abrams, pianist Jodie Christian, drummer Steve McCall, and composer Phil Cohran. Early members included Henry Threadgill, Anthony Braxton, Jack DeJohnette, Wadada Leo Smith, Leroy Jenkins, Amina Claudine Myers, Adegoke Steve Colson, Chico Freeman, George Lewis and the Art Ensemble of Chicago: Lester Bowie, Roscoe Mitchell, Joseph Jarman, Famoudou Don Moye, and Malachi Favors. The AACM is devoted \\"to nurturing, performing, and recording serious, original music,\\" according to its charter. It supports and encourages jazz performers, composers and educators. While founded in the Jazz tradition, the groups outreach and influence has, according to Larry Blumenfeld, \\"touched nearly all corners of modern music.\\" - A trumpet is a musical instrument commonly used in classical and jazz ensembles. The trumpet group contains the instruments with the highest register in the brass family. Trumpet-like instruments have historically been used as signaling devices in battle or hunting, with examples dating back to at least 1500 BC; they began to be used as musical instruments only in the late-14th or early 15th century. Trumpets are used in art music styles, for instance in orchestras, concert bands, and jazz ensembles, as well as in popular music. They are played by blowing air through almost-closed lips (called the player's embouchure), producing a \\"buzzing\\" sound that starts a standing wave vibration in the air column inside the instrument. Since the late 15th century they have primarily been constructed of brass tubing, usually bent twice into a rounded rectangular shape. - Kelan Phil Cohran (born in Oxford, Mississippi on May 8, 1927) is a jazz musician. He is known most for his trumpet contributions in the Sun Ra Arkestra in Chicago during 1959-1961 and for his involvement in the foundation of the AACM. - New Orleans (or ) is a major United States port and the largest city and metropolitan area in the state of Louisiana. The population of the city was 343,829 as of the 2010 U.S. Census. The New Orleans metropolitan area (New OrleansMetairieKenner Metropolitan Statistical Area) had a population of 1,167,764 in 2010 and was the 46th largest in the United States. The New OrleansMetairieBogalusa Combined Statistical Area, a larger trading area, had a 2010 population of 1,452,502. - Free jazz is an approach to jazz music that was first developed in the 1950s and 1960s as musicians attempted to alter, extend, or break down jazz convention, often by discarding fixed chord changes or tempos. Though the music of free jazz composers varied widely, a common feature was dissatisfaction with the limitations of bebop, hard bop, and modal jazz that had developed in the 1940s and 1950s. Often described as avant-garde, free jazz has also been described as an attempt to return jazz to its primitive, often religious, roots and emphasis on collective improvisation. - A rhythm section (also called a backup band) is a group of musicians within a music ensemble or band who provide the underlying rhythm and pulse of the accompaniment, providing a rhythmic reference and \\"beat\\" for the rest of the band. Many of the rhythm section instruments, such as keyboard instruments and guitars, are also used to play the chord progression upon which the song is based. The bass instrument (either double bass or electric bass, or another low-register instrument, such as synth bass, depending on the group and its style of music) plays the low-pitched bassline that supports the chord progression, typically by emphasizing the roots of the chords (and to a lesser degree the fifths and thirds of the chords). - Joseph Jarman (born September 14, 1937 in Pine Bluff, Arkansas), is a jazz musician, composer, and Shinshu Buddhist priest. He was one of the first members of the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians and a member of the Art Ensemble of Chicago. - A big band is a type of musical ensemble associated with playing jazz music and which became popular during the Swing Era from the early 1930s until the late 1940s. Big Bands evolved with the times and continue to today. A big band typically consists of approximately 12 to 25 musicians and contains saxophones, trumpets, trombones, and a rhythm section. The terms jazz band, jazz ensemble, stage band, jazz orchestra, and dance band are also used to refer to this type of ensemble. This does not, however, mean that each one of these names is technically correct for naming a \\"big band\\" specifically. - Eric Allan Dolphy, Jr. (June 20, 1928 June 29, 1964) was an American jazz alto saxophonist, flautist, and bass clarinetist. On a few occasions, he also played the clarinet and piccolo. Dolphy was one of several multi-instrumentalists to gain prominence in the 1960s. He was one of the first important bass clarinet soloists in jazz, extended the vocabulary and boundaries of the alto saxophone, and was among the earliest significant jazz flute soloists. - Jazz is a music genre that originated amongst African Americans in New Orleans, United States, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Since the 1920s jazz age, jazz has become recognized as a major form of musical expression. It emerged in the form of independent traditional and popular musical styles, all linked by the common bonds of African American and European American musical parentage with a performance orientation. Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes, call and response vocals, polyrhythms and improvisation. Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression, and in African-American music traditions including blues and ragtime, as well as European military band music. Although the foundation of jazz is deeply rooted within the Black experience of the United States, different cultures have contributed their own experience and styles to the art form as well. Intellectuals around the world have hailed jazz as \\"one of America's original art forms\\". - Miles Dewey Davis III (May 26, 1926September 28, 1991) was an American jazz trumpeter, bandleader, and composer. He is among the most influential and acclaimed figures in the history of jazz and 20th century music. With his ever-changing directions in music, Davis was at the forefront of a number of major stylistic developments in jazz over his five-decade career. - The piccolo (Italian for \\"small\\", but named \\"ottavino\\" in Italy) is a half-size flute, and a member of the woodwind family of musical instruments. The modern piccolo has most of the same fingerings as its larger sibling, the standard transverse flute, but the sound it produces is an octave higher than written. This gave rise to the name \\"ottavino\\" (Italian for \\"little octave\\"), the name by which the instrument is referred to in the scores of Italian composers. Piccolos are now only manufactured in the key of C ; however, they were once also available in D. It was for this D piccolo that John Philip Sousa wrote the famous solo in the final repeat of the closing section (trio) of his march \\"The Stars and Stripes Forever\\". - Africa is the world's second-largest and second-most-populous continent. At about 30.3 million km² (11.7 million square miles) including adjacent islands, it covers 6% of Earth's total surface area and 20.4 % of its total land area. With 1.1 billion people as of 2013, it accounts for about 15% of the world's human population. The continent is surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, both the Suez Canal and the Red Sea along the Sinai Peninsula to the northeast, the Indian Ocean to the southeast, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. The continent includes Madagascar and various archipelagos. It contains 54 fully recognized sovereign states (countries), nine territories and two \\"de facto\\" independent states with limited or no recognition. - Whitsun (also Whitsunday, Whit Sunday or Whit) is the name used in Britain and Ireland, and among Anglicans throughout the world, for the Christian festival of Pentecost, the seventh Sunday after Easter, which commemorates the descent of the Holy Spirit upon Christ's disciples (Acts of the Apostles chapter 2). In England it took on some characteristics of Beltane, which originated from the pagan celebration of Summer's Day, the beginning of the summer half-year, in Europe. Whitsuntide, the week following Whitsunday, was one of three vacation weeks for the medieval villein; on most manors he was free from service on the lord's demesne this week, which marked a pause in the agricultural year. Whit Monday, the day after Whitsun, remained a holiday in the UK until 1978 when the movable holiday was replaced with the fixed Spring Bank Holiday in late May. Whit was the occasion for varied forms of celebration. In the North West of England, church and chapel parades called Whit Walks still take place at this time (sometimes on Whit Friday, the Friday after Whitsun). Typically, the parades include brass bands and choirs; girls attending are dressed in white. Traditionally, Whit fairs (sometimes called Whitsun ales) took place. Other customs such as Morris dancing were associated with Whitsun, although in most cases they have been transferred to the Spring bank holiday. Whaddon, Cambridgeshire has its own Whitsun tradition of singing a unique song around the village before and on Whit Sunday itself.

The verb \\"he went\\" translates to \\"Odešel\\", used for past tense and masculine gender. 2. \\"Away on a business trip\\" can be translated as \\"na služební cestu\\". 3. The \\"... and she had his Labrador put down by the vet\\" part of the sentence requires some attention to correctly translate to Czech. In English the sentence is indirect, but Czech does not express this indirectness in similar fashion, hence the translation of this sentence part is more literal than would normally be in English. 4. \\"And she had\\" translates to \\"a ona měla\\". The verb \\"had\\" usually translates as \\"měla\\" or \\"měl\\" depending on the gender. 5. \\"His Labrador put down\\" means that the Labrador was euthanised, in Czech, this concept is expressed by the phrase \\"jeho labradora uspat\\", which literally means \\"his Labrador was put to sleep\\". 6. \\"By the vet\\" translates to \\"u veterináře\\". Justifying: The correct expression of indirect actions in different languages can be difficult as each language has developed different ways to express indirectness. Therefore, it is important to try to stick to the original meaning of the sentence as much as possible rather than trying to render the exact structure.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize: It was one of the first times the horrors of World War One had emerged from the columns of the newspapers and into the homes of ordinary people. But the Germans had actually set out to bomb Liverpool, 100 miles to the northwest, according to historians. Loughborough, where 10 died and an estimated 150 were injured, is likely to have been an entirely unintended target. Historian Robert Knight said warnings were issued when the zeppelins were spotted off the east coast. A blackout was ordered in cities across England, including Leicester, but in nearby Loughborough - a town of about 20,000 people - many lights were left on. \\"Just imagine the shock and horror, the sheer surprise people must have felt, when suddenly out of the blue came this absolutely enormous zeppelin the size of two football pitches,\\" he said. \\"They must have been terrified out of their minds and very curious.\\" Rather than seeking cover, that curiosity brought people out to see the shiny, cigar-shaped airships roll in overhead. Margaret Woolley, who was 12 at the time, told the University of Leicester in the 1980s about the bomb that landed in The Rushes, near her home. \\"We rushed out on to street and everything seemed to be in confusion,\\" she said. \\"The next morning, we went out into The Rushes to see where the bomb had dropped - my goodness, it was absolute chaos. \\"All the windows broken, curtains hanging out, all the roofs off, a big hole in the road. Of course it was really very frightening.\\" Historians disagree as to whether the bombers believed they had hit the northern cities they were aiming for or whether their plans changed due to the foggy weather. Bob Stephens believes Loughborough was identified as a target as the airships travelled west. \\"I'm absolutely staggered [the pilot] didn't hit the railway installations but he knew where the factories were and the gas and electricity works and I think he was aiming for both of those,\\" he said. But Andrew McWilliam, who is part of a campaign to commemorate the raid, said that view was a \\"conspiracy theory\\". \\"They thought they'd hit Liverpool and Sheffield, in fact they'd hit Loughborough and Burton-upon-Trent,\\" he said. A performance event in Loughborough is planned for May to remember the raid, and a plaque is to be erected in The Rushes, part-funded by a Heritage Lottery grant. Another probably unintended target that night was Ilkeston, Derbyshire, where two ironworkers were killed. One victim was Walter Wilson, who was on his way home from work. \\"He ducked behind the church wall just as a bomb struck the parish room,\\" said Stephen Flinders from the town's historical society. \\"He was hit in the back by a fragment of shrapnel, conveyed to Ilkeston Hospital and died the following day. \\"Wilson's name appears on the cenotaph on Ilkeston Market Place. Despite the fact he wasn't a serviceman, he was deemed to have died through enemy action.\\" A plaque is being unveiled in the town on Monday.","completion":"In WWI, a German zeppelin intended to bomb Liverpool mistakenly targeted Loughborough, killing 10 and injuring an estimated 150. Historians believe that the zeppelin was diverted due to foggy weather, and some argue that it intentionally targeted factories and electrical works in Loughborough as an alternative. Residents were caught off guard as they had not been warned of the incoming airships. The event brought the horrors of war into the homes of ordinary people for one of the first times. A performance event is planned to commemorate the raid and a plaque will be erected in Loughborough. Another unintended target that night was Ilkeston, Derbyshire, where two ironworkers were killed.

Historically attested Native American populations, such as the Sierra Miwok, Mono and Paiute, belong to the Uto-Aztecan and Utian phyla. In the mid-19th century, a band of Native Americans called the Ahwahnechee lived in Yosemite Valley. The California Gold Rush greatly increased the number of non-indigenous people in the region. Tensions between Native Americans and white settlers escalated into the Mariposa War. As part of this conflict, settler James Savage led the Mariposa Battalion into Yosemite Valley in 1851, in pursuit of Ahwaneechees led by Chief Tenaya. Accounts from the battalion, especially from Dr. Lafayette Bunnell, popularized Yosemite Valley as a scenic wonder. In 1864, Yosemite Valley and the Mariposa Grove of giant sequoia trees were transferred from federal to state ownership. Yosemite pioneer Galen Clark became the park's first guardian. Conditions in Yosemite Valley were made more hospitable to people and access to the park was improved in the late 19th century. Naturalist John Muir and others became increasingly alarmed about the excessive exploitation of the area. Their efforts helped establish Yosemite National Park in 1890. Yosemite Valley and the Mariposa Grove were added to the national park in 1906. The United States Army had jurisdiction over the national park from 1891 to 1914, followed by a brief period of civilian stewardship. The newly formed National Park Service took over the park's administration in 1916. Improvements to the park helped to increase visitation during this time. Preservationists led by Muir and the Sierra Club failed to save Hetch Hetchy Valley from becoming a reservoir in 1923. In 1964, 89 percent of the park was set aside in a highly protected wilderness area, and other protected areas were added adjacent to the park. The once-famous Yosemite Firefall, created by pushing red hot embers off a cliff near Glacier Point at night, was discontinued in the mid-to-late 20th century along with other activities that were deemed to be inconsistent with protection of the national park.

Curiosity is set to take its first Martian drive today, mission controllers have confirmed. The Mars rover Curiosity has been investigating the Martian weather around it and the soil beneath it, as its controllers prepare for the car-size vehicle's first drive on Mars. Last night the rover wiggled its wheels to test its motor system, and Nasa was set to send the rover its first driving commands. Scroll down for video. Handling's out of this world: Nasa's Curiosity Rovers tests its steering during final checks before it sets off across the surface of Mars. 'Late tonight, we plan to send Curiosity. the commands for doing our first drive tomorrow,' Curiosity. Mission Manager Michael Watkins of JPL said last night. 'We'll. drive about three meters forward, and then turn, and then drive back a. little less than that ... We don't back up right to the same location. that we are in right now.' If. the test, set to last around 90 minutes, is a success, Curiosity will. leave its landing spot in three or four days, Mr Watkins said. If all goes to plan Curiosity will end up parked at 90 degrees to its. original touchdown position. 'We want to park in a place we've exactly. examined. 'We just want to be extra safe,' said Mr Watkins. 'We have a couple more activities to complete before we start driving,' he said. Curiosity. will first head in the direction of Glenelg, a spot in Gale Crater less. than 500 meters (yards) away from its current position. The site. contains three different kinds of terrain that NASA scientists aim to. explore. Preparing to drive: Nasa released high resolution images of the rover's extended arm as it sent the rovers commands for its first drive on the red planet. It checks air temperature,. ground temperature, air pressure, wind and other variables every hour at. the landing site in Gale Crater. On a typical Martian day, or \\"sol,\\" based on measurements so far in the two-week old mission, air temperatures swing from 28 degrees to minus 103 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 2 to minus 75 Celsius), Nasa said. Ground temperatures change even more between afternoon and pre-dawn morning, from 37 degrees to minus 132 degrees Fahrenheit (3 to minus 91 Celsius). 'We will learn about changes from day to day and season to season,' said Javier Gómez-Elvira of the Centro de Astrobiología, Madrid, Spain, principal investigator for the suite of weather sensors called the Rover Environmental Monitoring Station (REMS). Within a week or so, daily Mars weather reports from Curiosity will become available. However, the mission also hit its first problem as scientists found one of the two sets of wind sensors is not providing data. 'One possibility is that pebbles lofted during the landing hit the delicate circuit boards on one of the two REMS booms,' said Curiosity Deputy Project Scientist Ashwin Vasavada of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif. Another new image of Curiosity's extended arm surveying the Martian landscape. Researchers found one of two wind sensors on it had not survived the landing, and believe it may have been broken by a pebble. 'We will have to be more clever about using the remaining wind sensor to get wind speed and direction.' An instrument provided by Russia is checking for water bound into minerals in the top three feet (one meter) of soil beneath the rover. It employs a technology that is used in oil prospecting on Earth, but had never before been sent to another planet. 'Curiosity has begun shooting neutrons into the ground,' said Igor Mitrofanov of Space Research Institute, Moscow, principal investigator for this instrument, called the Dynamic Albedo of Neutrons, or DAN. 'We measure the amount of hydrogen in the soil by observing how the neutrons are scattered, and hydrogen on Mars is an indicator of water.' The most likely hydrogen to be found in shallow ground of Gale Crater, near the Martian equator, is in hydrated minerals. These are minerals with water molecules, or related ions, bound into the crystalline structure of rocks. They can tenaciously retain water from a wetter past after all free water has gone. Images released last night show theCuriosity Rover is seen wiggling its wheels back and fourth during final checks before it sets off across the surface of Mars. Engineers at mission control have been running a series of tests before the one-ton vehicle's first drive which is expected in the next couple of days. The images were taken by one of Curiosity's navigation cameras. Curiosity, a six-wheeled. vehicle the size of a compact car, landed inside a vast, ancient impact. crater near Mars' equator on August 6 after an eight-month,. 354-million-mile voyage through space. Scroll down for video. Nasa's Curiosity rover has unfurled its robotic arm for the first time as scientists continue to tests its systems. The numbers around the edge are degrees of the compass and degrees below or above horizontal. The seven foot long robot arm contain a plethora of instruments, including:. A camera to capture images for analysis. A drill to get under the martian surface. A spectrometer to analyse samples. A scoop and mechanisms for sieving and portioning samples of powdered martian rock and soil. Earlier the Martian motor was shown. flexing its extending robotic arm for the first time.

The view (above)is a mosaic of low-resolution thumbnail images returned to Earth a few hours after the activity on Mars, with higher resolution versions set to follow. Curiosity landed on Mars two weeks ago to begin a two-year mission using. 10 instruments to assess whether a carefully chosen study area inside. Gale Crater has ever offered environmental conditions favorable for. microbial life. The Mars rover Curiosity zapped its first rock on Sunday with a high-powered laser gun designed to analyze Martian mineral content, and scientists declared their target practice a success. The robotic science lab aimed its laser beam at the fist-sized stone nearby and shot the rock with 30 pulses over a 10-second period, NASA said in a statement issued from mission control at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory near Los Angeles. Each pulse delivers more than 1 million watts of energy for about five one-billionths of a second, vapourising a pinhead-sized bit of the rock to create a tiny spark, which is analyzed by a small telescope mounted on the instrument. The ionized glow, which can be. observed and recorded from up to 25 feet away, is then split into its. component wavelengths by three spectrometers that give scientists. information about the chemical makeup of the target rock. Curiosity has begun its science mission on Mars by 'zapping' a rock with its laser analysis equipment. The combined system, called the Chemistry-and-Camera instrument, or ChemCam, is capable of discerning more than 6,000 different wavelengths in the ultraviolet, infrared and visible light spectrum and is designed to take about 14,000 measurements throughout Curiosity's Mars mission. The purpose of Sunday's initial use of the laser, conducted at roughly 3 a.m. Pacific time (7.00 a.m. EDT), was as 'target practice' for the instrument. But scientists will examine the data they receive to determine composition of the rock, which they dubbed 'Coronation,' NASA said. 'We got a great spectrum of Coronation - lots of signal,' said ChemCam principal investigator Roger Wiens of the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico, where the instrument was developed. 'After eight years of building the instrument, it's payoff time.' Curiosity's two-year mission is aimed at determining whether or not the planet most like Earth could have hosted microbial life.

The square inset is further magnified and processed to show the difference between images taken before and after the test. The rover's primary target is Mount Sharp, a towering mound of layered rock rising from the floor of Gale Crater. But mission controllers are gradually checking out Curiosity's sophisticated array of instruments before sending it on its first road trip across the Martian landscape. The 2.5 billion Curiosity project marks NASA's first astrobiology mission since the Viking probes to Mars during the 1970s and the most advanced robotic science lab sent to another world. The technique employed by ChemCam has been used to examine the composition of materials in other extreme environments, such as inside nuclear reactors and on the sea floor. Curiosity rover has also sent back its sharpest image of the 3-mile-high (5-kilometer-high) mountain, called Mount Sharp. The technology also has experimental applications in environmental monitoring and cancer detection. But Sunday's exercise, conducted during Curiosity's 13th full day on Mars, was the first use in interplanetary exploration, NASA said. Before Curiosity embarks on its 4.3-mile (7-km) trek to the foot of Mount Sharp, a journey that could take six months, mission controllers plan to send it out on a shorter jaunt to a spot 1,600 feet from its landing site.

John Vass, appointed head gardener in 1939, left in 1957. Called up to the RAF in 1941, he had urged that the hedges be maintained, confident that everything else in the garden could be restored after the war. Ronald Platt succeeded him from 1957 to 1959. In 1959 Pamela Schwerdt and Sibylle Kreutzberger were appointed as joint replacements. They remained at Sissinghurst until 1991, their contributions, \\"as much, if not more than Vita's, mak[ing] it the most admired and popular 20th-century garden in England\\". In 2006 they were awarded the Royal Horticultural Society's Victoria Medal of Honour for their work at Sissinghurst. The pair were followed as head gardener by Sarah Cook, who was succeeded by Alexis Datta.In 2014, Troy Scott Smith, previously head gardener at Bodnant, was appointed – the first male head gardener since the 1950s. He has written of the challenges of maintaining the garden \\"in the manner of its creator, after they have gone\\". In 2018 Scott Smith announced plans to extend the flowering season at Sissinghurst beyond the autumn period established by Schwerdt and Kreutzberger, into the winter months, allowing for year-round opening of the garden. The gardening writer and landscape critic Tim Richardson, writing in 2015, described Scott Smith's re-making of the garden: \\"Sissinghurst, more than any other garden I know, inspires extremes of emotion. There is a feeling that this is Britain's leading garden – and so, arguably, the world's, a status that has proven to be both a great boon and an albatross around its neck\\". Scott Smith's plans include the reinstatement of every species of rose known to have been grown by Sackville-West. A new history of the garden by Sarah Raven was published in 2014. Sissinghurst continues to exert considerable influence, being described as a \\"Mecca\\" and a \\"place of pilgrimage\\" for gardeners from around the world and encouraging many imitators.

Today, we are going to tell you an interesting story about a man who owns a TV station in a faraway country called Tunisia. This man got into a little bit of trouble because he showed a movie on his TV channel that some people thought was not okay. First, let's find out where Tunisia is. Tunisia is a small country in North Africa, near the big blue sea called the Mediterranean Sea. They have their own language, which is called Arabic, and people in Tunisia enjoy watching TV like we do here. Now, we must understand what a private TV station is. You see, some places have TV channels that are owned and run by the government, while others are owned by regular people or companies. This story is about a TV station that is owned by someone who is not a part of the government. One day, the man who owns this private TV station decides to show an animated film, or if you'd like to think of it, a cartoon movie. However, this cartoon movie was not like the ones we watch on Saturday mornings. Instead, some people in Tunisia believed that it had things in it that were not good for kids or grownups to see. These things, they said, were against the values and rules of the people living in Tunisia. When these people found out about the cartoon movie being shown on the TV station, they were very upset, and they told the government about it. The government looked into the matter and decided that the owner of the TV station had broken some rules by showing that movie. Because of that, the government told the TV station owner that he had to pay some money for the mistake he made. This is called a fine. It's like when you do something wrong and your parents ask you to apologize or do extra chores to make up for it. In the end, the TV station owner learned his lesson: he had to be more careful about the movies he chooses to show on his TV channel, so that everyone watching at home can enjoy fun, friendly, and respectful programs! And that's the story, little friends. We learned about a faraway country called Tunisia and how the owner of a TV station got fined for showing a controversial cartoon movie. So remember, it's always important to show respect towards the values and rules that people follow, no matter where they live."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Formed in 1982 as Hellhammer, the band became Celtic Frost in 1984 and was active until 1993. It re-formed in 2001 and disbanded following frontman Tom Gabriel Fischer's departure in 2008. Celtic Frost's frontman, guitarist and singer Tom Gabriel Fischer, adopted the alias Tom Warrior. With Steve Warrior on bass, he formed one of the earliest extreme metal bands, Hellhammer, in 1981. Steve Warrior was later replaced by Martin Eric Ain - also a pseudonym. The band attracted a small international fan-base, got signed to Noise Records in Germany and recorded their debut EP Apocalyptic Raids in March 1984, now a rare find on eBay or second-hand record stores around the world. Metal publications were also skeptical of Hellhammer's musical endeavor. Metal Forces loathed the group; that started a long-lasting feud between that zine and Warrior, which kept Celtic Frost from playing in England for a couple of years. Rock Power was not fond of Hellhammer either - they considered it \\"the most terrible, abhorrent, and atrocious thing 'musicians' were ever allowed to record\\". In fact, they were \\"receiving miserable reviews everywhere\\", Warrior concluded. Regarding the controversial status of his former band, Thomas said: Way back in 1984 and 85, when Martin Eric Ain and I recorded Celtic Frost's first two albums Morbid Tales and To Mega Therion, Hellhammer lasted on us almost like a curse. Even though Hellhammer was the very reason we had thought over our goals and conceived the Frost, HH's left-overs kept being mighty rocks in our way. Many voices saw Frost as the same band with just a name-change. The lack of musical quality in HH made it almost impossible for us to get an unbiased reaction for Frost. To make a long story short, it almost killed all our work and dreams. By May 1984, Hellhammer had disbanded. Fischer and Ain, along with session drummer Stephen Priestly, regrouped as Celtic Frost. Their 1984 debut mini-LP, Morbid Tales was a hit in the underground metal scene, and the band set out on its first tour, through Germany and Austria. This was followed with an EP Emperor's Return. Both early releases are now available on the one CD.

Are these two questions asking the same thing?","completion":"First question: What would have happened if Germany had won WWII? It is vital to note that any discussion about such an alternate history is purely speculative in nature. However, if Nazi Germany had emerged victorious in World War II, the consequences would have been profound and far-reaching. Several possible outcomes can be hypothesized: 1. Europe and Beyond: Nazi Germany, led by Adolf Hitler, was driven by the goal of establishing a racially pure, unified Greater German Reich. If Germany had won, they would have turned most of Europe into their subjugate and there would be massive forced deportations, exterminations or enslavement of people they deemed as racially \\"undesirable\\". The Holocaust, which led to the extermination of millions of Jews, would have continued unchecked, and its scope likely broadened to include Romani people, Slavs, and other marginalized populations. A brutal fascist regime would rule Europe under the iron grip of the Nazi Party. 2. Economic Impact: A victorious Germany would have aggressively plundered the resources and wealth of European countries, leading to potentially devastating economic consequences for much of the continent. Enslaving conquered populations would create a forced labor force that would contribute to rebuilding the German military and infrastructure. 3. Geopolitical Consequences: The Soviet Union and communism would likely have been defeated and disintegrated under a German conquest. As a result, the Cold War may not have taken place in the same way, or at all, in the absence of a strong communist presence. The United States would have emerged from WWII as the primary power balancing against Nazi Germany, and the global power structure would be completely different from the one we know today. 4. Science, technology, and culture: Nazi Germany placed a strong emphasis on technological advancements, especially in the military field. In a victorious scenario, the German war machine would have likely continued to innovate, with potential advancements in jet engines, rocketry, and perhaps even nuclear weapons. Cultural outputs, including art, literature, and cinema, would have been tightly controlled and censored by the Nazi regime, potentially stifling creativity and free expression across a vast portion of the world. Second question: Why did Germany lose WWII? There are multiple reasons why Germany ultimately lost World War II: 1. Strategic Errors: Adolf Hitler made several strategic errors, such as invading the Soviet Union in 1941. The invasion, Operation Barbarossa, led to a prolonged and costly war on the Eastern Front that severely depleted Germany's military and economic resources. 2. War on Multiple Fronts: Germany had to fight against the Allied forces on multiple fronts, stretching its resources thin. After the United States entered the war in December 1941, Germany had to confront the combined efforts of the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom, which ultimately overwhelmed German forces. 3. Economic Limitations: Although Germany had a strong and advanced military, it did not have the economic resources to match the United States and other Allied powers. The expansion of the war across multiple fronts and the need to maintain a vast army, navy, and air force drained the German economy, and by 1944, the Third Reich was in an economically precarious position. 4. Increased Allied Cooperation: The Allies worked closely together and coordinated their efforts against Germany in the latter stages of the war. This united front allowed them to effectively push the Germans back on both Eastern and Western fronts. 5. Technological Superiority: The Allied powers, particularly the United States, began to surpass Germany in terms of technological advancements. This proved decisive during the later stages of the war, especially in the air and naval battles. In conclusion, while these two questions are related, they are not asking precisely the same thing. The first question deals with a speculative alternate history in which Germany emerged victorious in WWII, and the potential consequences of that victory. The second question examines the real-world reasons why Germany lost WWII and the Allied powers triumphed. The connection between the two questions lies in their exploration of how Germany's victory or defeat shaped the world at large and the course of history."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Decomposition increases the amount of nutrients in the soil - This statement suggests that the process of decomposition adds nutrients to the soil. 2. Annelida aid the earth by redepositing - Annelida, which refers to a group of organisms that includes earthworms, help by redepositing something back into the earth.

Question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the full name of the persont that painted Charles IV of Spain and His Family? , can you please find it? In 1692, the Neapolitan painter Luca Giordano became one of the few allowed to view paintings held in Philip IV's private apartments, and was greatly impressed by Las Meninas. Giordano described the work as the \\"theology of painting\\", and was inspired to paint A Homage to Velázquez (National Gallery, London). By the early 18th century his oeuvre was gaining international recognition, and later in the century British collectors ventured to Spain in search of acquisitions. Since the popularity of Italian art was then at its height among British connoisseurs, they concentrated on paintings that showed obvious Italian influence, largely ignoring others such as Las Meninas.An almost immediate influence can be seen in the two portraits by Mazo of subjects depicted in Las Meninas, which in some ways reverse the motif of that painting. Ten years later, in 1666, Mazo painted Infanta Margaret Theresa, who was then 15 and just about to leave Madrid to marry the Holy Roman Emperor. In the background are figures in two further receding doorways, one of which was the new King Charles (Margaret Theresa's brother), and another the dwarf Maribarbola. A Mazo portrait of the widowed Queen Mariana again shows, through a doorway in the Alcázar, the young king with dwarfs, possibly including Maribarbola, and attendants who offer him a drink. Mazo's painting of The Family of the Artist also shows a composition similar to that of Las Meninas. Francisco Goya etched a print of Las Meninas in 1778, and later used Velázquez's painting as the model for his Charles IV of Spain and His Family. As in Las Meninas, the royal family in Goya's work is apparently visiting the artist's studio. In both paintings the artist is shown working on a canvas, of which only the rear is visible. Goya, however, replaces the atmospheric and warm perspective of Las Meninas with what Pierre Gassier calls a sense of \\"imminent suffocation\\".

While not as famous as some of their other collaborations (such as THE BLACK CAT and THE BODY SNATCHER), this is a dandy little horror film even though the casting decisions were a bit odd. Boris Karloff plays Dr. Janos Rukh, a weird scientist who lives in the Carpathian mountains--near where the Dracula character's home town. Bela Lugosi plays Dr. Benet--whose nationality was never discussed though the name certainly sounds French. I really think it would have made sense to have the two switch roles, as the Carpathian role seems tailor made for Lugosi--especially with his accent. However, despite this unusual twist, the two still did excellent jobs. Karloff's was definitely the lead role, but Lugosi acquitted himself well as a relatively normal person--something he didn't play very often in films!! It seems that Dr. Rukh is a bit of a pariah, as other scientists (especially Benet) think his theories are bizarre and nonsensical. However, over the course of the film, Rukh turns out to be right and Benet is especially generous in his new praise for Rukh. But, unfortunately, the wonderful new element that Rukh discovered has the nasty side effect of turning him into a crazy killing machine (don't you hate it when that happens?). While this could have just been a simple nice scientist turned mad story, the plot was well constructed, the characters nicely developed and the mad Rukh was NOT a one-dimensional killer, but complex and interesting. This film is bound to be enjoyed by anyone except for people who hate old horror films. You can really tell that Universal Pictures pulled out all the stops and made a bigger-budget film instead of the cheap quickies both Lugosi and Karloff unfortunately gravitated in later years. Good stuff. Did this review think positively or negatively of the movie?","completion":"This review thought positively of the movie.

Information: - Earth, otherwise known as the world, is the third planet from the Sun and the only object in the Universe known to harbor life. It is the densest planet in the Solar System and the largest of the four terrestrial planets. - The Tharsis Montes are three large shield volcanoes in the Tharsis region of the planet Mars. From north to south, the volcanoes are Ascraeus Mons, Pavonis Mons and Arsia Mons. Mons (plural \\"montes\\") is the Latin word for mountain. It is a descriptor term used in astrogeology for mountainous features in the Solar System. - Biblis Tholus is an extinct Martian volcano located at 2.55 ° N 235.62 ° E , one of two volcanoes near the center of the Tharsis volcanism . Along with Ulysses Tholus , it is almost midway between Olympus Mons and the Tharsis Montes . It is approximately 170 kilometers ( 110 mi ) long and 100 kilometers ( 62 mi ) wide , rising about 3 kilometers ( 1.9 mi ) from its surroundings . In the middle of the volcano is a caldera , named Biblis Patera , believed to have formed as the result of collapse of the magma chamber during eruptions of the volcano . The caldera is 53 kilometers ( 33 mi ) in diameter and four kilometers ( 2.5 miles ) in depth . - A mountain is a large landform that stretches above the surrounding land in a limited area, usually in the form of a peak. A mountain is generally steeper than a hill. Mountains are formed through tectonic forces or volcanism. These forces can locally raise the surface of the earth. Mountains erode slowly through the action of rivers, weather conditions, and glaciers. A few mountains are isolated summits, but most occur in huge mountain ranges. - Lava is the molten rock expelled by a volcano during an eruption. The resulting rock after solidification and cooling is also called \\"lava\\". The molten rock is formed in the interior of some planets, including Earth, and some of their satellites. The source of the heat that melts the rock within the earth is geothermal energy. When first erupted from a volcanic vent, lava is a liquid usually at temperatures from . - Mount Everest, also known in Nepal as Sagarmth and in China as Chomolungma/, is earth's highest mountain. Its peak is above sea level. Mount Everest is in the Mahalangur Range. The international border between China (Tibet Autonomous Region) and Nepal runs across Everest's summit point. Its massif includes neighbouring peaks Lhotse, ; Nuptse, , and Changtse, . - Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System, after Mercury. Named after the Roman god of war, it is often referred to as the \\"Red Planet\\" because the iron oxide prevalent on its surface gives it a reddish appearance. Mars is a terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere, having surface features reminiscent both of the impact craters of the Moon and the valleys, deserts, and polar ice caps of Earth. - A magma chamber is a large underground pool of liquid rock found beneath the surface of the Earth. The molten rock in such a chamber is under great pressure, and given enough time, that pressure can gradually fracture the rock around it creating outlets for the magma. If it finds a way to the surface, then the result will be a volcanic eruption; consequently many volcanoes are situated over magma chambers. Magma chambers are hard to detect, and most of the known ones are therefore close to the surface of the Earth, commonly between 1 km and 10 km under the surface. In geological terms, this is extremely close to the surface, although in human terms, it is considerably deep underground. - The Tharsis quadrangle is one of a series of 30 quadrangle maps of Mars used by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Astrogeology Research Program. The Tharsis quadrangle is also referred to as MC-9 (Mars Chart-9). - Ascraeus Mons is a large shield volcano located in the Tharsis region of the planet Mars. It is the northernmost and tallest of three shield volcanoes collectively known as the Tharsis Montes. The volcano's location corresponds to the classical albedo feature Ascraeus Lacus. - A volcano is a rupture in the crust of a planetary-mass object, such as Earth, that allows hot lava, volcanic ash, and gases to escape from a magma chamber below the surface. - Olympus Mons (Latin for Mount Olympus) is a very large shield volcano on the planet Mars. By one measure, it has a height of nearly 22 km (13.6 mi). Olympus Mons stands about two and a half times as tall as Mount Everest's height above sea level. It is the youngest of the large volcanoes on Mars, having formed during Mars's Hesperian Period. It is currently the largest volcano discovered in the Solar System and had been known to astronomers since the late 19th century as the albedo feature Nix Olympica (Latin for \\"Olympic Snow\\"). Its mountainous nature was suspected well before space probes confirmed its identity as a mountain. - A space probe is a robotic spacecraft that leaves Earth orbit and explores space. It may approach the Moon; enter interplanetary space; flyby, orbit, or land on other planetary bodies; or approach interstellar space. - Magma (from Ancient Greek (\\"mágma\\") meaning \\"thick unguent\\") is a mixture of molten or semi-molten rock, volatiles and solids that is found beneath the surface of the Earth, and is expected to exist on other terrestrial planets and some natural satellites. Besides molten rock, magma may also contain suspended crystals, dissolved gas and sometimes gas bubbles. Magma often collects in magma chambers that may feed a volcano or solidify underground to form an intrusion. Magma is capable of intruding into adjacent rocks (forming igneous dikes and sills), extrusion onto the surface as lava, and explosive ejection as tephra to form pyroclastic rock. - Pavonis Mons (Latin for \\"peacock mountain\\") is a large shield volcano located in the Tharsis region of the planet Mars. It is the middle member of a chain of three volcanic mountains (collectively known as the Tharsis Montes) that straddle the Martian equator between longitudes 235°E and 259°E. The volcano was discovered by the Mariner 9 spacecraft in 1971 and was originally called Middle Spot. Its name formally became Pavonis Mons in 1973. - Ulysses Tholus is a Martian volcano. It is located in the Tharsis quadrangle at 2.89° north latitude and 121.55° west longitude. It is 58 km across and is named after a classical albedo feature name. Ulysses Tholus is immediately east and slightly north of another volcano, Biblis Tholus. - Mount Olympus (also transliterated as Olympos, and on Greek maps, Oros Olympos) is the highest mountain in Greece and the second highest mountain in the Balkans. It is located in the Olympus Range on the border between Thessaly and Macedonia, between the regional units of Pieria and Larissa, about southwest from Thessaloniki. Mount Olympus has 52 peaks, deep gorges, and exceptional biodiversity. The highest peak \\"Mytikas\\", meaning \\"nose\\", rises to . It is one of the highest peaks in Europe in terms of topographic prominence. - Tharsis is a vast volcanic plateau centered near the equator in the western hemisphere of Mars. The region is home to the largest volcanoes in the Solar System, including the three enormous shield volcanoes Arsia Mons, Pavonis Mons, and Ascraeus Mons, which are collectively known as the Tharsis Montes. The tallest volcano on the planet, Olympus Mons, is often associated with the Tharsis region but is actually located off the western edge of the plateau. The name Tharsis is the Greco-Latin transliteration of the biblical Tarshish, the land at the western extremity of the known world. - Arsia Mons is the southernmost of three volcanos (collectively known as Tharsis Montes) on the Tharsis bulge near the equator of the planet Mars. To its north is Pavonis Mons, and north of that is Ascraeus Mons. The tallest volcano in the solar system, Olympus Mons, is to its northwest. Its name comes from a corresponding albedo feature on a map by Giovanni Schiaparelli, which he named in turn after the legendary Roman forest of Arsia Silva. - Tarshish occurs in the Hebrew Bible with several uncertain meanings, most frequently as a place (probably a large city or region) far across the sea from the Land of Israel and Phoenicia. Tarshish was said to have supplied vast quantities of important metals to Israel and Phoenicia. The same place-name occurs in the Akkadian inscriptions of Esarhaddon (the Assyrian king, d. 669 BC) and also on the Phoenician inscription on the Nora Stone, indicating that it was a \\"real\\" place; its precise location was never commonly known, and was eventually lost in antiquity. Legends grew up around it over time so that its identity has been the subject of scholarly research and commentary for more than two thousand years. Its importance stems in part from the fact that Hebrew biblical passages tend to understand Tarshish as a source of King Solomon's great wealth in metals - especially silver, but also gold, tin and iron (Ezekiel 27). The metals were reportedly obtained in partnership with King Hiram of Phoenician Tyre (Isaiah 23), and the fleets of Tarshish-ships. However, Solomon's Temple was destroyed by the Babylonians, thus archaeological evidence has been difficult to uncover.

Joe (Tony Curtis) is an irresponsible jazz saxophone player, gambler and ladies' man; his friend Jerry (Jack Lemmon) is a sensible jazz double-bass player; both are working in a speakeasy (disguised as a funeral home) owned by mob gangster \\"Spats\\" Colombo (George Raft). When the joint is raided by the police after being tipped off by informant \\"Toothpick\\" Charlie (George E. Stone), Joe and Jerry fleeâonly to accidentally witness Spats and his henchmen exacting his revenge on \\"Toothpick\\" and his own gang (inspired by the real-life Saint Valentine's Day Massacre). Penniless and in a mad rush to get out of town, the two musicians take a job with Sweet Sue (Joan Shawlee) and her Society Syncopators, an all-female band headed to Miami. Disguised as women and renaming themselves Josephine and Daphne, they board a train with the band and their male manager, Bienstock. Before they board the train, Joe and Jerry notice Sugar Kane (Marilyn Monroe), the band's vocalist and ukulele player.

During the forbidden drinking and partying on the train, Josephine and Daphne become intimate friends with Sugar, and have to struggle to remember that they are supposed to be girls and cannot make a pass at her. Once in Miami, Joe woos Sugar by assuming a second disguise as a millionaire named Junior, the heir to Shell Oil, while feigning disinterest in Sugar.

It only says that Michael Ipgrave, the current Bishop of Lichfield, was appointed on 10 June 2016. The foundation of the cathedral dates back to the medieval period. Lichfield Cathedral, a beautiful example of gothic architecture, was constructed in the 13th and early 14th centuries, making the iconic three-spired cathedral over 700 years old. The history of Christian worship in Lichfield actually goes back even further, to the 7th century when Saint Chad, the first bishop of Lichfield, moved the center of the Diocese from Repton to Lichfield. Saint Chad established a church in Lichfield and even though the current cathedral does not include his original church, there has been continuous Christian worship at the site since then. Through the centuries, the cathedral has undergone various restoration projects due to different reasons, such as damage inflicted during the English Civil War in the 17th century, or to maintain and enhance the structure and its intricate features. The position of the bishop evolved and changed over time as well, with Michael Ipgrave being the 99th and current Bishop of Lichfield.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the name of the person who asserted that the concept, melodies, and lyrics of \\"Already Gone\\" and \\"Halo\\" are completely different?, using the article: Soon after composing \\"Halo\\", Tedder worked with Kelly Clarkson on her fourth studio album, All I Ever Wanted (2009), for which they wrote \\"Already Gone\\" together. When the song came out, critics noted a resemblance to Beyoncé's \\"Halo\\". Clarkson, however, initially stated that she was unaware of any similarities between the two songs. She eventually realized their resemblance when she listened to both recordings closely; the similarities are most notable in the backing tracks, which in both cases feature a melancholy piano, loud drums, and handclaps. Clarkson tried to prevent \\"Already Gone\\" from being included on All I Ever Wanted, but it was impossible to make last minute changes, as her album was already being printed when I Am... Sasha Fierce was released. She accused Tedder of using the same arrangement on both \\"Already Gone\\" and \\"Halo\\", and complained that people would, incorrectly, assume she was stealing it from Beyoncé.Clarkson was furious, and confronted Tedder on the phone. In response, Tedder commented that he would never give two artists the same musical arrangement, and that her criticism was \\"hurtful and absurd\\". He asserted that the concept, melodies, and lyrics of \\"Already Gone\\" and \\"Halo\\" are completely different. Calling \\"Already Gone\\" one of the best songs he had ever composed, Tedder challenged people to \\"listen [to the two ballads] and form their own opinions\\". Clarkson also tried to stop her label, RCA, from releasing \\"Already Gone\\" as a single because she respected Beyoncé, but they went against her will and released it. She said, \\"It's one of those things I have no control over. I already made my album.

The Pacific ocean has less phytoplankton and nutrients for marine life. Which ocean experiences a stronger coastal upwelling? Hint: Among the tropical oceans, the western Indian Ocean hosts one of the largest concentration of phytoplankton blooms in summer, due to the strong monsoon winds. The monsoonal wind forcing leads to a strong coastal and open ocean upwelling, which introduces nutrients into the upper zones where sufficient light is available for photosynthesis and phytoplankton production. These phytoplankton blooms support the marine ecosystem, as the base of the marine food web, and eventually the larger fish species. The Indian Ocean accounts for the second largest share of the most economically valuable tuna catch. Its fish are of great and growing importance to the bordering countries for domestic consumption and export. Fishing fleets from Russia, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan also exploit the Indian Ocean, mainly for shrimp and tuna.Research indicates that increasing ocean temperatures are taking a toll on the marine ecosystem. A study on the phytoplankton changes in the Indian Ocean indicates a decline of up to 20% in the marine phytoplankton in the Indian Ocean, during the past six decades. The tuna catch rates have also declined abruptly during the past half century, mostly due to increased industrial fisheries, with the ocean warming adding further stress to the fish species.Endangered marine species include the dugong, seals, turtles, and whales.An Indian Ocean garbage patch was discovered in 2010 covering at least 5 million square kilometres (1.9 million square miles). Riding the southern Indian Ocean Gyre, this vortex of plastic garbage constantly circulates the ocean from Australia to Africa, down the Mozambique Channel, and back to Australia in a period of six years, except for debris that get indefinitely stuck in the centre of the gyre.The garbage patch in the Indian Ocean will, according to a 2012 study, decrease in size after several decades to vanish completely over centuries. Over several millennia, however, the global system of garbage patches will accumulate in the North Pacific.In 2016 six new animal...

Addison held Tracy in her arms lovingly. Given the context: What will Tracy want to do next? A:","completion":"Based on the context provided, Tracy is likely the newborn baby that Addison's best friend has just given birth to. As for what Tracy would want to do next, since she's a newborn, her needs and desires would be quite basic at this stage. These typically include: 1. Sleep: Newborns sleep for most of the day, so it's possible that Tracy would want to take a nap or continue sleeping as Addison holds her. 2. Feed: Newborn babies require feeding every 2-3 hours. Given the time elapsed since her last feeding, Tracy might want breastmilk from her mother or formula if she's not being nursed. 3. Be comforted: If Tracy is awake and feeling uncomfortable, she might want to be swaddled or cuddled to feel secure and calm. 4. Get a diaper change: If Tracy's diaper is wet or soiled, she might be in need of a diaper change to keep her comfortable and prevent irritation. It is important to note that newborn babies cannot express their desires through words or detailed actions. Instead, they communicate their needs through cues such as crying, facial expressions, and body language. So, Tracy's next move will revolve around her most immediate and basic needs at this moment, which only adults and caregivers can interpret and respond to accordingly."},{"prompt":"Is this product review positive?

Fact 2: Sunlight is composed of photons, or particles of solar energy. Given the two facts above, answer the question \\"What does a plant need in order to grow?\\" with the following options: - body water - rocks - wind - nutrients - photons - sugar - sound waves - cells Answer:","completion":"In order to grow, plants require primarily sunlight, water, nutrients, and cells. These are not the only requirements but they are the primary ones. From the options given, photons and nutrients are directly relevant. This is because photons, which make up sunlight, are absorbed by the plant for the process of photosynthesis. The process of photosynthesis is vital for plant growth as it allows plants to convert light energy, usually from the sun, into chemical energy that can be later used to fuel the plant's activities. As per Fact 1 provided, a plant requires sunlight to grow, and according to Fact 2, sunlight is composed of photons. Therefore, the photons are playing a key role for plants growth. Nutrients are also essential for plant growth. They absorb these from the soil through their roots. These nutrients, like nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, are important because they contribute to different aspects of the plant's growth and health. For instance, nitrogen is central to the creation of protein essential for new tissues. Phosphorous plays a key role in the process of photosynthesis, nutrient transportation, and energy transfer. Potassium promotes overall plant vigor. Apart from sunlight (photons) and nutrients, plants also need water which comprise a major part of a plant's body and are involved in almost every function of its growth and development. While it's not directly mentioned in this list as \\"body water\\", water is absolutely critical for a plant's growth. Cells are also essential. Plant cells have unique features that distinguishes them from animals cells, such as a cell wall and chloroplasts, which are involved in photosynthesis. Plant cells divide and differentiate to allow for growth in size and complexity in different parts of the plant. While elements like rocks and wind can indirectly influence a plant's growth by affecting factors like soil quality and pollination, they are not direct growth requirements. Sugar, produced by the plant itself through photosynthesis, is a source of energy that contributes to the growth of the plant. Sound waves do not significantly contribute to plant growth under normal circumstances. To summarize, the answer to \\"What does a plant need in order to grow?\\" from the given options would be photons (from sunlight), nutrients, and cells. Even not listed in the options, water is also a primary essential factor needed by plants for their growth."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the name of the best known non-vocal piece by Massenet?, using the article: Massenet was a fluent and skilful orchestrator, and willingly provided ballet episodes for his operas, incidental music for plays, and a one-act stand-alone ballet for Vienna (Le carillon, 1892). Macdonald remarks that Massenet's orchestral style resembled that of Delibes, \\"with its graceful movement and bewitching colour\\", which was highly suited to classical French ballet. The Méditation for solo violin and orchestra, from Thaïs, is possibly the best known non-vocal piece by Massenet, and appears on many recordings. Another popular stand-alone orchestral piece from the operas is Le dernier sommeil de la Vierge from La Vierge, which has featured on numerous discs since the middle of the 20th century.A Parisian critic, after seeing La grand' tante, declared that Massenet was a symphonist rather than a theatre composer. At the time of the British premiere of Manon in 1885, the critic in The Manchester Guardian, reviewing the work enthusiastically, nevertheless echoed his French confrère's view that the composer was really a symphonist, whose music was at its best when purely orchestral. Massenet took a wholly opposite view of his talents. He was temperamentally unsuited to writing symphonically: the constraints of sonata form bored him. He wrote, in the early 1870s, \\"What I have to say, musically, I have to say rapidly, forcefully, concisely; my discourse is tight and nervous, and if I wanted to express myself otherwise I would not be myself.\\" His efforts in the concertante field made little mark, but his orchestral suites, colourful and picturesque according to Grove, have survived on the fringes of the repertoire. Other works for orchestra are a symphonic poem, Visions (1891), an Ouverture de Concert (1863) and Ouverture de Phèdre (1873). After early attempts at chamber music as a student, he wrote little more in the genre. Most of his early chamber pieces are now lost; three pieces for cello and piano survive., what would be the answer ? Answer:","completion":"The answer to the question \\"What is the name of the best known non-vocal piece by Massenet?\\" is Méditation for solo violin and orchestra from the opera Thaïs.

What is the solution? Solve -68 + 24 = -22*k for k.","completion":"To solve the equation -68 + 24 = -22 * k for k, follow these steps: Step 1: Simplify the equation. First, simplify the left side of the equation by adding -68 and 24. -68 + 24 = -44 So, the simplified equation becomes: -44 = -22 * k Step 2: Isolate the variable k. To find the value of k, we need to isolate it by getting rid of the coefficient -22. We do this by dividing both sides of the equation by -22. -44 / -22 = (-22 * k) / -22 Step 3: Solve for k. Divide -44 by -22. -44 / -22 = 2 So, the value of k is: k = 2 Step 4: Verify the solution. To check if our solution is correct, we can substitute the value of k back into the original equation. -68 + 24 = -22 * k -68 + 24 = -22 * 2 -44 = -44 The original equation is true, which confirms that our solution is correct: k = 2"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Given the following context: After Shackleton left with the James Caird, Frank Wild took command of the Elephant Island party, some of whom were in a low state, physically or mentally: Lewis Rickinson had suffered a suspected heart attack; Perce Blackborow was unable to walk, due to frostbitten feet; Hubert Hudson was depressed. The priority for the party was a permanent shelter against the rapidly approaching southern winter. On the suggestion of George Marston and Lionel Greenstreet, a hut—nicknamed the \\"Snuggery\\"—was improvised by upturning the two boats and placing them on low stone walls, to provide around five feet (1.5 m) of headroom. By means of canvas and other materials the structure was made into a crude but effective shelter.Wild initially estimated that they would have to wait one month for rescue, and refused to allow long-term stockpiling of seal and penguin meat because this, in his view, was defeatist. This policy led to sharp disagreements with Thomas Orde-Lees, who was not a popular man and whose presence apparently did little to improve the morale of his companions, unless it was by way of being the butt of their jokes.As the weeks extended well beyond his initial optimistic forecast, Wild established and maintained routines and activities to relieve the tedium. A permanent lookout was kept for the arrival of the rescue ship, cooking and housekeeping rotas were established, and there were hunting trips for seal and penguin. Concerts were held on Saturdays and anniversaries were celebrated, but there were growing feelings of despondency as time passed with no sign of the ship. The toes on Blackborow's left foot became gangrenous from frostbite and, on 15 June, had to be amputated by surgeons Alexander Macklin and James McIlroy in the candle-lit hut. Using the very last of the chloroform in their medical supplies, the whole procedure took 55 minutes and was a complete success.By 23 August, it seemed that Wild's no-stockpiling policy had failed.

This means the dog generates less heat through the (A) tall grass or (B) short grass Do not use A and B to answer the question but instead, choose between \\"short grass\\" and \\"tall grass\\".","completion":"The dog generates less heat when running through short grass. The reason behind this lies in the factors that affect heat generation in a dog when running through grass of different heights. First, let's understand the association between speed, friction and heat production. When a dog runs through short grass, it can maintain a faster pace as there is a reduced resistance. The blades of grass offer comparatively less friction against the dog's body, specifically its legs and underbelly, as it moves through the short grass. Less friction equals less energy expenditure, which consequently results in a reduced amount of heat generated by the dog's muscles. On the other hand, when a dog runs through tall grass, it faces increased resistance due to the height and density of the blades of grass, which disrupt its movement. Consequently, the dog experiences a higher amount of friction as it constantly pushes against the grass, forcing it to use more energy to maintain its pace. In this scenario, the dog's muscles will work harder to overcome the resistance, and as a result, the dog generates more heat. Additionally, the dog's body posture in both cases can also indicate the heat generation. In short grass, the dog can maintain an efficient and natural posture, with proper distribution of force and muscle work. However, in tall grass, the dog might adapt an unnatural posture and gait to navigate through the grass, causing it to use its muscles inefficiently and generate more heat. Taking all these factors into account, it is evident that a dog generates less heat when running through short grass than it does when running through tall grass."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

This harbour, Front Bay, was first used by the ancient Kingdom of Awsan between the 5th and 7th centuries BC. The modern harbour is on the other side of the peninsula. Aden gives its name to the Gulf of Aden. - Swayne 's hartebeest ( Alcelaphus buselaphus swaynei ) is an endangered antelope native to Ethiopia . Two of the largest remaining populations are located in Senkelle Swayne 's Hartebeest Sanctuary and Maze National Park . It has been extirpated from Somalia . It is named after British officer H. G. C. Swayne ( 1860 -- 1940 ) . - Bison are large, even-toed ungulates in the genus \\"Bison\\" within the subfamily Bovinae. - A country is a region that is identified as a distinct national entity in political geography. A country may be an independent sovereign state or one that is occupied by another state, as a non-sovereign or formerly sovereign political division, or a geographic region associated with sets of previously independent or differently associated people with distinct political characteristics. Regardless of the physical geography, in the modern internationally accepted legal definition as defined by the League of Nations in 1937 and reaffirmed by the United Nations in 1945, a resident of a country is subject to the independent exercise of legal jurisdiction. - The even-toed ungulates (order Artiodactyla) are ungulates (hoofed animals) whose weight is borne equally by the third and fourth toes. By contrast, odd-toed ungulates, such as horses, bear their weight primarily on their third toe. The aquatic Cetaceans (whales, dolphins, and porpoises) evolved from even-toed ungulate ancestors, and therefore modern taxonomic classification combines Artiodactyla and Cetacea into Cetartiodactyla. - Ethiopia ('), officially known as the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia\\"' ( , \\"yetiyoya Fdralaw Dmokirasyaw Rpebilk\\" ), is a country located in the Horn of Africa. It shares borders with Eritrea to the north and northeast, Djibouti and Somalia to the east, Sudan and South Sudan to the west, and Kenya to the south. With nearly 100 million inhabitants, Ethiopia is the most populous landlocked country in the world, as well as the second-most populous nation on the African continent after Nigeria. It occupies a total area of , and its capital and largest city is Addis Ababa. - Eurasia is the combined continental landmass of Europe and Asia. The term is a portmanteau of its constituent continents. Located primarily in the Northern and Eastern Hemispheres, it is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the west, the Pacific Ocean to the east, the Arctic Ocean to the north, and by Africa, the Mediterranean Sea, and the Indian Ocean to the south. The division between Europe and Asia as two different continents is a historical and cultural construct, with no clear physical separation between them; thus, in some parts of the world, Eurasia is recognized as the largest of five or six continents. In geology, Eurasia is often considered as a single rigid megablock. However, the rigidity of Eurasia is debated based on the paleomagnet data. - The domestic goat (\\"Capra aegagrus hircus\\") is a subspecies of goat domesticated from the wild goat of southwest Asia and Eastern Europe. - An antelope is a member of a number of even-toed ungulate species indigenous to various regions in Africa and Eurasia. Antelopes comprise a wastebasket taxon (miscellaneous group) within the family Bovidae, encompassing those Old World species that are not cattle, sheep, buffalo, bison, or goats. A group of antelope is called a herd. - The sheep (\\"Ovis aries\\") is a quadrupedal, ruminant mammal typically kept as livestock. Like all ruminants, sheep are members of the order Artiodactyla, the even-toed ungulates. Although the name \\"sheep\\" applies to many species in the genus \\"Ovis\\", in everyday usage it almost always refers to \\"Ovis aries\\". Numbering a little over one billion, domestic sheep are also the most numerous species of sheep. An adult female sheep is referred to as a \\"ewe\\", an intact male as a \\"ram\\" or occasionally a \\"tup\\", a castrated male as a \\"wether\\", and a younger sheep as a \\"lamb\\". - A herd is a social grouping of certain animals of the same species, either wild or domestic. The form of collective animal behavior associated with this is referred to as \\"herding\\". What object entity has the relation of 'taxon rank' with the subject 'swayne's hartebeest'?

After moving to Havana in the sixties to continue his studies, Reinaldo begins to explore his ambitions, as well as his sexuality. After receiving an honorary mention in a writing contest, Arenas is offered the chance to publish his first work. Through his work and friendships with other openly gay men (such as Pepe Malas and Tomas Diego), Arenas manages to find himself. The political climate in Cuba becomes increasingly dangerous, and in the early seventies Arenas is arrested for allegedly sexually assaulting minors, and for publishing abroad without official consent. In the next decade, Arenas is in and out of prison, attempting and failing to leave the country several times. In 1980, Arenas finally leaves Cuba for the US, starting a new life with his close friend Lazaro Gomez Carriles.

Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","completion":"Questions 1 and 2 are indeed asking the same thing but in slightly different ways. Both questions are seeking information about countries' flags that have interesting stories or histories behind them. To provide a comprehensive answer to both questions, I will detail a few examples of countries with intriguing stories behind their flags. 1. United States of America - The Stars and Stripes The flag of the United States, commonly known as the Stars and Stripes, has 13 horizontal red and white stripes, representing the 13 original colonies. The blue rectangle in the canton holds 50 white, five-pointed stars, representing the current 50 US states. The legend of Betsy Ross creating the first American flag is widely known; however, it is disputed among historians. The design now attributed to Ross, chosen in 1777, has gone through 27 different versions as new states joined the Union. The current version was adopted on July 4, 1960, after Hawaii became the 50th state. 2. Brazil - The Yellow Diamond and Blue Circle The flag of Brazil features a green field with a large yellow diamond in the center, inside of which is a blue circle with 27 white, five-pointed stars arranged in the shape of the night sky as it appeared over Rio de Janeiro on November 15, 1889. The stars represent the 26 Brazilian states and the Federal District. The flag's green and yellow colors represent the House of Braganza and the House of Habsburg, the two royal houses of Pedro I and his wife Maria Leopoldina, who declared Brazil's independence from Portugal. 3. South Africa - The Multicolored Flag The South African flag is a vibrant and unique design, representing the diverse nature of the nation. Adopted in 1994, following the end of apartheid, the flag's six colors symbolize unity and progress. The Y-shaped design combines the red, white, and blue colors of the Dutch and British flags (acknowledging their part in South African history) with the green, black, and gold of the African National Congress, which played a significant role in ending apartheid. The flag thus celebrates the convergence of multiple cultural, historical, and political influences. 4. United Kingdom - The Union Jack The Union Jack is a combination of three different flags: England's St. George's Cross (red cross on a white field), Scotland's St. Andrew's Cross (white diagonal cross on a blue field), and Ireland's St. Patrick's Cross (red diagonal cross on a white field). The flag represents the unity of these three countries under the United Kingdom. However, the Welsh flag is notably absent from the design as, by the time the Union Jack was created, Wales had already been annexed by England and was thereby represented by the St. George's Cross. Due to this complex history, the Union Jack is an excellent example of a flag with a compelling backstory. These are just a few examples of countries with interesting stories behind their flags. There are countless other flags with fascinating histories reflecting each nation's unique cultural, political, and historical influences."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: You are given a new situation: Joel has just started his first day working as a scientist in a laboratory. The first task he was given is to look at two atoms and to jot down as much information about the two as he can. First, he needs to come up with an identification for these atoms. Since he is new, he decides to keep it professional and simply call the larger of the two atoms \\"atom L\\" and the smaller one \\"atom S\\". Now that he's taken care of that he can get down to work. and a hint : The ionization energies of the representative elements generally decrease from top to bottom within a group. This trend is explained by the increase in size of the atoms within a group. The valence electron that is being removed is further from the nucleus in the case of a larger atom. The attractive force between the valence electron and the nucleus weakens as the distance between them increases and as the shielding effect increases, resulting in a lower ionization energy for the larger atoms within a group. Although the nuclear charge is increased for larger atoms, the shielding effect also increases due to the presence of a larger number of inner electrons. This is particularly easy to see in the alkali metals, where the single valence electron is shielded by all of the inner core electrons. Please answer this question : Is the shielding effect in atom S higher or lower than in atom L? Answer:","completion":"The shielding effect in atom S is higher than in atom L. To understand why, let us first briefly discuss what the shielding effect is and how it relates to the overall atomic structure. The shielding effect refers to the phenomenon where the attraction between an electron and the nucleus is partially \\"shielded\\" or weakened due to the presence of other electrons, particularly those in the inner electron shells. These inner electrons essentially block some of the attractive force from the nucleus, making it more challenging to remove an electron in the outer shells. This effect has strong implications on ionization energies, which represent the energy required to remove an electron from an atom. Now, let's go back to the hint given. It discusses ionization energies of representative elements in a group of elements, stating that the ionization energies generally decrease from top to bottom within a group. The reason behind this decrease in ionization energy is due to the increasing atomic size as well as the increasing shielding effect for larger atoms within the group. When comparing atom L and atom S, atom L is larger than atom S. As a result, the valence electrons in atom L are further from the nucleus, and the shielding effect increases due to the presence of a larger number of inner electrons. The increased shielding effect in atom L subsequently weakens the attractive force between the valence electron and the nucleus. On the other hand, atom S is smaller than atom L, meaning its valence electrons are closer to the nucleus. As a consequence, the shielding effect in atom S is lower than in atom L because there are fewer inner electrons to shield the attractive force between the valence electron and the nucleus. In conclusion, the shielding effect in atom S is lower than in atom L, as atom S is smaller with fewer inner electrons, resulting in a more significant attractive force between its valence electrons and the nucleus than in atom L. This difference in shielding effect also contributes to the variation in ionization energies between the two atoms, with atom S having a higher ionization energy than atom L due to its lower shielding effect and stronger electron-nucleus attraction."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: As his days in office wane, U.S. President Barack Obama is pushing to commute sentences of non-violent drug offenders convicted under what the White House called \\"outdated and unduly harsh\\" sentencing laws. It has become the centerpiece of his effort to reform the country’s criminal-justice system, which has the highest incarceration rate in the world. Last Friday, the President granted commutations to 42 convicted nonviolent offenders, bringing the total so far in his presidency to 348 commutations — more than any president has in nearly half a century. His predecessor, George W. Bush granted clemency in just 11 cases. It's not just Obama pushing for reform. Top Republicans and Democrats in Congress also support relaxing the sentencing laws that have tripled the federal and state prison populations in the last 30 years, reaching more than 1.56 million inmates at the end of 2014. However in Congress, the main legislative effort for sentencing changes, the Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act of 2015, has failed to pass either chamber of Congress. The bill would reduce long mandatory minimum sentences for many nonviolent drug crimes, give judges more control over the terms of punishment and provide inmates with more opportunities to get out early by participating in rehabilitation programs. Failing congressional help, Obama has in recent months relied on his presidential powers to commute the sentences of non-violent offenders. Under the Constitution, the president has the power to grant “pardons for offenses against the United States” or to commute federal sentences. A pardon is an act of presidential forgiveness and wipes away any remaining legal liabilities from a conviction. A commutation reduces a sentence but does not eliminate a conviction or restore civil rights lost as a result of the conviction. The American Bar Association has joined Obama's push and put its support behind the Clemency Project 2014, a national effort by multiple justice groups to help inmates who meet U.S. Department of Justice...

The reviewer expressed their disinterest in the show and Telly Savales' performance, calling it one-dimensional and forgettable. They also mentioned the lack of plot development and action, considering the movie dull as they have no respect or interest in the portrayal of the mafia. Additionally, the reviewer criticized the dubbing, saying it was so bad that it was almost comical, and they expect to forget the movie within a few days. While they mentioned some positive aspects, such as decent acting and cinematography, these points were generally overshadowed by their negative opinions."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: What was the name of the EP released exclusively on iTunes?

Metallica recorded a guitar-based interpretation of Ennio Morricone's \\"The Ecstasy of Gold\\" for a tribute album titled We All Love Ennio Morricone, which was released in February 2007. The track received a Grammy nomination at the 50th Grammy Awards for the category \\"Best Rock Instrumental Performance\\". A recording of \\"The Ecstasy of Gold\\" has been played to introduce Metallica's performances since the 1980s. Earlier that year, Metallica announced on its official website that after 15 years, long-time producer Bob Rock would not be producing the band's next studio album. Instead, the band chose to work with producer Rick Rubin. Metallica scheduled the release of Death Magnetic as September 12, 2008, and the band filmed a music video for the album's first single, \\"The Day That Never Comes\\". Metallica's World Magnetic Tour ended in Melbourne on November 21, 2010. The band had been touring for over two years in support of Death Magnetic. To accompany the final tour dates in Australia and New Zealand, a live, limited edition EP of past performances in Australia called Six Feet Down Under was released. The EP was followed by Six Feet Down Under (Part II), which was released on November 12, 2010.

Write a text based on \\"australian dollar continues falling\\" Text:","completion":"Title: Australian Dollar's Ongoing Descent: Analyzing Potential Influences and Possible Impacts Introduction: The Australian Dollar (AUD) has faced a constant downward trajectory in recent times, causing concerns and speculation among investors, businesses, and citizens alike. This fall in value has sparked discussions on the possible reasons behind the decline and potential implications for Australia's economy, international trade, and the global financial situation. In this article, we will delve deeper into these aspects to obtain a better understanding of the ongoing depreciation of the Australian Dollar. Reasons for the Australian Dollar's Decline: 1. Economic Slowdown: The slowdown in the Australian economy has played a significant role in driving down the value of the Australian Dollar. Factors like weak consumer spending, slow wage growth, and lower business investments have contributed to this slowdown. Additionally, falling property prices have also negatively impacted the country's economic growth. 2. Global Uncertainty: The ongoing trade tensions between the United States and China have led to uncertainty in the global market, affecting the value of currencies worldwide. As Australia strongly depends on its trade with China, any slowdown in Chinese economic growth is likely to affect the Australian economy, and in turn, the Australian Dollar. 3. Interest Rate Cut: The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) has cut interest rates multiple times in recent months to counter the economic slowdown. A lower interest rate generally signifies a weaker economy, hence putting downward pressure on the AUD. 4. Strength of the US Dollar: The US Dollar has strengthened significantly over recent years, leading to the depreciation of other currencies, including the Australian Dollar. Investors often prefer to hold assets in a strong currency, causing a shift in investments away from the AUD. Implications of the Falling Australian Dollar: 1. International Trade: A weaker Australian Dollar can lead to mixed outcomes in international trade. While a lower AUD makes Australian exports more competitive, it also increases the cost of imports, which could lead to inflationary pressures. 2. Tourism and Education: A weaker Australian Dollar makes the country more attractive for international tourists, providing an opportunity to boost the nation's tourism industry. Additionally, it makes studying in Australia more affordable for international students, potentially increasing Australia's education sector revenue. 3. Australian Businesses and Investors: For Australian businesses and investors holding assets overseas, the depreciation of the AUD can translate into increased wealth when converting foreign earnings back into Australian Dollars. However, businesses that mostly rely on imported goods will face higher input costs. 4. Consumer Spending: As the purchasing power of the Australian Dollar is reduced, Australians may experience higher prices on imported goods. This can affect consumer spending patterns and potentially cause a further slowdown in the economy. Conclusion: The continuing fall of the Australian Dollar serves as a double-edged sword. On one hand, it can boost the competitiveness of exports, tourism, and the education sector. On the other hand, it can increase the cost of living, affecting consumer spending and businesses relying on imports. Despite the negative effects, if managed well, the depreciation of the AUD presents an opportunity for the country to strengthen its economic domains and remain resilient in times of global uncertainty. Financial institutions, policymakers, and leaders must closely monitor the situation to mitigate adverse impacts and capitalize on possible benefits."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

OPTIONS: (I) movement of water away from the equator (II) cyclical variations in the height of high tides (III) reduction in velocity with distance from Earth's poles (IV) deflection of water toward the direction of airflow Answer:","completion":"The drag of wind on the ocean surface plays a significant role in the formation and behavior of ocean surface currents. This force, along with other factors like the Coriolis Effect, temperature and salinity differences, and the Earth's rotation, influences the properties of ocean surface currents. Examining the given options, the correct answer can be deduced: (I) Movement of water away from the equator: While the drag of wind does move water, it is not specifically responsible for moving water away from the equator. This movement is driven by a combination of factors, including the trade winds and westerly winds near the equator, which cause water to move poleward through Ekman Transport. (II) Cyclical variations in the height of high tides: Tides are primarily influenced by the gravitational forces exerted by the moon and the sun on Earth. Although wind can influence the movement of water near the coast and sometimes intensify storm surges, the cyclical variations in tidal heights are not caused by wind. (III) Reduction in velocity with distance from Earth's poles: Although the wind has a considerable influence on the velocity of ocean surface currents, it does not entirely account for the reduction in velocity with distance from the Earth's poles. Some amount of velocity reduction is due to a combination of the drag of wind and the Coriolis Effect, but it's not exclusively responsible for this phenomenon. (IV) Deflection of water toward the direction of airflow: Wind causes the ocean surface to move, and the drag of wind on the ocean exerts a force on the water, ultimately transferring energy from the atmosphere to the ocean. This force creates surface currents that move in the same direction as the wind. The deflection of water towards the direction of airflow is the most accurate feature of ocean surface currents that results from the drag of wind on the ocean surface. Therefore, answering the question posed, the drag of wind results in the following feature of ocean surface currents: deflection of water toward the direction of airflow (Option IV)."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Grunge is generally characterized by a sludgy electric guitar sound with a \\"thick\\" middle register and rolled-off treble tone and a high level of distortion and fuzz, typically created with small 1970s-style stompbox pedals, with some guitarists chaining several fuzz pedals together and plugging them into a tube amplifier and speaker cabinet. Grunge guitarists use very loud Marshall guitar amplifiers and some used powerful Mesa-Boogie amplifiers, including Kurt Cobain and Dave Grohl (the latter in early, grunge-oriented Foo Fighters songs ). Grunge has been called the rock genre with the most \\"lugubrious sound\\"; the use of heavy distortion and loud amps has been compared to a massive \\"buildup of sonic fog\\". or even dismissed as \\"noise\\" by one critic. As with metal and punk, a key part of grunge's sound is very distorted power chords played on the electric guitar.Whereas metal guitarists' overdriven sound generally comes from a combination of overdriven amplifiers and distortion pedals, grunge guitarists typically got all of their \\"dirty\\" sound from overdrive and fuzz pedals, with the amp just used to make the sound louder. Grunge guitarists tended to use the Fender Twin Reverb and the Fender Champion 100 combo amps (Cobain used both of these amps). The use of pedals by grunge guitarists was a move away from the expensive, studio-grade rackmount effects units used in other rock genres. The positive way that grunge bands viewed stompbox pedals can be seen in Mudhoney's use of the name of two overdrive pedals, the Univox Super-Fuzz and the Big Muff, in the title of their \\"debut EP Superfuzz Bigmuff\\". In the song Mudride, the band's guitars were said to have \\"growled malevolently\\" through its \\"Cro-magnon slog\\".

Many people insist that ideas about right and wrong are merely personal opinions. Some voices, though, are calling Americans back to traditional moral values. William J. Bennett, former U.S. Secretary of Education, edited the Book of Virtues in 1993 to do just that. Bennett suggests that great moral stories can build character. The success of Bennett ' s book shows that many Americans still believe in moral values. But what are they? One of the most basic moral values for Americans is honesty. The well-known legend about George Washington and the cherry tree tells this value clearly. Little George cut down his father's favorite cherry tree while trying out his new axe. When his father asked him about it, George said honestly, \\"I can not tell a lie. I did it with my axe.\\" Instead of punishment, George received his father's praise for telling the truth. Sometimes American honesty-being open and direct-can offend people. But Americans still believe that \\"honesty is the best policy.\\" Another virtue Americans respect is perseverance. Remember Aesop's fable( )about the rabbit and the turtle that had a race? The rabbit thought he could win easily, so he took a nap. But the turtle finally won because he didn't give up. Sympathy may be the queen of American virtues. The story of \\"The Good Samaritan\\" from the Bible describes a man who showed sympathy. On his way to a certain city, a Samaritan man found a poor traveler lying on the road. The traveler had been beaten and robbed. The kind Samaritan, instead of just passing by, stopped to help this person in need. In no way can these brief descriptions cover all the moral values honored by Americans. Responsibility, loyalty, courage, gratitude and many others could be discussed. In fact, Bennett's bestseller-over 800 pages-highlights just 10 virtues.

Though there're many kinds of resources, with the fast increase of population and the increase of many more factories, the more we use, the fewer there will be left for the future. Oil is getting less and less year after year. It's said that oil can last for only 50 years. Natural gas perhaps will last about 38 years. Oil can be used in many ways and it's difficult to imagine what the modern world will be like without oil. But oil isn't easy to find and get out of the earth. Men must study the rocks. When they think the rocks in a certain place may have oil, a metal tower is built. A machine in the tower cuts a hole down into the ground. At the same time, a steel pipe is pushed down to stop the sides from falling in and to keep out water. At last if the men are right, usually the oil rushes up the sides with great force by the pressure of the gas in the top of the rock, and it rushes high into the air. If the oil catches a light, there will be a terrible fire. So a kind of cover is fixed on the top of the pipe, and the oil can run out through taps . If we are near the middle of the oil field, we can also get gas. Such gas is sent through pipes to towns far away and used in houses and factories like coal gas. Today oil is under pressure as never before. The price of oil keeps rising all the time. In many countries, the governments encourage people to save oil as much as possible.

In 1933, during the Great Depression, New York City vaudeville actress Ann Darrow is hired by financially troubled filmmaker Carl Denham to star in a film with Herb, Carl's cameraman, Mike, Carl's soundman, Preston, Carl's assistant, and actor Bruce Baxter. Ann learns her favorite playwright, Jack Driscoll, is the screenwriter. As their tramp steamer, the SS Venture, journeys to the mysterious Skull Island, Ann and Jack fall in love. The people on the ship consist of Englehorn the captain and his crew, including Hayes, a World War One veteran, Lumpy the cook, Choy the janitor, and the Venture's lookout Jimmy. Captain Englehorn has second thoughts about the voyage, prompted by Lumpy and Hayes' speculation of trouble ahead. Deep in the southern waters, the Venture receives a radio message informing Englehorn there is a warrant for Carl's arrest due to his defiance of the studio's orders to cease production. The message instructs Englehorn to divert to Rangoon, but the ship becomes lost in fog and runs aground on the rocky shore of Skull Island. Carl and his crew explore the island and are attacked by natives, who kill Mike as well as one of the sailors. Ann screams as she is captured, and a loud roar is heard beyond a wall. After this, the matriarch of the tribe targets Ann, muttering the word \\"Kong\\". Englehorn kills one of the natives and his crew break up the attack. Back on the ship, they lighten their load to float off the rocks and carry out repairs, but Jack discovers Ann has been kidnapped and another sailor has been killed. The natives offer Ann as a sacrifice to Kong, a 25 feet (7.6 m) tall gorilla. The crew returns fully armed, but is too late as Kong takes Ann and flees into the jungle. Though initially terrified, Ann wins Kong over with juggling and dancing, and begins to grasp Kong's intelligence and capacity for emotion.

Solve this instance: Background Paragraph: The major effect of transpiration is the reduction of soil pore water pressures which counteracts the loss of strength which occurs through wetting, this is most readily seen as a loss of moisture around trees. However it is not easy to rely on tree and shrub roots to remove water from slopes and consequently help ensure slope stability. The ability to transpire in wet conditions is severely reduced and therefore any increase in soil strength previously gained in evaporation and transpiration will be lost or significantly reduced, consequently the effects of transpiration cannot be taken into account at these times. However it can be assumed that the chance of slope failure following saturation by storm event or periods of extended rainfall will be lessened as a result of transpiration. Moreover, although changes in moisture content will affect the undrained shear strength, the effective shear stress parameters as commonly used in routine slope stability analysis are not directly influenced by changing moisture content, although the water pressures (suctions) used in the analysis will change.[2][3]. Story: The two teams took different approaches in reinforcing the highway embankment slopes when building segments of the interstate. Team A led by Chuck relied almost entirely on inspiration and good building materials therefore decreasing slope stability, while team B lead by Mike used nature as an ally by planting tens of thousands of trees and shrubs to prevent slope failures and moderate soil transpiration and evaporation.

A:","completion":"Skylar's decision to tilt Kendall's head back to kiss her on the mouth could have been motivated by various factors, which can be emotional, physical, or circumstantial. It is essential to understand that this analysis is speculative, as we cannot accurately assess Skylar's intentions without direct insight. That said, some possible reasons for Skylar's actions include: 1. Comfort and ergonomics: By tilting Kendall's head back, Skylar might have been aiming to make it more comfortable for both of them during the kiss. Depending on their height difference, this might have helped align their faces better, ensuring that their lips met at a comfortable angle. 2. Intimacy and deep connection: Skylar could have been seeking a deeper sense of emotional and physical intimacy with Kendall. Tilting someone's head back during a kiss can be a tender and caring gesture, suggesting that the person values close connection and wants to create a genuinely shared moment. 3. Dominance and assertiveness: In some cases, this gesture can represent an attempt to establish dominance or a more assertive role within the relationship or interaction. By tilting Kendall's head back, Skylar may have been displaying a subtle desire to take control and lead the particular situation. 4. Expression of passion and desire: Tilting Kendall's head back might have been a way for Skylar to demonstrate their passion and enthusiasm for the relationship. It could signal that Skylar feels a strong attraction to Kendall and wanted to establish a passionate and intense moment. 5. Surprising Kendall with a romantic gesture: Sometimes, people will tilt their partner's head back during a kiss to catch them off-guard and create a memorable, romantic moment. Skylar may have wanted to surprise Kendall and make the kiss feel more special and memorable to both of them. 6. Following cues from pop culture: Movies, television shows, and other forms of media often depict romantic encounters in specific ways to evoke emotion. Skylar might have mimicked this gesture from a favorite romantic scene, believing it would create a similarly passionate experience for Kendall and themselves. In conclusion, it is difficult to pinpoint why Skylar tilted Kendall's head back to kiss her on the mouth without more context and understanding of their relationship dynamic. The reasons mentioned above, however, provide some potential explanations, such as comfort, intimacy, assertiveness, passion, surprise, or emulation of popular culture. Each of these factors could have played a role in influencing Skylar's decision and shaping the overall experience of the kiss for both partners."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write an article based on this summary: Transport officials in Washington DC have blocked plans by an American free speech pressure group to have a controversial cartoon of the Prophet Muhammad displayed on the subway. Article:","completion":"Title: Washington DC Transport Officials Reject Display of Controversial Muhammad Cartoon on Subway Introduction Transport officials in Washington DC recently decided to block the request made by an American free speech pressure group who wanted a controversial cartoon depicting Prophet Muhammad placed in the city's subway system. The situation has raised widespread debates on the importance of free speech and the difference between promoting free expression and propagating hate speech or offensive material. This article will examine the circumstances around this decision, the opinions of both opponents and proponents, and some potential implications of this controversial situation. Background The American free speech pressure group attempting to place the contentious cartoon advertisement in the subway system is the American Freedom Defense Initiative (AFDI). The organization is classified as a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center and is known for troublesome, anti-Islamic activities. AFDI had hoped to use the publicity from displaying the cartoon as a means of promoting their mission and stance on free speech, a move deemed to be offensive and provoking by many. Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority's Decision In response to the request made by AFDI, the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) rejected the application, citing safety concerns and the potential for inciting violence as the primary reasons behind their decision. WMATA stated that the display of the controversial cartoon on the subway could lead to public unrest, hostile sentiments, and even acts of terror, prompting them to prioritize the safety of commuters and staff. According to their guidelines, the transit authority holds the right to decline any advertising campaign that is deemed to incite or provoke violence, or which has the potential to harm or disrupt public order. In this case, the content's inflammatory nature and the potential backlash were determined to be reason enough to deny the capabilities of showcasing the cartoon in the transit system. Debate: Free Speech vs. Hate Speech This situation has sparked a significant debate regarding the boundaries of free speech in a democratic society. Proponents of featuring the cartoon argue that the rejection of the display undermines the freedom of expression and sets a dangerous precedent for censorship. They maintain that the mere existence of a controversial and offensive image should not be grounds for suppressing it. Conversely, opponents believe that the AFDI's attempt to display the cartoon of Prophet Muhammad in the subway system was not a genuine effort to promote free speech, but rather a calculated provocation aimed at one specific religious group. They point out that there is a significant difference between advocating for free speech and actively promoting hate speech, and that the latter should never be encouraged or tolerated. Conclusion The decision made by the WMATA to block the display of the controversial cartoon raises important questions about the limits of free speech and the role of public institutions in ensuring the safety and well-being of the public. While upholding the right to free expression is fundamental in a democratic society, it is crucial to strike a balance between this right and the protection of individuals from hate speech or offensive content that could provoke violence and endanger public order. It is essential that freedom of speech is maintained and supported, but the WMATA decision serves to remind us that there may be instances where safety concerns and the potential for hate speech to incite violence must be examined and addressed. As societies continue to grapple with these complex issues, it is crucial to engage in open, respectful dialogue about the balance between free speech, personal liberties, and social responsibilities."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Yoast debates pursuing opportunities elsewhere, but when most of his white players vow to sit out the season unless he coaches, he changes his mind and stays on as Boone's assistant.Throughout training camp and the season, Boone and Yoast's black and white players learn to accept each other, to work together, and that football knows no race. As they learn from each other, Boone and Yoast also learn from them and in turn, the whole town learns from the team, the Titans.

Single/multi-choice problem: Which of the following solutions is better for the following goal: drills Choose from: [i] can puncture steel [ii] can puncture diamond","completion":"In order to choose the better solution, we need to consider the purpose of the drill and the materials that will be drilled most frequently. Step 1: Identify the goal and materials - The goal is to have a drill that can efficiently work with a specific type of material. The materials mentioned are steel and diamond. Step 2: Analyze the options - Option [i]: Can puncture steel - Option [ii]: Can puncture diamond Step 3: Assess the utility of each option - Steel is a more common material used in various industries such as construction, automotive, and manufacturing. A drill capable of puncturing steel could be more useful in daily applications. - Diamond is a much harder material and is less commonly encountered in day-to-day operations. A drill that can puncture diamonds might have fewer practical applications, but it could be valuable in specialized industries such as mining or cutting gemstones. Step 4: Choose the better solution for the given goal Considering that the goal does not specify a particular industry or application, it is more reasonable to assume that a generally useful and versatile drill would be desired. In this case, it's better to choose the drill that can puncture steel (Option [i]).

Answer the following question: Please answer the following question about this movie plot. If it's un-answerable, please output \\"No answer\\". Question: In what town did the main characters plant their bomb? Movie plot title: What To Do In Case Of Fire Movie plot: The sound of a film reel rolling accompanies credits appearing jerkily on the screen, as if displayed by an old film projector. As the credits continue, voices and clanking sounds are heard. One says \\"Camera - rolling!\\" and another follows with \\"Group 36 Training Film.\\" After some more fumbling sounds, the training film begins. A crude map of Berlin in 1987 appears, filmed by an unsteady camera. A narrator, one of the previously heard voices, explains that Allied occupation forces rule the city, and almost every squat has been evacuated. Only one block remains: Machnow Street, zip code SO36, in the American sector. The film then gives way to footage of a crowd of jeering people in a run-down neighborhood. They begin to throw objects at a line of police holding riot shields. For a moment, the camera freezes, and the film's title, \\"Was Tun, Wenn's Brennt?\\" (What to Do in Case of Fire?) appears on the screen. Then the rioters rush the line of policemen, jumping on cars, screaming, and generally causing mayhem. The camera focuses on some of the rioters, whose names appear onscreen, introducing Tim (Til Schweiger) and Flo (Doris Schretzmayer). A water cannon, a huge, tank-like vehicle equipped with a high-pressure water hose, begins to rumble down the street. Its spray knocks down several rioters, and they begin to flee. Rioters with signs continue to mock the policemen. Two more new characters appear in the same way as the others, Maik (Sebastian Blomberg) and Nele (Nadja Uhl). Another, Terror (Matthias Matschke) urinates on the policemen from an upper-story window. Yet another, Hotte (Martin Feifel), leads a mob down a street, waving a flag bearing the symbol for anarchy. All the while, the rioters are heard shouting in the streets. The narrator begins to speak again, informing viewers that Machnow street residents live in terrible conditions. A female voice adds that they are always inebriated or on drugs. More voices chime in that these people commit vandalism, resist arrest, and are misguided and sexually...

Q: Based on this review, would the user recommend this product? === Review: Several years ago I was given a bottle of Happy and I had received many compliments while wearing it. When I went to the mall to purchase more, they were out of Happy and offered me another perfume. I was fairly pleased with that perfume and, over the past few years, I have changed perfume every time I purchased a bottle. I guess I was looking for a sort of signature fragrance, something no one else wore. Recently I was browsing Amazon and noticed Happy was available on sale and thought maybe I should give it another go, despite my desire to find some obscure scent. There is a reason Happy is so well known, it has a pleasing and not-too-strong smell. The smell lingers on my sweaters and jackets, so I do not have to re-apply all the time. Many people have commented on and complimented me on this fragrance. So I guess Happy makes me happy.

The user mentions that they had initially received Happy as a gift several years ago and had received many compliments while wearing it. When they couldn't find more at the mall, they have tried various other perfumes in search of their signature fragrance. Recently, the user rediscovered Happy on sale at Amazon and decided to give it another try despite their earlier quest for an obscure scent. The user further explains that there is a reason Happy is so well-known, as it has a pleasing and not-too-strong smell. They also appreciate that the scent lingers on their clothing, eliminating the need for constant reapplication. Additionally, they have received numerous compliments on this fragrance, which indicates that not only do they enjoy wearing it, but others around them appreciate it as well. The user ends the review by stating that Happy makes them happy, further reinforcing their positive experience and satisfaction with the product.

Given the question: I can use this background: From the data he collected and documented, Aristotle inferred quite a number of rules relating the life-history features of the live-bearing tetrapods (terrestrial placental mammals) that he studied. Among these correct predictions are the following. Brood size decreases with (adult) body mass, so that an elephant has fewer young (usually just one) per brood than a mouse. Lifespan increases with gestation period, and also with body mass, so that elephants live longer than mice, have a longer period of gestation, and are heavier. As a final example, fecundity decreases with lifespan, so long-lived kinds like elephants have fewer young in total than short-lived kinds like mice. Now, I have a new situation: John wanted to revisit Aristotle's theory of tetrapods. To that end, he chose two tetrapods, tetA and tetB. An adult tetA was heavier than an adult tetB. Moreover, a tetA had longer gestation period than tetB. He needed to figure out how their characteristics fit Aristotle's theory. Answer this question please: Which tetrapod would live longer, tetA or tetB? The answer is:","completion":"Tetrapod tetA would likely live longer than tetrapod tetB based on Aristotle's observations about the life-history features of live-bearing tetrapods. According to Aristotle's inferences, there are specific relationships between various characteristics of tetrapods, which can help us determine the probable lifespan of tetA and tetB. In the given situation, we know that an adult tetA is heavier than an adult tetB, and tetA has a longer gestation period than tetB. As Aristotle's rules suggest, there is a direct correlation between body mass, gestation period, and lifespan. Heavier tetrapods tend to have longer gestation periods, and both factors contribute to an increased lifespan as compared to their lighter, shorter-gestation counterparts. Thus, applying Aristotle's theory to tetA and tetB, we can infer that since tetA is heavier and has a longer gestation period than tetB, it is more probable that tetA would have a longer lifespan than tetB. This conclusion aligns with the observed patterns in Aristotle's study of terrestrial placental mammals, such as the comparison between elephants and mice in terms of body mass, gestation period, and lifespan."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Given the following context: There are three universities in the City of Manchester.

The University of Manchester is the largest full-time non-collegiate university in the United Kingdom and was created in 2004 by the merger of Victoria University of Manchester founded in 1904 and UMIST, founded in 1956, though the university's logo appears to claim it was established in 1824. It includes the Manchester Business School, which offered the first MBA course in the UK in 1965. Manchester Metropolitan University was formed as Manchester Polytechnic on the merger of three colleges in 1970. It gained university status in 1992, and in the same year absorbed Crewe and Alsager College of Higher Education in South Cheshire. The University of Law, the largest provider of vocation legal training in Europe, has a campus in the city.The three Universities are grouped around Oxford Road on the southern side of the city centre, which forms Europe's largest urban higher education precinct. Together they have a combined population of 76,025 students in higher education as of 2015, although almost 6,000 of them were based at Manchester Metropolitan University's campuses at Crewe and Alsager in Cheshire.One of Manchester's most notable secondary schools is the Manchester Grammar School. Established in 1515, as a free grammar school next to what is now the Cathedral, it moved in 1931 to Old Hall Lane in Fallowfield, south Manchester, to accommodate the growing student body. In the post-war period, it was a direct grant grammar school (i.e. partially state funded), but it reverted to independent status in 1976 after abolition of the direct-grant system. Its previous premises are now used by Chetham's School of Music. There are three schools nearby: William Hulme's Grammar School, Withington Girls' School and Manchester High School for Girls.

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Blackbeard's Ghost Context: Steve Walker (Dean Jones) arrives in a Maryland seacoast town to take the position of track coach at Godolphin, the local college. The night of his arrival coincides with a charity bazaar at the hotel where he will be boarding: Blackbeard's Inn, named after the notorious English pirate Captain Edward Teach, and now run by the elderly descendants of the pirate's crew. The owners are attempting to pay off their mortgage in order to keep the inn from being bought by the local crime boss, Silky Seymour (Joby Baker), who wants to build a casino on the land. In quick succession, Steve discovers his track team's shortcomings and runs afoul of the stiff dean of Godolphin College, its football coach, and Seymour; but he also makes the acquaintance of an attractive Godolphin professor, Jo Anne Baker (Suzanne Pleshette), who is anxious to help the elderly ladies save the Inn.A bidding war with the football coach at the charity auction nets Steve an antique bed warmer, once owned by Blackbeard's wife, Aldetha Teach, who - in addition to being a witch - is also the spitting image of Jo Anne. Inside this bed warmer is hidden a book of magic spells, that had once been the property of Aldetha. Steve recites one on a lark, unintentionally conjuring up the ghost of Captain Blackbeard (Peter Ustinov), who appears as a socially-inappropriate drunkard whose wife cursed him to an existence in limbo since his death in 1718 for all eternity unless he can perform one good deed.Steve and Captain Blackbeard soon learn that the two of them are bound to one another by the power of the spell and only the very reluctant and somewhat eccentric Steve can see or hear the ghost (whom is also coporial and can physically moves things with nobody seeing his physical image). As a result, the increasingly frustrated Steve must deal with the antics of the wayward pirate while attempting to revive Godolphin's track team and form a relationship with Jo Anne.The next evening, Steve gets arrested falsely for drunk driving in his automobile, which was in...

Answer the following question: Deciding to go on a diet is easy, but sticking to a diet is not easy! So, when facing that challenge, it is important to know how to reach your weight-loss goal. Of course, you have to decide you want to lose weight and be committed to doing so; then, you must stick to your guns and stay motivated or the goal will never be realized. There is no magic bullet, but there are two important tips that can help you reach your weight-loss goal. #1 – Take It a Week at a Time You must break your ultimate goal into smaller chunks and have bench marks that will indicate you are moving in the right direction. According to the Mayo Clinic, “Over the long term, it’s best to aim for losing 1 to 2 pounds (0.5 to 1 kilogram) a week.” When you have a realistic weekly weight-loss target, you will be more confident in your efforts and you will know exactly what you are going to measure at the end of each week. Your long-term goal may be 40 pounds, but take it “one week at a time” (1 to 2 pounds/week = 20 to 30 weeks) In addition to choosing a healthy diet that fits your lifestyle and current health conditions, plus a solid commitment to stay with it, don’t forget to get plenty of rest and exercise. . BUT . . . the primary target should be the number of pounds you plan to lose each week. That target should be clear – and realistic. If it is, you should be able to stick to your weight loss program and enjoy success week after week, after week. AND, feel good in the process. If you are not hitting your target, be willing to look closely at what you are doing, or not doing – and figure out why you are not reaching your weekly target. Maybe the target you set was not sensible or reasonable; or, maybe you are putting too much pressure on yourself. Honest introspection is a good way to see what you are really capable of doing and then, you can develop or choose a plan that is suitable for your unique lifestyle.

The church didn't allow the new member into it because the","completion":"church committee had implemented a set of rigorous rules and guidelines for accepting new members into their congregation. These rules were not only put into place to ensure that the members shared the same spiritual beliefs, but also to preserve the sanctity and integrity of the church; this was done in response to a recent surge in individuals joining religious institutions with the intent to sway or dismantle long-held beliefs and practices. The new member, whose name was Samuel, had been attending church services for a few months and was quite keen on joining the religious community. However, the church committee had reservations about his admission due to certain aspects of his background that were not aligned with their principles. Samuel had a history of activism and involvement in various social causes that the church deemed too radical and controversial. Additionally, he had been open about his prior religious affiliations, which appeared to be quite fluid and ever-changing, causing the committee to question the sincerity and depth of his commitment to their faith. One of the main reasons the church decided to deny Samuel's application for membership was his social media presence. On platforms like Facebook and Twitter, Samuel had shared highly charged opinions on topics such as politics, race, and gender - many of which were in direct conflict with the church's teachings and values. The committee felt that allowing Samuel to become a member might create tension within their congregation, given the strong emotions and debates surrounding such topics. They wanted to maintain a peaceful and focused environment for their members to grow in their spirituality, without having to grapple with controversial issues that could derail their religious journeys. Another important factor in the church's decision was their adherence to strict behavioral and moral codes for members. In their bylaws, they had outlined that all members must uphold a certain level of moral conduct, which included abstaining from alcohol, drugs, and other vices that could impact their spiritual well-being. Through a thorough background check, the committee discovered that Samuel had had some legal troubles in the past related to substance abuse and disorderly conduct. Although Samuel claimed to have turned a new leaf and left his past behind him, the committee felt it was too much of a risk to admit him into their community. In summary, the church didn't allow the new member into it because the committee believed that his background, social media presence, and history of activism and fluid religious affiliations posed a threat to the stability, sanctity, and cohesiveness of their religious community. They deemed that admitting Samuel as a member would risk diluting the church's core values, creating conflict, and potentially compromising the spiritual growth and unity of their congregation. They ultimately decided that, in order to preserve the integrity of their church and the well-being of their members, they had to uphold their rigorous admission standards and deny Samuel's application for membership."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A public service announcement begins running this week on NASA TV. The collaboration encourages women to reach for the stars.","completion":"Title: Reaching for the Stars: NASA and Mary J. Blige Inspire Women to Aim High Introduction In an innovative and empowering move, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has partnered with the acclaimed recording artist Mary J. Blige to launch a public service announcement (PSA) aimed at inspiring women to pursue careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and reach for the stars. Set to kick off this week on NASA TV, this collaboration serves as a powerful reminder of the potential every woman holds and the importance of nurturing female talent in the scientific realm. The Power of Collaboration NASA, an independent agency of the United States government, has long been at the forefront of space exploration, scientific research, and technological advancements. Its collaboration with Mary J. Blige, a beloved figure in the music industry with numerous accolades and awards to her name, is symbolic of the vast potential for achievement when science and arts collide. As a role model for women and girls across the globe, Mary J. Blige perfectly embodies the resilience, intelligence, and creativity necessary to break barriers in traditionally male-dominated fields. By joining forces with NASA, the duo is sending a clear message of hope and encouragement to the millions of women who aspire to excel in STEM careers. Encouraging Women to Pursue STEM Despite significant progress in recent years, women are still hugely underrepresented in STEM fields. This disparity is fueled by a multitude of factors, from gender stereotypes to a lack of female role models in these areas. The NASA and Mary J. Blige collaboration strives to challenge these outdated norms while simultaneously sparking interest in STEM among women and girls. Through the PSA campaign running NASA TV, viewers will be exposed to stories of successful women who have made their mark in fields like space exploration, research, and innovation. Highlighting the achievements of these women aims to inspire others to follow suit – moving beyond traditional gender roles and embracing the vast opportunities that exist for female scientists, mathematicians, engineers, and technologists. Reaching for the Stars The overarching theme of the collaboration - \\"Reach for the Stars\\" - serves as a powerful mantra for women seeking careers in STEM, as well as a reminder that the sky is the limit for their aspirations. By daring to dream and relentlessly pursuing their passions, women can, and will, make invaluable contributions to their respective fields. Conclusion The collaboration between NASA and Mary J. Blige is an uplifting reminder that powerful cultural icons can help dismantle the barriers that have historically prevented women from venturing into STEM careers. With the PSA launching this week on NASA TV, the campaign is set to encourage women to reach for the stars, reminding us all of the limitless potential within each individual. Ultimately, this partnership demonstrates the profound impact that can be achieved when different sectors join forces to empower, inspire, and impact change for the better. As more women pursue careers in STEM, the potential for new discoveries, groundbreaking research, and innovative problem-solving will be greatly amplified, making the world a better place for all."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Most of us celebrate Christmas just because we see many people around us do it. China has its own holidays, such as the Spring Festival and Mid-Autumn Day, so we don't have to celebrate holidays from other countries. Some people spend a lot of money celebrating Christmas Day.

However, it is essential to note that not everyone in China shares this enthusiasm for Christmas Day celebrations, as some believe that China has its own culturally significant holidays like the Spring Festival and Mid-Autumn Day. In addition, the commercial aspect of the holiday, such as spending a lot on gifts, may not be the best method to show love and care for friends and family.

Jacen is on a forest planet searching for Anakin Solo, but only encountering a Sith Lord named Darth Katai, played by Zarth. The two begin to duel, and it is an intense battle...until Greg misses his cue, incurring the wrath of writer-director Tom \\"Servo\\" Harrison. Tom gets into a fight with his friends, and they walk out on him. After a monologue based on High Fidelity, with Star Wars in the place of rock music, Tom reflects back a few months to the genesis of the fanfilm project. Tom, Greg, Jenny, and Zarth are seen hanging out at Excalibur Games, a hobby shop, playing the Star Wars pants game. Tom is revealed to be an employee at the store, working for store credit while he has his money saved up for film school.

Eric Boucher was born in Boulder, Colorado, the son of Virginia (nee Parker), a librarian, and Stanley Wayne Boucher, a psychiatric social worker and poet. He had a sister, Julie J. Boucher, the Associate Director of the Library Research Service at the Colorado State Library (who died in a mountain-climbing accident on October 12, 1996). As a child, Eric developed an interest in international politics that was encouraged by his parents. An avid news watcher, one of his earliest memories was of the John F. Kennedy assassination. In April 1986, police officers raided his house in response to complaints by the Parents Music Resource Center (PMRC). In June 1986, L.A. deputy city attorney Michael Guarino, working under City Attorney James Hahn, brought Biafra to trial in Los Angeles for distributing \\"harmful material to minors\\" in the Dead Kennedys album Frankenchrist. However, the dispute was about neither the music nor the lyrics from the album, but rather the print of the H. R. Giger poster Landscape XX (Penis Landscape) included with the album. Biafra believes the trial was politically motivated; it was often reported that the PMRC took Biafra to court as a cost-effective way of sending a message out to other musicians with content considered offensive in their music. Music author Reebee Garofalo argued that Biafra and Alternative Tentacles may have been targeted because the label was a \\"small, self-managed and self-supported company that could ill afford a protracted legal battle.\\" Facing the possible sentence of a year in jail and a 2,000 fine, Biafra, Dirk Dirksen, and Suzanne Stefanac founded the No More Censorship Defense Fund, a benefit featuring several punk rock bands, to help pay for his legal fees, which neither he nor his record label could afford. The jury deadlocked 5 to 7 in favor of acquittal, prompting a mistrial; despite a motion to re-try the case, the judge ordered all charges dropped. The Dead Kennedys disbanded during the trial, in December 1986, due to the mounting legal costs; in the wake of their disbandment, Biafra made a career of his spoken word performances. Biafra has a cameo role in the 1988 film Tapeheads. He plays an FBI agent who arrests the two protagonists (played by Tim Robbins and John Cusack). While arresting them his character asks \\"Remember what we did to Jello Biafra?\\" lampooning the obscenity prosecution. On March 25, 2005, Biafra appeared on the U.S. radio program This American Life, \\"Episode 285: Know Your Enemy\\", which featured a phone call between Jello Biafra and Michael Guarino, the prosecutor in the Frankenchrist trial. In October 1998, three former members of the Dead Kennedys sued Biafra for nonpayment of royalties. The other members of Dead Kennedys alleged that after Biafra, in his capacity as the head of Alternative Tentacles records, discovered an accounting error amounting to some 75,000 in unpaid royalties over almost a decade. Rather than informing his bandmates of this mistake, the suit alleged, Biafra knowingly concealed the information until a whistleblower employee at the record label notified the band. According to Biafra, the suit resulted from his refusal to allow one of the band's most well-known singles, \\"Holiday in Cambodia\\", to be used in a commercial for Levi's Dockers; Biafra opposes Levi's because of his claim that they use unfair business practices and sweatshop labor. Biafra maintained that he had never denied them royalties, and that he himself had not even received royalties for re-releases of their albums or \\"posthumous\\" live albums which had been licensed to other labels by the Decay Music partnership. Decay Music denied this charge and have posted what they say are his cashed royalty checks, written to his legal name of Eric Boucher. Biafra also complained about the songwriting credits in new reissues and archival live albums of songs, alleging that he was the sole composer of songs that were wrongly credited to the entire band. In May 2000, a jury found Biafra and Alternative Tentacles \\"guilty of malice, oppression and fraud\\" by not promptly informing his former bandmates of the accounting error and instead withholding the information during subsequent discussions and contractual negotiations. Biafra was ordered to pay 200,000, including 20,000 in punitive damages. After an appeal by Biafra's lawyers, in June 2003, the California Court of Appeal unanimously upheld all the conditions of the 2000 verdict against Biafra and Alternative Tentacles. Furthermore, the plaintiffs were awarded the rights to most of Dead Kennedys recorded works -- which accounted for about half the sales for Alternative Tentacles. Now in control of the Dead Kennedys name, Biafra's former bandmates went on tour with a new lead vocalist. In the early 1980s, Biafra collaborated with musicians Christian Lunch and Adrian Borland (of The Sound) for the electropunk musical project The Witch Trials, releasing one self-titled EP in its lifetime. In 1988, Biafra, with Al Jourgensen and Paul Barker of the band Ministry, and Jeff Ward, formed Lard. The band became yet another side project for Ministry, with Biafra providing vocals and lyrics. According to a March 2009 interview with Jourgensen, he and Biafra are working on a new Lard album, which is being recorded in Jourgensen's El Paso studio. While working on the film Terminal City Ricochet in 1989, Biafra did a song for the film's soundtrack with D.O.A.. As a result, Biafra worked with D.O.A. on the album Last Scream of the Missing Neighbors. Biafra also worked with Nomeansno on the soundtrack, which led to their collaboration on the album The Sky Is Falling and I Want My Mommy the following year. Biafra also provided lyrics for the song \\"Biotech is Godzilla\\" for Sepultura's 1993 album Chaos A.D.. In 1999, Biafra and other members of the anti-globalization movement protested the WTO Meeting of 1999 in Seattle. Along with other prominent West Coast musicians, he formed the short-lived band the No WTO Combo to help promote the movement's cause. The band was originally scheduled to play during the protest, but the performance was canceled due to riots. The band performed a short set the following night at the Showbox in downtown Seattle (outside the designated area), along with the hiphop group Spearhead. No WTO Combo later released a CD of recordings from the concert, entitled Live from the Battle in Seattle. As of late 2005, Biafra was performing with the band The Melvins under the name \\"Jello Biafra and the Melvins\\", though fans sometimes refer to them as \\"The Jelvins.\\" Together they have released two albums, and have been working on material for a third collaborative release, much of which was premiered live at two concerts at the Great American Music Hall in San Francisco during an event called Biafra Five-O, commemorating Biafra's 50th birthday, the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Dead Kennedys, and the beginning of legalized same-sex marriage in California. Biafra is also working with a new band known as Jello Biafra and the Guantanamo School of Medicine, which includes Ralph Spight of Victims Family on guitar and Billy Gould of Faith No More on bass. This group debuted during Biafra Five-O. In 2011, Biafra appeared in a singular concert event with an all-star cast of Southern musicians including members from Cowboy Mouth, Dash Rip Rock, Mojo Nixon and Down entitled, \\"Jello Biafra and the New Orleans Raunch & Soul All Stars\\" who performed an array of classic Soul covers to a packed house at the 12-Bar in New Orleans, Louisiana. He would later reunite with many of the same musicians during the Carnival season 2014 to revisit many of these classics at Siberia, New Orleans. A live album from the 2011 performance, Walk on Jindal's Splinters, and a companion single, Fannie May/Just a Little Bit, were released in 2015.

Jordan studied Australia, while Jeb studied Antarctica. and a hint : Some of Antarctica has been warming up; particularly strong warming has been noted on the Antarctic Peninsula. A study by Eric Steig published in 2009 noted for the first time that the continent-wide average surface temperature trend of Antarctica is slightly positive at >0.05 °C (0.09 °F) per decade from 1957 to 2006. This study also noted that West Antarctica has warmed by more than 0.1 °C (0.2 °F) per decade in the last 50 years, and this warming is strongest in winter and spring. This is partly offset by autumn cooling in East Antarctica. There is evidence from one study that Antarctica is warming as a result of human carbon dioxide emissions, but this remains ambiguous. The amount of surface warming in West Antarctica, while large, has not led to appreciable melting at the surface, and is not directly affecting the West Antarctic Ice Sheet's contribution to sea level. Instead the recent increases in glacier outflow are believed to be due to an inflow of warm water from the deep ocean, just off the continental shelf. The net contribution to sea level from the Antarctic Peninsula is more likely to be a direct result of the much greater atmospheric warming there.In 2002 the Antarctic Peninsula's Larsen-B ice shelf collapsed. Between 28 February and 8 March 2008, about 570 km2 (220 sq mi) of ice from the Wilkins Ice Shelf on the southwest part of the peninsula collapsed, putting the remaining 15,000 km2 (5,800 sq mi) of the ice shelf at risk. The ice was being held back by a \\"thread\\" of ice about 6 km (4 mi) wide, prior to its collapse on 5 April 2009. According to NASA, the most widespread Antarctic surface melting of the past 30 years occurred in 2005, when an area of ice comparable in size to California briefly melted and refroze; this may have resulted from temperatures rising to as high as 5 °C (41 °F).A study published in Nature Geoscience in 2013 (online in December 2012) identified central West Antarctica as one of the fastest-warming regions on Earth.

What evidence supports this claim?","completion":"To gather evidence supporting the claim that EU expansion is good for current members economically, I will follow these steps: Step 1: Understand the claim The claim states that the expansion of the European Union (EU) - the process of adding new member countries - has positive economic effects for existing members. I will look for evidence that supports this statement. Step 2: Identify sources of information To find reliable evidence, I need to locate authoritative sources that provide data, reports, studies, and expert opinions on the economic impact of EU expansion. Key sources of information can include: 1. Official EU institutions and agencies, such as the European Commission, the European Central Bank, and Eurostat. 2. International organizations, such as the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). 3. Economic research institutions, think tanks, and academic studies related to the EU and international economics. 4. Publications from credible news sources, which may include expert opinions, analyses, or interviews with economists. Step 3: Extract evidence to support the claim After identifying the sources of information, I will collect and analyze the data, reports, case studies, and expert opinions that support the claim. Key pieces of evidence can include: 1. The economic growth of current member countries following EU expansion. This can be measured using indicators such as GDP growth, employment rates, and investment flows. 2. The increase in trade among EU countries following enlargement, as this could indicate that current members benefited from greater market access, lower trade barriers, and the creation of new business opportunities. 3. The changes in foreign direct investment (FDI) levels, as the expansion could have led to increased investment in current member countries due to a larger, more integrated market, or improved investor confidence. 4. The improvements in infrastructure, transportation, and communication networks within the EU, resulting from investment and cooperation among member countries, spurred by expansion. 5. The increased economic competitiveness of current member countries, which may be attributed to the EU expansion, creating a wider pool of human capital, improved access to resources, and opportunities for innovation. Step 4: Organize and present the evidence Once I've gathered the evidence, I'll present it in a coherent and clear manner, ensuring that each piece of evidence supports the claim that EU expansion has positive economic effects for current member countries.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Manziel was born in Tyler, Texas, on December 6, 1992, to Michelle (nee Liberato) and Paul Manziel. He has a younger sister named Meri. Manziel's great-great-grandfather Joseph immigrated to the United States in 1883 from the Mount Lebanon region of Syria in what is now Lebanon. He is of Italian descent on his maternal side. Texas A&M faced uncertainty at the quarterback position when Ryan Tannehill left for the National Football League after the 2011 season. Manziel performed well during spring ball and fall practices and won the starting job over Jameill Showers and Matt Joeckel before the season began. His first game was supposed to be against Louisiana Tech in Shreveport, Louisiana on Thursday, August 30, 2012, but the game was postponed until October 13 due to Hurricane Isaac hitting the Louisiana coast two days prior to game time. Consequently, Manziel's college football debut was played as a redshirt freshman against the Florida Gators before a home crowd at Kyle Field. Although Manziel began the season in relative obscurity, his play against Arkansas in which he broke Archie Manning's 43-year-old total offense record gained him some attention. Manziel produced 557 yards of total offense, breaking Manning's record of 540. Two games later, Manziel surpassed his own total offense record against #24 Louisiana Tech by achieving 576 yards of total offense, becoming the first player in SEC history to have two 500+ total offense games in one season. After Texas A&M's blowout of Auburn in the eighth game of the season, in which Manziel accounted for 3 passing and 2 rushing touchdowns through only the first half plus one series in the second, Manziel began showing up in national Heisman Watch lists. Manziel was launched into the national scene after he led Texas A&M to a 29-24 victory over #1 Alabama in Tuscaloosa. In that game, Manziel accounted for 345 of A&M's 418 yards of offense, including two passing touchdowns. In the following days, Manziel became the frontrunner for the Heisman Trophy in most national watch lists and polls due to his performance during the game combined with other Heisman frontrunners faltering. On November 24, during the game against the Missouri Tigers before a home crowd, Manziel left the game with an apparent knee injury late in the first quarter. He returned to the field for the next series of downs wearing a knee brace and finished the game with 439 yards of total offense, including 3 passing and 2 rushing touchdowns. During the game, he broke the single season record for offensive production in the SEC with 4,600 yards, surpassing Cam Newton and Tim Tebow, notable recent Heisman Trophy winners. He also became the first freshman and only the fifth player in NCAA history to pass for 3000 and rush for 1,000 yards in a season, reaching that mark two games earlier than any other player.

Answer the following question: Q: What are commonly used to control insect pests, but can have harmful effects on the environment? A: OPTIONS: (1). toxins. (2). fertilizers. (3). Herbicides. (4). insecticides. Answer:","completion":"To answer the question, let me consider each option step by step: (1). Toxins: Toxins are poisonous substances produced by some plants, animals, and microorganisms. While they can be harmful to insects, the term is too broad and doesn't specifically target insect pests. (2). Fertilizers: Fertilizers are substances that are added to soil to supply essential nutrients for plant growth. Although they can influence the presence of insect pests in some way, their primary function is not to control insects but to promote plant growth. (3). Herbicides: Herbicides are chemicals used to control unwanted plants or weeds. While they can play a role in integrated pest management, they are not specifically designed to control insect pests. (4). Insecticides: Insecticides are chemical substances that are specifically designed to control insect pests. They are commonly used in a variety of settings, including agriculture and home gardens. However, they can have harmful effects on the environment by contaminating soil, water, and air, as well as harming non-target species, including beneficial insects and other wildlife. Considering all the options, I conclude: Answer: (4). insecticides.

Unable to contain the outbreak or cure the infected, The UK government built a massive 60-foot wall that isolated Scotland from the rest of Britain. The quarantine was deemed a success; however, the extreme method employed by the government destroyed diplomatic and economic relations between the UK and the rest of the world. This led to massive unemployment, civil unrest and extreme economic turmoil, causing the UK to collapse into a dystopia. In 2035, 27 years after the quarantine, during a raid, police discover several people infected with Reaper Virus. The Prime Minister John Hatcher shares with domestic security chief Captain Nelson satellite footage of survivors in Scotland. Believing a cure may exist, Hatcher orders Nelson to send a team into Scotland to find medical researcher Dr. Kane, who was working on a cure when Scotland was quarantined. Nelson chooses Major Eden Sinclair to lead the team. Sinclair's team crosses the wall and goes to Glasgow, Dr. Kane's last known location. In Glasgow, while searching the local hospital for survivors, Sinclair and her team are ambushed by a group of marauders. Sgt. Norton and Dr. Stirling manage to escape, while the team suffers heavy casualties. Sinclair and Dr. Talbot are captured by what turns out to be a huge gang of brutal cannibals. Sinclair is interrogated by the gang's leader, Sol, who plans to use her as leverage to cross the wall and leave Scotland. He leaves and joins the rest of the gang, who grill Dr. Talbot and eat him. With the help of Cally, another prisoner, Sinclair escapes and kills Viper, Sol's dedicated partner. After meeting with Norton and Stirling, they escape on a train. Cally reveals that she and Sol are Kane's children. Unsatisfied with Kane's rule, Sol left to create his own army.

Definition: In this task, you are given an abstract of article. Your task is to generate title for this article. Preferred titles are under thirty words. Input: A fundamental goal in biology is to determine how cellular organization is coupled to function. To achieve this goal, a better understanding of organelle composition and structure is needed. Although visualization of cellular organelles using fluorescence or electron microscopy (EM) has become a common tool for the cell biologist, recent advances are providing a clearer picture of the cell than ever before. In particular, advanced light-microscopy techniques are achieving resolutions below the diffraction limit and EM tomography provides high-resolution three-dimensional (3D) images of cellular structures. The ability to perform both fluorescence and electron microscopy on the same sample (correlative light and electron microscopy, CLEM) makes it possible to identify where a fluorescently labeled protein is located with respect to organelle structures visualized by EM. Here, we review the current state of the art in 3D biological imaging techniques with a focus on recent advances in electron microscopy and fluorescence super-resolution techniques.

Morality (from the Latin \\"\\" \\"manner, character, proper behavior\\") is the differentiation of intentions, decisions and actions between those that are distinguished as proper and those that are improper. Morality can be a body of standards or principles derived from a code of conduct from a particular philosophy, religion or culture, or it can derive from a standard that a person believes should be universal. Morality may also be specifically synonymous with \\"goodness\\" or \\"rightness\\". Moral philosophy includes moral ontology, or the origin of morals, as well as moral epistemology, or knowledge of morals. Different systems of expressing morality have been proposed, including deontological ethical systems which adhere to a set of established rules, and normative ethical systems which consider the merits of actions themselves. An example of normative ethical philosophy is the Golden Rule, which states that: \\"One should treat others as one would like others to treat oneself.\\" Immorality is the active opposition to morality (i.e. opposition to that which is good or right), while amorality is variously defined as an unawareness of, indifference toward, or disbelief in any particular set of moral standards or principles. Ethics (also known as moral philosophy) is the branch of philosophy which addresses questions of morality. The word \\"ethics\\" is \\"commonly used interchangeably with 'morality,' and sometimes it is used more narrowly to mean the moral principles of a particular tradition, group, or individual.\\" Likewise, certain types of ethical theories, especially deontological ethics, sometimes distinguish between ethics and morals: \\"Although the morality of people and their ethics amounts to the same thing, there is a usage that restricts morality to systems such as that of Immanuel Kant, based on notions such as duty, obligation, and principles of conduct, reserving ethics for the more Aristotelian approach to practical reasoning, based on the notion of a virtue, and generally avoiding the separation of 'moral' considerations from other practical considerations.\\" 1. where does the word morality come from? 2.

Fold the diaper length-ways with the back sheet facing outwards; you don't want a hard crease, just a soft fold.","completion":"Next, prepare the diaper for a comfortable fit. Ensure that the side with the adhesive tabs is at the back, while the front has a softer and thinner area. Some adult diapers come with wetness indicators and size labels on the backsheet to simplify the process. Gently stretch the leg elastics in the diapers, as it will help create a better fit and reduce the risk of leakage. Choose a comfortable and clean spot to put on the diaper. Select a spot that provides ample space to move around and ensures privacy, like a bedroom or bathroom. Make sure it is clean, as hygiene is essential when handling an adult diaper. For added ease, you may want to use a changing pad or a towel as a surface during the process. Position the diaper for easy application. Place the diaper on the chosen surface, with the backsheet facing down and the front part facing up. The diaper should be in a symmetrical diamond shape, with the top and the bottom points facing away from you. Fan out the rear wings of the diaper, which is the part with adhesive tabs, as doing so will aid in getting a good fit around the waist. Get into a comfortable position. There are a few ways to put on a diaper, so choose the position that is most comfortable for you. Some people prefer lying down on their back with their legs slightly bent, while others find it more comfortable to sit on the edge of a bed, a chair, or the toilet. You may also consider standing up with your legs slightly apart if that feels better for you. Regardless of the position you choose, make sure your back and hips are aligned for even pressure distribution. Slide the back part of the diaper under your buttocks. In your chosen position, gently lift your hips or lean to one side and slide the rear part of the diaper beneath your buttocks. Ensure that the backside of the diaper is centered and positioned slightly higher than the front side. This positioning ensures that the diaper offers maximum coverage and protection, especially when sitting or lying down. Adjust the diaper snugly around your groin. Bring the front part of the diaper up between your legs and make sure it fits comfortably across your stomach area. Take a moment to ensure that the padding material is correctly aligned around the groin area, as it will help reduce the risk of any leaks or discomfort. While doing this, don't forget to doubly check the symmetrical positioning on both sides to ensure proper coverage. Secure the adhesive tabs. While holding the front part of the diaper in place, fasten the adhesive tabs onto the front area. Begin by securing the lower tabs and work your way up. Make sure the lower tabs are angled upwards to create secure leg openings, while the upper tabs should be pulled horizontally to prevent sagging around the waist. The adhesive tabs should be secure but not too tight, as this might cause discomfort or irritation on your skin. Adjust the diaper for comfort and a proper seal. Once the diaper is in place, run your fingers around the leg openings to ensure a snug fit, and create a seal to prevent leaks. Adjust the waistband and leg cuffs as needed, making sure not to make it too tight. Ensure that the diaper feels comfortable, provides adequate coverage, and doesn't restrict your movement.

When I taught in the traditional classroom, creating self portraits was something I had students do whether they were four or nine. In fact, I’d have them draw one on the first day of school and one toward the end of the year and to see the change over time was always so interesting. At least once during the year, likely toward the beginning, I would center a lesson around self portraits. In younger classes, there would be more than one. Creating a self portrait teaches students to be aware of themselves. Where is her head in relation to her body? Where are her feet in relation to her legs? It also teaches children spatial awareness. Where should he begin…with his feet or with his head? Where on the paper should his head be placed? How far down should his arms go? How can his whole body fit on a single piece of paper? A Lesson on Creating Self Portraits Whether you are in a classroom, or teaching a child at home, here is a simple lesson on creating self portraits geared toward young children, anywhere from age 2 through age 6. Keep in mind that their final product will show various levels of writing development, depending on what stage of writing they are in. (Basically, a two-year-old’s drawing should look very different than that of a five-year-old.) The teacher will need to model how to draw a self portrait. Gather the children around an easel or board and clip a paper to it. Narrate the process as you walk through the steps. “I am going to draw a picture of myself. I am going to start with my head.” Use your hands to show your actual head on yourself so students are aware of what you talking about. The visuals also help English Language Learners (if you’re teaching in an English speaking classroom.) and build vocabulary for all students.

It will mean £1bn extra for Northern Ireland over the next two years - but may not trigger new funding for Wales. Carwyn Jones said the deal \\"kills the idea of fair funding\\". But Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns said the deal was the sort of positive intervention already made through the two Welsh city deals. The Welsh Government previously demanded \\"fair funding\\" for Wales as a result of any deal to give the Conservatives a working majority following the general election. Sources have told the BBC the agreement may not affect the so-called Barnett formula - which decides how the UK's nations are funded in comparison with each other - because most of the money will go to specific projects rather than general spending. But a spokesman for the first minister said the equivalent funding under the Barnett formula would result in an extra £1.67bn for Wales over the course of the current parliament. Mr Jones said: \\"Today's deal represents a straight bung to keep a weak prime minister and a faltering government in office. \\"Only last week we were told that the priority was to 'build a more united country, strengthening the social, economic and cultural bonds between England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales'. \\"This deal flies in the face of that commitment and further weakens the UK and as currently drafted all but kills the idea of fair funding for the nations and regions. \\"It is outrageous that the prime minister believes she can secure her own political future by throwing money at Northern Ireland whilst completely ignoring the rest of the UK. \\"This is a short-term fix which will have far-reaching and destabilising consequences.\\" The first minister said he had spoken to the Secretary of State for Wales to state his views, saying Mr Cairns \\"has a duty to fight against this deal and secure additional funding for our country\\". Mr Cairns said: \\"For decades people complained about underfunding for Wales but I resolved that in December with a funding floor agreed with the Welsh Government. Wales currently gets £120 for every £100 spent in England. \\"The funding announced today for Northern Ireland - which faces unique circumstances and specific challenges - is the sort of positive intervention that the UK government has already made across different parts of the UK to support economic growth, for example through City Deals for Swansea and Cardiff.\\" Meanwhile Mr Cairns's predecessor as Welsh Secretary, Stephen Crabb, told the BBC's Daily Politics programme the deal was \\"the cost of doing business\\" to keep his party in power. Labour's former Northern Ireland and Welsh Secretary Lord Hain admitted that Northern Ireland's \\"conflict-ridden history\\" made it a special case. But he condemned \\"such a nakedly party-interested deal to keep the prime minister in power\\". \\"That's what makes this so toxic to so many people,\\" he said. Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood called the deal a \\"bribe\\", while the party's Westminster leader Liz Saville Roberts said: \\"Any commitments for Northern Ireland should be matched for Wales. \\"If reports that the DUP has secured a £1bn increase in public spending in Northern Ireland are realised, Wales' population share would be around £1.7bn - a substantial boost to the Welsh economy that must be delivered.\\" A spokesman for UKIP in the assembly said the DUP had \\"only done what any other party would have done\\", but added that any increase in funding for Northern Ireland \\"should be replicated on a pro-rata basis for Wales\\". Politically, this deal will be considered a gift for Carwyn Jones, and he has given it both barrels, particularly with his claim that it \\"kills the idea of fair funding\\". The long-held grievance about funding for Wales, compared with Scotland and Northern Ireland, appeared to have gone away after the financial deal put together by the Treasury last year. This language suggests that grievance will rocket back up the agenda for Labour and Plaid Cymru. The pressure on the Conservatives will be to persuade people of the merits of the city deals, as these have not only become levers for economic development, but also symbols of the UK Government's investment in Wales. What is a summary of this text?","completion":"The deal between the UK Conservative Party and Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) will mean an extra £1bn for Northern Ireland over the next two years, but may not trigger additional funding for Wales.

However, Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns said the agreement is in line with existing city deals for Wales. The Welsh Government had previously demanded funding equity for the nation.

During his travels, he meets another frequent flyer named Alex, and they begin a casual relationship. Ryan is called back to his company's offices in Omaha, Nebraska. Natalie Keener, a young and ambitious new hire, promotes a program designed to cut costs by conducting layoffs via videoconferencing. Ryan raises concerns that the program could be seen as detached and apathetic, arguing that Natalie knows nothing about the reality of the firing process or how to handle upset people. He then plays the role of a fired employee to demonstrate her inexperience. Ryan's boss assigns him to bring Natalie on his next round of terminations to show her the ropes. As they travel together, Natalie questions Ryan's philosophies on life, particularly on relationships and love, but Ryan is adamant that he is more than happy with his lifestyle. During the trip, Natalie is shattered when her boyfriend unceremoniously dumps her by text message, and Ryan and Alex try to comfort her. Natalie later lectures Ryan about his refusal to consider a commitment to Alex in spite of their obvious compatibility, and becomes infuriated; she apologizes later, but soon afterward they are both ordered back to Omaha to implement Natalie's program.

Her mother was extremely protective, and Victoria was raised largely isolated from other children under the so-called \\"Kensington System\\", an elaborate set of rules and protocols devised by the Duchess and her ambitious and domineering comptroller, Sir John Conroy, who was rumoured to be the Duchess's lover. The system prevented the princess from meeting people whom her mother and Conroy deemed undesirable (including most of her father's family), and was designed to render her weak and dependent upon them. The Duchess avoided the court because she was scandalised by the presence of King William's bastard children, and perhaps prompted the emergence of Victorian morality by insisting that her daughter avoid any appearance of sexual impropriety. Victoria shared a bedroom with her mother every night, studied with private tutors to a regular timetable, and spent her play-hours with her dolls and her King Charles spaniel, Dash.

Is it possible to conclude that \\"Two men and a woman on chairs outside near water\\" if \\"The two women stare at the one man next to a bridge.\\"?","completion":"No, it is not possible to conclude that \\"Two men and a woman on chairs outside near water\\" if \\"The two women stare at the one man next to a bridge.\\" These two statements describe different scenarios with different people involved, and without any additional information, it cannot be definitively assumed that they are referring to the same situation. Let's break down both sentences and analyze their key differences. 1. \\"Two men and a woman on chairs outside near water\\": This statement describes a situation where three individuals, specifically two men and one woman, are seated on chairs. The location is outdoors, and they are in proximity to a water source, which can be interpreted as a beach, lake, river, or even a swimming pool. However, there is no mention of any interaction or relationship between these people, nor is there any explicit reference to a bridge in this statement. 2. \\"The two women stare at the one man next to a bridge.\\": This statement describes a different scenario with a different set of individuals, specifically two women and one man. The dynamic between the individuals is more explicit here, as the sentence highlights that the women are staring at the man. Additionally, their geographical location is specified to be near a bridge. There is no mention of chairs or proximity to a water source in this statement. As we can see, the two statements describe distinct situations with their own set of variables. While it is possible that the first scenario (\\"Two men and a woman on chairs outside near water\\") may be taking place near a water source that is close to a bridge, it is not plausible to conclude that these two statements are referring to the same situation, as the number of people, their interactions, and the specific details about their location differ significantly. In order to link both statements, there must be further context or information provided that explicitly ties the situations together. For example, if the narrative continues and it is mentioned that the two women in the second statement shortly join the two men and the woman near the water, then it could be implied that the same characters are involved, and both sentences are describing different aspects or moments within the same scenario. However, without such additional details, it is not possible to draw a direct connection between the two statements."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

I’ve been trying out two new ones to see which I prefer. In the red corner we have MAC Patent Polish Lip Pencil and in the blue corner we have NARS Velvet Matte Lip Pencil. So let’s get ready to rumble while I put them through their paces…. Although the packaging of these two is quite similar the formulation and finish of the lip colours are very different – MAC Patent Polish is a light gloss and NARS Velvet Matte has a stark matte finish. So whether you prefer your lips sheer and glossy or pigmented and matte there should be something for everyone here. MAC Patent Polish Lip Pencil – this is the first lip pencil that I’ve tried from MAC (apart from lip liner) and I’m really impressed with it. As the name suggests the finish is a very shiny gloss that gives an almost patent shine, it has the feel of a lip gloss but it’s not sticky. The colour is called Spontaneous, MAC describe it as a ‘soft plum with pearl’. It’s definitely a plummy shade, although I can’t really detect any pearl in there. It looks quite dark as a crayon but as it’s very sheer it appears much more natural once it’s on the lips. It’s a great way to introduce darker lip colours to your make-up bag if you’re not used to them. MAC Patent Polish Lip Pencil is a bit like a fabulous giant tinted lip balm! The crayon itself is chunky and easy to hold, the nib is quite chunky and not great for precision application, but you could use a lip brush to apply it. I love to apply MAC Patent Polish straight from the crayon, it’s quick and easy, and as it’s very light and sheer it’s easy to wipe away any mistakes and re-apply.

In this statement, the person communicating seems to be informing that the chairman of the legal affairs committee in a parliament, De Clercq, has requested the minister of justice to give an explanation or a briefing to the parliament. The context appears to be related to a specific matter or situation that requires attention from both the legal affairs committee and the minister of justice. In a democratic system, such requests are common for promoting transparency, maintaining the government's accountability, and ensuring that the parliament is well-informed about important legal matters. It is crucial for legislative bodies like the parliament to be kept informed about issues relating to legal matters, as they may have an effect on passing laws or making decisions about existing legislation and policy. In some cases, this may lead to an amendment in existing laws or the formation of new legislation. Additionally, by sharing information and viewpoints, the parliament, the legal affairs committee, and the minister of justice can collaborate effectively in addressing important issues. This request from De Clercq signifies the importance of checks and balances in a government, ensuring that no branch can wield unlimited power and that they maintain a level of credibility with the general public.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize this article in one sentence. Some fresh air can help to keep you awake and alert. If you tend to stay inside much of the day, take a few breaks and head outside. Getting some sunlight (especially in the morning) can help regulate your waking and sleeping cycles so that you’re fully awake during the day and can sleep well at night. Take a walk during your lunch break or ask to meet with people outside. For example, if you have a dog, go for a walk each morning so you can maximize your sun exposure. Engaging in social activities can help to keep you alert and involved. Find a friend to talk to. This might also be a good time to make any necessary phone calls. Avoid using instant messaging to communicate; it’s best to speak in-person or over the phone to stay awake. Talk to another student or co-worker throughout your day. Schedule regular meetings so that you can be continuously engaged. Avoid reaching for the sugary snacks and grab something that will give you long-lasting energy. For example, try eating a handful of nuts or a bowl of fresh fruit. Spread some nut butter on a whole grain cracker or eat a yogurt. When you get a craving for a snack, get in the habit of fueling yourself for long-term energy to help avoid any lows that might make you drowsy or tired. If you’re struggling to stay awake, get up and take a 10-minute walk. Moving around can increase blood flow and provide oxygen throughout your body. Simple movement can help increase energy for up to 2 hours. If you can’t take a walk, do some stretches or movements to wake up your body. Try some jumping jacks or burpees. If possible, use the gym or attend a yoga class in the morning or during lunchtime. Adding a supplement to your day can help to increase energy and keep you awake. For example, B vitamins are known to help increase energy, especially if your diet is low in B vitamins. However, beware of supplements that promise energy without any research or support. Speak to your physician before starting any new supplements or medications. Be cautious of using stimulants like caffeine as they can increase feelings of anxiety. Caffeine may also affect the quality of your sleep.","completion":"To maintain alertness and avoid drowsiness, spend time outdoors for sunlight exposure, engage in social activities, choose energy-sustaining snacks, incorporate physical movement, and consider adding B-vitamin supplements with a doctor's guidance, while avoiding over-reliance on caffeine."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Audrey Faith McGraw (born September 21, 1967) is an American singer and record producer. She is one of the most successful country artists of all time, having sold more than 40 million albums worldwide. Hill is married to American singer Tim McGraw, with whom she has recorded several duets. Hill's first two albums, Take Me as I Am (1993) and It Matters to Me (1995), were major successes and placed a combined three number ones on Billboard's country charts. Hill was born in Ridgeland, Mississippi, north of Jackson, Mississippi. She was adopted as an infant, and named Audrey Faith Perry. She was raised in the nearby town of Star, 20 miles outside of Jackson. Her adoptive parents, Edna and Ted Perry, raised her with their two biological sons in a devout Christian environment. Hill's vocal talent was apparent early, and she had her first public performance, at a 4-H luncheon, when she was seven. In 1976, a few days before her 9th birthday, she attended a concert by Elvis Presley at the State Fair Coliseum, in Jackson, which impressed her deeply. By the time she was a teenager, Hill was a regular performer at area churches, even those not in her own Baptist denomination. At 17, Hill formed a band that played in local rodeos. She graduated from McLaurin Attendance Center in 1986, and briefly attended college at Hinds Junior College (now Hinds Community College) in Raymond, Mississippi. At times, she sang for prisoners at the Hinds County Jail, her song of choice being \\"Amazing Grace\\". At age 19 she quit school to move to Nashville and pursue her dream of being a country singer. In her early days in Nashville, Hill auditioned to be a backup singer for Reba McEntire, but failed to secure the job. After a stint selling T-shirts, Hill became a secretary at a music publishing firm. Hill also landed a job at a local McDonald's restaurant franchise, which she disliked intensely. \\"Fries, burgers, cash register - I did it all, I hated it,\\" she has said. In 1988, she married music publishing executive Daniel Hill (not to be confused with Canadian musician Dan Hill). A co-worker heard Hill singing to herself one day, and soon the head of her music publishing company was encouraging her to become a demo singer for the firm. She supplemented this work by singing backup vocals for songwriter Gary Burr, who often performed his new songs at Nashville's Bluebird Cafe. During one of those performances, Bob Saporiti, an executive from Warner Bros. Records was in the audience, and, impressed with Hill's voice, began the process of signing her to a recording contract. Shortly after the release of her album, Hill's marriage fell apart. She and Daniel Hill divorced in 1994. what did she do after the audition failed?","completion":"After Audrey Faith McGraw (Faith Hill) failed the audition to be a backup singer for Reba McEntire, she went on to work various jobs to support herself.

Russian emigres living in Paris and Copenhagen ten years after the Tsar was executed during the First World War were historically drawn into an extortion scheme to draw on one of the family's unclaimed ten million pound bank accounts in the form of war reparations. .Yul Brynner is a player in the extortion scheme. As the group's window of opportunity to cop the lolly is drawing to a close, he boxes homeless woman, Ingrid Bergman, into being the claimant asking for fiscal executorship to draw on the ten million pound bank account. Because the players and their sycophants do not seem to be able to generate the legal paperwork to prepare the civil suit to claim the lolly, the second half draws into it a recluse widow played by Helen Hayes, whom they believe will be able to sort it out. What none in the group, least of all Yul Brynner, expects is that two of Hollywood's most admired stars, Ingrid Bergman and Helen Hayes, are given character blocking to exhibit loose cannon personalities who purposefully blow everything up at every turn, and also light up the screen with heart-rending performances as foils to Brynner's charismatic presence and powerful gut determination to extort money. Following their powerful confrontations which take up much of the second half, Bergman and Hayes disappear from the action to prepare, offscreen, a formal diplomatic reception to which the press will be invited to witness Hayes' proclamation of support for Bergman's civil suit petition to cop the ten million pound lolly so Brynner can distribute some of it to each cohort.

Recording took place from April to November 1982 at Westlake Recording Studios in Los Angeles, with a production budget of 750,000.

Canadian football Penalties never result in a score for the offence. For example, a point-of-foul infraction committed by the defence in their end zone is not ruled a touchdown, but instead advances the ball to the one-yard line with an automatic first down. For a distance penalty, if the yardage is greater than half the distance to the goal line, then the ball is advanced half the distance to the goal line, though only up to the one-yard line (unlike American football, in Canadian football no scrimmage may start inside either one-yard line). If the original penalty yardage would have resulted in a first down or moving the ball past the goal line, a first down is awarded.

Read this and answer the question For any animal, survival requires maintaining a variety of parameters of bodily state within a limited range of variation: these include temperature, water content, salt concentration in the bloodstream, blood glucose levels, blood oxygen level, and others. The ability of an animal to regulate the internal environment of its body—the milieu intérieur, as pioneering physiologist Claude Bernard called it—is known as homeostasis (Greek for \\"standing still\\"). Maintaining homeostasis is a crucial function of the brain. The basic principle that underlies homeostasis is negative feedback: any time a parameter diverges from its set-point, sensors generate an error signal that evokes a response that causes the parameter to shift back toward its optimum value. (This principle is widely used in engineering, for example in the control of temperature using a thermostat.) Homeostasis is like what household tool?","completion":"Homeostasis is like a thermostat, as mentioned in the text.

Combine the c terms: Since 10*c and 0*c both have c as a factor, we can combine these terms. 0*c is equal to 0, so adding 0 to 10*c does not change its value. Thus, the equation becomes: 10*c - 20 = 0 2. Isolate c: In order to find the value of c, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. To do this, we'll first add 20 to both sides of the equation: 10*c - 20 + 20 = 0 + 20 This simplifies to: 10*c = 20 3.

At her father's birthday party she is under dressed and is of course moaned at by her hypocritical mother. Here we learn that her parent's friends are just as false as what is accepted by everyone.

Case. Answer:","completion":"Title: Shades of Duty Our movie begins by introducing us to 'White' who is James White, a diligent, unsentimental, and yet emotionally wounded ex-military intelligence officer turned private detective. When the movie starts, White is suffering from a personal loss - his wife and daughter were killed in an unexplained car accident. Step by step, we show his grief, his solitude, and his unforgiving nature towards life. Step 1: Introduce the protagonist. To get our audience emotionally invested in our hero, this step is crucial. By showing White's tragedy and the path he has chosen, we create an emotional connection with the audience. Next, enter 'Case', who is a wealthy and shrewd businessman with political ambitions. But Case is under suspicion of several human rights violations and illegal arms dealings. The story takes a turn when White receives an anonymous package containing evidence against Case. Step by step, we build the tension by increasing White's involvement in this case. Step 2: Introduce the antagonist. The introduction of Case is a significant part of the plot. His character must strike as threatening to White's values to set the ground for potential confrontations. The evidence brings White to confront Case directly. But, Case dismissive of the accusations and threatened by White's audacity, prepares a counterattack. He uses his influence to make White's life miserable, getting him expelled from his work and tarnished his reputation. Step by step, we display Case's power and influence, cultivating the tension between him and White. Step 3: Confrontation We must portray Case as a formidable force to make the confrontation significant. It is important to gradually build tension before the confrontation to make it more impactful. White, rises from the ashes, and starts secretly probing Case. This involves many twists and turns where White encounters both old allies and foes. A series of suspense sequences unravel where White collects proof against Case and strives to bring him to justice. Step 4: Climax White's efforts in collecting evidence against Case, despite all odds, are a part of the climax. This will be tense, thrilling, and full of suspense. In the end, White confronts Case with the truth in public, shattering his political ambitions, and Case is arrested. The movie concludes as White finds a new purpose in life by establishing his detective agency. Step 5: Resolution Here, Case's arrest marks the triumph of White. This will instill a sense of satisfaction in the audience. The conclusion serves to tie up loose ends and show the hero's new pursuits. Overall, the plot involves White's confrontation with Case, building layers of tension, thrills, and suspense before resolving them in a climactic showdown."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: \\"Tribal governments can have privileges taken away as they are under the what of another government?\\" Context: \\"Thirty-nine Native American tribal governments are based in Oklahoma, each holding limited powers within designated areas. While Indian reservations typical in most of the United States are not present in Oklahoma, tribal governments hold land granted during the Indian Territory era, but with limited jurisdiction and no control over state governing bodies such as municipalities and counties. Tribal governments are recognized by the United States as quasi-sovereign entities with executive, judicial, and legislative powers over tribal members and functions, but are subject to the authority of the United States Congress to revoke or withhold certain powers. The tribal governments are required to submit a constitution and any subsequent amendments to the United States Congress for approval.\\" Answer: The answer to this question is:","completion":"Tribal governments in Oklahoma, as well as in other parts of the United States, are under the authority of the United States Congress. While they possess quasi-sovereign status and hold executive, judicial, and legislative powers over their tribal members and functions, their powers can be limited, revoked, or withheld by the U.S. Congress. This means that even though tribal governments have a degree of autonomy, they are ultimately subject to federal oversight and control. Since tribal governments must submit their constitution and any subsequent amendments to the U.S. Congress for approval, the Congress can influence their governance and make decisions regarding their privileges. This arrangement highlights the fact that tribal governments are not completely independent entities, but rather function within the broader framework of the United States government."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: The Juggler Context: A man finds himself running from both the police and his own troubling memories in this drama. Hans Muller (Kirk Douglas), a German Jew, was once a well-known juggler before he was committed to a concentration camp; Muller survived, but his wife and children did not. After the war, Muller and many other displaced people found themselves in a temporary camp in Israel; his experiences have left him upset and confused, and several of the guards notice that he's behaving oddly. Muller flees the camp after one day, but while running away, he's stopped by Kogan (Richard Benedict), an Israeli policeman. When Kogan asks to see Muller's papers, he immediately flashes back to an unsetting memory in which a Nazi officer asked the same question; Muller panics, attacks the cop, and flees for Mount Carmel. In the morning, Muller encounters a group of children who believe the story he tells them: that he's a tourist from the United States. One of them, Yehoshua (Joseph Walsh), is making his way to a kibbutz in Syria, and Muller, who hopes to get to some friends in Egypt, joins him. Muller entertains the young man by teaching him to juggle, and they become close friends. When Yehoshua is injured by a land mine, Muller rushes him to a hospital, where he meets Ya'el (Milly Vitale), a woman who lost her husband to Arabs. A romance soon blossoms between Muller and Ya'el, and he confesses to her that he's on the run from the police; meanwhile, Israeli Detective Karni (Paul Stewart) is combing the nation, searching for the juggler -- not to arrest him, but to convince him that he's not wanted for murder, and that others want to help him. Michael Blankfort, who wrote the original novel upon which The Juggler was based, adapted the screenplay and also served as executive producer. ~ Mark Deming, All Movie Guide A:","completion":"After the war, Muller found himself in Israel.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: When a friend tells you she has wild roses blooming everywhere, it’s not hard to imagine where the conversation headed to next… to turning them into rose petal jam, of course. My friend Simona Quirini and her family run the beautiful Canto del Maggio, a B&B, restaurant and garden, about one hour’s drive from Florence. We arrived to catch Simona with a wooden crate in her hands, already half full of blush pink flower heads, small and as fragrant as honey. It wasn’t just roses that were bursting out of their bushes with colour and fragrance. In fact, every time I go to Canto del Maggio, I notice how lush the property is with fruit, flowers and plants, and every season there are bounties to be collected. The first time I was there I noticed the myrtle bushes and heirloom fruit trees — little tiny, red pears and apples. The garden was full of summer produce and I stole green-skinned figs harbouring raspberry-red flesh off the trees. The next time I went, we picked ripe olives off the trees around the pool and took them down to the local frantoio, olive oil mill, to press the bright green oil out of them. I also came home with buckets of corbezzoli, or Irish strawberries, to make jam. This spring, I noticed the hedge rows of flowering wild strawberries and this last visit we picked the berries off them for an afternoon snack. With the help of my daughter (who was slightly more interested in playing with Simona’s new puppy), we filled a crateful of roses and picked the petals delicately off and into bowls. We were using the rose petal jam recipe and the technique I learned between two wonderful sources — Pellegrino Artusi’s 1891 cookbook (this pastry recipe below is also inspired by it) and the Armenian monks on Venice’s Isola di San Lazzaro Island where I worked for two autumns. The secret, other than having beautiful, small and fragrant roses to begin with, is in massaging the petals with a bit of the sugar and the lemon juice until almost a pulp to release the essential oils.

Article: In her new book, \\"The Smartest Kids in the World,\\" Amanda Ripley, an investigative journalist, tells the story of Tom, a high-school student from Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, who decides to spend his senior year in Warsaw, Poland. Poland is a surprising educational success story: in the past decade, the country raised students' test scores from significantly below average to well above it. Polish kids have now outscored(......) American kids in math and science, even though Poland spends, on average, less than half as much per student as the United States does. One of the most striking differences between the high school Tom attended in Gettysburg and the one he ends up at in Warsaw is that the latter has no football team, or, for that matter, teams of any kind. That American high schools lavish more time and money on sports than on math is an old complaint. This is not a matter of how any given student who plays sports does in school, but of the culture and its priorities. This December, when the latest Program for International Student Assessment(PISA) results are announced, it's safe to predict that American high-school students will once again display their limited skills in math and reading, outscored not just by students in Poland but also by students in places like South Korea, Belgium, the Netherlands, Finland, Singapore, and Japan. Meanwhile, they will have played some very exciting football games, which will have been breathlessly written up in their hometown papers. Why does this situation continue? Well, for one thing, kids like it. And for another, according to Ripley, parents seem to like the arrangement, too. She describes a tour she took of a school in Washington D.C., which costs thirty thousand dollars a year. The tour leader--a mother with three children in the school--was asked about the school's flaws . When she said that the math program was weak, none of the parents taking the tour reacted.

A later tradition recorded his entry into Jerusalem: according to Josephus, Alexander was shown the Book of Daniel's prophecy, presumably chapter 8, which described a mighty Greek king who would conquer the Persian Empire. He spared Jerusalem and pushed south into Egypt. However, Alexander met with resistance at Gaza. The stronghold was heavily fortified and built on a hill, requiring a siege. When \\"his engineers pointed out to him that because of the height of the mound it would be impossible... this encouraged Alexander all the more to make the attempt\\". After three unsuccessful assaults, the stronghold fell, but not before Alexander had received a serious shoulder wound. As in Tyre, men of military age were put to the sword and the women and children were sold into slavery. Alexander advanced on Egypt in later 332 BC, where he was regarded as a liberator. He was pronounced son of the deity Amun at the Oracle of Siwa Oasis in the Libyan desert.

Article: Clearly if we are to participate in the society in which we live, we must communicate with other people. A great deal of communicating is performed on a person-to-person basis by the simple means of speech. If we travel in buses, buy things in shops, or eat in restaurants, we are likely to have conversations where we give information or opinions, receive news or comment, and very likely to have our views challenged by other members of society. Face to face contact is by no means the only form of communication and during the last two hundred years the art of mass communication has become one of the dominating factors of contemporary society. Two things, above others, have caused the enormous growth of the communication industry. Firstly, inventiveness has led to advanced imprinting, telecommunications photography, radio and television. Secondly, speed has revolutionized the transmission and reception of communications so that local news often takes a back seat to national news, which itself is often almost eclipsed( ) by international news. No longer is the possession of information confined to a privileged minority. In the last century the wealthy man with his own library was indeed fortunate, but today there are public libraries. For years ago people used to flock to the cinema, but now far more people sit at home and turn on the TV to watch a programme that is being channeled into millions of homes. Communication is no longer merely concerned with the transmission of information. The modem communication industry influences the way people live in society and broadens their horizons by allowing access to information, education and entertainment. The printing, broadcasting and advertising industries are all involved with informing, educating and entertaining. Although a great deal of the material communicated by the mass media is very valuable to the individual and to the society of which he is part, the vast modem network of communications is open to abuse . However, the mass media are with us for better,...

Answer:","completion":"\\"Public libraries have replaced the private completely.\\" Justification: While the text mentions the existence of public libraries as a resource available to the public, it does not imply that they have completely replaced private libraries. Therefore, the assertion that public libraries have completely displaced private libraries is not supported by the text provided."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

While the original statement \\"The man is posing in front of a small child near a light post\\" provides certain information, it does not contain all the necessary details to confidently answer the question about whether the man is posing near a light post at night. In the statement, we learn that there is a man, and he is posing near a light post with a small child in the vicinity. However, we do not have any information regarding the time of day, which is a critical element to ascertain if it is nighttime or not. It is essential to understand that despite having a light post in the scenario, it does not necessarily imply that it is nighttime. Light posts can also be found during the day, and people can pose near them for various reasons, including photography, resting, or simply enjoying the surrounding area. Therefore, given the information provided, we cannot definitively confirm whether the man is posing near the light post at night without any mention of the time of day in the original statement.

Sentence 1: Swaying rhythms are among the most appealing aspects of life in the French West Indies. Sentence 2: You can experience swaying rhythms at any nightclub in the French West Indies. Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","completion":"The second sentence is not directly entailed by the first sentence, but it is related to the content of the first sentence. Before we dive into the explanation, let us first clarify the meaning of entailment in this context. Entailment, in the world of linguistics and logic, is the relationship between two sentences where the truth of one sentence necessarily implies the truth of the other. In other words, if the first sentence is true, then the second must logically be true as well. The two sentences should have an adequate level of dependence and coherence. Now, let's analyze the given sentences: Sentence 1: Swaying rhythms are among the most appealing aspects of life in the French West Indies. This sentence points out that swaying rhythms are a significant and attractive part of the West Indian culture in French territories, without specifying particular settings or locations where these rhythms are experienced. Sentence 2: You can experience swaying rhythms at any nightclub in the French West Indies. This sentence asserts that the experience of swaying rhythms is available at any nightclub in the French West Indies. There is a connection between the two sentences in that they both discuss swaying rhythms in the French West Indies, but the second sentence is not necessarily entailed by the first. Entailment would require that the truth of the first sentence would guarantee the truth of the second one.

Choose the most suitable option to answer the above question. Options: - latin america - mountains - burrow - home - new hampshire A:","completion":"A: Latin America The most suitable option to find a marmoset in a southern area not in the US is Latin America. Marmosets are small monkeys belonging to the Callitrichidae family, which is native to the forested regions of Central and South America. They are predominantly found in countries such as Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Paraguay, Bolivia, and Peru. The habitats of marmosets include tropical rainforests, savannah, and Atlantic forests. These regions provide the ideal environment for these small primates due to the abundance of trees and vegetation, which provide them with food, shelter, and protection from predators. Marmosets mostly feed on tree sap, gum, and other exudates from trees, but their diet can also include insects, fruits, and small lizards. The other options provided do not represent suitable and specific locations where you would have a high likelihood of finding marmosets: - Mountains: Although marmosets may be found in mountainous areas, this geographical feature is not specific enough to indicate a high likelihood of finding them, as there are many mountains around the world that do not have marmosets inhabiting them. - Burrow: Marmosets do not live in burrows. They are arboreal animals, meaning they prefer to live in trees and move around in the branches. - Home: While in some cases, marmosets might be kept as pets or live in a home environment, you are much more likely to encounter these animals in their natural habitats within Latin America. - New Hampshire: New Hampshire is a state in the northeastern United States, which does not fit the criteria of a southern area not in the US. Furthermore, this region is not a natural habitat for marmosets. In conclusion, the most suitable location to find a marmoset in a southern area not in the US is Latin America, where these small primates are indigenous and thrive in the natural habitats they are accustomed to. Their preference for forested areas such as the tropical rainforests, savannah, and Atlantic forests of Latin American countries makes it the ideal region to observe these fascinating creatures."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Does Stantin forget about finding Steve? Movie plot title: Shoot to Kill Movie plot: This article needs an improved plot summary. (May 2015) A man is discovered breaking into his own jewellery shop in the dead of night. Questioned closely, it is discovered that his wife is being held hostage at their home by Steve, a brutal extortionist who demands the diamonds in the shop's safe in exchange for the woman's life. After Steve kills the family maid, FBI agent Warren Stantin (Sidney Poitier) hands over the diamonds, but Steve kills the jeweller's wife anyway, and escapes. Feeling that he has failed, Stantin becomes obsessed with finding Steve, and he chases Steve into the rugged forests of the state of Washington, where Steve joins up with a group of sportsmen who plan to trek into the wilderness on a fishing trip. Steve's plan is to kill them and force their guide, Sarah (Kirstie Alley), to lead him through the wilderness to the CanadaâUS border. Stantin must team up with Sarah's mountain-man boyfriend Jonathan Knox (Tom Berenger) to pursue Steve. Jonathan does not believe city slicker Stantin can keep up on a tough cross-country hike that includes some rock climbing, and Stantin is determined to prove himself. They pursue Steve and Sarah into the wilderness and eventually to the streets of Vancouver. The movie also featured a chase scene aboard the BC Ferries Queen of Vancouver. After a long chase, Stantin manages to shoot Steve in an underwater struggle. The killer's identity is not revealed until midway through the film. He attempts to evade detection by killing a member of a hiking expedition and taking his place. To keep the audience guessing as to the true identity of the villain, some of the hikers were played by actors known for playing bad guys: notably Clancy Brown (Highlander), Frederick Coffin (Mother's Day), Andrew Robinson (Dirty Harry) and Richard Masur (the vicious drug dealer in Who'll Stop the Rain). The answer to this question is:","completion":"No, Stantin does not forget about finding Steve.

Please answer the following question: I have a new situation: Environmental scientists are trying to find a solution to reducing the harmful effects of chemicals on the environment. To that end, they developed a transgenic crop with the help of Bt toxin - they referred to it as case A. To test the effectiveness of this new crop they also studied Bt toxin spray - they referred to it as case B. They need to figure out which case is safer for the environment. But I can use this background: There is growing concern regarding the use of pesticides in agriculture. Therefore, many of the current commercial applications of modern biotechnology in agriculture are focused on reducing the dependence of farmers on these chemicals. For example, Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) is a soil bacterium that produces a protein that can act as an insecticide, known as the Bt toxin . But it is a naturally occurring protein, not a foreign chemical. Could this protein be used in crops instead of pesticides? Traditionally, an insecticidal spray has been produced from these bacteria. As a spray, the Bt toxin is in an inactive state and requires digestion by an insect to become active and have any effect. Crop plants have now been engineered to contain and express the genes for the Bt toxin, which they produce in its active form. When an insect ingests the transgenic crop, it stops feeding and soon thereafter dies as a result of the Bt toxin binding to its gut wall. Bt corn is now commercially available in a number of countries to control corn borer (an insect like a moth or butterfly), which is otherwise controlled by insecticidal spraying. What is an answer for this question: In which case the Bt toxin does not need to be digested by the insects, case A or case B? Answer:","completion":"In case A, where the transgenic crop contains the Bt toxin, the toxin does not need to be digested by the insects. This is because the crop plants have been engineered to contain and produce the Bt toxin in its active form. When the insects feed on the transgenic crop, they are immediately affected by the toxin, which binds to their gut wall, causing them to stop feeding and eventually die. In contrast, case B involves the use of Bt toxin spray, in which the toxin is in an inactive state and needs digestion by the insects to become active."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He didn't. He came and sat in front of the bus stop, but he didn't look like he could have enough money to ride the bus.

He sat there quietly as I worked. The expected asking for money never came. As the silence between us widened, it seemed that a voice inside me said, \\"Ask him if he needs any help.\\" I was sure that he would say \\"yes\\", but I listened to the inner voice. \\"Do you need any help?\\" I asked. He answered in three simple but meaningful words that I shall never forget. We often look for wisdom in great men and women, and we expect it from those of higher learning and achievements. I expected nothing but a dirty hand from him, but he said three words that shook me. \\"Don't we all?\\" he said.

Maybe not for a bus fare or for a place to sleep, but I needed help. I reached in my wallet and gave him not only for a bus fare, but enough to get a warm meal and shelter for the day.

Actually, there’s a lot that can be done with it. If you can use it as a ravioli filling with ricotta, then you can imagine it taking the place of spinach in gnudi, too, but also soups or frittata or stirred through polenta. I learned that the flowers are just as delicious, if not more interesting, for their delicate cucumber-like flavour — people told me of their use in salads or cocktails like Pimms, and someone even mentioned she freezes them in ice cubes, what a pretty idea for those first warm nights when you can dine al fresco, homemade cocktail in hand.

We have had our ups and downs but now i realise i really want to be with him . I thought it might just be lust but i have felt like this for a long while now . Question Why do I really want to be with him ? Answer:","completion":"There could be several reasons why you want to be with him. I will analyze the situation step-by-step: 1. Emotional connection: One possibility is that you share a deep emotional connection with him because of the time you've spent together and the experiences you've shared. This connection can make you want to start a romantic relationship. 2. Compatibility: Since you have been friends for a long while, you might find that your personalities, interests, and values align well, making you think about being more than just friends. 3. Trust and support: You mentioned that you two have helped each other through a lot. The trust and support that you have established throughout your friendship may be making you desire a stronger commitment with him. 4. Growth and self-improvement: Being with someone who positively influences us and helps us grow is important for a fulfilling relationship. If you see that this person has helped you become a better you, it might be contributing to your desire to be with him. 5. Infatuation: Although you mentioned that you don't think it's just lust, it's still essential to consider the role of attraction in this situation. A strong physical attraction can't be the foundation of a healthy relationship, but it can be a factor in why you desire to be with him. In conclusion, it appears that your desire to be with your friend might be due to a combination of factors, such as emotional connection, compatibility, trust and support, personal growth, and physical attraction.

Q:Given the below context: Henry Moore was born in Castleford, West Riding of Yorkshire, England, to Mary Baker and Raymond Spencer Moore. His father was of Irish origin and became pit deputy and then under-manager of the Wheldale colliery in Castleford. He was an autodidact with an interest in music and literature. Determined that his sons would not work in the mines, he saw formal education as the route to their advancement. Henry was the seventh of eight children in a family that often struggled with poverty. He attended infant and elementary schools in Castleford, where he began modelling in clay and carving in wood. He professed to have decided to become a sculptor when he was eleven after hearing of Michelangelo's achievements at a Sunday School reading.On his second attempt he was accepted at Castleford Grammar School, which several of his siblings had attended, where his headmaster soon noticed his talent and interest in medieval sculpture. His art teacher broadened his knowledge of art, and with her encouragement, he determined to make art his career; first by sitting for examinations for a scholarship to the local art college. Moore's earliest recorded carvings – a plaque for the Scott Society at Castleford Secondary School, and a Roll of Honour commemorating the boys who went to fight in the First World War from the school – were executed around this time.Despite his early promise, Moore's parents had been against him training as a sculptor, a vocation they considered manual labour with few career prospects. After a brief introduction as a student teacher, Moore became a teacher at the school he had attended. Upon turning eighteen, Moore volunteered for army service. He was the youngest man in the Prince of Wales' Own Civil Service Rifles regiment and was injured in 1917 in a gas attack, on 30 November at Bourlon Wood, during the Battle of Cambrai. After recovering in hospital, he saw out the remainder of the war as a physical training instructor, only returning to France as the Armistice was signed. He recalled later, \\"for...

Please answer the following question: Fact 1: Mammals conserve body heat with their hair or fur. Fact 2: Basically, heat is energy. Given the two facts above, answer the question \\"What kind of animals conserve energy with their hair or fur?\\" with the following options: - fur - bears - mammals - sweating - frogs - cactus - goats - humans Answer:","completion":"Mammals conserve energy with their hair or fur. To understand this, let's break down the facts provided and consider the options given. Fact 1: Mammals conserve body heat with their hair or fur. This means that mammals, which are a class of warm-blooded vertebrates, have developed hair or fur as an evolutionary adaptation to aid in maintaining their body temperature. The fur or hair acts as insulation, trapping a layer of warm air close to the skin, which helps to reduce heat loss and maintain a stable internal temperature. Fact 2: Basically, heat is energy. When we talk about energy, it is important to consider its various forms. In this case, heat is specifically referred to as thermal energy, which can be transferred from one body or system to another in the form of warmth. When an organism maintains its body heat, it is effectively conserving energy by limiting the amount of heat – or thermal energy – lost to its surroundings. Given the two facts above, let's examine the options provided to answer the question, \\"What kind of animals conserve energy with their hair or fur?\\" - fur: Fur is not an animal; it is a physical characteristic found in some animals, particularly mammals. Thus, it cannot be the answer. - bears: Bears, being mammals, do conserve energy with their hair or fur. However, this answer is too specific, as other mammals also conserve energy in this manner. - mammals: This is the correct answer. As mentioned in Fact 1, mammals conserve body heat with their hair or fur, which effectively conserves energy. - sweating: Sweating is a cooling mechanism utilized by some animals, including humans, to dissipate excess heat. It is not an animal and does not conserve energy with hair or fur. - frogs: Frogs are amphibians, not mammals, and do not have hair or fur. Therefore, they do not conserve energy in this way. - cactus: A cactus is a plant, not an animal, so it does not conserve energy with hair or fur. - goats: Goats, like bears, are mammals that conserve energy with their hair or fur. However, this answer is too specific, as the correct answer should encompass all mammals that conserve energy in this manner. - humans: Humans are mammals, and while they have less hair or fur than many other mammals, they do still conserve some degree of energy with their body hair. However, similar to the bear and goat options, this answer is too specific. In summary, given the facts provided and the options available, the correct answer to the question \\"What kind of animals conserve energy with their hair or fur?\\" is mammals. This class of warm-blooded vertebrates has evolved hair or fur as an adaptation to conserve energy in the form of body heat, helping to maintain a stable internal temperature and limit heat loss."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: What year did the houston rockets win their first championship?

Help as much as you can. Given a question and a context passage, generate the answer having the word or phrase from the context passage. Here, the answer should be a shortest continous span from the passage. Context: An infectious disease is a disease that is caused by a pathogen. A pathogen is an organism or virus that causes disease in another living thing. Pathogens are commonly called germs. Watch this dramatic video for an historic perspective on infectious diseases and their causes: . MEDIA Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL: There are several types of pathogens that cause diseases in human beings. They include bacteria, viruses, fungi, and protozoa. The different types are described in Table 21.1. The table also lists several diseases caused by each type of pathogen. Many infectious diseases caused by these pathogens can be cured with medicines. For example, antibiotic drugs can cure most diseases caused by bacteria. Different pathogens spread in different ways. Some are easy to catch. Others are much less contagious. Some pathogens spread through food or water. When harmful bacteria contaminate food, they cause foodborne illness, commonly called food poisoning. An example of a pathogen that spreads through water is the protozoan named Giardia lamblia, described in Table 21.1. It causes a disease called giardiasis. Some pathogens spread through sexual contact. In the U.S., the pathogen most commonly spread this way is HPV, or human papillomavirus. It may cause genital warts and certain types of cancer. A vaccine can prevent the spread of this pathogen. Many pathogens spread by droplets in the air. Droplets are released when a person coughs or sneezes, as you can see in Figure 21.2. The droplets may be loaded with pathogens. Other people may get sick if they breathe in the pathogens on the droplets. Viruses that cause colds and flu can spread this way. Other pathogens spread when they are deposited on objects or surfaces. The fungus that causes athletes food spreads this way. For example, you might pick up the fungus from the floor of a public shower. You can also pick up viruses for colds and flu from doorknobs and other commonly touched surfaces. Still other pathogens are spread by vectors. A vector is an organism that carries pathogens from one person or animal to another. Most vectors are insects such as ticks or mosquitoes. They pick up pathogens when they bite an infected animal and then transmit the pathogens to the next animal they bite. Ticks spread the bacteria that cause Lyme disease. Mosquitoes spread the protozoa that cause malaria. What can you do to avoid infectious diseases? Eating well and getting plenty of sleep are a good start. These habits will help keep your immune system healthy. With a healthy immune system, you will be able to fight off many pathogens. Vaccines are available for some infectious diseases. For example, there are vaccines to prevent measles, mumps, whooping cough, and chicken pox. These vaccines are recommended for infants and young children. You can also take the following steps to avoid picking up pathogens or spreading them to others. Watch this video for additional information on preventing the spread of infectious diseases: MEDIA Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL: Wash your hands often with soap and water. Spend at least 20 seconds scrubbing with soap. See Figure 21.3 for effective hand washing tips. Avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands. Avoid close contact with people who are sick. This includes kissing, hugging, shaking hands, and sharing cups or eating utensils. Cover your coughs and sneezes with a tissue or shirt sleeve, not your hands. Disinfect frequently touched surfaces, such as keyboards and doorknobs, especially if someone is sick. Stay home when you are sick. The best way to prevent diseases spread by vectors is to avoid contact with the vectors. For example, you can wear long sleeves and long pants to avoid tick and mosquito bites. Using insect repellent can also reduce your risk of insect bites.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize this article in one sentence. The general rule for lure color is \\"bright day, light colors; dark day, dark colors.\\" On bright, sunny days and in clear water conditions, choose lures that are light in color and mimic natural patterns. On cloudy days and in dirty water conditions, choose darker lures and those with a non-natural coloration, preferably types that make noise or vibrate as they move through the water. A notable exception to this rule is the use of 2-toned plastic worms that feature a darker head color and a fluorescent pink or yellow tail color. Many anglers use plastic worms colored like this when fishing in cloudy water conditions. In general, choose smaller jigs and grubs when fishing for panfish (bluegill, sunfish, crappie, perch) and larger lures such as spinnerbaits and crankbaits when fishing for bigger fish (bass, walleye, and pike). Smaller lures are best suited for light and ultralight spinning and spincasting tackle (or fly rods in the case of dry and wet flies) with lines of 4 to 10-pound test (2 to 5 kg class), while larger lures are meant to be fished with medium to heavy action rods, spinning or baitcasting reels, and lines of 12 to 20-pound test (6 to 10 kg class) or better. (Lures used to fish for muskellunge, the largest member of the pike family, are decidedly larger than those used for bass, walleye, and northern pike, and often require the use of a wire leader because of the muskie's sharp teeth.) Lure size can also be dictated by weather conditions and how fish react to them. In early spring, or when cold front conditions clear the skies and cool the water to make fish lethargic, smaller lures are usually better choices than larger lures. (Lures used for ice fishing are exceptionally tiny, usually grub jigs or small spoons.) In high-wind conditions, you may need to use a larger lure simply to have enough resistance on the end of the line to keep the wind from bowing it so that you can't detect if fish are hitting the lure. Also try casting out a spinner and just keep casting and retrieving the lure. Summary:","completion":"Select lure color based on weather, with light colors for bright days and dark colors for cloudy ones, adjusting size and type depending on target fish and conditions."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the following question: Given the following context: A NASA spacecraft lands on an unknown planet and begins to take rock and soil samples. Four aliens discover it and are sucked into the craft through its vacuum tube, after which it makes its way back to Earth. The aliens are able to escape from a government base by using their powers (with which they can destroy or heal anything they touch). During the escape, the youngest one hides in a passing van, occupied by a boy named Eric Cruise who uses a wheelchair, his older brother, Michael, and their single mother, Janet, who are moving to California from Illinois. Shortly after the Cruise family arrives at their new home, Eric becomes suspicious of the alien's presence. The next morning, he finds that the creature has trashed most of the house and learns its identity, but is blamed alongside his brother by their mother for what has happened. After seeing the creature again, Eric tries to catch up to him, but ends up sliding down a hill and falls into a lake, where he nearly drowns, but is rescued by the alien. Eric is not believed at all when he tries to tell his family about the creature's actions. Later that night, he sets a trap with the help of his new friend, Debbie, who had also seen the alien. The two trap him inside a vacuum cleaner, which malfunctions and causes the entire neighborhood to suffer a power surge. After the alien is released, Michael now believes Eric, but it leaves before Janet can be convinced.

So says science. Ok, so it's not common. But a team of neurosurgeons at Hannover Medical School has indicated that it is a possibility, after treating a 50-year-old fan that presented in January 2013 with a terrible headache. The anonymous patient had been suffering from the pains for two weeks, but otherwise presented with an \\"unremarkable\\" medical history and \\"denied substance abuse\\" the team, led by Ariyan Pirayesh Islamian, reports in the Lancet. \\"This case serves as evidence in support of Motörhead's reputation as one of the most hardcore rock'n'roll acts on earth, if nothing else because of the hazardous potential for headbanging fans to suffer brain injury\\" \\"He had no history of head trauma, but reported headbanging at a Motörhead concert four weeks previously,\\" write the physicians, before clearing up any misunderstanding thus: \\"Headbanging is a contemporary dance form consisting of abrupt flexion-extension movements of the head to the rhythm of rock music, most commonly see in the heavy metal genre.\\" A grave warning follows: \\"While such shows are enjoyable and stimulating for the audience, some fans might be endangered by indulging in excessive headbanging.\\" Coagulation screening was issued for the anonymous patient, to check that his blood was clotting properly. After all came back normal the team ordered a CT scan, and there they found it: a chronic subdural haematoma (bleeding under the membrane that protects the brain, resulting in a clot). Don't miss This type of clot can be extremely dangerous, potentially putting excessive pressure on the brain. The threat of death depends on the type of haematoma -- acute (formed straight after injury) comes with a 65 percent risk of death in those aged 40-80; subacute (formed up to a week after the initial injury) are less threatening; chronic (formed over a period of two to three weeks) results in death within the first 30 days of having surgery in one out of 20 people. The patient fell into the latter category, so there was a significant risk involved. To treat the dedicated Motörhead fan, the German team drilled burr holes into his skull to alleviate the pressure. A drain was placed, and kept in for six days after surgery. The headache cleared, and within eight days of the surgery the fan was home, and was found to be symptom free at his two-month checkup. It was concluded that, given his history, the \\"brisk forward and backward acceleration and deceleration forces\\" the patient experienced while dancing was what caused bridging veins in his brain to rupture. A arachnoidal cyst may have been a \\"predisposing factor\\", they warned. These cysts are benign, however, and are usually found inadvertently during other routine scans. It could have made the brain \\"susceptible to haemorrhage into the subdural space\\" though, the authors suggest, simply because of its position. The doctors admit cases of headbanging leading to serious complications are rare. They found three such examples, two involving a subacute subdural haematoma, and one including an acute haematoma. The latter led to the patient's sudden death. Other potential side effects include carotid artery dissection (a tear in the arteries of the neck), mediastinal emphysema (a pocket of trapped air around the heart, its vessels, the trachea and other areas in the mediastinum), whip lash injury and fractures. Islamian warns, however: \\"Even though there are only a few documented cases of subdural haematomas, the incidence may be higher because the symptoms of this type of brain injury are often clinically silent or cause only mild headache that resolves spontaneously.\\" The article, in giving its readers a little context, tells us that headbanging was popularised in the 70s, but \\"the number of avid aficionados [i.e., potential victims] is unknown\\". It does, however, attribute Motörhead as being \\"seminal in the creation of the speed metal sub genre, where tempos greater than 200 bpm are aspired to\\". So, they make people bang their heads really, really fast. Fans will be deligted to hear, however, that the doctors were unanimous in one conclusion. \\"This case serves as evidence in support of Motörhead's reputation as one of the most hardcore rock'n'roll acts on earth, if nothing else because of their contagious speed drive and the hazardous potential for headbanging fans to suffer brain injury.\\" ||||| LONDON (AP) — It may not destroy your soul, but it turns out heavy metal music can be hazardous to your brain. At least in some rare cases. FILE - In this Saturday, Oct. 7, 2006 file photo, rock band Motorhead performs during the show program of the the \\"TV total Stock Car Crash Challenge 2006\\" celebrities race at the Veltins-Arena in Gelsenkirchen,... (Associated Press) German doctors say they have treated a Motorhead fan whose headbanging habit ultimately led to a brain injury, but that the risk to metal fans in general is so small they don't need to give up the shaking. Last January, doctors at Hannover Medical School saw a 50-year-old man who complained of constant, worsening headaches. The patient, who was not identified, had no history of head injuries or substance abuse problems but said he had been headbanging regularly for years — most recently at a Motorhead concert he attended with his son. After a scan, doctors discovered their patient had a brain bleed and needed a hole drilled into his brain to drain the blood. The patient's headaches soon disappeared. In a follow-up scan, the doctors saw he had a benign cyst which might have made the metal aficionado more vulnerable to a brain injury. \\"We are not against headbanging,\\" said Dr. Ariyan Pirayesh Islamian, one of the doctors who treated the man. \\"The risk of injury is very, very low. But I think if (our patient) had (gone) to a classical concert, this would not have happened.\\" Islamian said the violent shaking of the head in headbanging can sometimes be enough to cause damage as the brain bumps up against the skull and noted a handful of previous injuries, also in heavy metal fans. The latest case was described in a report published online Friday in the journal Lancet. Motorhead is a British metal band known for helping create the \\"speed metal\\" genre, which inspires extremely fast headbanging. Islamian described the band as \\"one of the most hard-core rock 'n' roll acts on earth.\\" Doctors said headbangers shouldn't be discouraged from enjoying their favorite bands. \\"There are probably other higher risk events going on at rock concerts than headbanging,\\" noted Dr. Colin Shieff, a neurosurgeon and trustee of the British brain injury advocacy group Headway. \\"Most people who go to music festivals and jump up and down while shaking their heads don't end up in the hands of a neurosurgeon.\\" Islamian agreed heavy metal fans shouldn't necessarily skip the headbanging. \\"Rock 'n' roll will never die,\\" he said. \\"Heavy metal fans should rock on.\\" ___ Online: www.lancet.com ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","completion":"Headbanging to Motörhead, a heavy metal band, can be dangerous for your brain, as doctors found after treating a 50-year-old fan who experienced a severe headache. They discovered that the \\"brisk forward and backward acceleration and deceleration forces\\" the patient experienced during headbanging caused the bridging veins in his brain to rupture, resulting in a dangerous blood clot.

From 3D sets, to televisions with curved screens - it may seem as if there is already a TV to suit any living room. But Google is reportedly working on screens that fit seamlessly together - potentially making the days of having to pick the perfect sized screen to fit a given space a thing of the past. The search giant said the screens would fit seamlessly together in a similar way to Lego bricks, and won't have a surrounding bezel, like current smartphones and tablets. Scroll down for video. Google is reportedly working on screens that can fit seamlessly together to create a larger ones. Its modular system would be different to video walls (illustrated) which show different images on different screens with spaces between them. Engineers at the Google X lab, in California, which is also responsible for the company’s self-driving car, are working on the new screens, The Wall Street Journal reported. It is rumoured that the screens could be put together to form different shapes, enabling users to watch films on a large widescreen, before reassembling the screen blocks to view a document in portrait format, or simply choosing to use one of them as a smaller screen. The project is at an early stage as the experts at Google try to work out how to makes screens without bezels that can connect together seamlessly, and work as one large screen. It is reportedly being led by Mary Lou Jepsen, co-founder of One Laptop Per Child. It appears that Google believes the future is likely to be modular, because the company is already working on Project Ara smartphones (pictured), where components clip together. They could be ready for consumers to buy in January. According to the developer kit, Ara phones will be able run on multiple batteries - when one battery dies, it can be detached and replaced with a full battery module. Each phone will have a central 'spine' and an endoskeleton - nicknamed 'endo' - made of ribs that the individual modules will clip on to. There will be three different sized endos - including mini, medium and large - to rival the existing range of phones currently on the market, from compacts to phablets. Larger phones will be able to accommodate either larger, or additional modules, than the mini will. Google's kit describes various modules including batteries, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth chips, cameras, speakers and more. In theory, any sensor that can be fitted to a module will be able to attach to a module and while Google will make the shell, these modules will be made by other companies. By printing their own parts, users will also be able to customise them. The phone is set to be available in January 2015 with prices starting from just 50 (£31).

Wound colonization refers to nonreplicating microorganisms within the wound, while in infected wounds, replicating organisms exist and tissue is injured. All multicellular organisms are colonized to some degree by extrinsic organisms, and the vast majority of these exist in either a mutualistic or commensal relationship with the host. An example of the former is the anaerobic bacteria species, which colonizes the mammalian colon, and an example of the latter is various species of staphylococcus that exist on human skin. Neither of these colonizations are considered infections. The difference between an infection and a colonization is often only a matter of circumstance. Non-pathogenic organisms can become pathogenic given specific conditions, and even the most virulent organism requires certain circumstances to cause a compromising infection. Some colonizing bacteria, such as Corynebacteria sp. and viridans streptococci, prevent the adhesion and colonization of pathogenic bacteria and thus have a symbiotic relationship with the host, preventing infection and speeding wound healing.

How is \\"\\"Your mother is just away, Sofia, very, very soon to return...\\" said in Czech?","completion":"The sentence \\"Your mother is just away, Sofia, very, very soon to return...\\" translates to Czech as follows: \\"\\"Tvoje matka je právě pryč, Sofia, velmi, velmi brzy se vrátí...\\" Here's a breakdown of the translation: - \\"Your mother” translates to \\"Tvoje matka\\". In Czech, possessive pronouns (your, my, her, his, etc.) must agree in gender, number, and case with the noun they modify. \\"Matka\\" is a feminine noun, hence we use \\"Tvoje\\"; - \\"is just\\" translates to \\"je právě\\". - \\"away\\" equals \\"pryč\\", an adverb that describes the state of being away or gone; - \\"Sofia\\" remains the same, as it's a proper noun. A comma is used to indicate a pause, similarly to English language punctuation rules; - \\"Very, very\\" translates to \\"velmi, velmi\\". The repetition is used for emphasis here, just like in English; - The term \\"soon\\" translates to \\"brzy\\"; - \\"to return\\" is translated as \\"se vrátí\\". \\"Se\\" is a reflexive pronoun connected with the verb \\"vrátí\\" (will return), it doesn't have a direct equivalent in English in this case. \\"vrátí\\" is used in the third person singular future tense form, as \\"matka\\" is the third person. So, the entire phrase \\"Your mother is just away, Sofia, very, very soon to return...\\" translates as \\"Tvoje matka je právě pryč, Sofia, velmi, velmi brzy se vrátí...\\" Please note: Czech, as a Slavic language, uses a different grammatical structure than English. Therefore, word-for-word translations are often not possible. The aim of translation is to reflect the meaning of the original sentence, while adhering to the grammatical norms and conventions of the target language. The sentence structure and word order can be different due to unique characteristics of Czech syntax. That's why \\"se vrátí\\" is at the end of the sentence and not right after \\"very, very soon\\" (\\"velmi, velmi brzy\\"). Another peculiarity of Czech (and many other languages) is formal and informal forms of \\"you\\". In the sentence provided, we used \\"Tvoje\\", which corresponds to the informal \\"you\\". If you were speaking to Sofia in a formal setting, then it would be \\"Vaše\\"."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

They can have new experiences: a person who is thin can know what it is like to be fat. A man can have an experience of what it's like to be a woman.\\" During the experiment, a \\"female\\" approached and hit the face of the character another man was playing. \\"Their reaction was immediate,\\" said Slate. \\"They would take in a quick breath and maybeflinch .

The two meet, and a reluctant and troubled Breuer agrees to Salome's plan; to cure the intense migraine attacks that plague Nietzsche, and at the same time, without his knowing, cure the despair that her refusal of marriage has inflicted upon him. Salome has persuaded Franz Overbeck (Nietzsche's friend) to send him to Breuer, however, Nietzsche offers no support to Breuer, so the course of treatment must end. In a chilling parallel, an encounter with a mistreated horse causes Nietzsche to redeem his appointment with Breuer (Nietzsche finally went mad after stopping a man from whipping a horse using his own body, before breaking down in tears and descending into insanity). Nietzsche later visits a whorehouse, where he has another attack of migraine, exacerbated by the overuse of a sleeping draught. Nietzsche decides that he will, instead of pursuing treatment, leave for Basel. Meanwhile, an up-and-coming psychologist Sigmund Freud, friend of Josef and Mathilde Breuer, suggests that if Breuer was to make some confession to Nietzsche, he may stop seeing any positive sentiment shown as being a bid for power, and indulge in confessions of his own. So, the next time they met, Breuer makes the suggestion that, while he treats Nietzsche's body, Nietzsche must \\"treat\\" Breuer of the despair that he feels after falling in love with one of his patients, Bertha Pappenheim (played by Michal Yannai), otherwise known as Anna O., a...

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize this article: If you get into an argument with your child, don't let your ego get in the way of your relationship regardless of whether you are wrong or right. Try to remind yourself that you are the parent, and letting a fight drag on simply because you want to win is not good for your child or your relationship with them. Develop your conflict resolution skills. If you struggle with what to do when a problem arises between you and your child, then work on your conflict resolution skills. Developing ways to calm down, analyze the situation, and communicate effectively with your child will help to ensure that you do not behave like a toxic parent. Your child will likely forget about who won or lost a certain fight, but they will probably remember how your actions during that fight made them feel about you and themselves. Thus, it is important to be as mature as possible. Don't ignore your child or make them feel stupid. If you're not sure how to end a fight, try calmly telling your child you need a few minutes to yourself. Take this time to calm down if you need. When you've calmed down, return to your child, and apologize for fighting. You don't even need to bring up what the fight was about or who was right/wrong. If you can't bring yourself to apologize, you can at least say, “I don't like it when we fight. Let's go do something fun together instead.” Give them a hug, and remind them how much you love them. For many parents, this can be difficult to do, especially if you tend to be overcritical of yourself. Many parents criticize their children because they simply want them to be the best they can be without realizing how this makes the child feel about themselves. Thus, it's important to think before you speak when you talk with your child, especially when it comes to talking to them about their performance on something. Instead, act as a guide for your child. Remind yourself that your child is learning how to do things every day, and they need your help, not your judgments. If you have a hard time grasping this, think about how you feel when someone you love criticizes you. It probably doesn't make you feel good about yourself, even if you know it's not true. Even the most secure people don't enjoy being criticized. If your child is doing something that you think should be done differently, avoid saying something like, “That's such a dumb way to do that. Why would you think that's a good idea?” Instead, say something more positive such as, “You're doing great, can I show you how I normally do it? Then you can do it whichever way you prefer.” Remember that just because you do something a certain way doesn't mean it is the best way. Even if it is the best way, it's good to let your child have autonomy and figure some things out for themselves. One habit of many toxic parents is that they demand the attention of their children, especially when they are upset about something. Remind yourself, that, in your relationship with your child, you are not the center of attention, and your child probably doesn't have the maturity or coping skills to make you the center of their attention. Even if they do, it is not fair to expect your child to act as your caretaker. This doesn't mean that you can't be honest with your child about emotions you might be having. For example, if you are feeling sad and your child asks you what's wrong, you can tell them that you're feeling sad because something happened that you didn't want to happen. If it is appropriate, you can also tell them the reason you're sad. However, you should also remind your child that you'll be OK, you just need a bit of time to feel sad. You can do this rather than expect them to comfort you. Parenting is tough, so it is important to remember that making mistakes does not make you a toxic parent. Raising children can be very difficult, and occasionally, you might lose your cool. It is important to tell your child that you're sorry, remind them that you love them very much, and explain to them why you lost your temper, but make it clear that it wasn't because you think they are a bad kid. Forgive yourself. When you make a mistake, don't beat yourself up over it. You can reflect on what happened and why you think it happened in order to do better in the future, but it won't help you or your children to let yourself feel like a failure. Abuse is perhaps the worst thing that can happen to a child. The obvious forms of abuse are physical and sexual abuse. Both of these forms of abuse constitute completely unacceptable forms of behavior for a parent. However, a perhaps more common form of abuse is verbal abuse, which toxic parents are often guilty of using. This occurs whenever you say something to your child that harms their sense of self-worth or playing mind games aimed at putting you in control of your child's emotions. Verbal abuse may not leave physical signs that the abuse happened, but it certainly leaves emotional scars that may afflict your child for the rest of your life. Many parents aren't aware of the research, which makes it clear that spanking is just as harmful to a child's emotional well-being as other forms of physical abuse, such as slapping, punching, pinching, etc. If you have been spanking your child as a means of punishment, look for other, healthier ways to discipline your child for bad behavior. For example, take away a privilege and explain to them the reason that they have lost that privilege and when they can have it back. When it comes to child sexual abuse, any form of sexual touching between a child and an adult is considered sexual abuse. If you realize that you have been abusing your child either physically, sexually, or verbally, you should recognize that you have a problem and stop immediately. Seeking professional help for your issues is perhaps the best way to deal with anger and control issues. The first thing you need to do is understand what abuse is. Stop trying to rationalize your behavior. Yes, parenting is tough, but abusing is never a good (or acceptable) way to deal with your frustration no matter how mad you might be. In many cases, abusers often abuse because that's how they were raised. Getting professional help to learn how to better deal with your anger and emotions is often the best way to stop the cycle. One way to avoid abusing a child is to walk away from the situation when you feel that you are too frustrated or angry to deal with the situation rationally. Don't be afraid to ask for help when you need it.","completion":"The article emphasizes the importance of maintaining a healthy relationship with your children and avoiding toxic parenting behaviors. It advises not letting your ego get in the way during conflicts, and instead, focus on developing conflict resolution skills to calmly and effectively communicate with your children. Children will remember how conflicts made them feel, so it is crucial to be as mature and understanding as possible. In order to avoid being overly critical, act as a guide for your child and provide them with the support they need. Be mindful of the way you address their mistakes and allow them to have autonomy in their decisions. Keep in mind that your relationship with your child should not be centered around your own needs, and do not expect your child to act as your caretaker. It is important to recognize that making mistakes as a parent does not automatically make you toxic. Apologize when necessary, and remember to forgive yourself. Moreover, avoid any form of abuse, such as physical, sexual, or verbal, as these can leave lasting emotional scars on your child. Recognize if you have a problem and seek professional help to deal with anger and control issues. In conclusion, maintaining a healthy parent-child relationship requires effective communication, empathy, and understanding. Develop conflict resolution skills, provide guidance, avoid toxic behaviors, and seek help when needed to ensure a nurturing environment for your child's growth."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A fellow gym-goer who also happened to be a doctor administered CPR and used paddles to keep the trainer alive.

Project 86 is an American rock band from Orange County, California, formed in 1996. The band has released eight albums, which have collectively sold nearly 500,000 units worldwide, two EPs, two DVDs, and one live album. Their music is considered by most to be a rock/post-hardcore/alternative style. Frontman Andrew Schwab's poetic and introspective lyrics have addressed a wide variety of topics such as conformity and emptiness. According to the official Project 86 documentary \\"XV,\\" Project 86 formed in mid 1996 by vocalist Andrew Schwab in Orange County, California. Guitarist Randy Torres, who was a sophomore in high school, was the first member recruited. The original lineup included Schwab, Torres, Ethan Luck (Demon Hunter, Relient K), and bassist Matt Hernandez (Unashamed, The Dingees). Drummer Alex Albert was added when Hernandez left the band after a few rehearsals, then Luck moved to bass from drums. Luck left the band to join The Dingees in Summer 1997, after which high school senior Steven Dail joined in late 1997. Schwab comments in a 2004 interview regarding the number 86 in the band name: \\"The generation before us used that phrase to describe when they would reject or remove something...Project 86 is like the whole idea of being rejected, or separate, or not going along with the current.\\" The group did not travel much initially; they decided to hone their sound and live performances before embarking on tours. In 1997, Project 86 was voted one of the top independent acts of the year by HM magazine readers. At Tomfest the same year, their performance was a big hit and Tooth & Nail Records, became interested and subsequently signed them. Bryan Carlstrom produced their self-titled debut. He had engineered albums by multi-platinum outfits The Offspring and Alice in Chains as well as producing labelmates Stavesacre . Schwab drew upon personal struggles he was experiencing at the time to write meaningful lyrics. Sonny Sandoval, lead singer of nu metal group P.O.D., appeared as a guest performer. The album was released in June 1998 and was well received. It sold over 50,000 copies to date and gained mainstream exposure on MTV shows Road Rules and The Real World. Project 86 was observed by Allmusic to be the \\"most daring album at the time for its genre\\". The success of their debut made Project 86 a top seller for BEC/Tooth and Nail. The band embarked on a pioneering tour called \\"The Warriors Come Out and Play Tour\\" in May 1999 with friends P.O.D. and Blindside as the middle slot, which drew crowds of 600-1000 across the nation.

Born in Nelson County, Virginia, Allen was the son of Loretta M. and Earl Raymond Allen, who was recorded in the 1920 and 1930 U.S. census records for Wayne County, Michigan as working as a chauffeur to a private family. He earned varsity letters in football, track and basketball at Lake Shore High School in St. Clair Shores, Michigan; having graduated in 1940. Allen went to Alma College in Michigan and later at Marquette University in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where he was sent as an officer trainee in the U. S. Navy's World War II V-12 program. He graduated with a B.S. in education from Michigan State Normal College (now Eastern Michigan University) in Ypsilanti, and then attended the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, where he earned his master's degree in physical education in 1947. After rejecting a 1 million, four-year contract offer throughout the 1977 season, Allen was dismissed by the Redskins in mid-January. He was replaced by one of his favorite players, Jack Pardee, by then the promising young head coach of the Bears, who had gained the wild card playoff berth ahead of the Redskins; both had finished at 9-5. Rams owner Carroll Rosenbloom was searching for a new coach after parting ways with Chuck Knox, and decided to bring Allen back. Allen's hiring was announced on February 1, and he returned to Los Angeles in 1978 with much media fanfare. His second stint as the Rams' head coach was an unfortunate experience for all concerned. Unlike his first stint, Allen did not have full authority over personnel. He thus worked with general manager Don Klosterman to oversee a talented roster that had made the team a perennial playoff challenger. Allen brought with him his scrupulous discipline and attention to detail, which extended to practice-field protocol and dining-hall decorum. However, his coaching style did not play well with the new generation of NFL players, and a group of Ram players chafed at the regulations almost immediately. Some made their grievances public; a few, including standout linebacker Isiah Robertson, briefly left camp. As newspaper reports were quoting players expressing confidence that differences would be resolved, the Rams played listlessly and lost the first two games of the 1978 exhibition schedule. Rosenbloom decided that for the season to be salvaged a change must be made, and the announcement of Allen's abrupt dismissal was made on August 13. Many of Allen's own players were surprised by the decision. Defensive coordinator Ray Malavasi, well-respected and liked by players (and the only holdover from Chuck Knox' staff), replaced him; the Rams ultimately advanced to that year's NFC Championship Game and the following year to the Super Bowl. Rosenbloom died in April 1979. Allen soon joined CBS Sports as an analyst for NFL network telecasts, and worked in the broadcast booth from 1978 to 1983. With former Cleveland Browns great running back Jim Brown and play-by-play announcer Vin Scully, they were the network's only three-man announcing team.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: how did the players respond to his coaching style?","completion":"The players' response to George Allen's coaching style during his second stint as the Rams' head coach was mixed.

Please answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: By what specific date had a 16,000-foot-long eastward-trending fracture system developed across the summit area? ? Mount St. Helens remained dormant from its last period of activity in the 1840s and 1850s until March 1980. Several small earthquakes, beginning on March 15, indicated that magma may have begun moving below the volcano. On March 20, at 3:45 p.m. Pacific Standard Time (all times will be in PST or PDT), a shallow magnitude 4.2 earthquake centered below the volcano's north flank, signaled the volcano's violent return from 123 years of hibernation. A gradually building earthquake swarm saturated area seismographs and started to climax at about noon on March 25, reaching peak levels in the next two days, including an earthquake registering 5.1 on the Richter scale. A total of 174 shocks of magnitude 2.6 or greater were recorded during those two days. Shocks of magnitude 3.2 or greater occurred at a slightly increasing rate during April and May with five earthquakes of magnitude 4 or above per day in early April, and eight per day the week before May 18. Initially there was no direct sign of eruption, but small earthquake-induced avalanches of snow and ice were reported from aerial observations. At 12:36 p.m. on March 27, phreatic eruptions (explosions of steam caused by magma suddenly heating groundwater) ejected and smashed rock from within the old summit crater, excavating a new crater 250 feet (75 m) wide, and sending an ash column about 7,000 feet (2.1 km) into the air. By this date a 16,000-foot-long (3.0 mi; 4.9 km) eastward-trending fracture system had also developed across the summit area. This was followed by more earthquake swarms and a series of steam explosions that sent ash 10,000 to 11,000 feet (3,000 to 3,400 m) above their vent. Most of this ash fell between three and twelve miles (5 and 19 km) from its vent, but some was carried 150 miles (240 km) south to Bend, Oregon, or 285 miles (460 km) east to Spokane, Washington.

What is the best way to: To discourage weeds from growing in the garden, Available options: 1). lay some mulch down around the base of the plants to suppress them. 2). water and fertilize the garden frequently to provide nutrients to the plants. Answer:","completion":"The best way to discourage weeds from growing in the garden is Option 1: lay some mulch down around the base of the plants to suppress them. Step 1: Choose an appropriate mulch material like wood chips, shredded bark, straw, or even newspapers, which can help suppress weeds by blocking sunlight and creating a physical barrier for weed growth. Step 2: Prepare the garden area by weeding it first. Remove any existing weeds, ensuring that you pull out their roots to prevent regrowth. Step 3: Apply a layer of mulch around the base of your plants, maintaining a thickness of 2-4 inches. The thickness is essential because too thin a layer of mulch will not effectively block sunlight, allowing weeds to grow, and too thick a layer may suffocate your plants by preventing air and water from reaching their roots. Step 4: Ensure that you keep the mulch a few inches away from the stems of your plants. This will help prevent rotting of the stem or any other potential diseases from impacting the plant. By choosing Option 1, you're suppressing weed growth without providing the weeds with the nutrients they need to thrive, as watering and fertilizing the garden (Option 2) would do. Mulching is a more effective method to specifically target weeds while helping conserve soil moisture and regulate temperature for the desired plants."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the exact title of the portrait featuring the children of Ellis Agar, 2nd Earl of Normanton? ? In February 1828, shortly before his 41st birthday, Etty soundly defeated John Constable by 18 votes to five to become a full Royal Academician, at the time the highest honour available to an artist. By this time, complaints about his supposed indecency were beginning to resurface. All but one of the 15 paintings Etty exhibited at the Royal Academy in the 1820s had included at least one nude figure, and Etty was acquiring a reputation for using respectable themes as a pretext for nudity.For the 1828 Summer Exhibition Etty exhibited three pictures; The World Before the Flood, Venus, the Evening Star and Guardian Cherubs. (The latter was a portrait of the children of Welbore Ellis Agar, 2nd Earl of Normanton, and was the only non-nude painting exhibited by Etty at the RA in the 1820s.) Although similar to his earlier works, they were technically more accomplished. Both The World Before the Flood and Venus attracted positive reviews in the press and were sold during their exhibition for substantial sums, although the purchase by the Marquess of Stafford of The World Before the Flood—a work containing scantily clad figures of both sexes—drew a pointed comment in The Gentleman's Magazine that it \\"will serve to accompany the private Titians of that nobleman\\". Despite the increasing number of complaints in the press about his use of nudity, respect for Etty from his fellow artists continued to rise, and in 1828 the British Institution awarded him £100 in recognition of his talent. As soon as the 1828 Summer Exhibition was over, Etty stopped work on other projects to concentrate on a diploma piece, without which he could not become a Royal Academician. This piece, Sleeping Nymph and Satyrs, was presented to the Academy in October, and in December 1828 Etty became a Royal Academician. It appears to me then that virtuous happiness being our lawful aim in life, that having Academic Rank and Fame the next thing to be considered (if God approve) is to seek that Decent Competency which shall make my latter days comfortable...

Paul and Audrey Safranek, a married couple in Omaha with financial problems, meet Dave and Carol Johnson, who have downsized. While the inventors advocate that downsizing is environmentally friendly through the reduction of waste, Dave argues that its benefits extend far beyond that and improve one's life through the increase in value of their money. Exploring the possibilities of downsizing, Paul and Audrey agree to undergo the process and move to Leisureland, New Mexico, one of the most popular communities for small individuals. After undergoing downsizing, Paul receives a call from Audrey, saying that she was unable to go through with the procedure and, by opting out at the last minute, will be leaving him. One year later, Paul finalizes the divorce with Audrey, and settles in to his new apartment (a downsizing of its own from the mansion he was to originally share with Audrey). Although Paul had anticipated a life of relative ease, the divorce left him without Audrey's share of their assets. In addition, Paul's share of the asset shrank further still due to divorce settlement negotiations.

Yelberton Abraham Tittle Jr. (October 24, 1926 - October 8, 2017), better known as Y. A. Tittle, was a professional American football quarterback. He played in the National Football League (NFL) for the San Francisco 49ers, New York Giants, and Baltimore Colts, after spending two seasons with the Colts in the All-America Football Conference (AAFC). Known for his competitiveness, leadership, and striking profile, Tittle was the centerpiece of several prolific offenses throughout his seventeen-year professional career from 1948 to 1964. Tittle played college football for Louisiana State University, where he was a two-time All-Southeastern Conference (SEC) quarterback for the LSU Tigers football team. A photo of a dazed Tittle in the end zone taken by Morris Berman of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette on September 20, 1964, is regarded among the most iconic images in the history of American sports and journalism. Tittle, in his 17th and final season, was photographed helmet-less, bloodied and kneeling immediately after having been knocked to the ground by John Baker of the Pittsburgh Steelers and throwing an interception that was returned for a touchdown at the old Pitt Stadium. He suffered a concussion and cracked sternum on the play, but went on to play the rest of the season. Post-Gazette editors declined to publish the photo, looking for \\"action shots\\" instead, but Berman entered the image into contests where it took on a life of its own, winning a National Headliner Award. The photo was published in the October 2, 1964, issue of Life magazine. It is regarded as having changed the way that photographers look at sports, having shown the power of capturing a moment of reaction. It became one of three photos to hang in the lobby of the National Press Photographers Association headquarters, alongside Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima and the Hindenburg disaster. A copy now hangs in the Pro Football Hall of Fame. After at first having failed to see the appeal of the image, Tittle eventually grew to embrace it, putting it on the back cover of his 2009 autobiography. \\"That was the end of the road,\\" he told the Los Angeles Times in 2008. \\"It was the end of my dream. It was over.\\" Pittsburgh player John Baker, who hit Tittle right before the picture was taken, ran for sheriff in his native Wake County, North Carolina in 1978, and used the photo as a campaign tool. He was elected and went on to serve for 24 years. Tittle also held a fundraiser to assist Baker in his bid for a fourth term in 1989.

With its 190 million inhabitants, Brazil has the largest population in Latin America and ranks fifth in the world. However, Brazil's population growth rate has dropped greatly and Brazilian women now have only 2.7 children on average. This achievement really becomes the envy of many other Third World countries. Brazil has become one of the developing world's great successes at reducing population growth-----but more by accident than design. While countries such as India have made joint efforts to reduce birth rates, Brazil has had a better result without really trying, says George Martine at Harvard. Martine _ , among other things, soap operas(TV series) and installment plans introduced in the 1970s. Both played an important, although indirect role in lowering the birth rate.

Remove the spaces from the following sentence: Walnuts and Health Diet Moderation","completion":"\\"WalnutsandHealthDietModeration\\" is the sentence without the spaces. Walnuts are a great addition to your diet because they are packed with essential nutrients that support overall health. They are particularly known for their high levels of omega-3 fatty acids, which are beneficial for the brain, heart, and the entire body. The importance of a healthy diet is well established, and incorporating nutrient-dense foods like walnuts can provide numerous health benefits. In addition to omega-3 fatty acids, walnuts are also rich in antioxidants, fiber, and protein. Some potential health benefits of including walnuts in your diet include: 1. Improved Heart Health: Walnuts contain healthy fats like monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats, which help to lower the levels of LDL (bad) cholesterol while increasing levels of HDL (good) cholesterol. This leads to a reduced risk of cardiovascular diseases. 2. Cognitive Boost: The omega-3 fatty acids found in walnuts may help improve cognitive function and reduce the risk of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s. They can also support better memory and overall brain functioning. 3. Anti-inflammatory Properties: Walnuts contain phytonutrients and polyphenols, which can help in reducing inflammation throughout the body. 4. Weight Management: The fiber and protein content in walnuts help promote a feeling of fullness, making them an excellent snack option for individuals looking to maintain or lose weight. 5. Improved Digestive Health: The fiber from walnuts also aids in digestion by promoting regular bowel movements, reducing bloating, and preventing constipation. 6. Enhanced Immunity: The mix of antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals contained in walnuts supports overall immunity by protecting cells from damage and reducing the risk of various infections. As with any food item, moderation is key when incorporating walnuts into your diet. While they are highly nutritious, walnuts are also calorie-dense – one ounce (approximately 28 grams) contains around 185 calories. Consuming excessive amounts of walnuts can result in weight gain and other health issues. To effectively integrate walnuts into your diet, consider implementing the following tips: 1. Consume a handful (about 1 oz or 28 grams) of walnuts as a daily snack, rather than consuming them in large quantities. 2. Use walnuts as a topping for your salads, oatmeal, yogurt, or smoothie bowls for added texture and nutrition. 3. Replace unhealthy snacks like chips and candy bars with a mix of walnuts and other healthy nuts or seeds like almonds, pistachios, and chia seeds. 4. Choose unsalted or lightly salted walnuts to minimize your sodium intake, as excessive salt can contribute to high blood pressure and other health issues. By incorporating walnuts into your diet in moderation, you can enjoy their numerous health benefits without risking adverse side effects. Along with maintaining a balanced diet and engaging in regular physical activity, the inclusion of walnuts will contribute positively to your overall well-being."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: In the Netherlands,cycling isn't seen as an eco-friendly exercise; it's part of everyday life, as it's people's top choice to school and work. \\"There are more bicycles than residents in the Netherlands. In cities like Amsterdam and The Hague, up to 70 percent of all journeys are made by bike,\\" said BBC. So how did cycling become such a popular means of transportation in the European country? In the 1970s, the Dutch government began to improve its cycling infrastructure due to both a social movement demanding safer cycling condition for children and the oil crisis in the Middle East, when oil producing countries stopped their exports to Western Europe. To make cycling safer and more appealing, the Dutch have built the widest cycling network in the world. The country has over 40,000 kilometers of bicycle lanes and paths,which are clearly marked. They have smooth surfaces,separate signs and lights for those on two wheels. The lanes are wide enough to allow side-by-side cycling and passing. In many cities the bike lanes are completely segregated from motorized traffic. And in many traffic situations cyclists are given priority over drivers. Sometimes,where space is limited and both must share, you can see signs showing an image of a cyclist with a car behind accompanied by the words \\"Bike Street:Cars are guests\\". As young people aren't allowed to drive alone until they are 18, cycling offers Dutch teenagers an alternative form of freedom. The government also makes cycling training lessons a compulsory part of the Dutch school curriculum . Bike parking facilities are everywhere in the country. Cyclists are accommodated in the way motorists are elsewhere. Take Groningen, a city in the northeastern part of the Netherlands, for example. The city's central train station has underground parking for 10,000 bikes. For many Dutch people, bikes are trusty friends for life's adventures. In that kind of relationship it is longevity that matters--that's why many Dutch people ride older bikes. Question: What is the author's main purpose in writing the article?

Prolonged sexual activity can lead to physical exhaustion, and the most natural response for the body is to rest and recover after such an extended period of physical exertion. Although the other options might occur or be related to the situation, they are not as fitting as the need for rest.

The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the person that owned the Hookend studio? , can you please find it? In Waters' absence, Gilmour had been recruiting musicians for a new project. Months previously, keyboardist Jon Carin had jammed with Gilmour at his Hookend studio, where he composed the chord progression that became \\"Learning to Fly\\", and so was invited onto the team. Gilmour invited Bob Ezrin (co-producer of 1979's The Wall) to help consolidate their material; Ezrin had turned down Waters' offer of a role on the development of his new solo album, Radio K.A.O.S., saying it was \\"far easier for Dave and I to do our version of a Floyd record\\". Ezrin arrived in England in mid-1986 for what Gilmour later described as \\"mucking about with a lot of demos\\".At this stage, there was no commitment to a new Pink Floyd release, and Gilmour maintained that the material might become his third solo album. CBS representative Stephen Ralbovsky hoped for a new Pink Floyd album, but in a meeting in November 1986, told Gilmour and Ezrin that the music \\"doesn't sound a fucking thing like Pink Floyd\\". Gilmour later said that the new project was difficult without Waters. He experimented with songwriters such as Eric Stewart and Roger McGough, but eventually settled on Anthony Moore, who was credited as co-writer of \\"Learning to Fly\\" and \\"On the Turning Away\\". Whereas many prior Pink Floyd albums are concept albums, Gilmour settled for the more conventional approach of a collection of songs without a thematic link. By the end of that year, he had decided to make the material into a Pink Floyd project.

Choices: - two halves - fifty weeks - four quarters - three trimesters A: Answer:","completion":"Human gestation is commonly divided into three trimesters. Each trimester represents a distinct period of development and growth for both the mother and the developing fetus. The duration of a human pregnancy is approximately 40 weeks, with each trimester lasting roughly 13 to 14 weeks. Understanding the different stages of pregnancy can help provide a better understanding of the physical and emotional changes experienced during this period. 1. First trimester (week 1 to week 12-13): The first trimester is critical for the initial development of the baby. It starts with fertilization when the sperm meets the egg, and this fertilized egg implants itself into the lining of the uterus. At this stage, the baby is called an embryo, and its development begins with the formation of essential body systems, including the nervous system, heart, and lungs. During this trimester, pregnancy-related hormones such as hCG (human chorionic gonadotropin), progesterone, and estrogen increase. The surge in these hormones can cause common early pregnancy symptoms like morning sickness, fatigue, breast tenderness, and frequent urination. As the first trimester comes to an end, the risk of miscarriage decreases significantly. 2. Second trimester (week 13 to week 26-27): The second trimester is known as the \\"golden period\\" of pregnancy because many uncomfortable symptoms from the first trimester begin to subside, and the risk of miscarriage is lower. At this stage, the fetus transitions from being an embryo to a fetus. The organs and body systems continue to mature and develop, leading to the fetus's rapid growth. During this period, the mother begins to show a more visible baby bump as her uterus expands to accommodate the baby's growth. The mother may also start to experience fetal movements or \\"quickening\\" during the second trimester. Additionally, new symptoms like round ligament pain and lower back pain may occur as the body adjusts to the changes in weight and posture. 3. Third trimester (week 27 to week 40): The third trimester is the final stage of pregnancy, and the fetus's organs continue to mature and function independently. The fetus gains weight rapidly as layers of fat begin to form, which is essential for maintaining body temperature after birth. The lungs develop further to prepare for breathing outside the womb, and the brain continues to grow. During this period, the mother might experience increased discomfort due to the size of the baby and the pressure it puts on her internal organs. Common symptoms in the third trimester include shortness of breath, heartburn, swelling, and difficulty sleeping. The body also starts preparing for labor by releasing a hormone called relaxin, which softens the ligaments and joints in the pelvic region. Toward the end of this trimester, the baby typically shifts into the head-down position to prepare for birth. In summary, human gestation is divided into three trimesters, each with its unique set of developmental milestones and changes for both the mother and the fetus. Understanding each stage can help expectant parents prepare for the physical, emotional, and psychological needs associated with the pregnancy journey."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Uighurs are Muslims. They regard themselves as culturally and ethnically close to Central Asian nations. The region's economy has for centuries revolved around agriculture and trade, with towns such as Kashgar thriving as hubs along the famous Silk Road. In the early part of the 20th Century, the Uighurs briefly declared independence. The region was brought under the complete control of communist China in 1949. Xinjiang is officially designated an autonomous region within China, like Tibet to its south. Activists say central government policies have gradually curtailed the Uighurs' religious, commercial and cultural activities. Beijing is accused of intensifying a crackdown after street protests in Xinjiang in the 1990s, and again in the run-up to the Beijing Olympics in 2008. Over the past decade, many prominent Uighurs have been imprisoned or have sought asylum abroad after being accused of terrorism. Mass immigration of Han Chinese to Xinjiang had made Uighurs a minority in Xinjiang. Beijing is accused of exaggerating the threat from Uighur separatists in order to justify repression in the region. China's central government says Uighur militants are waging a violent campaign for an independent state by plotting bombings, sabotage and civic unrest. Since the 9/11 attacks in the US, China has increasingly portrayed its Uighur separatists as auxiliaries of al-Qaeda, saying they have received training in Afghanistan. Little evidence has been produced in support of these claims. More than 20 Uighurs were captured by the US military after its invasion of Afghanistan. They were imprisoned at Guantanamo Bay for years without being charged with any offence and most have now been resettled elsewhere. Almost 200 people died in ethnic riots in Urumqi, the administrative capital of Xinjiang, in July 2009. One of the sparks for the violence seems to have been the deaths of two Uighurs in clashes with Han Chinese at a factory thousands of miles away in southern China. The authorities blame Xinjiang separatists based outside China for the unrest, and they singled out exiled Uighur leader Rebiya Kadeer, saying she incited the violence. She denied any responsibility for the violence. Uighur exiles say police fired indiscriminately on peaceful protests, leading to violence and deaths. Xinjiang has received huge state investment in industrial and energy projects, and Beijing has been keen to highlight these as major steps forward. But many Uighurs complain that the Han are taking their jobs, and that their farmland has been confiscated for redevelopment. The activities of local and foreign journalists are closely monitored by the state and there are few independent sources of news from the region. However, occasional attacks on Chinese targets suggest Uighur separatism remains a potent and potentially violent force.","completion":"The Uighurs, a Muslim ethnic group in China's Xinjiang region, face cultural repression and challenges from central government policies and mass immigration of Han Chinese, while Beijing asserts that Uighur separatists pose a significant threat and are connected to terrorism."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.
