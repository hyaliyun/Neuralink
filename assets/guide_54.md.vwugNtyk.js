The answer to the question: What are the names of the two people who the genre of Chinese travel literature became popular with? is inside the article: The visual arts during the Song dynasty were heightened by new developments such as advances in landscape and portrait painting. The gentry elite engaged in the arts as accepted pastimes of the cultured scholar-official, including painting, composing poetry, and writing calligraphy. The poet and statesman Su Shi and his associate Mi Fu (1051–1107) enjoyed antiquarian affairs, often borrowing or buying art pieces to study and copy. Poetry and literature profited from the rising popularity and development of the ci poetry form. Enormous encyclopedic volumes were compiled, such as works of historiography and dozens of treatises on technical subjects. This included the universal history text of the Zizhi Tongjian, compiled into 1000 volumes of 9.4 million written Chinese characters. The genre of Chinese travel literature also became popular with the writings of the geographer Fan Chengda (1126–1193) and Su Shi, the latter of whom wrote the 'daytrip essay' known as Record of Stone Bell Mountain that used persuasive writing to argue for a philosophical point. Although an early form of the local geographic gazetteer existed in China since the 1st century, the matured form known as \\"treatise on a place\\", or fangzhi, replaced the old \\"map guide\\", or tujing, during the Song dynasty.The imperial courts of the emperor's palace were filled with his entourage of court painters, calligraphers, poets, and storytellers. Emperor Huizong was a renowned artist as well as a patron of the arts. A prime example of a highly venerated court painter was Zhang Zeduan (1085–1145) who painted an enormous panoramic painting, Along the River During the Qingming Festival. Emperor Gaozong of Song initiated a massive art project during his reign, known as the Eighteen Songs of a Nomad Flute from the life story of Cai Wenji (b. 177). This art project was a diplomatic gesture to the Jin dynasty while he negotiated for the release of his mother from Jurchen captivity in the north., can you guess it ?

I belong to a very humble and conservative family, from Indore. @I never had a lot of exposure to guys, until we went to attend a marriage of one of our wealthy relatives in Delhi.. it was one of the best times I had, as we had a group of 4–5 similar aged cousins, though most of them were very distant relatives. One of them was a 19 year old dude, and he was kind of cute. But I never thought I would have this urge to you know… it was teenage and everything seemed new and exciting. So the second day, after having roamed all around Noida, we finally returned to our hotel and that guy accompanied me to my room. I asked him if he wants to come in as my parents were involved in the late night Sangeet rehearsals. He nodded gently and before I could know, we were cuddling and watching TV. I felt like a rebel, though it was the strangest and least expected thing I had done. Then he kissed me. Before I knew it I let him in my mouth …and he kept rolling his tongue on mine. It was my first kiss, and I don't regret it. The warmth of his mouth, the wetness of his lips and his breath felt like the only thing I ever wanted. I was a teen so please not judge. Sadly… before we could proceed, rest of our cousins called us to play Antakhshree with them. Never have we met since, but we often exchange messages on Facebook.

User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Summarize this article in one sentence. One of the key components to a healthy and fulfilling relationship is offering your partner support for their personal endeavors. Your partner was a model before they met you and, if they continue their career, understand they will sometimes have to sacrifice spending time with you to further their career. Ask them how work is going. Listen to them vent or talk about upcoming jobs they’re excited for. On the flip side, don’t get angry if your partner decides to leave modeling to follow another career path. Most models don’t spend their entire lives modeling. Getting angry over their decision to leave may communicate that you’re only with their for their fame and hurt your relationship. If your partner has gained considerable fame, your relationship will inevitably end up within the public eye. Once things start getting serious between the two of you, sit down with them to discuss your privacy as a couple. It’s okay if you’re fine with the spotlight, but it’s also okay if you want more privacy. One point to consider is whether you’re okay with being photographed with your partner while on dates and attending events. Do you want to be mentioned on their social media and in interviews? Being a model requires a lot of traveling to different job locations and events. You won’t always be able to accompany your partner to different areas, so you will have to discuss whether you’re okay with long distance relationships and how you’ll communicate during these periods. Web messenger clients like LINE and Telegram are great for keeping in touch over long distances, since they don’t require specific network signals to function. Facetime and Skype can help you talk in a more face to face manner. Setting aside time to spend together will strengthen your relationship, especially if you’re indulging in a common interest. Cook meals with your partner. Cuddle together as you watch a television show or movie you both love. Take dancing classes together to learn a fun new skill. Enjoy your time with each other as much as you can to keep your relationship strong. Fame aside, your partner is still a regular person and will appreciate being treated that way. Don’t let their fame go to your head. Always remember who they are and what you love about them as a person, whether it’s their passion for a particular hobby or a charming personal quirk.","completion":"Support your partner's modeling career by understanding their need for flexibility, discussing privacy and long-distance communication, engaging in shared interests, and treating them as a regular person regardless of fame."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Hercules was once destined to be the King of Mycenae as his father Zeus had planned but his jealous stepmother Hera had other plans. Hera not willing a bastard son of Zeus should overshadow her, decided to let another boy, Eurystheus, his cousin born first which deprived Hercules of the right. Hera tried to kill Hercules with two serpents but he strangles them both. As the years go by, Hercules displayed strength like no other boy his age which unknown to many, his father is really Zeus. Eurystheus was then declared king after winning a race. Unable to accept his defeat, Hercules challenged Eurystheus to another round which accidentally takes away the life of his mother Alcmene. Feeling guilty even with all the consolation Megara gives him, he goes to the oracle and consults Apollo who tells him he must perform the \\"Twelve Labors\\" for Eurystheus. He refuses at first until the guilt goes so deep that he gives in to the challenge. Hercules is given a series of challenges each one was designed tougher by the other by his stepmother Hera. He was first sent to kill the Nemean lion which he succeeded into turning his coat. He also drove away the Stymphalian birds with the help of Athena's cymbals. Each one was made difficult by the other as his stepmother hopes to see the last of him. A series of labors are shown like the slaying of the Lernaean Hydra, catching the stag of Artemis, the Cathmanian boar, the Cretan bull, cleaning the Augeean stables, getting the girdle of Hippolyte, the man-eating mares of Diomedes and the Cattle of Geryon (but the monster is not shown). When asked to get the Golden Apples of the Hesperides, he does not get permission so he goes to Atlas who gets the apples for him.

Its cardinal trait is its syncopated, or \\"ragged\\", rhythm. The genre has its origins in African-American communities like St. Louis years before being published as popular sheet music for piano. Ernest Hogan (18651909) was a pioneer of ragtime music and was the first to compose ragtime into sheet music. The composition was called \\"LA Pas Ma LA\\" and it was released in 1895. Hogan has also been credited for coining the term \\"ragtime\\". The term is actually derived from his hometown \\"Shake Rag\\" in Bowling Green, Kentucky. Ben Harney, who is also a Kentucky native has often been credited for introducing the music to the mainstream public. His first ragtime composition \\"You've been a good old wagon but you done broke\\" helped popularize the musical genre. The composition was published in 1895 but released in 1896. Ragtime was also a modification of the march made popular by John Philip Sousa, with additional polyrhythms coming from African music. The ragtime composer Scott Joplin (\\"ca.\\" 18681917) became famous through the publication of the \\"Maple Leaf Rag\\" (1899) and a string of ragtime hits such as \\"The Entertainer\\" (1902), although he was later forgotten by all but a small, dedicated community of ragtime aficionados until the major ragtime revival in the early 1970s. For at least 12 years after its publication, \\"Maple Leaf Rag\\" heavily influenced subsequent ragtime composers with its melody lines, harmonic progressions or metric patterns. - Improvisation is broad term referring to the process of devising an atypical method of solving a problem due to lack of time or resources. In a technical context, this can mean adapting a device for some use other than that which it was designed for, or building a device from unusual components in an ad-hoc fashion. Improvisation, within the context of performing arts, is a very spontaneous performance without specific or scripted preparation. The skills of improvisation can apply to many different faculties, across all artistic, scientific, physical, cognitive, academic, and non-academic disciplines. - West Africa, also called Western Africa and the West of Africa, is the westernmost subregion of Africa. West Africa has been defined as including 18 countries: Benin, Burkina Faso, the island nation of Cape Verde, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Ivory Coast, Liberia, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, the island of Saint Helena, Senegal, Sierra Leone, São Tomé and Príncipe and Togo. - African-American music is an umbrella term covering a diverse range of musics and musical genres largely developed by African Americans. Their origins are in musical forms that arose out of the historical condition of slavery that characterized the lives of African Americans prior to the American Civil War. - A trumpet is a musical instrument commonly used in classical and jazz ensembles. The trumpet group contains the instruments with the highest register in the brass family. Trumpet-like instruments have historically been used as signaling devices in battle or hunting, with examples dating back to at least 1500 BC; they began to be used as musical instruments only in the late-14th or early 15th century. Trumpets are used in art music styles, for instance in orchestras, concert bands, and jazz ensembles, as well as in popular music. They are played by blowing air through almost-closed lips (called the player's embouchure), producing a \\"buzzing\\" sound that starts a standing wave vibration in the air column inside the instrument. Since the late 15th century they have primarily been constructed of brass tubing, usually bent twice into a rounded rectangular shape. - Africa is the world's second-largest and second-most-populous continent. At about 30.3 million km² (11.7 million square miles) including adjacent islands, it covers 6% of Earth's total surface area and 20.4 % of its total land area.

The continent is surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, both the Suez Canal and the Red Sea along the Sinai Peninsula to the northeast, the Indian Ocean to the southeast, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. The continent includes Madagascar and various archipelagos. It contains 54 fully recognized sovereign states (countries), nine territories and two \\"de facto\\" independent states with limited or no recognition. - New Orleans (or ) is a major United States port and the largest city and metropolitan area in the state of Louisiana.

Since the 1920s jazz age, jazz has become recognized as a major form of musical expression. It emerged in the form of independent traditional and popular musical styles, all linked by the common bonds of African American and European American musical parentage with a performance orientation. Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes, call and response vocals, polyrhythms and improvisation. Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression, and in African-American music traditions including blues and ragtime, as well as European military band music. Although the foundation of jazz is deeply rooted within the Black experience of the United States, different cultures have contributed their own experience and styles to the art form as well. Intellectuals around the world have hailed jazz as \\"one of America's original art forms\\". - Vic Lewis (29 July 1919 9 February 2009) was a British jazz guitarist and bandleader.

Answer a question about this article: After the end of the late Middle Ages period, the Renaissance would spread unevenly over continental Europe from the southern European region. The intellectual transformation of the Renaissance is viewed as a bridge between the Middle Ages and the Modern era. Europeans would later begin an era of world discovery. Combined with the influx of classical ideas was the invention of printing which facilitated dissemination of the printed word and democratized learning. These two things would lead to the Protestant Reformation. Europeans also discovered new trading routes, as was the case with Columbus’s travel to the Americas in 1492, and Vasco da Gama’s circumnavigation of Africa and India in 1498. Their discoveries strengthened the economy and power of European nations. What effect did the discoveries of Columbus and da Gama have on European nations?","completion":"The discoveries of Columbus and da Gama strengthened the economy and power of European nations.

Possible A: friend's house, bicycle, space shuttle, kitchen, disneyland Why is \\"space shuttle\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? Answer:","completion":"\\"Space shuttle\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense for the given question because: 1. Context of the question: The question asks about the type of transport where food is normally freeze-dried or dehydrated. This implies that the transport would be unusual or have specific conditions that require preserving food in such a way. 2. Nature of other options: Comparing \\"space shuttle\\" to the other options (friend's house, bicycle, kitchen, and Disneyland), none of them are a form of transport. A friend's house and kitchen are static places, Disneyland is a theme park, and a bicycle is used for short-distance transport where people usually don't require a specific food preservation method. 3. Specific conditions in space: The space shuttle (and space travel in general) presents unique conditions such as microgravity, limited storage, and the need for long-lasting provisions that are lightweight and easy to prepare. These factors make freeze-dried and dehydrated food ideal for consumption on a space shuttle. Freeze-dried food retains nutritional value, has a long shelf life, is lightweight, and is easily rehydrated. 4. Precedence: Historically, freeze-dried and dehydrated food has been used by astronauts during space missions due to the reasons stated above. This is a well-established concept bolstered by examples from real-life space missions.

After the death of Charles XII, Sweden still refused to make peace with Russia on Peter's terms. Despite a continued Swedish naval presence and strong patrols to protect the coast, small Russian raids took place in 1716 at Öregrund, while in July 1717 a Russian squadron landed troops at Gotland who raided for supplies. To place pressure on Sweden, Russia sent a large fleet to the Swedish east coast in July 1719. There, under protection of the Russian battlefleet, the Russian galley fleet was split into three groups. One group headed for the coast of Uppland, the second to the vicinity of Stockholm, and the last to coast of Södermanland. Together they carried a landing force of nearly 30,000 men. Raiding continued for a month and devastated amongst others the towns of Norrtälje, Södertälje, Nyköping and Norrköping, and almost all the buildings in the archipelago of Stockholm were burned. A smaller Russian force advanced on the Swedish capital but was stopped at the battle of Stäket on 13 August. Swedish and British fleets, now allied with Sweden, sailing from the west coast of Sweden but failed to catch the raiders. After treaty of Frederiksborg in early 1720, Sweden was no longer at war with Denmark, which allowed more forces to be placed against the Russians. This did not prevent Russian galleys from raiding the town of Umeå once again. Later in July 1720 a squadron from the Swedish battlefleet engaged the Russian galley fleet in the battle of Grengam. While the result of the battle is contested, it ended Russian galley raids in 1720. As negotiations for peace did not progress, the Russian galleys were once again sent to raid the Swedish coast in 1721, targeting primarily the Swedish coast between Gävle and Piteå.

But comets are not made of solid rocks like planets. A comet is a ball of dust, stones, and ice. Many people call comets dirty snowballs. The \\"snowball\\" may be only a few miles across. But when the sun heats the \\"snowball,\\" much of it is changed to gases. The gases spread out and form the comet's head, which may be thousands of miles across. A comet moves fast in its trip around the sun. But when we see it, the comet does not seem to move. That's because it is so far away. The moon moves fast, but when you look at it, you can't see any motion . That's because the moon is far away. Each year astronomers discover new comets. Some of them are seen only once. They make one trip around the sun and then go away out into space. The sun's gravity cannot hold them. Other comets, like Halley, keep returning. They have been captured by the sun. Halley's earliest visit was probably 3,000 years ago. It may keep returning for another 3,000 years. But every time a comet goes around the sun, the comet loses part of itself. Gases and dust are pulled out of the comet. That's why Halley is now dimmer than it used to be. Next time it visits us, in 2062, it may be even dimmer. Each visit it may get dimmer and dimmer, until it finally disappears. Now, provide a numbered list of answers to these questions: 1. What is a dirty snowball? 2. What is it composed of? 3.

Why do some comets only go around once? 8. What is Halley? 9. When was Halley first seen? 10. How long will it be around?","completion":"1. A dirty snowball is a colloquial term used to describe a comet because of its composition and appearance. It is a metaphorical way to represent the mixture of dust, stones, and ice found in a comet. 2. A dirty snowball (comet) is composed of dust, stones, and ice, with the majority of its composition being ice. The icy core, or nucleus, usually contains frozen water along with other frozen gases such as methane, ammonia, and carbon dioxide. 3. Dirty snowballs (comets) travel in elliptical orbits around the Sun from different regions of our solar system. They come from either the Kuiper Belt or the Oort Cloud, at the outer edges of the solar system, and move toward the Sun when disturbed by various forces. 4. Yes, other celestial bodies, such as planets, dwarf planets, asteroids, and meteoroids, also travel around the Sun. These objects orbit the Sun due to its gravitational influence on them. 5. Comets are different from other celestial bodies that travel around the Sun, primarily in their composition and origin. Unlike solid, rocky planets, comets are made up of ice, dust, and rocky materials. Additionally, comets originate from the outer edges of the solar system, whereas planets and other celestial bodies can be found closer to the Sun. 6. No, not all comets make just one trip around the Sun. Some comets have orbits that repeatedly bring them back near the Sun, while others may make a single pass before being ejected out of the solar system or disintegrating. 7. Some comets only go around the Sun once because they become gravitationally unbound from the solar system. This can occur if their orbits are influenced by the gravity of other celestial bodies or if they get too close to the Sun and disintegrate. 8. Halley is a well-known, short-period comet officially known as Halley's Comet. It is named after the English astronomer Edmond Halley, who first recognized that its recorded appearances at regular intervals were of the same comet. 9. Halley's Comet was first seen and recorded by Chinese astronomers in 240 BCE. Edmond Halley, however, used earlier observations of this comet to calculate and predict its return about 1700 years later, in 1758. 10. Halley's Comet is predicted to be around for several thousand more years as it continues to orbit the Sun. However, with each visit, the comet loses part of itself due to the Sun's heat, causing it to become dimmer.

I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: HIGH (Human Growth Hormone) could be the favorite drug at the next athletic world championships, and we might never know it. It is a natural substance produced by the human body, and it helps children's bones and muscles to grow. Scientists are allowed to make the drug and it is also legal to take HGH in most countries. HGH is considered a wonder drug for children. It helps many children with growth problems every year. However, some athletes are now taking the drug. HGH helps add muscle in adults and recent research by the World Anti-Doping Agency shows that HGH may improve the sportsman's time by 5% when he takes part in short, fast races. Some athletes say that HGH surely makes them stronger. It also helps them to recover more quickly from injuries. Although it is _ by most professional sports, HGH is almost impossible to test for. The drug is completely natural and it will only show in tests for around 24 hours after taking it. Testing is usually done only during competitions, but athletes use HGH during training, so it is very difficult to know who has used the drug. This makes it very attractive for some athletes. Scientists are developing a new test which will find the drug in the body for up to two weeks. But it isn't going to be easy. Everybody has different levels of natural HGH in their body. For this reason, scientists are warning athletes of the possible problems with the drug. Research shows that HGH increase the risk of cancer. But is this enough to stop athletes from taking it? Scientists don't think so. Some athletes will do all they can to win, and worry about their health later. Question: Besides making them stronger, why is taking HGH attractive for some athletes?

Answer the following question: This is a correct answer to the following question about Cluster sampling. Yes or no? Answer: Cluster sampling is a sampling technique used when \\"natural\\" but relatively homogeneous groupings are evident in a statistical population . Question: what is the difference between multistage and cluster sampling Answer:","completion":"Yes, your definition of cluster sampling is correct. Cluster sampling is a probability sampling technique where researchers divide the population into distinct, non-overlapping groups called \\"clusters\\" based on shared characteristics. These clusters are then randomly selected, and all members within each selected cluster are included in the sample. Cluster sampling is often used when the population is geographically dispersed or when no complete list of the population is available. Now, let's discuss the difference between multistage and cluster sampling: Multistage sampling is a more complex form of probability sampling that involves multiple stages of selection. It is an extension of cluster sampling, and it combines two or more sampling techniques, usually stratified and cluster sampling. In multistage sampling, the population is sequentially divided into smaller groups, which are then sampled at each stage. In contrast to cluster sampling, where all members within each selected cluster are included in the sample, multistage sampling involves selecting only a subset of members from each cluster in the later stages. This approach allows researchers to focus on specific segments of the population while reducing the time and costs associated with data collection. To summarize, the main difference between multistage and cluster sampling is as follows: 1. Cluster sampling involves dividing the population into distinct clusters and then randomly selecting some clusters for inclusion in the sample. All members within the selected clusters are included in the sample. 2. Multistage sampling is a more complex probability sampling technique that involves dividing the population into smaller groups at different stages and then selecting members based on certain criteria. It is an extension of cluster sampling and combines multiple sampling techniques. Overall, both methods are used to study large and geographically dispersed populations, but multistage sampling allows for more focused and efficient sampling due to the hierarchical selection process."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Hint: Sometimes muscles and tendons get injured when a person starts doing an activity before they have warmed up properly. A warm up is a slow increase in the intensity of a physical activity that prepares muscles for an activity. Warming up increases the blood flow to the muscles and increases the heart rate. Warmed-up muscles and tendons are less likely to get injured. For example, before running or playing soccer, a person might jog slowly to warm muscles and increase their heart rate. Even elite athletes need to warm up ( Figure below ).

In the end of the show the mayor of Buenos Aires Mauricio Macri gave the torch to the first torchbearer, Carlos Espínola. The leg finished at the Buenos Aires Riding Club in the Palermo district, the last torchbearer being Gabriela Sabatini. The 13.8 km route included landmarks like the obelisk and Plaza de Mayo. The day was marked by several pro-Tibet protests, which included a giant banner reading \\"Free Tibet\\", and an alternative \\"human rights torch\\" that was lit by protesters and paraded along the route the flame was to take. Most of these protests were peaceful in nature, and the torch was not impeded. Chinese immigrants also turned out in support of the Games, but only minor scuffles were reported between both groups. Runners surrounded by rows of security carried the Olympic flame past thousands of jubilant Argentines in the most trouble-free torch relay in nearly a week. People showered the parade route with confetti as banks, government offices and businesses took an impromptu half-day holiday for the only Latin American stop on the flame's five-continent journey.

Because lipids are very high in energy, eating too many may lead to unhealthy weight gain. A high-fat diet may also increase lipid levels in the blood. This, in turn, can increase the risk for health problems such as cardiovascular disease. The dietary lipids of most concern are saturated fatty acids, trans fats, and cholesterol. For example, cholesterol is the lipid mainly responsible for narrowing arteries and causing the disease atherosclerosis. Ben and Jerry were two friends with very different dietary habits. Jerry ate healthy food, and was always on top of his caloric consumption, while Ben overate because he loved fatty foods such as butter, bacon et al. Which friend had a higher blood lipid level? The answer is:","completion":"Ben likely had a higher blood lipid level. As the question suggests, a diet high in lipids, specifically saturated fatty acids, trans fats, and cholesterol, can increase lipid levels in the blood. It's mentioned that Ben overate and loved fatty foods such as butter and bacon, which are high in the aforementioned harmful lipids. On the other hand, Jerry’s habits of eating healthy food and monitoring his caloric intake would typically be associated with lower lipid levels in the blood.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Ciara Princess Harris was born in Austin, Texas, on October 25, 1985, the only child of Jackie and Carlton Clay Harris. An army brat, she grew up in Germany, New York, Utah, California, Arizona and Nevada. Ciara's parents are both African Americans. Ciara also has some Irish ancestry, from her mother's background. On December 5, 2006, Ciara released her second studio album, Ciara: The Evolution. According to the singer, the title of the album is \\"about so much more than just my personal growth - it's about the evolution of music, the evolution of dance, the evolution of fashion.\\" The source of the album's creativity such as the sound and edge comes from Ciara in general. Ciara: The Evolution became Ciara's first number one album on the U.S. Billboard 200 and second on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums charts with sales of more than 338,000 becoming her highest first week of sales to date. The album went on to be certified platinum by the RIAA in the United States, within only five weeks of its release, and has sold 1.3 million copies according to Nielsen SoundScan. It sold over two million copies worldwide. The album's international lead single, \\"Get Up\\", which features Chamillionaire, reached number seven in the United States and gained a platinum accreditation. It reached number five in New Zealand. The song was used for the film Step Up (2006) and featured on the film's soundtrack. The album's US lead single, \\"Promise\\", reached number eleven on the Billboard Hot 100 and became her third number one single on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. \\"Like a Boy\\" was released as the second international single which reached within the top twenty in the UK, Finland, France, Ireland, Sweden Switzerland, and also in the United States. The fourth and final single from the album, \\"Can't Leave 'em Alone\\", reached number 10 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart and number 40 on the Billboard Hot 100. The song became Ciara's fifth single to peak in the top in New Zealand, peaking at number 4. The song achieved moderate success in other international markets. In support of the album, Ciara went on her first headlining tour in October 2006. The tour went to seventeen different clubs in cities throughout the United States. The tour was met with mixed to positive reviews; critics were divided regarding the pre-recorded backing tracks and remarked that Ciara was slightly under-prepared to host her own headlining tour, but ultimately praised her energetic choreography. In August 2007, she headlined the Screamfest '07 tour with fellow rapper, T.I.. Critics praised her performance for her gracious dancing and being able to command a sold out arena. Ciara, along with Chris Brown and Akon, was a support act for Rihanna's Good Girl Gone Bad Tour in the United Kingdom. She made a guest appearance on \\"So What\\" by Field Mob. The single went on to become a top 10 hit on the Billboard Hot 100. She also appeared on Tiffany Evans' single \\"Promise Ring\\". The song achieved little success on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. In addition to her music, Ciara made her acting debut in the MTV Films production All You've Got in May 2006. In the movie she played Becca Whiley, a teenager who is competing in a volleyball tournament. The movie received mixed to positive reviews; critics said the movie was predictable but still enjoyable.

Write an article with the title: \\"Charlie Hebdo lives again with new issue\\" Article:","completion":"Title: Charlie Hebdo Lives Again with New Issue Introduction: (Step 1: Introduce the topic and provide background information about Charlie Hebdo's history.) Once the epicenter of a terrorist attack in 2015, French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo continues to defy fear and intimidation by releasing a new issue. Founded in 1970, the publication is famous for its provocative illustrations, sharp-witted humor, and unapologetic commitment to freedom of speech. This article explores the resurrection of Charlie Hebdo and the importance of supporting its steadfast presence in the face of adversity. Triumph over Tragedy: (Step 2: Discuss the attack on Charlie Hebdo and its aftermath.) On January 7, 2015, terrorists stormed the Charlie Hebdo headquarters in Paris, gunning down twelve staff members, including cartoonists and editors. Many around the world were shaken, mourning the loss of these lives while simultaneously struggling to understand the motivations behind such a violent act. The tragedy, fueled by the magazine’s history of controversial caricatures and satirical content, sent ripples throughout the media landscape. In the aftermath, support for Charlie Hebdo surged, not just for the victims, but for the magazine’s continual act of defiance against terror that sought to silence it. The surviving staff members vowed to continue their work, and millions of euros poured in from various sources to help rebuild the publication. New Issues, Unwavering Resolve: (Step 3: Introduce the new issue of Charlie Hebdo and its significance.) Today, Charlie Hebdo's return to the public eye with its new issue marks a powerful statement of perseverance through which the magazine adamantly refuses to be silenced. Featuring fresh satirical content and illustrations in the classic Charlie Hebdo style, the latest issue serves as a reminder that freedom of speech should be vigorously defended. This new beginning for Charlie Hebdo is not without challenges, however. Concerns have been raised over the safety and security of its staff, with many members living under police protection in undisclosed locations. However, this has not dampened their spirits or weakened their commitment to pushing boundaries through satire and humor. Global Importance of Free Speech: (Step 4: Address the importance of defending freedom of speech and artistic expression.) Charlie Hebdo's return also serves as a broader statement on the necessity of defending freedom of speech and artistic expression worldwide. In an era when political correctness and intolerance threaten open discourse, it is imperative that society preserves the rights of all individuals to express their views freely - even when those ideas may be offensive or controversial to some. As a triumph of courage and determination, Charlie Hebdo stands as a testament to the resilience of free speech. It is up to us all, as members of a global society, to foster an environment where every voice can be heard, even when that voice shakes the foundations of what we believe to be right and true. Conclusion: (Step 5: Summarize the article and reflect on the significance of Charlie Hebdo's resurgence.) In conclusion, the revival of Charlie Hebdo with a new issue is a testament to their unwavering commitment to free speech, even in the face of extreme adversity. Charlie Hebdo's ongoing presence is a bold reminder that fear cannot silence the human spirit, and their defiant return to the public eye serves as an inspiration for all who champion the freedom of expression."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Here's a question: Seeing someone open a gift after buying christmas presents causes what for the gift giver? Here are possible answers to this question: - stress - understand themselves - pleasure - sense of joy - debt I believe the correct choice is \\"pleasure\\", here's why: Answer:","completion":"Pleasure. Step 1: Analyze the possible answers In this situation, we have to consider all the given options and understand their relevance to the context of the question. The options are: stress, understand themselves, pleasure, sense of joy, and debt. Step 2: Identify the emotions and conditions associated with gift giving We should consider the emotions and conditions commonly associated with gift giving, especially during Christmas. Generally, gift-giving is intended to express love, appreciation, or kindness. The act usually results in positive emotions for both the giver and the recipient. Step 3: Rule out irrelevant options We can rule out \\"stress\\" and \\"debt\\" as these options represent negative emotions or conditions that do not align with the positive emotions typically associated with gift-giving. Although gift purchases may at times lead to financial stress or debt, the act of seeing someone open a gift should result in positive emotions that overshadow these negative aspects. Step 4: Compare remaining options Now we are left with the options: \\"understand themselves\\", \\"pleasure\\", and \\"sense of joy\\". Although understanding one's self is important, it is not directly related to the experience of seeing someone open a gift. Hence, we can rule out this option. Step 5: Choose the most appropriate answer Between \\"pleasure\\" and \\"sense of joy\\", the most suitable choice is \\"pleasure\\" because it is a general term that encompasses the positive emotions experienced by the gift giver when seeing someone open the gift they have purchased. Joy can be a specific form of pleasure, but \\"pleasure\\" is a more inclusive term that best captures the wide range of positive feelings a gift giver may experience upon seeing the recipient open their gift. Therefore, the correct choice in this context is \\"pleasure,\\" as it represents the overarching positive emotions experienced by the gift giver when they witness the recipient opening their Christmas present."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Q: What type of molecules sit within a membrane and contain an aqueous channel that spans the membrane’s hydrophobic region? Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers: you could prove that movements are occurring even in the absence of a gradient. In a similar manner, there are analogous carrier systems that move hydrophobic molecules through water. Channel molecules sit within a membrane and contain an aqueous channel that spans the membrane’s hydrophobic region. Hydrophilic molecules of particular sizes and shapes can pass through this aqueous channel and their movement involves a significantly lower activation energy than would be associated with moving through the lipid part of the membrane in the absence of the channel. Channels are generally highly selective in terms of which particles will pass through them. For example, there are channels in which 10,000 potassium ions will pass through for every one sodium ion. Often the properties of these channels can be regulated; they can exist in two or more distinct structural states. For example, in one state the channel can be open and allow particles to pass through or it can be closed, that is the channel can be turned on and off. Channels cannot, however, determine in which direction an ion will move - that is determined by the ion gradient across the membrane. The transition between open and closed states can be regulated through a number of processes, including the reversible binding of small molecules to the protein and various other molecular changes (which we will consider when we talk about proteins). Another method of channel control depends on the fact that channel proteins are i) embedded within a membrane and ii) contain charged groups. As we will see cells can (and generally do) generate ion gradients, that, is a separation of charged species across their membranes. For example if the concentration of K+ ions is higher on one side of the membrane, there will be an ion gradient where the natural tendency is for the ions to move to the region of lower K+ concentration.222 The ion gradient in turn can produce an electrical field across the plasma membrane. As these fields change, they can produce (induce) changes... Choices: - osmotic fluid - microorganisms - mole - channel A: Answer:","completion":"Channel"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

When the 22-year-old entered college in 2009, he decided not to change his rural residence to a students' collective one. But when he finished college and was offered a job with a state-owned enterprise in Beijing, Sun was told that he couldn't accept the offer unless he had an urban hukou (household registration record). This time, he had no choice but to change his residence status. Transferring hukou to a university became optional in 2003, and many students are confronted with the dilemma of whether to do so or not. Professionals suggest they make the decision based on their current situation and future plans. 'I regret transferring my hukou' Wang Jinbi, 20, is an accounting major at Beijing Union University. Coming from Chifeng, Inner Mongolia autonomous region, she transferred her hukou when she enrolled at university. \\"I didn't think it was a big deal,\\" Wang says. \\"Since I'm registering under an urban hukou, it doesn't matter whether it's in Beijing or Inner Mongolia, I thought.\\" What Wang didn't expect, however, is that she would regret her decision later. \\"After two years of study, I've figured out my future plans.

That means Wang needs to transfer her hukou back again, which she worries will be a troublesome procedure. \\"I have a friend who graduated last year. She spent a lot of time and energy transferring her hukou back to her hometown again due to complicated paperworks,\\" says Wang. Guidelines for transferring hukou Wang's experience is not uncommon. Many students don't know what their decision means for their future.

Kounavia is a magical land with lots of colors, fun games, and friendly people. To get to Kounavia, the traveler had to go through several other exciting places along the way. Picture it like going from your house to the playground, but with many stops in between to see other cool things. First, the traveler started in his hometown, which was a cozy place filled with people he loved, just like your home with your family. He waved goodbye and began his journey. Second, the traveler went through the Forest of Whispers, a place filled with tall trees and colorful birds that could talk! Imagine if trees and birds could chat with you while walking to the park. That is what it was like for our traveler in the Forest of Whispers. Next, the traveler reached Crystal River, a big, shiny river made of crystal-clear water. He crossed it using a magical boat. Picture a sparkly river full of fish jumping and playing, so clear that you can see each and every rock on the bottom. After crossing the river, the traveler arrived at Rainbow Bridge. Just like the name says, it was a long bridge in all the colors of the rainbow! The traveler walked across it, watching the pretty colors under his shoes. It was like walking on a rainbow slide that took him to the other side. The last place the traveler visited before Kounavia was the Village of Smiles. This was a small, cute village filled with people always smiling and having fun. They shared ice cream and played games together, like you would do at a birthday party with your friends. Finally, the traveler reached Kounavia after his amazing journey. Kounavia was even more magical and beautiful than he could have ever imagined. It was a place where wishes came true, and everyone was happy and friendly. And that, dear friend, is the story of the traveler's journey to Kounavia.

Write down the solution for this math problem: Solve 119*a - 21407 = -238*a - 8012 + 21948 for a.","completion":"Alright, let's solve the math problem step by step. We need to find the value of 'a' in the equation 119*a - 21407 = -238*a - 8012 + 21948. 1. First, we combine the numbers on the right side to make it simpler: -8012 + 21948 = 13936 So now our equation is: 119*a - 21407 = -238*a + 13936 2. Now, we want to get all the 'a' terms on one side and the numbers on the other side. Let's move -238*a to the left side by adding 238*a to both sides: 119*a + 238*a - 21407 = 13936 3. Combine the 'a' terms on the left side: 357*a - 21407 = 13936 4. Now, let's move -21407 to the right side by adding 21407 to both sides: 357*a = 13936 + 21407 5. Combine the numbers on the right side: 357*a = 35343 6. Lastly, to find the value of 'a', divide both sides by 357: a = 35343 / 357 7.

Write a text based on this summary: key regulators urge broad oversight of derivatives Text:","completion":"Title: Key Regulators Call for Expanded Oversight of Derivatives Market In a recent development, key financial regulators have come together to advocate for broader oversight and monitoring of the derivatives market. These regulators, identifying the growing complexity and significance of the derivatives industry, believe that a more comprehensive approach is necessary to mitigate the risks associated with these financial instruments and maintain the stability of the global economy. The derivatives market, which includes options, futures, swaps, and other complex financial products linked to underlying assets, has expanded rapidly in recent years due to increasing demand from investors seeking alternative ways to manage risk and enhance returns. However, this growth has also led to concerns over the potential for systemic risk, market manipulation, and irresponsible trading practices that could threaten financial stability. In response to these concerns, the key regulators propose a multi-faceted plan to enhance oversight and supervision of the derivatives market. The plan features a series of steps aimed at bolstering the existing regulatory framework, including: 1. Strengthening the reporting requirements: By imposing stricter reporting standards for derivative transactions, regulators will have better access to critical information, thus allowing them to more effectively monitor market activities and identify potential breaches of regulatory rules. 2. Implementing centralized clearing: The introduction of central counterparties (CCPs) will significantly reduce counterparty risk by acting as an intermediary between buyers and sellers, ensuring that both parties fulfill their obligations. 3. Enhancing margin requirements: Increased margin requirements will act as a safety net, encouraging market participants to maintain sufficient collateral to cover potential losses and promote responsible trading practices. 4. Promoting transparency: Increasing the availability of information on derivatives trading activities to the public will help to build trust in the market and discourage potential manipulative practices. 5. Encouraging international cooperation: By working together with global regulatory bodies, the key regulators aim to create a more consistent and harmonized approach to the supervision of the derivatives market across different jurisdictions. The key regulators' call for broad oversight of derivatives signifies their recognition of the importance of this market in the global financial landscape. By implementing these measures, they hope to strike a balance between facilitating innovation and investment and protecting the financial system from potential pitfalls associated with growing complexity. In conclusion, the proposed enhancements to the existing regulatory framework underscore the commitment of key regulators to ensuring the stability and integrity of the derivatives market. By taking a proactive approach to address emerging risks and fostering international cooperation, the regulators aim to bolster financial stability and promote confidence in the global economy."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: This article: Young filmmaker Stevie Horowitz eagerly awaits a meeting with big shot Hollywood film producer J.P.

It is revealed to be owned by a scientist named Dr. Bradford Crane (Michael Caine), the only survivor of the attack.

The teenaged son manages to escape in a Mustang, although he is also stung, and crashes into the Maryville town square, where the citizens are preparing for the annual flower festival. The boy is brought into the hands of military personnel, where he hallucinates a vision of giant bees attacking him, due to the aftereffects of the bee sting. Dr. Walter Krim (Henry Fonda) confirms to Crane that the very war they have feared for a long time has started against the bees. At the gates of the base, Slater must confront angry country bumpkin Jed Hawkins (Slim Pickens) who demands to see the dead body of his son, who was killed by the bees. Hawkins takes the body bag and departs, leaving the entire watching crowd silent over the loss.

In fact, several people on the ground or at sea claimed they saw Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 before it went missing after its post-midnight takeoff from Kuala Lumpur on March 8. The purported eyewitnesses include fishermen, an oil rig worker and islanders in an atoll. Some even alleged they saw it crash. While none of their claims have been substantiated, their assertions add to the ongoing mystery of the missing Boeing 777 and the 239 people aboard. Sighting claim: Kota Bharu, Malaysia. In the middle of the night, two fishermen near the Malaysia-Thailand border saw a plane flying low over the South China Sea -- at the same time that air traffic controllers lost contact with Flight 370 over the same body of water, at 1:30 a.m. or almost 50 minutes after takeoff. Fisherman Azid Ibrahim and a friend had taken people fishing that night off the coast of Kota Bharu. \\"I was fishing when I saw the plane -- it looked strange. Flying low. I told my friend that's not normal. Normally, it flies at 35,000 feet. But that night it touched the clouds. I thought the pilot must be crazy,\\" Ibrahim said. \\"It was really low. I saw the lights they looked like the size of a coconut,\\" he said. Their fishing grounds lay under a flight path, but the predawn plane was unusual to see because of its low altitude, they said. The fishermen filed a police report about their sighting, but Malaysian officials haven't commented. Location, weather may hamper search. Sighting claim: Oil rig off Vietnam. A New Zealand man working on an oil rig off Vietnam claimed he saw a burning object in the sky Saturday morning, hours after the plane had taken off. Mike McKay of New Zealand was stationed on the Sona-Mercur oil rig on seas about 186 miles southeast of Vung Tau, a coastal Vietnamese town outside Ho Chi Minh City, according to CNN affiliate Radio New Zealand. McKay wrote of his sighting in an e-mail, the news outlet said. \\"Gentlemen. I believe I saw the Malaysian Airlines flight come down. The timing is right. I tried to contact Malaysian and Vietnamese officials several days ago. But I do not know if the message has been received,\\" he wrote last week. \\"I observed the plane burning at high altitude at a compass bearing of 265 to 275 degrees from our surface location. \\"While I observed (the plane) it appeared to be in one piece. From when I first saw the burning (plane?) until the flames went out (at high altitude) was 10-15 seconds. There was no lateral movement so it was either coming toward our position stationary (falling) or going away from our location. The general position of the observation was perpendicular/south-west of the normal flight path and at a lower altitude than the normal flight paths,\\" he wrote. In fact, Vietnamese authorities dispatched aircraft last week to search for the plane, in response to McKay's report, the affiliate reported. When the Vietnamese navy sent a plane to conduct a search, it found nothing, ABC News reported. Vietnamese naval officer Le Minh Thanh told that network that the plane investigated the area cited by McKay, but the search came up empty. New theories about what happened to missing flight. Sighting claim: Maldives atoll. On a remote island in the Maldives, residents claimed they saw a \\"low flying jumbo jet\\" the same morning that the Malaysia plane disappeared, according to the website of the Maldivian news outlet Haveeru. Residents on the isle of Kuda Huvadhoo in the Dhaalu Atoll gave a description that matched the commercial airliners: white with red stripes, according to the news outlet. \\"I've never seen a jet flying so low over our island before. We've seen seaplanes, but I'm sure that this was not one of those. I could even make out the doors on the plane clearly,\\" an unidentified eyewitness said, according to Haveeru. \\"It's not just me either, several other residents have reported seeing the exact same thing.

The Maldives coast guard told CNN it had no reports of such sightings and had not even been requested to conduct a search. The acting Malaysian transport minister also declared the reports false. \\"I can confirm that the Malaysian Chief of the Defense Force has contacted his counterpart in the Maldives, who has confirmed that these reports are not true,\\" Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said at a press conference. The Maldives Ministry of Defense and National Security also confirmed that their radar systems and surveillance mechanisms show no indication of the missing plane. Sighting claim: Off Indonesia coast. Indonesian fishermen claim they saw an airplane crash around the Strait of Malacca on the morning of March 9 -- more than a full day after the Malaysian plane took off -- the Indonesian state news agency Antara reported late Monday. The strait lies between Indonesia and Malaysia. The Indonesia fishermen, based in the North Sumatra provincial subdistrict of Pangkalan Susu, went to sea for a week of fishing on March 9, a Sunday. At 11 a.m., they saw a plane crash, Antara reported. \\"We saw an airplane crash around the Malacca Straits,\\" a fisherman identified as Hendra said, according to Antara. The fishermen saw a white plane crossing and circling, Antara reported. Smoke came from the plane's right rear portion when it circled for a second round and tilted to the left, the agency said. Flying lower, the plane then fell from sight. \\"We suspect the plane crashed into the sea,\\" Hendra said, according to Antara. \\"We could not go to the location where the aircraft was lost due to large waves, and the boat did not have enough fuel.\\" The aircraft is believed to have crashed in waters off the Aceh provincial district of East Aceh. But there are two problems with these fishermen's account. They spotted the plane more than 24 hours after it took off from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. And Indonesian military officials said their radar didn't spot Flight 370. The Jakarta Post reported that Indonesian air force spokesman Air Commodore Hadi Tjahjanto said the Air Force's radar in Lhokseumawe, Aceh, didn't detect the missing flight in the area that the Malaysian military suggested was the plane's last detected position, around Penang waters. \\"Our radar information has been shared with our Malaysian counterparts,\\" the air force spokesman added, according to the Jakarta Post.

While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Please answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: When a solid substance is involved in a chemical reaction, only the matter at the surface of the solid is exposed to other reactants. If a solid has more surface area, more of it is exposed and able to react. Therefore, increasing the surface area of solid reactants increases the reaction rate. Look at the hammer and nails pictured in the Figure below . Both are made of iron and will rust when the iron combines with oxygen in the air. However, the nails have a greater surface area, so they will rust faster. I am facing a new situation today: Andy is participating in this years science fair. He is testing how fast metal takes to rust. He rakes 3 pieces of iron one is a cube, and the other is a sheet both weighing the same. It takes the cube almost a week to fully rust but the sheet only takes 2 days. The only difference between the two is that the sheet has more surface area. He tries this again with a cylinder so the surface area is larger than the cube but smaller than the sheet and it takes about 4 days to fully rust. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which will rust faster given they contain the same amount of iron, a sheet or a cylinder? Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided in the background article and the new situation, we can follow these steps to answer the question: 1. Acknowledge that increasing the surface area of a solid substance involved in a chemical reaction increases the reaction rate. 2. Recall the background article's example of nails rusting faster than a hammer due to a higher surface area. 3. Consider the new situation with Andy's science fair experiment involving three pieces of iron: a cube, a sheet, and a cylinder. The rusting times observed were as follows: - Cube: 1 week - Sheet: 2 days - Cylinder: 4 days 4. Notice that the rusting time decreases as the surface area of the iron pieces increases. 5. Evaluate the given question: \\"Which will rust faster, given they contain the same amount of iron, a sheet or a cylinder?\\" From these steps, we can conclude that the sheet, having a larger surface area than the cylinder, will rust faster. The background article and Andy's experiment support this conclusion, as both demonstrate a correlation between increased surface area and increased reaction rate."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Former sheet metal worker Mr Warren-Madden, 60, came up with the plan around seven years ago. An inventive pet owner has created the world's goldfish walking device, after worrying that his fish was becoming bored. Mike Warren-Madden spent thousands of hours designing his unique 'Aquatic Perambulator' as a way to help pet fish Malcolm have a more exciting life. Sadly, his beloved goldfish has since died, but he lived to the grand old age of 11, thanks Mr Warren-Madden says, to his adventurous lifestyle - which included trips to the pub and walks around town. Sadly, his beloved goldfish has since died. But the fish lived to the grand old age of 11 thanks, Mr Warren-Madden says, to his adventurous lifestyle - which included trips to the pub and walks around town. Despite Malcolm passing away he hopes his pioneering legacy will now see an entrepreneur come forward to invest in the invention. Mr Warren-Madden, from Holmfirth, West Yorkshire, said: 'We had some right looks around town, we stopped traffic, but everyone has got into it now. It's not every day you see someone taking a fish for a walk. 'If a fish is in a bowl on a shelf swimming in circles it must get bored. I decided it would be fun to take it out with me down the pub.

It's not every day you see someone taking a fish for a walk' The contraption even allows fish owners to share a drink at the local with their pet, as Mr Warren-Madden enjoyed to do with the late Malcolm. He said: 'If a fish is in a bowl on a shelf swimming in circles it must get bored. I decided it would be fun to take it out with me down the pub' 'Malcolm lived to almost 12-years-old, I think he was getting something out of it.' The Aquatic Perambulator - which is now a Mark III - stands around four-foot tall and is made from laser-cut mild steel. Mr Warren-Madden, who lives with wife Shirley, 58, said: 'My wife has learned to live with me, I have been tinkering around with this idea for around seven years. 'With the first designs I didn't take into account how heavy water is so I have modified it over the years. 'I've added better elastic to take the shock out of the water and I hope to get better wheels. 'Because of my background as a sheet metal worker I have been able to build this at little cost - but for someone else it would cost hundreds to make.

While the user initially loved various aspects of the Dyson Animal, such as its ease of handling, cleaning capabilities, and it being bagless, they became disappointed and dissatisfied when the vacuum cleaner started making a horrible noise after only 6-10 uses. Upon discovering that the issue was the result of premature wear on the plastic gears, the user became even more disheartened and angry, given the high price of the product. The user also questions the manufacture location, speculating that it might be made in China and assuming that this could be the reason behind the vacuum's poor durability.

Anthony's box is stocked with traditional toys--board games, puzzles, art supplies--and as far as he is concerned, they are relics of Christmases past. His sister Michaely, 6 years old, still likes dressing her Barbies. But once she starts playing Game Boy, it's hard to get her away. Play patterns like this could take up another Christmas for the toy department. Through September, toy sales were down 5% compared with the first nine months of last year, according to the NDP Group. Meanwhile, the video-game industry is heading for another record year. Thanks to hot new games like Halo 2 for the Xbox, the industry is light-years ahead of the toy business when it comes out. While some new toys emerge every holiday season, toymakers are heading into this one without a monster hit . Indeed, there has not been a Furby-style frenzy in years. Of 10 toy segments only two, arts and crafts and dolls, have generated sales growth over a recent 12-month period. Some of the weakest categories like construction sets and action figures are the ones aimed at boys, who suffer the most from the video games. Analysts expect one of the top stocking stuffers this season to be not a traditional toy but the new generation of Nintendo's Game Boy, the DS, which hit stores last week. The deeper issue is that shifts in play patterns are forcing toymakers to fight for shelf space in a tightening market. Boys in particular seem to be abandoning traditional toys at earlier ages in favor of consumer electronics, video games, PC software and the Internet. The fact that kids are growing more tech-savvy , a trend called \\"age compression \\", has troubled toy companies for at least a decade.

As his car slid downtown on Tuesday morning the mind of Arnold Thorndike was occupied with such details of daily routine as the purchase of a railroad, the Japanese loan, the new wing to his art gallery, and an attack that morning, in his own newspaper, upon his pet trust. But his busy mind was not too occupied to return the salutes of the traffic policemen who cleared the way for him. Or, by some genius of memory, to recall the fact that it was on this morning young Spear was to be sentenced for theft. It was a charming morning. The spring was at full tide, and the air was sweet and clean. Mr. Thorndike considered whimsically that to send a man to jail with the memory of such a morning clinging to him was adding a year to his sentence. He regretted he had not given the probation officer a stronger letter. He remembered the young man now, and favorably. A shy, silent youth, deft in work, and at other times conscious and embarrassed. But that, on the part of a stenographer, in the presence of the Wisest Man in Wall Street, was not unnatural. On occasions, Mr. Thorndike had put even royalty— frayed, impecunious royalty, on the lookout for a loan—at its ease. The hood of the car was down, and the taste of the air, warmed by the sun, was grateful. It was at this time, a year before, that young Spear picked the spring flowers to take to his mother. A year from now where would young Spear be? It was characteristic of the great man to act quickly, so quickly that his friends declared he was a slave to impulse.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer the following question: You are given a new situation: Gill and Ann were two fellow botanists. Gill studied alpine tundras extensively, while Ann studied tropical forests. They both discovered very interesting facts about nature and plants. and a hint : Alpine tundra occurs at high enough altitude at any latitude. Portions of montane grasslands and shrublands ecoregions worldwide include alpine tundra. Large regions of alpine tundra occur in the North American Cordillera, the Alps and Pyrenees of Europe, the Himalaya and Karakoram of Asia, the Andes of South America, and the Eastern Rift mountains of Africa.Alpine tundra occupies high-mountain summits, slopes, and ridges above timberline. Aspect plays a role as well; the treeline often occurs at higher elevations on warmer equator-facing slopes. Because the alpine zone is present only on mountains, much of the landscape is rugged and broken, with rocky, snowcapped peaks, cliffs, and talus slopes, but also contains areas of gently rolling to almost flat topography.Averaging over many locations and local microclimates, the treeline rises 75 metres (245 ft) when moving 1 degree south from 70 to 50°N, and 130 metres (430 ft) per degree from 50 to 30°N. Between 30°N and 20°S, the treeline is roughly constant, between 3,500 and 4,000 metres (11,500 and 13,100 ft). Please answer this question : Which person learned less about shrublands ecoregions? Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided, it would appear that Ann learned less about shrublands ecoregions compared to Gill. Ann primarily studied tropical forests, which are typically characterized by a dense and diverse accumulation of plant species, including trees, shrubs, and ground flora in warm regions, usually near the Equator. These environments are distinct from shrublands, which are characterized by sparse, low-growing shrubs, grasses, and herbaceous plants. On the other hand, Gill studied alpine tundras extensively. Alpine tundras occur at high altitudes, often above the treeline, where ecological conditions are unfavorable for the establishment of tall trees. Portions of montane grasslands and shrublands ecoregions worldwide, as mentioned, include alpine tundra. In studying alpine tundras, Gill would likely have encountered and learned about the shrublands ecoregions within these areas. Therefore, due to Ann's focus on tropical forests and Gill's study of alpine tundras, which overlap with shrublands ecoregions, it can be concluded that Ann learned less about shrublands ecoregions than Gill."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It was really surprising how good this one turned out to be. It actually has a story, and it is very romantic indeed. What makes 'Yellow Emanuelle' so good is it's leading heroine, the beautiful and exotic Chai Lee. She plays her character, Emy Wong so sweetly, that the viewer just has to feel something for her when her dreams crash down around her. Emy Wong is a much-respected doctor, statuesque, with a regal quality. She comes from an important old family, where ancient customs are still practiced. Emy will remain a virgin until she is married, to a man she has never met. The beautiful doctor seems OK with this arranged marriage. It is simply how it is done in her world. However she does not plan on meeting and falling in love with the British pilot who ends up under her care in the hospital where she works. Emy decides to do away with custom, and she gives herself to her Western man. But only after a very long courtship, as Doctor Wong is anything but an easy woman. Her pilot, George, is a good guy, and promises to marry Emy, so that she doesn't lose her respectability and place in her rigid society. Neither one counts on a third party, one Ilona Staller, who destroys their relationship through a series of vicious games. Emy is made to believe that she has been abandoned by her man, that he only played a game with her in order to sleep with her. Her place in society is gone, she has been debased. The film takes a surprisingly dramatic and depressing turn as this proud, elegant woman gives up her career, as well as a sweet relationship with her caring father, and succumbs to a life of drinking and prostitution. I was surprised to find myself so engrossed in this operatically tragic tale. I was on the edge of my seat when George blows back into town, and unknowingly walks into a hotel where his beautiful Emy is working as a prostitute! Classic drama. I imagine many viewers were a bit frustrated by all this drama. One would expect lots of sex and nudity here, but there is not much. And when there is, it is totally non-exploitative, and very artsy and soft-core. If you are a fan of the first Emmanuelle, with Sylvia Kristel, than you most likely will appreciate this, lesser known classic. I was especially impressed by the extra attention to details. The whole segment where Emy takes George to her fathers house on the island is really nice. Her father shows George, and the viewer his impressive collection of Bonzai trees. He has a whole miniature forest built out of these amazing trees. Totally unexpected. After catching it on late night cable TV years ago, I spent much time searching the internet for a copy of the film. When i finally got it i found that the video version was longer. More sex? No, more melodrama. For the DVD release there is a subplot about George suddenly keeling over with some unknown deadly disease! I actually preferred the cable version better. I am glad that this rare gem has been released finally on DVD. I must also mention the beautiful cinematography and the bizarre and catchy 70's soundtrack.

Intrigued by the idea, the two help Doofenshmirtz rebuild the machine, while Perry arrives on his mission to stop Doofenshmirtz. Unwilling to give away his secret identity to the boys (which would get him relocated to another family), Perry reverts to his pet mode and is forced to watch them help Doofenshmirtz activate his invention. The group is transported to an alternate dimension where a second, truly intelligent and evil Doofenshmirtz rules over his Tri-State Area. The second Perry (known as Platyborg), was converted into an evil cyborg by Doofenshimrtz-2 and programmed to serve as his second-in-command and general of his army of Norm-Bots. When the boys arrive with Perry to Doofenshmirtz-2's office, Doof-2 recognizes Perry as a secret agent and orders Platyborg to attack Perry. When that doesn't affect him, Doofenshmirtz-2 orders Platyborg to attack the boys next, which forces Perry to reveal his secret identity to stop Platyborg from doing so, much to the others' shock. Doofenshmirtz-2 then sends several of his Norm Bots to catch Perry and the boys, but the trio escapes.

The only way to recreate the input data from an ideal cryptographic hash function's output is to attempt a brute-force search of possible inputs to see if they produce a match. Bruce Schneier has called one-way hash functions \\"the workhorses of modern cryptography\\". The input data is often called the \\"message\\", and the output (the \\"hash value\\" or \\"hash\\") is often called the \\"message digest\\" or simply the \\"digest\\". - NOEKEON is a family of two block ciphers designed by Joan Daemen, Michaël Peeters, Gilles Van Assche and Vincent Rijmen and submitted to the NESSIE project in September 2000. The two ciphers are \\"direct mode\\" NOEKEON, to be used for maximum efficiency where related-key attacks are not possible, and \\"indirect mode\\" NOEKEON where they are. - The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), also known by its original name Rijndael, is a specification for the encryption of electronic data established by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in 2001. - ECRYPT (European Network of Excellence in Cryptology) was a 4-year European research initiative launched on 1 February 2004 with the stated objective of promoting the collaboration of European researchers in information security, and especially in cryptology and digital watermarking. - The Computer Security and Industrial Cryptography research group , commonly called COSIC , is a research group at the Department of Electrical Engineering of the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven , which is headed by Professor Bart Preneel , Vincent Rijmen , and Professor Ingrid Verbauwhede . The goal of COSIC 's research activities is to create a secure electronic equivalent for interactions in the physical world such as confidentiality , signatures , identification , anonymity , payment and elections . The research concentrates on the design , evaluation , and implementation of cryptographic algorithms and protocols , on the development of security architectures for information and communication systems and on the development of security mechanisms for embedded systems . COSIC 's theoretical work is mainly based on discrete mathematics such as number theory , finite fields , Boolean algebra , but also includes statistics and optimization . The aim is to achieve efficient and secure solutions . The broader goal is to achieve efficient and secure multi-party computation . These mathematical tools are applied to increase our understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of cryptographic algorithms and to develop new and better algorithms such as block ciphers , stream ciphers , public - key encryption algorithms and zero - knowledge identification protocols . One of the well - known successes is the selection of Rijndael as the Advanced Encryption Standard ( AES ) . Currently AES is used by millions of users in more than thousand products , such as the protection of US government information . COSIC is also coordinating ECRYPT , a European - wide Network of Excellence in the area of cryptology and watermarking . - The International Association for Cryptologic Research (IACR) is a non-profit scientific organization whose purpose is to further research in cryptology and related fields. The IACR was organised at the initiative of David Chaum at the CRYPTO '82 conference. - In cryptography, SHARK is a block cipher identified as one of the predecessors of Rijndael (the Advanced Encryption Standard). - Bart Preneel (born October 15, 1963) is a Flemish cryptographer and cryptanalyst. He is a professor at Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, in the COSIC group. He was the president of the International Association for Cryptologic Research in 2008-2013 and project manager of ECRYPT. - A whirlpool is a body of swirling water produced by the meeting of opposing currents. The vast majority of whirlpools are not very powerful and very small whirlpools can easily be seen when a bath or a sink is draining. More powerful ones in seas or oceans may be termed maelstroms. \\"Vortex\\" is the proper term for any whirlpool that has a downdraft.

Question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person whose preliminary work came to a halt in April 1948? In 1947, Walton was presented with the Royal Philharmonic Society's Gold Medal. In the same year he accepted an invitation from the BBC to compose his first opera. He decided to base it on Chaucer's Troilus and Criseyde, but his preliminary work came to a halt in April 1948 when Alice Wimborne died. To take Walton's mind off his grief, the music publisher Leslie Boosey persuaded him to be a British delegate to a conference on copyright in Buenos Aires later that year. While there, Walton met Susana Gil Passo (1926–2010), daughter of an Argentine lawyer. At 22 she was 24 years younger than Walton (Alice Wimborne had been 22 years his senior), and at first she ridiculed his romantic interest in her. He persisted, and she eventually accepted his proposal of marriage. The wedding was held in Buenos Aires in December 1948. From the start of their marriage, the couple spent half the year on the Italian island of Ischia, and by the mid-1950s they lived there permanently.Walton's last work of the 1940s was his music for Olivier's film of Hamlet (1948). After that, he focused his attentions on his opera Troilus and Cressida. On the advice of the BBC, he invited Christopher Hassall to write the libretto. This did not help Walton's relations with the Sitwells, each of whom thought he or she should have been asked to be his librettist. Work continued slowly over the next few years, with many breaks while Walton turned to other things. In 1950 he and Heifetz recorded the Violin Concerto for EMI. In 1951 Walton was knighted. In the same year, he prepared an authorised version of Façade, which had undergone many revisions since its premiere. In 1953, following the accession of Elizabeth II he was again called on to write a coronation march, Orb and Sceptre; he was also commissioned to write a choral setting of the Te Deum for the occasion.Troilus and Cressida was presented at Covent Garden on 3 December 1954. Its preparation was dogged by misfortunes. Olivier, originally scheduled to direct it, backed out, as did Henry...

The country geographically comprises two main landmassesthat of the North Island, or Te Ika-a-Mui, and the South Island, or Te Waipounamuand numerous smaller islands. New Zealand is situated some east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and roughly south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its long period of isolation, New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal, fungal and plant life. The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's capital city is Wellington, while its most populous city is Auckland. - Lieutenant Commander Denis James Matthews Glover DSC (9 December 19129 August 1980) was a New Zealand poet and publisher. What is the relationship between 'caxton press ' and 'publisher'? The answer to this question is:","completion":"The relationship between 'Caxton Press' and 'publisher' lies in the fact that Caxton Press is a printing and publishing company itself. Founded in 1935 by Denis Glover and John Drew, Caxton Press holds the responsibility of publishing and printing the works of various authors and poets. In this context, 'publisher' refers to an individual or company that prepares, prints, and issues books, journals, magazines, or other literary content for public distribution and sale. Caxton Press has played a significant role in New Zealand's literary scene by promoting and publishing numerous works of esteemed poets and authors, including Janet Frame, Denis Glover, Ursula Bethell, R.A.K.

Here is the text with spaces added between the words: \\"Both her PPP and Nawaz Sharif's Pakistan Muslim League (PML-N) were run as dynasties.\\" The text discusses two political parties in Pakistan: the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) and the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N). The PPP is a center-left, social-democratic political party, founded in 1967 by Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. Since then, the party has been led by members of the Bhutto family, including Benazir Bhutto, who became the first female Prime Minister of Pakistan. The PPP has historically been associated with populist, socialist, and progressive policies. On the other hand, the PML-N is a center-right, conservative political party in Pakistan. Founded by Nawaz Sharif in 1993 as a faction of the original Pakistan Muslim League, the party has been associated with capitalist, pro-business policies, as well as asserting a strong nationalistic stance. Much like PPP, the PML-N has also functioned as a family-run political dynasty, with the Sharif family dominating the party's leadership. Both the PPP and PML-N have influenced Pakistani politics significantly and have been characterized as family-run political dynasties. These dynasties often have a strong influence in their respective parties and can shape policies and political discourse.

Background: De La Soul is an American hip hop trio formed in 1987 on Long Island, New York. The group is best known for their eclectic sampling, quirky lyrics, and their contributions to the evolution of the jazz rap and alternative hip hop subgenres. The members are Posdnuos, Trugoy the Dove and Maseo. The three formed the group in high school and caught the attention of producer Prince Paul with a demo tape of the song \\"Plug Tunin'\\". Context: De La Soul's debut album, 3 Feet High and Rising, released in 1989, was a critical smash hit in the hip hop genre. They quickly became prominent members of the Native Tongues Posse along with A Tribe Called Quest, Black Sheep, Queen Latifah, the Jungle Brothers and others. The single \\"Me Myself and I\\" became a huge hit, further cementing the group's popularity. However, the sixties pop group The Turtles sued De La Soul for using a sample from their 1969 hit \\"You Showed Me\\" for the interlude track \\"Transmitting Live from Mars\\", despite the fact that The Turtles did not actually write the original song. Lyrically, much of 3 Feet High and Rising focused on striving for peace and harmony. 3 Feet High and Rising also introduced De La Soul's concept of the \\"D.A.I.S.Y. Age\\" (an acronym standing for \\"da inner sound, y'all\\"). As a result, audiences were quick to peg the members of De La Soul as hippies. This stereotype greatly agitated the group's members, as they always envisioned their career as a constantly changing style; this frustration would influence their next recording sessions. In the press kit for 3 Feet High and Rising, the members explained their stage names: Trugoy when reversed spells yogurt, because he likes yogurt, and Posdnuos spelled backwards is \\"sound sop\\". The album artwork was designed by radical British artist collective the Grey Organisation De La Soul's second album, De La Soul Is Dead (1991) was a much more mature album. It featured a wealth of material that criticized the violent, careless direction that hip hop was heading in at the time, though it still managed to maintain a light, absurd sense of humor. The cover of the album features a broken daisy flower pot, symbolizing the death of the \\"D.A.I.S.Y. Age\\" and the imagery that went along with it. The album spawned several singles, including the dark \\"Millie Pulled a Pistol on Santa\\", a tale of a young girl who could no longer take the sexual abuse from her father, and the lead single \\"Ring Ring Ring (Ha Ha Hey)\\", a story about the people rated with the Black Sheep on \\"Fanatic of the B Word,\\" Q-Tip from A Tribe Called Quest on \\"A Roller Skating Jam Named 'Saturdays'\\", and Prince Paul makes an appearance on the mic in \\"Pass the Plugs\\" with a verse of his own. The album also more prominently featured Vincent Mason as a rapper, providing verses of his own on \\"Bitties in the BK Lounge,\\" \\"Afro Connections at a Hi-5,\\" and \\"Ring Ring Ring (Ha Ha Hey)\\". Though it received mixed reviews and did not sell as well as 3 Feet High and Rising it eventually became a cult classic. The Source magazine listed the album as one of their top 100 hip hop albums of all time, stating that \\"its true genius is rarely understood\\". There are several major differences between the CD version of this album and the other formats, as the tracks \\"Johnny's Dead AKA Vincent Mason\\", \\"My Brother's a Basehead\\", \\"Kicked Out the House\\", and \\"Who Do U Worship?\\" are only available on the CD. The limited edition double vinyl promotional copies of the album distributed to the media before the official release did not feature these. Question: How was the album received? Answer:","completion":"The album, De La Soul Is Dead, received mixed reviews when it was released.

Purchase netting from most home supply stores. Secure your netting at the bottom so birds can't get them at ground level. Look for heavy-duty, knitted netting with an aperture no bigger than 5 by 5 millimetres (0.20 in × 0.20 in) and woven no larger than 500 microns thick. Check your netting in the spring and winter. Bird sometimes peck at growing cherry buds in the late winter. Replace your netting as needed. When your trees will be exposed to much sunlight, it is important to keep your trees hydrated and healthy, especially for freshly planted trees. Water your trees when the top layers of soil seem dry. To check the moisture, stick your finger about 3 inches (7.6 cm) into the soil. If the soil is not moist, then water it thoroughly from the base of the tree. If the soil is still wet, you can wait another day before checking the moisture level again. Use an all-purpose fertilizer or a fruit tree fertilizer, and follow instructions on the package to determine the recommended amount to use. After April, only fertilize your trees after you harvest the fruit each season. Fertilizing right before your trees bloom helps replenish nutrients and help the tree produce more fruit. in the late winter annually. This will help your trees grow new fruiting wood. Prune the tree when it is dormant so you don't damage the fruit-bearing branches. You can use hand pruners or scissors to cut away dead, damaged, or diseased branches. Regularly pruning your trees will prevent infection and disease. In order to prevent winter sunscald, you should wrap the trunk with tree wrap every winter. Start at the bottom of the trunk and work your way toward the top, overlapping the layers. You can find tree wrap at gardening and home improvement stores. Sweet cherries are more likely to get a fungal or bacterial disease, so prune them again in the late summer to prevent diseases from spreading. The warmth of the sun will develop the flavor of your cherries, and they will fall off the tree when ready to harvest. Pick your cherries with the stalks still attached using scissors or hand pruners. Hand picking can injure your tree and cause infection. Cherries will appear dark red, black, or yellow when fully ripened. They will be the most sweet and delicious at this point, because the sugar content will rise a few days before they are fully ripened Pick your cherries when they are still firm if you want to freeze them. Typical cherry harvests only last 1 week, so be ready to pick! Common cherry tree pests include aphids, Japanese beetles, and caterpillars. If you have issues with pests, you can treat your trees with pesticides. Always consider using natural pesticides so you don't damage your trees or cherries with harsh chemicals. You can easily make your own pesticides at home. Try mixing different household vegetables, oils, or soaps with water and treating for pests naturally.

Leo found that the specialty company numbered fifteen people. The performers were, for the most part, of very ordinary ability. There were several song and dance men, a number of musicians who drew tunes out of a variety of articles, several lady vocalists, a comical fat man and a magician. The magician was a young fellow, hardly older than Leo. His name was Carl Ross, and he had such a smiling face and gentlemanly manner that Leo took to him instantly. “We want a good all-around gymnast and tumbler,” said Carl Ross. “As it is the show is lop-sided—too much singing and dancing.” Leo was asked to give an exhibition of what he could do, and readily complied, performing at first on the floor of the stage and then on a bar let down from the flies. “Very good!” said Nathan Wampole, highly pleased, and Carl Ross also smiled his approval. At the conclusion of the show that evening Leo decided to join the company, and from that moment on he and Carl Ross became warm friends.

He was the third child, and first son, of František Smetana and his third wife Barbora Lynková. František had fathered eight children in two earlier marriages, five daughters surviving infancy; he and Barbora had ten more children, of whom seven reached adulthood. At this time, under Habsburg rule, German was the official language of Bohemia. František knew Czech but, for business and social reasons, rarely used it; and his children were ignorant of correct Czech until much later in their lives. The Smetana family came from the Hradec Králové (German: Königgrätz) region of Bohemia. František had initially learned the trade of a brewer, and had acquired moderate wealth during the Napoleonic Wars by supplying clothing and provisions to the French Army. He subsequently managed several breweries before coming to Litomyšl in 1823 as brewer to Count Waldstein, whose Renaissance castle dominates the town.The elder Smetana, although uneducated, had a natural gift for music and played in a string quartet. Bedřich was introduced to music by his father and in October 1830, at the age of six, gave his first public performance. At a concert held in Litomyšl's Philosophical Academy he played a piano arrangement of Auber's overture to La muette de Portici, to a rapturous reception. In 1831 the family moved to Jindřichův Hradec in the south of Bohemia—the region where, a generation later, Gustav Mahler grew up. Here, Smetana attended the local elementary school and later the gymnasium. He also studied violin and piano, discovering the works of Mozart and Beethoven, and began composing simple pieces, of which one, a dance (Kvapiček, or \\"Little Galop\\"), survives in sketch form.In 1835, František retired to a farm in the south-eastern region of Bohemia. There being no suitable local school, Smetana was sent to... contains an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who moved with his mother, father, and siblings to the south of Bohemia in 1831?, what is it ?

You must generate a detailed and long answer. At what game was a former world champion famously defeated by a computer called Deep Blue in 1997?","completion":"The game in which a former world champion was famously defeated by a computer called Deep Blue in 1997 is chess. The world champion who faced Deep Blue was Garry Kasparov, a Russian chess grandmaster who is widely considered one of the greatest chess players of all time. The match took place from May 11 to May 17, 1997 and was held in New York City. Deep Blue was a chess-playing computer developed by IBM, specifically designed to compete at an advanced level against human chess players. It was a successor to an earlier system called Deep Thought, which was also a chess-playing system. Deep Blue's creators worked to significantly improve its processing power and decision-making abilities, enabling it to analyze in-depth chess strategies and think several moves ahead, much like a human chess player. The 1997 match was a rematch, as Kasparov and Deep Blue had previously faced off in February 1996. In that earlier encounter, Kasparov emerged victorious, winning with a 4-2 score. However, subsequent improvements were made to Deep Blue's capabilities leading up to their 1997 match. The 1997 match consisted of six games, and Deep Blue won the match with a score of 3.5-2.5. This historic victory marked the first time that a chess-playing computer had defeated a reigning world champion in a match played under classic time controls. Kasparov won the first game, while Deep Blue claimed a victory in the second game. Games three, four, and five ended in draws, and Deep Blue ultimately triumphed in the sixth and final game. Kasparov's defeat at the hands of Deep Blue is significant for several reasons. Firstly, it showcased the remarkable advancements in artificial intelligence and computing at the time. The event also sparked widespread debate about the relationship between humans and machines, raising questions about the future of artificial intelligence and its potential implications for various fields. Furthermore, the match exemplified how technology can push the boundaries of human ingenuity, as engineers and computer scientists were able to create a system capable of outthinking a human mind in a game as complex and strategic as chess. This achievement serves as a testament to the ongoing development and evolution of artificial intelligence and its potential to transform a wide range of industries and disciplines in the future."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Robert Dale Owen (November 7, 1801 - June 24, 1877) was a Scottish-born social reformer who immigrated to the United States in 1825, became a U.S. citizen, and was active in Indiana politics as member of the Democratic Party in the Indiana House of Representatives (1835-39 and 1851-53) and represented Indiana in the U.S. House of Representatives (1843-47). As a member of Congress, Owen successfully pushed through the bill that established Smithsonian Institution and served on the Institution's first Board of Regents. Owen also served as a delegate to the Indiana Constitutional Convention in 1850 and was appointed as U.S. charge d'affaires (1853-58) to Naples. Owen was a knowledgeable exponent of the socialist doctrines of his father, Robert Owen, and managed the day-to-day operation of New Harmony, Indiana, the socialistic utopian community he helped establish with his father in 1825. After his first term in the Indiana legislature and two unsuccessful campaigns for election to the U.S. Congress in 1838 and in 1840, Owen was elected as a Democrat to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1842. He served from 1843 to 1847 in the Twenty-eighth and Twenty-ninth Congresses. Owen was chairman of the Committee on Roads and Canals during the Twenty-eighth Congress. He was also involved in the debates about the annexation of Texas and an Oregon boundary dispute in 1844 that led to the establishment of the U.S-British boundary at the 49th parallel north, the result of the Oregon Treaty (1846). While serving as a member of Congress, Owen introduced and helped to secure passage of the bill that founded the Smithsonian Institution in 1846. Owen was appointed to the Smithsonian Institution's first Board of Regents and chaired its Building Committee, which oversaw the construction of the Smithsonian Institution Building in Washington, D.C., and recommended James Renwick, Jr. as architect, James Dixson and Gilbert Cameron as the contractors, and the Seneca Quarry for its distinct, dark-red sandstone. Owen, his brother David Dale Owen, and architect Robert Mills, were involved in developing preliminary plans for the Smithsonian Building. These early plans influenced Renwick's choice of the Romanesque Revival architectural style (sometimes referred to as Norman-style architecture) and his three-story design for the building, which was finally selected, although not without controversy. Owen's book Hints on Public Architecture (1849) argued the case for the suitability of Renwick's Romanesque Revival (Norman) architectural style for public buildings such as the Smithsonian \\"Castle,\\" which he discussed in detail. Seven full-page illustrations and details of the building's architectural elements were prominently featured in the book, leading some to criticize Owen for his bias toward Renwick and his preference for Norman-style architecture over other popular styles.

Summarize this article: Individuals who have satisfying interpersonal relationships and friendships show reduced depression, a more positive outlook, and a better ability to deal with challenging situations and feelings overall. Social support can help reduce stress that is associated with feeling lonely. Going to therapy and going to family therapy are good ways to work on your relationships. Focus on engaging in social activities that can lead to friendships. Keep away from cynical and negative people if they bring you down. Ask for help when you need it. Rejection can be more of a worry when you feel lonely. Try not to put pressure on yourself to make a new best friend or a fantastic conversation with each social interaction. Instead, try to enjoy the feeling of connecting in the moment. Social networking allows you to connect without having to worry too much about rejection. Try leaving a comment on someone's post, or sending someone a short message. When you're socializing in person, whether with someone you know or a stranger, try making small talk. You can start with the friendly question, \\"How is your day going?\\". Asking someone how their day is going may not seem like the start of a profound conversation, but it allows you to make a small connection with anyone you meet. If it leads to a deeper conversation, that's fine; if not, you've still shared a moment with another person. Signing up for a dating website, joining a group or club, volunteering, or taking a class are just a few ways to put yourself in situations where you'll meet new people who share common interests. If you are interested in and connect with someone, a great way to follow up is by adding him or her on a social networking site (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter). Remember that the relationships you form may not grow deeper right away, and that's OK. For now, focus on how it feels to connect with people in the moment. It can be tough to get out there and socialize. Each time you make a connection, whether it's making small talk with a stranger or asking someone in your class out for coffee, be proud of yourself for reaching out. Feeling positive about your social achievements will help you continue making an effort to connect with people. As your social needs are increasingly met, you'll begin to feel less lonely.","completion":"This article emphasizes the importance of satisfying interpersonal relationships and friendships in reducing depression and enhancing a positive outlook. Social support aids in diminishing the stress related to loneliness. To nurture relationships, people should consider therapy and engage in social activities leading to friendships.

Social networking could provide a platform to initiate conversations without the fear of rejection, and if face-to-face interaction is involved, starting with a friendly question like, \\"How is your day going?\\" is recommended. Expanding social circles can be achieved by joining clubs or classes, volunteering, or even through dating websites.

A media personality on health-related issues, he is best known as CNN's multiple Emmy Award-winning chief medical correspondent, hosting the network's weekend health program Sanjay Gupta, M.D., and making frequent appearances on their American Morning, Larry King Live and Anderson Cooper 360deg programs. His reports from Charity Hospital, New Orleans, Louisiana, in the wake of Hurricane Katrina led to him winning a 2006 Emmy Award for Outstanding Feature Story in a Regularly Scheduled Newscast. Some journalists and journalism professors specializing in health care have criticized Gupta's coverage. Trudy Lieberman, a regular Nation contributor on healthcare and director of the health and medicine reporting program at the CUNY Graduate School of Journalism, reviewed Gupta's \\"ineptitude\\" in reporting on the McCain health plan.

Peter Aldhous criticized Gupta's \\"enthusiasm for many forms of medical screening - even when the scientific evidence indicates that it may not benefit patients\\". He and other medical journalists accuse him of a \\"pro-screening bias\\" in promoting widespread electrocardiogram and prostate cancer screening, even though medical authorities like the US Preventive Services Task Force recommend against it. Writing in CounterPunch, Pam Martens criticized Gupta's promotion of Merck's cervical cancer vaccine Gardasil, including repeated assertions that it prevented cervical cancer years before clinical trials had proven that to be true, and without disclosing the financial arrangements between CNN and Merck; she also criticized his downplaying of the risks of Vioxx for cardiovascular events, for which he stated that he drew his conclusions from having \\"talked to the makers of Vioxx, the Merck company\\"; and for his involvement in AccentHealth, a health infomercial site that presents itself as patient education and is played in physician waiting rooms and does not in her view adequately disclose its promotional nature.

In the fanfily traditional cultural patterns confer (~z~,) leadership on one or both of the parents. In other cases, such as friendship groups, one or more persons may gradually emerge as leaders, although there is no formal process of selection. In larger groups, leaders are usually chosen formally through election or recruitment. Although leaders are often thought to be people with unusual personal ability, decades of research have failed to produce consistent evidence that there is any category of \\"natural leaders.\\" It seems that there is no set of personal qualities that all leaders have in common; rather, virtually any person may be recognized as a leader if the person has qualities that meet the needs of that particular group. Furthermore, although it is commonly supposed that social groups have a single leader, research suggests that there are typically two different leadership roles that are held by different individuals. Instrumental leadership is leadership that emphasizes the completion of tasks by a social group. Group members look to instrumental leaders to \\"get things done.\\" Expressive leadership, on the other hand, is leadership that emphasizes the collective well-beings of a social group's members. Expressive leaders are less concerned with the overall goals of the group than with providing emotional support to group members and attempting to minimize tension and conflict among them. Group members expect expressive leaders to maintain stable relationships within the group and provide support to individual members.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Article: In May 1985, Gorbachev delivered a speech in Leningrad advocating reforms and an anti-alcohol campaign to tackle widespread alcoholism. Prices on vodka, wine, and beer were raised in order to make these drinks more expensive and a disincentive to consumers, and the introduction of rationing. Unlike most forms of rationing intended to conserve scarce goods, this was done to restrict sales with the overt goal of curtailing drunkenness. Gorbachev's plan also included billboards promoting sobriety, increased penalties for public drunkenness, and to censor drinking scenes from old movies. Although this program was not a direct copycat of Tsar Nicholas II's outright prohibition during World War I, Gorbachev faced the same adverse economic reaction as did the last Tsar. The disincentivization of alcohol consumption was a serious blow to the state budget according to Alexander Yakovlev, who noted annual collections of alcohol taxes decreased by 100 billion rubles. Alcohol production migrated to the black market, or through moonshining as some made \\"bathtub vodka\\" with homegrown potatoes. Poorer, less educated Russians resorted to drinking unhealthy substitutes such as nail polish, rubbing alcohol or men's cologne, which only served to be an additional burden on Russia's healthcare sector due to the subsequent poisoning cases. The purpose of these reforms, however, was to prop up the existing centrally planned economy, unlike later reforms, which tended toward market socialism.

Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","completion":"To answer these questions, I will first define each term in detail. Question 1: How would you define a semi-open caucus? Step 1: Understand the context - A caucus is a meeting where members of a political party gather to discuss and make decisions related to the party's platform, elect candidates or delegates, and discuss the party's strategies. Step 2: Define 'Semi-open' - A 'semi-open' system can be defined as one that partially restricts participant eligibility. Step 3: Combine context and term definition - Based on the provided context and definition of 'semi-open,' a semi-open caucus can be defined as a meeting of party members where participation is partially restricted. This could mean that while party members are permitted to participate, independent voters or members of other parties may attend the meeting but are not allowed to vote or participate in some discussions. Question 2: How would you define an open caucus? Step 1: Understand the context - As mentioned earlier, a caucus is a meeting of party members to discuss and make decisions related to the party's platform, elect candidates or delegates, and discuss the party's strategies. Step 2: Define 'Open' - An 'open' system typically refers to one that has unrestricted or minimal restrictions on participant eligibility. Step 3: Combine context and term definition - An open caucus can be defined as a meeting of party members where participation is unrestricted (or has minimal restrictions) and everyone, including independents and members of other parties, can attend and participate in the meeting, discussions, and voting processes. Comparing the two questions: No, questions 1 and 2 are not asking the same thing. Question 1 is asking for a definition of a semi-open caucus, which has partial restrictions on participation. Question 2 is asking for a definition of an open caucus, which has minimal or no restrictions on participation. The main difference between the two lies in the level of restriction on participation in the meetings and related processes."},{"prompt":"Information: - Sony BMG Music Entertainment was a record music company, which was a 5050 joint venture between the Sony Corporation of America and Bertelsmann AG.

Information: - The Eighty Years' War or Dutch War of Independence (15681648) was a revolt of the Seventeen Provinces against the political and religious hegemony of Philip II of Spain, the sovereign of the Habsburg Netherlands. After the initial stages, Philip II deployed his armies and regained control over most of the rebelling provinces. Under the leadership of the exiled William the Silent, the northern provinces continued their resistance. They eventually were able to oust the Habsburg armies, and in 1581 they established the Republic of the Seven United Netherlands. The war continued in other areas, although the heartland of the republic was no longer threatened; this included the beginnings of the Dutch Colonial Empire, which at the time were conceived as carrying overseas the war with Spain. After a 12-year truce, hostilities broke out again around 1619 which can be said to coincide with the Thirty Years' War. An end was reached in 1648 with the Peace of Münster (a treaty part of the Peace of Westphalia), when the Dutch Republic was recognised as an independent country (though the fact of its being such was evident long before). - Flanders is the Dutch-speaking northern portion of Belgium, although there are several overlapping definitions, including ones related to culture, language, politics and history. It is one of the communities, regions and language areas of Belgium. The demonym associated with Flanders is Fleming, while the corresponding adjective is Flemish. The official capital of Flanders is Brussels, although Brussels itself has an independent regional government, and the government of Flanders only oversees some cultural aspects of Brussels life. - Brussels, officially the Brussels-Capital Region, is a region of Belgium comprising 19 municipalities, including the City of Brussels which is the capital of Belgium. The Brussels-Capital Region is a part of both the French Community of Belgium and the Flemish Community, but is separate from the region of Flanders (in which it forms an enclave) or Wallonia. The region has a population of 1.2 million and a metropolitan area with a population of over 1.8 million, the largest in Belgium. - Roelant Savery ( or Roeland ( t ) Maertensz Saverij , or de Savery , or many variants ) ( 1576 - buried 25 February 1639 ) , was a Flanders - born Dutch Golden Age painter . - Language is the ability to acquire and use complex systems of communication, particularly the human ability to do so, and a language is any specific example of such a system. The scientific study of language is called linguistics. Questions concerning the philosophy of language, such as whether words can represent experience, have been debated since Gorgias and Plato in Ancient Greece. Thinkers such as Rousseau have argued that language originated from emotions while others like Kant have held that it originated from rational and logical thought. 20th-century philosophers such as Wittgenstein argued that philosophy is really the study of language. Major figures in linguistics include Ferdinand de Saussure and Noam Chomsky. - Belgium is a federal state comprising three communities, three regions, and four language areas. For each of these subdivision types, the subdivisions together make up the entire country; in other words, the types overlap. - Belgium , officially the Kingdom of Belgium, is a sovereign state in Western Europe bordered by France, the Netherlands, Germany, Luxembourg, and the North Sea. It is a small, densely populated country which covers an area of and has a population of about 11 million people. Straddling the cultural boundary between Germanic and Latin Europe, Belgium is home to two main linguistic groups: the Dutch-speaking, mostly Flemish community, which constitutes about 59% of the population, and the French-speaking, mostly Walloon population, which comprises 41% of all Belgians. Additionally, there is a small group of German-speakers who live in the East Cantons located around the High Fens area, and bordering Germany. - The Dutch Golden Age was a period in Dutch history, roughly spanning the 17th century, in which Dutch trade, science, military, and art were among the most acclaimed in the world. The first half is characterized by the Eighty Years' War which ended in 1648. The Golden Age continued in peacetime during the Dutch Republic until the end of the century. - The Dutch Republic, also known as the Republic of the Seven United Netherlands ('), Republic of the United Netherlands or Republic of the Seven United Provinces ('), was a republic in Europe existing from 1581, when part of the Netherlands separated from Spanish rule, until 1795. It preceded the Batavian Republic, the Kingdom of Holland, the United Kingdom of the Netherlands, and ultimately the modern Kingdom of the Netherlands.

Question: What goes on a rampage through Tokyo? Movie title: Roujin Z Movie plot: Roujin Z is set in early 21st century Japan. A group of scientists and hospital administrators, under the direction of the Ministry of Public Welfare, have developed the Z-001: a computerized hospital bed with robotic features.[2][3] The Z-001 takes complete care of the patient: it can dispense food and medicine, remove excretory waste, bathe and exercise the patient lying within its frame. The bed is driven by its own built-in nuclear power reactorâand in the event of an atomic meltdown, the bed (including the patient lying within) would become automatically sealed in concrete.[4] The first patient to be \\"volunteered\\" to test the bed is a dying widower named Kiyuro Takazawa. He is an invalid who is cared for by a young nursing student named Haruko.[5] The electronic elements within the Z-001 somehow manage to transcribe Takazawa's thoughts through Haruko's office computer, and he uses the communication to cry for help.[4] Although she objects to such treatment of elderly patients, Haruko begrudgingly seeks the aid of a group of computer hackers in the hospital's geriatric ward to create and install a vocal simulation of Takazawa's deceased wife in the Z-001.[2][3] However, once Takazawa wishes to go to the beach, the Z-001 detaches itself from its moorings and escapes from the hospital with the man in its grasp.[2][6] Haruko's fears are then justified, as it is discovered that the bed is actually a government-designed, experimental weapons robot.[3][5]","completion":"It seems like the thing that goes on a rampage through Tokyo in the movie Roujin Z is the Z-001 computerized hospital bed that transforms into a government-designed experimental weapons robot.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Write some highlights for the following article: A week, as they say, is a long time in football. By that reckoning, six weeks is almost an eternity. For fans of one of English football's oldest clubs, it certainly feels that way. On Boxing Day 2012, former European champions Nottingham Forest lined up to play Leeds United in a second flight match in the English Championship. After going a goal behind, Forest roared back to an emphatic 4-2 victory that had a certain swagger about it. Watching at the time, it was hard to escape the feeling that things were finally coming together for a side that has come to embody the term 'sleeping giant'. One point and one place outside the playoffs, that afternoon Forest fans would have tucked into their turkey sandwiches with a sense of satisfaction and thoughts of good things to come. But just hours after the final whistle the club's Kuwaiti owners, the Al Hasawi family, fired the club's quietly progressive manager, Sean O'Driscoll. Baffling decision. For fans and observers alike it was a baffling decision. \\"We cannot speak highly enough of Sean as a man,\\" said Chairman Fawaz Al Hasawi. \\"He was appointed at an extremely difficult time for the club and can count himself unlucky to have lost his job with the team just one point away from the top six. But we have a responsibility to look to the future for this great Club because we have huge ambitions for it.\\" Fast forward just a few weeks, and O'Driscoll's replacement, Alex McLeish, has followed his predecessor to the exit. January had also seen the sudden and unceremonious exits of Forest's CEO, its head of recruitment, and the popular club ambassador (and former player and manager) Frank Clark. McLeish departed 'by mutual consent' after just one win in seven games and a transfer window that bordered on farcical, as key target George Boyd's switch to the club foundered after the player apparently failed an eye test. Forest fans took to social media once more in a bewildered daze as headlines painted a picture of a shambolic club in disarray. Days later another former Forest manager, the combative Billy Davies, was reinstalled in this hottest of managerial hot seats. But before he could properly take charge his team duly lost 2-0 to a Bristol City side now, somewhat poetically, managed by none other than Sean O'Driscoll. Blackburn woes. This odd story will have particular resonance in England's north west, where another of English football's most venerable institutions, Blackburn Rovers, has collapsed from mid table comfort in the English Premier League (EPL) to relegation and ignominy. The club's owners, India's Venky's Group, began their tenure by sacking the widely respected Sam Allardyce in December 2010. Since then they appear to have embarked on a kamikaze PR strategy, which has led to ridicule off the pitch and confusion on it. In the latest chapter, Shebby Singh, the former TV pundit brought in by Venky's as the club's 'global advisor', is reportedly at loggerheads with managing director Derek Shaw, amid allegations of interference with football matters and disputes over players' contractual deals. The culture clash between the old and the new sides of the club looks wider than ever. Rovers are now onto their third manager of the season and a swift return to the EPL looks wildly improbable. Venky's and the Al-Hasawi family are the latest in a wave of foreign owners taking control of clubs in the English leagues. Few on the growing list are strangers to controversy. Mixed feelings. Cardiff City's new Malaysian owners changed the club's colors from blue to red, causing outrage -- but perhaps they will be forgiven as they are currently well set for promotion to the EPL. The Glazer family's takeover of Manchester United sparked a supporter's revolt that saw the formation of a completely new team -- FC United of Manchester -- by fans alarmed at the level of debt (currently around Â£360million - 550m) foisted upon the club. Then there's Roman Abramovich's Chelsea, whose phenomenal success has been tempered by the owner's propensity to fire managers; and Sheikh Mansour of Manchester City, whose investments in the club stretch UEFA's concept of Financial Fair Play to the limit, and very probably beyond. The attitude of football fans to these types of investor is pretty schizophrenic. On the one hand the very prospect of a new owner, awash with cash, coming in and transforming a club's fortunes would get many salivating, regardless of where the money is from and who is taking the reins. English football, or at least the Premier League, is an enormously attractive stage and clubs make for interesting playthings for the super-rich. Meanwhile, fans are attracted to the idea of quick-fix success. Community connection. On the other hand, with spiraling ticket prices driven largely by players' wages and the increasingly erratic pictures being painted by some of these new owners, there is a sense that clubs' connections with the communities in which many have existed for over a century are being undermined. Then of course there's the idea of what constitutes super rich in the context of football. Away from the financial machinations of the Glazers, Randy Lerner's more straightforward commitment to Aston Villa appears to have run dry, with the team staring at a relegation battle and the purse strings tied tightly shut. In the Championship, Watford's owners have enjoyed remarkable success by filling their side with loan signings from another club, Italy's Udinese, which they also own. And then, in England's League One, there's Portsmouth. If the Glazer's ownership of Manchester United appears complex, the background to Portsmouth's stewardship is positively arcane. An excellent blog by Portsmouth fan SJ Maskell recently dissected the baffling raft of creditors currently being pored over in the English courts. The club, which enjoyed a Premier League berth and an FA Cup win just five years ago, is facing relegation to England's fourth tier and possible ruin. It has seen a succession of owners, offshore companies, and paper trails leading all over the world drive it into successive demotions and financial collapse. Wayward club. A group of fans has formed the Portsmouth Supporters' Trust, which is looking to gain control of this wayward club and finally wrestle it back from a course to apparent doom. All logic points to their being given the chance to do so, but this is a club that has defied logic for years and a decision in their favor is by no means certain. The Portsmouth Supporters Trust faces a battle, but it is perhaps this kind of institution that points to a more stable future for clubs and the sport of football in England. The problem with many of the new wave of owners in English football is not that they are foreign. Football is a global game, and the EPL is filled with players from all over the world, so it would be illogical to deny owners from overseas the chance to take part too. But the disconnect between the fans that pay to watch these clubs, the communities in which they operate, and even the armchair fans that follow them from afar, is an issue. A report launched this week by the football community trust Supporters Direct outlines a range of measures primarily focused on the physical manifestations of clubs -- the stadia in which they play, and the various off-shoots of these buildings. At the report's core are recommendations designed to protect the relationship between clubs and their communities, including joint ownership of stadia, 'golden shares' to be held by supporters collectively, and clubs that are owned by or formed as so-called Community Benefit Societies. In essence, it is about taking a degree of control into the hands of supporters. The sentiment behind this applies not just to the bricks and mortar of a football stadium. Clubs like Barcelona in Spain and throughout Germany's Bundesliga are protected from extreme and erratic behavior by the fact that fans are directly involved in a democratic ownership arrangement. The worst excesses of owners, who can act on a whim to often disrupt and damage the course of some of the long established institutions at the heart of communities, can be curbed by what is basically a democratic, rather than autocratic structure. Allied to initiatives such as UEFA's Financial Fair Play rules, perhaps this will see a game in England that is balanced less precariously, and fit for a long term and sustainable future. For now, however, English football fans should perhaps be careful what they wish for.","completion":"This article talks about how Nottingham Forest, a well-known English football team, went through many changes after their Kuwaiti owners, the Al Hasawi family, made some big decisions.

Please answer a question about the following article about Dutch language: Vowel length is not always considered a distinctive feature in Dutch phonology, because it normally co-occurs with changes in vowel quality. One feature or the other may be considered redundant, and some phonemic analyses prefer to treat it as an opposition of tenseness. However, even if not considered part of the phonemic opposition, the long/tense vowels are still realised as phonetically longer than their short counterparts. The changes in vowel quality are also not always the same in all dialects, and in some there may be little difference at all, with length remaining the primary distinguishing feature.

The chill of the January afternoon pierced her through, but it was fear, more than the cold, that made her limbs shake. Having just crossed over to the Left Bank, she glanced back over her shoulder and saw the towers and spires of the royal palace across the Seine. She felt as if hidden eyes there were watching her. Could anyone on the palace wall have seen her walk over the Petit-Pont? Not Amalric. He was still in the south, the King having just appointed him seneschal for Beziers and the surrounding country. But he had so many agents in Paris and allies at court. Except for Agnes, all the servants in the Gobignon town house were loyal to him. His aunt, Queen Blanche, was forever praising him to all who would listen. If Nicolette were involved in scandal, the White Queen would be furious, and would see to it that word reached Amalric. And if indeed he found out about her meeting the troubadour? Just a message, a song, let alone a meeting like this one, could mean death for her and Orlando. I should turn around right now, cross this bridge, and run back to the palace. The streets of the Latin Quarter were crawling with ruffians and criminals - it was insane for her to be walking here alone after sunset. The sight of the small knife she carried under her cloak might deter an attacker, but then she would be discovered. If I screamed for help, the whole palace would find out. Blanche would demand to know why I was here. No, she thought, her blood turning to ice, she would know why. But those eyes of his? to look into them again, was that not worth any risk? She stood, vacillating, in the shadows by a wooden house that overhung the Rue Saint-Jacques. I must see Orlando, she thought. Over a year now, and I have not been able to forget him. She longed just to be alone with him and have him take her in his arms. What did Nicolette look back at after crossing the bridge? Pick the correct answer from the following options: A.

A Quirky House in New York’s West Village Reveals Neighborhood Shifts Artist John Bennett’s 1829 home is a time capsule of development in the West Village section of Manhattan—on land once owned by Aaron Burr. The 3,500-square-foot house, on the market for 9.995 million, sits on a parcel owned by the third U.S. vice president at a time when he controlled a vast swath of the neighborhood. Mr. Burr took ownership of the block in 1793 when it was still farmland; the deed, however, doesn’t list a price and wasn’t recorded until 1814, according to city archives. In 1803, a year before his famous duel that took the life of Alexander Hamilton, Mr. Burr started selling off parcels to developers, including the Astor family, said Andrew Berman, executive director of the Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation, a community nonprofit. By the 1820s, the area was bustling with shops and row houses. Mr. Bennett’s home, on Downing Street, was one of the latter, built as a two-story, wood-frame house for sisters Sarah and Louisa Smith. The home was probably valued at a few thousand dollars, said Mr. Berman, judging from the sale of a nearby, albeit grander, four-house package that he said fetched 56,000 in 1832. The home likely didn’t get its brick facade or third floor until 1870, according to a report from the society. By the late 19th century, the neighborhood was primarily settled by immigrants, Mr. Berman said. The report says the home became a tenement occupied by five families. Mr. Bennett, 72, and his wife, Karen Lee Grant, a former art director, 69, bought the home in 1977 for 115,000. The couple had just moved from Paris, and Ms. Grant was eight months pregnant. Artists were starting to discover the Village, though Mr. Bennett recalled drug dealers and prostitutes occupying the sidewalks. The couple got a loan from the sellers—a group of siblings—which required them to put down 40,000, pay monthly installments of 550 (which then rose to 650), and then pay off a remaining sum. “I didn’t have to prove my worth to anybody—it was fantastic,” Mr. Bennett said, estimating that he paid 230,000 over 20 years. What they acquired was a shell of a building: Each floor had a single direct-current lightbulb, the air was sooty from nearby coal furnaces, and a water sprocket stood exposed where a toilet should have been, Mr. Bennett said. “It was just a black hole when I bought it,” he added. Over the years, Mr. Bennett has put his artistic (and handyman) skills to work. He added walls to the third-floor space, creating three bedrooms (one now an office) and a bathroom, and putting in insulation and a drywall ceiling. On the main, or second, floor, decorative wood columns around the kitchen table create an eating area; a washer/dryer hides below the counters. Mr. Bennett’s studio—a roughly 25-by-70-foot space filled with art and capped by a vast skylight—occupies the ground floor. Mr. Bennett also changed the facade, adding casement windows and a frieze of sculptural concrete heads above the entryway. If he has an aesthetic, Mr. Bennett said, it is based on necessity, with every design choice the result of a “fantasy or whimsy I had.” He scrounged bricks from an old schoolhouse, lined the bathtub with Mexican tiles at 75 cents a piece, and commissioned kitchen cabinets from a no-frills local store. Now, their three children are grown, and keeping the home has gotten expensive; the neighborhood is an enclave for Hollywood actors and Wall Street financiers. The couple want to move to Sullivan County, N.Y., where one son is a furniture maker. To some real-estate brokers, the home is a teardown, Mr. Bennett said. One prospective buyer has come to see the property several times with an architect. “They will inherit exactly the same building I did, which is basically all bricks and wood,” he said. What is a short summary of the above article?","completion":"The 3,500-square-foot house in the West Village section of Manhattan, previously owned by 3rd U.S. Vice President Aaron Burr, reveals historical neighborhood shifts. Built in 1829 as a two-story, wood-frame house, it saw significant transformations throughout its history. By the late 19th century, it was a brick-facade tenement occupied by immigrant families. In 1977, artist John Bennett and his wife Karen Lee Grant bought it for 115,000 and transformed it into a remarkable reflection of their artistic sensibilities. Now, the historically enriched property is on the market for 9.995 million. However, the West Village, once a haven for artists, is now an expensive enclave for Hollywood actors and Wall Street financiers making it challenging for the couple, whose three grown children have moved out, to keep the house. Some real-estate brokers see it as a teardown due to age and historic renovations, but it is a testament to a time capsule of the neighborhood's shifting dynamics."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Together with his companion, the mysterious Umbopo, they penetrate unknown country, following a map believed to be genuine. It transpires that Professor Huston has been captured by a German military expedition on the same quest, led by Bockner (Herbert Lom), a single-minded knackwurst-munching, bald-headed Colonel and a ruthless Turkish slave-trader and adventurer, Dogati (John Rhys-Davies). Huston is being forced to interpret another map, also believed to be genuine. The two rival expeditions shadow each other, clashing on several occasions, and finally enter the tribal lands of the Kukuana who capture them. The tribe is under the control of the evil priestess, Gagoola, who has Quatermain hung upside down over a pond full of crocodiles. Just when all seems lost, Umbopo arrives and after defeating Gagoola's warriors in combat, reveals his identity as an exiled tribal chief and the rightful ruler of the Kukuanas. As the tribesmen submit to him, Gagoola captures Jesse and flees into caves in the depths of the Breasts of Sheba, the twin mountain peaks where the mines are located. They are pursued by Bockner and Dogati, who attack the village in full force. They follow Quatermain and Umbopo to the entrance to the mines, but are hampered by a moat of quicksand. Bockner orders his men forward into the moat, but they have trouble crossing it. Dogati then kills all of Bockner's soldiers, as well as most of his own men, and uses their bodies as stepping stones to cross the moat safely.

The United States, France and Britain fired 105 missiles at three Syrian chemical weapons facilities on Saturday, in response to an alleged Syrian chemical weapons attack in the city of Douma that killed at least 40 people and wounded or sickened hundreds of others. The Syrian government has repeatedly denied any use of banned weapons. The combined military strike on Syria comes as the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump and the government of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un are preparing for an expected summit in late May or early June to discuss dismantling the North’s nuclear program in exchange for security guarantees. Trump’s willingness to use force against Syria can be seen to reinforce his “maximum pressure” campaign message, that in addition to imposing tough sanctions banning most North Korean exports, the U.S. would take military action, if necessary, to force Kim to terminate his nuclear program and end the continued development of a nuclear armed intercontinental ballistic missile that can reach the U.S. mainland. Calling the U.S. attack on Syria “a warning for Pyongyang,” the South Korean newspaper the Korea Joongang Daily, in an editorial on Monday said, “If Kim wants to be free from the fear of a potential raid, then he must be willing to denuclearize.” From this perspective the U.S. show of force in Syria will increase pressure on the leadership in North Korea to offer meaningful nuclear concessions at the Trump-Kim summit. “Unless it abandons at least part of its nuclear and missile capabilities then the Trump administration will not be satisfied,” said Bong Young-shik, a political analyst with the Yonsei University Institute for North Korean Studies in Seoul However the U.S. military strike on Syria could also reinforce concerns in North Korea that giving up its nuclear deterrent would make the...

You are given a new situation: Space explorers, that launched from Earth, just encountered a new planet several light years away. This planet is almost an exact copy of Earth, but it is currently uninhabited by intelligent life. Upon landing, the explorers name the planet Caprica and begin learning as much as they can. They discover that the species on this Caprica are nearly all the same as on Earth, and even most of the topography looks the same. However, the main difference is that humans never evolved here. For this reason, there are no cities or cars or factories to burn up fossil fuels. and a hint : When humans dig up and use fossil fuels, we have an impact on the carbon cycle ( Figure below ). This carbon is not recycled until it is used by humans. The burning of fossil fuels releases more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere than is used by photosynthesis. So, there is more carbon dioxide entering the atmosphere than is coming out of it. Carbon dioxide is known as a greenhouse gas , since it lets in light energy but does not let heat escape, much like the panes of a greenhouse. The increase of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere is contributing to a global rise in Earth’s temperature, known as global warming or global climate change. Please answer this question : Does Earth have more or less greenhouse gases than Caprica? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Earth has more greenhouse gases than Caprica. The primary reason for this difference is due to the presence of humans and their activities on Earth, which have significantly impacted the carbon cycle. Human activities, such as the burning of fossil fuels for energy production, transportation, and industrial processes, have led to a sharp increase in the level of greenhouse gases, particularly carbon dioxide, in the atmosphere. When fossil fuels are dug up and burned, they release carbon dioxide that had been stored deep underground for millions of years. This rapid release of carbon dioxide increases the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, which in turn leads to a number of environmental issues, such as global warming or climate change. Greenhouse gases, like carbon dioxide, are effective at trapping heat within the Earth's atmosphere, resulting in the gradual warming of the planet's surface. In contrast, Caprica is an almost exact copy of Earth, but it never experienced the evolution of intelligent life. As a result, there are no cities, cars, factories, or any human infrastructure to burn up fossil fuels and release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. The absence of these human activities means that the carbon cycle on Caprica is more balanced, with no significant excess of carbon dioxide being released. Photosynthesis performed by plants and other autotrophic organisms ensures that the carbon dioxide within the atmosphere remains relatively stable, which in turn allows for a more balanced and stable climate. In summary, Earth has a higher concentration of greenhouse gases compared to Caprica, primarily due to human activities that involve the burning of fossil fuels and release of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. The absence of human activities on Caprica allows its carbon cycle to remain balanced, resulting in a more stable and healthy environment."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Then, fill the glass so it’s at least ¾ of the way full. This is more than enough to spot anything out of the ordinary in a sample. For pools of water, scoop up a sample with the glass. You don’t need to sterilize the glass first. Think of the crystal clear water at a beautiful beach. Clean water looks transparent and doesn’t have anything floating in it. If you can’t see your hand on the other side of the glass, you’re probably not going to enjoy drinking that water. Anything floating in the glass could be a sign of bacteria or other problems. Before getting on the phone with your water department, set the glass down and wait for a minute. Sometimes milky water clears up right away. That means the color came from air bubbles, so your water is safe to drink. Hard water is water that has calcium, magnesium, and other minerals in it. The minerals cause the water to look a little cloudy. It is usually safe to drink but can be fixed with a water softener to avoid damage to your plumbing. Treat water with colored particles. For example, brown or orange particles are from rusty pipes while black ones come from rubber. Call a plumber to fix the problem. Even if your water doesn’t have anything floating in it, it may still not look completely clear. Discolored water not only looks gross but is a big red flag. These colors also turn up as stains on your dishes, clothing, bathtub, and other places. Use the strange coloring to figure out the source of the contamination before paying for a more comprehensive purity test. For instance, brown water is a very common problem. The contamination comes from dirt and other sediments, which you might see settle at the bottom of the glass. Red and orange colors come from rusty pipes. Black could mean you have lead in the water, a very toxic metal that also often comes from pipes. Green usually means algae grew in your water supply, so don’t drink it. If it has a blue-green coloring, it could be copper instead. A black stain could also mean mold. If the water smells bad, play it safe by assuming that it is going to be unsafe to drink. Sometimes water has that distinct rotten egg smell of sulfur, which comes from bacteria in the water. Other times, it could have the smell of a swimming pool because of chlorine contamination. If your water smells like nail polish or varnish, that could mean that some chemical leaked into the water supply. It might be from a home improvement project, for instance. Purify water by filtering and boiling it to remove contaminants. If you’re using municipal water, call your city or utility company. Contact your local government for more information. If you don’t see anything unusual about the water, taste a little bit of it with the tip of your tongue. You can usually detect polluted water right away. Bitterness often means metal in the water, so order a more complete water test as you look for problems. If you detect salt instead and live near the sea, seawater could be leaking into your plumbing. Clean water has a flat, bland taste. If your sample tastes metallic or like a fizzy soda, don’t risk drinking it. Keep in mind that you can’t always taste water quality issues. Things like bacteria and pesticides may not be easy to detect. Normally you can tell by looking at the water, but double-check with a lab test if necessary.","completion":"This article talks about how to check if your water is clean or not.

In fact one year Matt was out in the sun for a long time and picked up a bit of a tan so they actually did look exactly alike. and a hint : The epidermis also contains melanocytes , which are cells that produce melanin. Melanin is the brownish pigment that gives skin much of its color. Everyone has about the same number of melanocytes, but the melanocytes of people with darker skin produce more melanin. The amount of melanin produced is determined by heredity and exposure to UV light, which increases melanin output. Exposure to UV light also stimulates the skin to produce vitamin D .

Q:I read this background article the other day: Liquid water is a fluid. The hydrogen bonds in liquid water constantly break and reform as the water molecules tumble past one another. As water cools, its molecular motion slows and the molecules move gradually closer to one another. The density of any liquid increases as its temperature decreases. For most liquids, this continues as the liquid freezes and the solid state is denser than the liquid state. However, water behaves differently. It actually reaches its highest density at about 4°C.

Plot title: I Love You, Man Movie plot: Peter Klaven (Paul Rudd), a real estate agent, proposes to his girlfriend Zooey Rice (Rashida Jones); both happily become engaged. The conflict is that Peter seem to not have any close friends to share the good news with: only family and superficial (mainly female) acquaintances. After overhearing Zooey's female friends voicing their concerns over his lack of close male friends, Peter realizes his abnormality and decides that he needs to find male friends in order to have a best man for the upcoming wedding. Peter turns to his gay younger brother, Robbie (Andy Samberg), for advice on dealing with men. He makes a series of overtures toward various men, including Barry (Jon Favreau), the husband of Zooey's friend Denise. When Peter inadvertently projectile-vomits on Barry after winning a beer-drinking contest, he is kicked out of Barry's house. Feeling rejected, Peter is about to give up, when during an open house at Lou Ferrigno's mansion which Peter is trying to sell, he meets Sydney Fife (Jason Segel), an investor who is attending the showing simply to pick up divorced women and take advantage of the free food. The two quickly become friends, especially bonding over their mutual adoration of the progressive rock band Rush. Peter introduces Sydney to Zooey at their engagement party, but the meeting takes an unfortunate turn when a nervous Sydney makes a very awkward toast. The next night, Peter agrees to attend a Rush concert with Sydney, on the condition that he can bring Zooey. During the concert, Zooey is left feeling ignored by Peter and Sydney. The next day, while shopping for tuxedos, Sydney asks Peter why he is marrying Zooey, and also asks for an 8,000 loan. After some thought, Peter decides to lend Sydney the money, and later grants him the honor of being best man at his wedding. Zooey, meanwhile, has become suspicious of Sydney.

These criminal enterprises can generate staggering profits, often through effectively controlling the supply chain and distribution channels of drugs destined for the US market. Moreover, the same porous border, which has enabled illegal drugs to enter the US, has also facilitated the flow of firearms from the US back into Mexico. The high demand for illegal drugs in the United States fuels the drug cartels and allows them to expand their reach and power. Besides the drug trade, cartels have diversified their criminal activities, dabbling in human trafficking, extortion, and other lucrative illicit businesses. This has made them even more resilient and adaptable to law enforcement efforts, both in Mexico and in the United States. They're not just drug traffickers anymore; they're transnational criminal organizations, with the ability to destabilize entire communities and strike fear into the hearts of citizens and authorities alike. The federal government, as well as local police and judiciary in Mexico, faces a major challenge in eradicating these criminal groups. The police forces are often poorly equipped, underpaid, and infiltrated by corruption. The mistrust of law enforcement, and a culture of impunity that has grown over the years, makes it difficult for citizens to rally behind their government in the fight against the cartels. The United States plays a significant role in Mexico's drug conflict, not only because of the demand for drugs but also due to its involvement in assisting Mexican authorities with intelligence, training, and financial support. The Mérida Initiative, a bilateral policy effort between the US and Mexico aimed at combating drug trafficking, is an example of this partnership. The logical completion of the story is the acknowledgment that Mexico's drug war is an issue of shared responsibility, requiring cooperation and trust-building between the US and Mexico. It's crucial for the two countries to work together, sharing resources, knowledge, and strategies to dismantle the drug cartels, and fight corruption within the law enforcement and judicial systems. Additionally, addressing the root causes of drug addiction and investing in prevention and rehabilitation programs for communities ravaged by the drug trade is a priority. A comprehensive, coordinated approach will help create a safer environment for Mexican citizens and prevent the dangerous spillover effects from affecting American communities. Mexico may not be a failed state, as some pundits suggest, but the urgency of dealing with the drug war before it escalates further cannot be understated. Time will tell if the US and Mexico can successfully overcome the many challenges they face in this long and deadly conflict."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

In order to get ready for it, this summer, many Beijing middle school students had a different kind of vacation. Instead of hanging out with friends or traveling, they trained hard for the 60th birthday of China this year. Students trained from 7:30 am to around 10:00 am or from 4 pm to 6:30 pm, because it was very hot this summer. They wore white hats, T-shirts and blue trousers. The hats and T-shirts were printed with a red logo, the number \\"60\\". The first week of training was PE. Students practiced standing and squatting. Then they moved on to practice the group show.

Write a title for this article: People's birth years can affect their risk of catching certain strains of influenza — probably because their first case of flu somehow sets their immune system, researchers reported Thursday. Their findings could be good news for what scientists predict about the risk of a killer flu pandemic, and they could also help researchers find better flu vaccines, the researchers said. \\"Our work implies that we have never seen a true 'virgin soil' influenza pandemic,\\" the team wrote in their report, published in the journal Science. \\"Virgin soil\\" means a population that has no immunity at all to a new infection. The teams were looking at the puzzling characteristics of two strains of bird flu that keep popping up in people: the H5N1 and H7N9 avian influenza viruses. They've been spilling over into people for years and scaring scientists who see the potential for a pandemic of flu that could kill tens or even hundreds of millions of people. But this hasn't happened yet. And, oddly, while H5N1 has hit young people and children especially hard, H7N9 seems to attack older people. RELATED: History of flu outbreaks History of bird flu outbreaks History of bird flu outbreaks This undated handout image provided by Science and the University of Tokyo shows infectious particles of the avian H7N9 virus emerging from a cell. Scientists who sparked an outcry by creating easier-to-spread versions of the bird flu want to try such experiments again using a worrisome new strain. Since it broke out in China in March, the H7N9 bird flu has infected more than 130 people and killed 43. Leading flu researchers say that genetically engineering this virus in the lab could help track whether itâs changing in the wild to become a bigger threat. They announced the pending plans Wednesday in letters to the journals Science and Nature.

H7N9 has infected 452 people and killed 124 of them, according to the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota. The team at the University of Arizona and the University of California Los Angeles dove into the numbers, examining the reports of each case, who was affected and how severely. Related: Where has H5N1 Been, Anyway? They found an almost startling link with birth year. \\"It's ridiculously predictive,\\" said Michael Worobey, an expert in viral genetics at the University of Arizona. Worobey thinks he knows why. Other research suggests that early infections \\"imprint\\" the body's immune system. It makes sense — the human immune system makes cells and antibodies that \\"learn\\" to recognize and react more quickly to microbial invaders the next time they infect someone. Worobey has also found that influenza viruses that commonly infect people can be categorized into two groups. Group 1 consists of subtypes H1, H2, and avian H5, while group 2 includes seasonal H3 and avian H7. Related: What's in a Flu Name? Influenza A viruses all are named for two proteins found on their surfaces: hemagglutinin (the H in a flu name) and neuraminidase (the N in a flu name). Thus flu strains get names such as H5N1 or H1N1 or H3N2. So human H1N1, H2N2 and the H5N1 bird flu virus are all related in Group 1, while the H3N2 seasonal flu virus is related to the H7N9 bird flu strain. Every few decades, the predominant flu strain changes. So the H1N1 flu strain that killed tens of millions of people in 1918 hung around infecting people until 1957, when a pandemic of H2N2 flu swept the world and took over. Then H2N2 predominated until 1968, when the H3N2 \\"Hong Kong\\" flu took over. Most recently, the H1N1 \\"swine flu\\" caused a minor pandemic in 2009. Now H1N1 and H3N2 both regularly circulate as seasonal flu viruses. What Worobey and colleagues found was that people born in 1968 and later are less likely to be made severely ill by H7N9. They believe this is because the first flu strain that would have infected them would have been H3N2, which is in the same group as H7N9. Related: Canadian Woman Infected With H7N9 Flu And people born before 1968 are less likely to die or be made severely ill by H5N1, because their first flu infection would have been an H1N1 or H2N2 strain. \\"Roughly half of the people are quite well-protected against one of these potential pandemic viruses but not the other,\\" Worobey said. \\"Our findings show clearly that this 'childhood imprinting' gives strong protection against severe infection or death from two major strains of avian influenza,\\" added James Lloyd-Smith, a UCLA professor of evolutionary biology who worked on the study. \\"These results will help us quantify the risk of particular emerging influenza viruses sparking a major outbreak.\\" \\"It's imprinting. Not the virus, not the behavior of people, but being exposed to different viruses at an early age,\\" Worobey said. Flu strains mutate all the time, which is why people need a fresh flu shot every year. But Worobey and other researchers say there are unchanging, or \\"conserved\\" parts of the flu virus on the \\"stem\\" of the mushroom-shaped hemagglutinin structure that the human immune system can recognize. It obviously does not provide perfect protection, but enough to protect most people with this immune imprinting from the most severe disease, he said. \\"It is an extra barrier that is probably protecting us from even more frequent influenza pandemics,\\" he said. More importantly, later flu infections do not seem to alter this mechanism, although this theory needs testing. The researchers cannot say whether regular flu vaccination affects this \\"imprinting\\" effect. People are now encouraged to get annual flu vaccines starting as infants, and they get a cocktail of vaccines that protect against both the Group 1 H1N1 and Group 2 H3N2 viruses. They also cannot say whether peoples' susceptibility to seasonal flu is affected by imprinting. Flu is so very common that it will be hard to say which virus first infected someone and then follow them through life to see which strains make them sicker. But it might be possible to use the findings to make better vaccines, Worobey said. \\"This is really the first evidence out in the real world that this kind of cross-protection is possible,\\" Worobey said.

Given the question: Article: According to an old story, a farmer once found that a bag of corn had been stolen from his house. He went to the judge and told him about his loss. The judge ordered all the people of the farm to come before him. He took a number of sticks of equal length and gave one stick to each man. He then said, \\"Come before me again tomorrow. I shall then know which of you is the thief because the stick given to the thief will be one inch longer than the others.\\" The thief was afraid of being found out, and so he cut an inch off his stick. The next day the thief's stick was found to be one inch shorter than any of the others. In this way the thief was found out, and was at once taken away to prison. Question: Since the thief cut the stick short, _ . Yes or no, is the answer \\"he was found out\\"? The answer is:","completion":"Yes, the answer is \\"he was found out.\\" The story explains that the judge had a clever plan to identify the thief. He gave all the people on the farm a stick of equal length and told them that the thief's stick would be one inch longer the next day. The thief, fearing he would be discovered, cut an inch off his stick, thinking that it would help him avoid detection. However, the judge's plan was a clever ruse. There was no magic involved in identifying the thief; the judge instead used reverse psychology to trick the thief into revealing himself. By telling everyone that the thief's stick would be one inch longer, the judge prompted the thief to alter his stick out of fear. When all the people on the farm returned with their sticks the next day, it was clear that the thief had fallen for the judge's trick. His stick was one inch shorter than all the others, as he had cut it to avoid appearing to have a longer one. This action inadvertently exposed him as the thief, and he was immediately taken to prison. In conclusion, the thief was indeed found out due to the judge's psychological tactics and his own fear of being caught, which ultimately led him to cut his stick and distinguish himself from the others."},{"prompt":"This article: Handel's music for Messiah is distinguished from most of his other oratorios by an orchestral restraint—a quality which the musicologist Percy M. Young observes was not adopted by Mozart and other later arrangers of the music. The work begins quietly, with instrumental and solo movements preceding the first appearance of the chorus, whose entry in the low alto register is muted. A particular aspect of Handel's restraint is his limited use of trumpets throughout the work. After their introduction in the Part I chorus \\"Glory to God\\", apart from the solo in \\"The trumpet shall sound\\" they are heard only in \\"Hallelujah\\" and the final chorus \\"Worthy is the Lamb\\". It is this rarity, says Young, that makes these brass interpolations particularly effective: \\"Increase them and the thrill is diminished\\". In \\"Glory to God\\", Handel marked the entry of the trumpets as da lontano e un poco piano, meaning \\"quietly, from afar\\"; his original intention had been to place the brass offstage (in disparte) at this point, to highlight the effect of distance. In this initial appearance the trumpets lack the expected drum accompaniment, \\"a deliberate withholding of effect, leaving something in reserve for Parts II and III\\" according to Luckett.Although Messiah is not in any particular key, Handel's tonal scheme has been summarised by the musicologist Anthony Hicks as \\"an aspiration towards D major\\", the key musically associated with light and glory. As the oratorio moves forward with various shifts in key to reflect changes in mood, D major emerges at significant points, primarily the \\"trumpet\\" movements with their uplifting messages. It is the key in which the work reaches its triumphant ending. In the absence of a predominant key, other integrating elements have been proposed. For example, the musicologist Rudolf Steglich has suggested that Handel used the device of the \\"ascending fourth\\" as a unifying motif; this device most noticeably occurs in the first two notes of \\"I know that my Redeemer liveth\\" and on numerous other... contains an answer for the question: What is the title of the work that reaches its triumphant ending in the key of D major?, what is it ?","completion":"The title of the work that reaches its triumphant ending in the key of D major is Handel's \\"Messiah.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The authors propose that the universe created itself from nothing using the laws of physics, and therefore, there is no need for a creator like God. Hawking and Mlodinow's thoughts mentioned in the sentence mainly address the question of creation and whether there is a need for a God or a creator to generate the universe.

Understand the given information: - AF = 30 m - CE = 40 m - ED = 50 m - AE = 120 m 2. Use the given information to find the area of the plot ABCD. In this case, we can use the trapezoid area formula, since the plot appears to take the shape of a trapezoid when we consider the line AE as the height of the trapezoid: - Area = (1/2) * (sum of parallel sides) * height - The parallel sides are AB + CD (which we don't know yet) and the height is AE. 3. To find AB and CD, look for possible triangles we can use to calculate these distances. We have triangles: - AFE (with sides AF, AE, and FE) - CDE (with sides CD, CE, and DE) 4. Since we know three sides of each triangle, we can use Heron's formula to find their respective areas: - Area (Triangle AFE) = sqrt(s * (s - AF) * (s - AE) * (s - FE)), where s = (AF + AE + FE) / 2 - Area (Triangle CDE) = sqrt(s * (s - CD) * (s - CE) * (s - DE)), where s = (CD + CE + DE) / 2 5. Calculate the sum of the areas of these triangles and subtract it from the total area of the trapezoid to get the area of plot ABCD. 6.

Some commonly used fruits are watermelons, bananas, pineapple, oranges, and peaches. Experiment with different fruit to see what species you attract. A butterfly proboscis can’t penetrate the thick peels of fruit. Use a sharp knife to slice the fruit open so the inside flesh is easier to eat and drink. In case the fruit still isn’t easy for a butterfly to eat, making multiple slits in the flesh of the fruit gives a space for the juice to collect. Using the same knife as before, make shallow cuts into each piece of fruit you’re leaving out. You can also scrape the fruit or stab multiple holes into it with the tines of a fork for a similar effect. Fruit left out overnight may attract raccoons or other destructive mammals to your yard. Store fruit in a cool place like a garage or shed overnight and put it back in the morning. As the fruit keeps rotting, it will get softer and easier for the butterflies to eat. Replace the fruit once the fruits have turned black or moldy. If you save the fruit, cut 1⁄8 inch (3.2 mm) into the fruit with a knife or fork each day so there is easy access to the juices. Summary:","completion":"To feed butterflies, follow these steps: 1. Choose the right fruit: Opt for ripe or slightly mushy fruit, as it is easier for butterflies to eat. Commonly used fruits include watermelons, bananas, pineapples, oranges, and peaches. 2. Prepare the fruit: Using a sharp knife, slice the fruit open to expose the inner flesh, making it more accessible for butterflies. If necessary, make multiple slits or stab holes using a fork to create spaces for juice to collect and provide better access. 3. Set up the feeding area: Place the prepared fruit in a suitable location where butterflies frequent. 4. Store fruit overnight: To avoid attracting unwanted animals, store the fruit in a cool place like a garage or shed overnight and put it back out in the morning. 5. Maintain the fruit: As the fruit continues to rot, it becomes easier for butterflies to eat. Make daily cuts about 1⁄8 inch (3.2 mm) deep to ensure easy access to the juices. 6. Replace the fruit: Once the fruit turns black or moldy, replace it with fresh fruit. By following these steps, you'll be able to provide a source of nourishment for butterflies and possibly attract different species to your area."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: So, I worked with a friend of mine who was a playwright to put together a play to take to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. It was a three person show, and one of the roles was written specifically for me. Many of the lines were written after we improvised the scenes in my living room as she wrote the piece. Took it to Scotland, where it was quite well received. A year or so later, it was being produced in New York in a much more prestigious setting. I auditioned, was called back a couple times, and got to the play the role again. Fantastic! THEN, it was produced by an even larger theatre. Different producer, different casting director, etc. I went to the open call for it, and the casting director treated me really poorly. It was odd. She looked at my resume and said, “It says you have already played this role.” I said, “Yes, I was fortunate enough to workshop it and originate the role.” She looked at me like I was lying. I mean, shuttled me out the door like I was a crazy woman. Needless to say, I was not called back. And that was okay—(I mean, of course I wanted to do the show with this group of people, but hey, we can’t always get what we want). Fast forward to opening night: my playwright friend invites me to see the show. The actress playing “my” role was fantastic, but they had to change lines in the script that indicated what she looked like, because she was of Hawaiian descent. Again, no big deal…and she was great! What was strange was meeting the director that evening. My friend introduced me as the originator of the role, and the director asked me why I hadn’t auditioned…Overall, it wasn’t a harsh rejection or a terrible story, it was just weird to have been treated like a liar when I was not lying… Question: How long is the play in Edinburgh?

The correct answer is that the island of Majuro is home to the capital of the Marshall Islands. The Marshall Islands are an island nation in the Pacific Ocean, comprising 29 atolls and over 1,000 individual islands and islets. These atolls and islands are scattered over a vast expanse of ocean, equating to about 1,800 kilometers in a north to south direction and 970 kilometers from east to west. Majuro Atoll is the political, economic, and urban center of the country, and it consists of 64 islands and islets. Majuro Atoll has a land area of 3.7 square miles (9.7 square kilometers) but encloses a large, sheltered lagoon of 114 square miles (295 square kilometers), which makes it one of the most significant atolls in the Marshall Islands. The capital city of the Marshall Islands is also named Majuro and is located on the southern part of the atoll, on three islands: Delap, Uliga, and Djarrit. These three islands form a 30-mile-long (48 kilometers) \\"downtown\\" divided by two narrow channels. The population in the capital city is about 30,000, which makes up over half of the country's total population. In addition to being the political center, Majuro serves as the country's main port and houses most of its economic activities, including government services, businesses, health care facilities, and the main airport – Amata Kabua International Airport. The College of the Marshall Islands, the only institution of higher learning, is also located in the capital city. As for the information you provided, it is relevant to the Marshall Islands in terms of geographic context and neighbors in the region. The maritime boundaries of this island nation are shared with several nearby countries, which are the Federated States of Micronesia to the west, Wake Island to the north, Kiribati to the southeast, and Nauru to the south. These maritime boundaries help define the nation's Exclusive Economic Zone and its territorial waters, which play a vital role in matters of trade, navigation, and fishing rights."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In today's society, we expect public figures, especially those connected to professional sports teams, to be role models and uphold values of tolerance and respect. Sterling's racist comments, even if they were initially private, have now become public, showing a side of him that is not in line with those values. It is important for the children of Los Angeles to learn from this incident and understand that such behavior is not acceptable, regardless of one's position or wealth. For those reasons, I believe that Donald Sterling's continued association with the Clippers and the NBA could potentially have a negative impact on the younger generation, who may be influenced by his actions.

Blood The answer to this question is:","completion":"Title: \\"Midnight in Bloom\\" Genre: Horror, Musical, Comedy Act I: Blooming Nightmare The movie opens in a busy yet eerie floral shop named \\"Midnight Blossoms,\\" located in the heart of the bustling city of Carmina. Seymour, a young and shy florist with an incredible talent for nurturing and arranging plants, works tirelessly behind the scenes to make the store a success. His boss, Gus, receives most of the credit for their shop's magnificent plants; but, Seymour, a reserved and self-deprecating man, is just happy to be doing what he loves. One day, Seymour discovers a mysterious and unusual-looking plant in the back room of their shop. Intrigued by its appearance and dismal condition, he decides to take care of it and attempt to revive it. Act II: A Friend or a Foe? Over the course of a few weeks, Seymour's efforts pay off as the plant – which he affectionately names Audrey II, after his coworker and secret crush, Audrey – starts to show signs of improvement. However, Audrey II is unlike any plant Seymour has ever encountered before. The plant possesses an aura of mystery and danger, but Seymour is drawn to it inexplicably. On a stormy night while working late at the shop, Seymour accidentally pricks his finger on one of Audrey II's thorns. As a drop of blood falls onto the plant, it suddenly comes to life, showing signs of sudden growth. Shocked by this spectacle, Seymour quickly realizes that Audrey II has a hunger for blood. Act III: Feeding the Beast Audrey II begins to crave more and more blood, using its incredible growth and newfound powers of persuasion to convince Seymour to continue feeding its insatiable appetite. Seymour, feeling consumed by guilt but also captivated by Audrey II's mystique, secretly feeds the plant small amounts of his own blood to avoid suspicion. As Audrey II continues to grow, so does its hunger - demanding larger and more frequent portions to keep going. As a talented singer, Audrey II serenades Seymour with hypnotic and entrancing tunes, causing him to fall deeper under the plant's spell. The community also becomes entranced by the unique and enchanting Audrey II, boosting the shop's popularity and attracting customers from all over. Act IV: A Bloody Dilemma Seymour's devotion to the plant results in increased tension and jealousy from Gus, who is angered by the spotlight being shifted away from him. Audrey, who is increasingly enamored by Seymour's confidence and passion, desperately tries to uncover the truth behind Audrey II's growth and mysterious powers. The situation reaches a breaking point when Audrey II's hunger cannot be satiated with just Seymour's blood any longer and it demands him to bring the blood of others to survive and keep growing. The plant threatens to expose him and ruin the shop's success if he fails to comply. Torn between his desire to keep Audrey II alive and the fear of harming innocent people, Seymour must make a crucial decision that will forever change his life and the lives of those around him. Act V: Unraveling the Roots Audrey, determined to help Seymour amidst this crisis, discovers incriminating evidence in the form of ancient books and cryptic messages left behind by a mysterious figure known as \\"The Gardener.\\" Together, Seymour and Audrey unearth the dark secrets of Audrey II's origin and learn about a sinister supernatural force behind the plant. As the force gains energy from the blood it feeds on, it becomes an unstoppable being that threatens to consume the entire world. To save the city of Carmina and end the plant's wicked reign, Seymour, Audrey, and a motley crew of townsfolk come together and devise a dangerous plan to eliminate Audrey II once and for all. As the clock ticks closer to midnight, the fate of the entire town hangs in the balance, and Seymour's quest to redeem himself and save those he cares about takes center stage in a thrilling and twisted final showdown with Audrey II and The Gardener. Midnight in Bloom is a compelling dark comedy musical that explores themes of loyalty, temptation, and the power of redemption and love.

The events last weekend were apparently “live tweeted” by a rapper living beside the spot where Michael Brown, 18, died. The mostly black neighbourhood has been rocked by protests ever since, threatening to ignite a race war, as locals demand to know how an unarmed man could be shot dead in broad daylight as he apparently tried to surrender to police. Officers have been widely condemned for being out of touch and for using excessive force against the demonstrators. They have also come under fire for claiming that Brown was stopped because he was a suspect in a robbery - only to backtrack hours later when it emerged the officer involved did not know of his alleged crime. Using the street slang of rap culture, Emanuel Freeman, who goes by the Twitter label of @TheePharaoh , gave a blow by blow account of what unfolded last Saturday at about midday. <noframe>Twitter: Bruh. - I JUST SAW SOMEONE DIE OMFG</noframe> His first tweet said: “I JUST SAW SOMEONE DIE OMFG.” He then posted a photograph of a man lying face down in the street outside his house. To a friend, he said: “The police just shot someone dead in front of my crib yo.” An angry crowd soon gathered in the street. “Its blood all over the street, n----s protesting nshit. There is police tape all over my building. I am stuck in here omg,” he wrote. Michael Brown (Facebook) TheePharoah then went on to answer questions from other Twitter users, saying that he thought the man was shot seven times - twice from behind, and then five further shots as the victim turned to face police. More photographs follow, including a police officer with a rifle in his hand. The killing has sent shockwaves across America, igniting protests in 60 other cities. Civil rights campaigners compare the death with the 2012 shooting of Trayvon Martin, a black teenager killed by a neighbourhood watch organiser who was later acquitted of murder in a racially charged case. The local chapter of the Ku Klux Klan has reportedly begun raising money as a “reward” for the officer involved. But for many, the case highlights the gulf between communities and the officers who police them. In Ferguson, a down-at-heel neighbourhood of strip malls, a local force of 53 officers has just three black members for an area that is two-thirds African-American. Five years ago, police there charged a black man with property damage for bleeding on four uniforms as officers allegedly beat him. And this week’s disturbing scenes of officers with armoured vehicles has raised questions about whether America has allowed its police to morph into a paramilitary force. Ferguson, for example, is one of the areas that has signed up to a Pentagon programme to receive surplus military supplies, including automatic weapons and armoured vehicles, such as MRaps, or Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected vehicles of the sort more usually seen in Afghanistan. Barack Obama interrupted his summer holiday to condemn the police’s heavy handed approach, arresting journalists and denying peaceful protesters their right to express themselves. <noframe>Twitter: Bruh. - Just got told to stay inside. Scene will be clear hopefully in a couple hours.</noframe> Details of the killing remain contested. Police say Brown was shot dead after a scuffle with officers that left one policeman with a swollen face. On Friday, they released video footage showing Brown and a friend apparently stealing a 49 box of cigars from a convenience store. The pictures show Brown pushing a member of staff into a display stand. In American police jargon it was described as a “strong arm” robbery - one that did not involve a weapon. That was why, according to the official version of events released on Friday morning, Brown and his friend had been stopped in the street. However, the revelations added fuel to an already combustible situation. Locals accused police of trying to shift attention from the killing and of concocting a cover story. Benjamin Crump, a lawyer for the Brown family, said it amounted to a character assassination. A statement released by the Brown family said: “There is nothing based on the facts that have been placed before us that can justify the execution style murder of their child by this police officer as he held his hands up, which is the universal sign of surrender.” Even then the police were forced to change their story later in the day. Thomas Jackson, the chief of Ferguson police, was forced to admit that the officer responsible for the shooting, named as Darren Wilson, had not known Brown was a suspect in the robbery. Instead, he had asked Brown not to walk in the middle of the street so a police car could pass. After 24 hours of calm on Thursday, when state police were given responsibility for calming the protests, the result was inevitable. Protesters gathered outside a looted QuikTrip store - focal point for anger in four of five previous nights. Al Aitkins, a crane operator, said the accusations would enflame simmering anger. “It will make things worse,” he said. “They may try to shift the blame but we will carry on demanding justice for Mike.” The evening started peacefully. Dancers and drummer created a carnival spirit despite steady drizzle. Witnesses said the atmosphere changed at midnight, when dozens of protesters confronted police, shouting abuse. A hard core threw bottles which were met with a single teargas round, sparking an attack on the Ferguson Market and Liquor store, the scene of Brown’s alleged robbery. TV pictures showed masked looters emerging with bottles of wine and even the cash register. Police stayed away, and trouble died down as other protesters formed human barriers in front of shops to keep looters at bay. It left the black officer drafted in to restore calm at the end of the week exasperated. Captain Ron Johnson, of Missouri Highway Patrol, who has won praise for his sensitive handling of the protests, told a local television station he had spent all day trying to ease concerns after local police released the video. “We had concerns that this would happen,” he said.

But the Klan –– desperate for publicity and any opportunity to spread hate and terror –– is climbing atop the powder keg that Ferguson has become following the police killing of an unarmed college-bound black teenager last Saturday. The South Carolina-based New Empire Knights of the Ku Klux Klan says its Missouri chapter is raising money for the still unidentified white police officer who shot and killed Michael Brown, 18, who was scheduled to begin college classes this week. “We are setting up a reward/fund for the police officer who shot this thug,” the Klan group said in an email. “He is a hero! We need more white cops who are anti-Zog and willing to put Jewish controlled black thugs in their place. Most cops are cowards and do nothing while 90% of interracial crime is black (and non-white) on white.” In a Tuesday editorial about the case headlined “The Death of Michael Brown: Racial History Behind the Ferguson Protests,” The New York Times expressed hope that the FBI will be able “to answer the many questions surrounding the death” of the teenager” while focusing on St. Louis’ history of racial problems. ||||| Summary:","completion":"Photographs have emerged of the moment a black teenager, Michael Brown, was shot dead by police in the small Missouri suburb of Ferguson. Protests turned violent in the mostly black neighborhood, threatening to ignite a race war. The police have been condemned for out of touch handling and excessive force against demonstrators, and false claims that Michael Brown was a suspect in a robbery. The killing has ignited protests in 60 other cities across America and highlighted the gap between communities and the officers who police them."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

They lay eggs that can be fertilized either inside or outside of the body. In most fish, the eggs develop outside of the mother's body. In the majority of these species, fertilization also takes place outside the mother's body. The male and female fish release their gametes into the surrounding water, where fertilization occurs. Female fish release very high numbers of eggs to increase the chances of fertilization. and the situation: Tim and Dan both studied reproduction in college. Dan studied plant reproduction while Tim studied fish reproduction. Answer the following question: Which person studied more about the ways female fish release very high numbers of eggs? Answer:","completion":"Tim studied more about the ways female fish release very high numbers of eggs. This is because Tim studied fish reproduction in college, which involves learning about the various aspects of how fish reproduce, including the process in which female fish release their eggs. Fish reproduction is a complex subject that covers various mechanisms employed by different species to ensure the survival and continuation of their genetic lineage. One of the key components of this subject is understanding the way female fish produce and release a high number of eggs, ensuring higher chances of fertilization and the successful development of their offspring. During his studies, Tim would have learned about the different types of fish species and their reproductive habits, including the external fertilization process that occurs in most fish species. This would involve understanding how the eggs are developed within the female fish's body, the cues and environmental factors that trigger the release of the eggs, and the behavioral and physiological adaptations in fish to improve the likelihood of successful fertilization. On the other hand, Dan studied plant reproduction, which does not cover the reproductive habits of fish. Plant reproduction primarily focuses on the various methods in which plants generate offspring, including sexual reproduction through the exchange of genetic material via pollination and fertilization, and asexual reproduction through vegetative propagation. Therefore, Tim's studies in fish reproduction would have provided him with more in-depth knowledge and understanding of the ways in which female fish release very high numbers of eggs, compared to Dan who studied plant reproduction."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

December 17, 1897) and Ann Eliza Birney (d. January 25, 1861), on February 16, 1852 in Allegheny, Pennsylvania. Russell was the second of five children, of whom two survived into adulthood. His mother died when he was 9 years old. The Russells lived for a time in Philadelphia before moving to Pittsburgh, where they became members of the Presbyterian Church. With the formation of the Watch Tower Society, Russell intensified his ministry. His Bible study group had grown to hundreds of local members, with followers throughout New England, the Virginias, Ohio, and elsewhere. They annually re-elected him \\"Pastor\\", and commonly referred to him as \\"Pastor Russell\\". Congregations that eventually formed in other nations also followed this tradition. In 1881, Russell published his first work to gain wide distribution: Food for Thinking Christians. The 162-page \\"pamphlet\\" was published using donated funds amounting to approximately 40,000 (current value 1,014,345). It had a circulation of nearly 1.5 million copies over a period of four months distributed throughout the United States, Canada and Great Britain by various channels. During the same year he published Tabernacle and its Teachings which was quickly expanded and reissued as Tabernacle Shadows of the \\"Better Sacrifices\\", outlining his interpretation of the various animal sacrifices and tabernacle ceremonies instituted by Moses. Russell claimed that the distribution of these works and other tracts by the Watch Tower Society during 1881 exceeded by eight times that of the American Tract Society for the year 1880. In 1903, newspapers began publishing his written sermons. These newspaper sermons were syndicated worldwide in as many as 4,000 newspapers, eventually reaching an estimated readership of some 15 million in the United States and Canada. In 1910 the secular journal Overland Monthly calculated that by 1909, Russell's writings had become the most widely distributed, privately produced English-language works in the United States. It said that the entire corpus of his works were the third most circulated on earth, after the Bible and the Chinese Almanac. In 1912 The Continent, a Presbyterian journal, stated that in North America Russell's writings had achieved a greater circulation \\"than the combined circulation of the writings of all the priests and preachers in North America.\\" Russell also had many critics, and he was frequently described as a heretic in this period.

Article: In the human digestive system, food enters the mouth and mechanical digestion of the food starts by the action of mastication (chewing), a form of mechanical digestion, and the wetting contact of saliva. Saliva, a liquid secreted by the salivary glands, contains salivary amylase, an enzyme which starts the digestion of starch in the food; the saliva also contains mucus, which lubricates the food, and hydrogen carbonate, which provides the ideal conditions of pH (alkaline) for amylase to work. After undergoing mastication and starch digestion, the food will be in the form of a small, round slurry mass called a bolus. It will then travel down the esophagus and into the stomach by the action of peristalsis. Gastric juice in the stomach starts protein digestion. Gastric juice mainly contains hydrochloric acid and pepsin. As these two chemicals may damage the stomach wall, mucus is secreted by the stomach, providing a slimy layer that acts as a shield against the damaging effects of the chemicals. At the same time protein digestion is occurring, mechanical mixing occurs by peristalsis, which is waves of muscular contractions that move along the stomach wall. This allows the mass of food to further mix with the digestive enzymes.

Review feedbacks are usually an excellent source in gauging the quality and functionality of a product. In this context, the reviewer used the term \\"Verry verry verry bad app.\\" The repetition of the word 'very' regardless of its incorrect spelling emphasizes the depth of their discontentment.

Next, the user calls the application a \\"feak app.\\" Although 'feak' probably is a typographical error, even assuming the intended word was 'fake,' it gives us crucial information about the app. 'Fake,' in common technology parlance, is often used to describe apps that do not deliver the services they promise, are replicas of other legitimate apps, or possibly containing harmful elements like viruses or spyware. Finally, the line, \\"don't time vest,\\" most likely meant \\"don't waste your time,\\" which implies that the app didn't provide them with value for the time they spent using it. Considering these elements in the review, it's unlikely you'd want to recommend this application to a friend.

President Obama hailed Bergdahl’s recovery as a triumph of years of high-wire diplomatic efforts that reached a breakthrough in the waning months of the U.S. combat mission there. “He wasn’t forgotten by his country,” Obama said Saturday evening in the Rose Garden, standing alongside Bergdahl’s parents, Robert and Jani. “The United States of America does not ever leave our men and women in uniform behind.” His father, who grew a long beard in a gesture of solidarity with his son, said a few words to him in Pashto, the language spoken in southern Afghanistan, saying that he understood his son is having trouble speaking English. “I am your father, Bowe,” Robert Bergdahl said. “I look forward to continuing the recovery of our son which will be a considerable task for our family.” While leaders across the political spectrum expressed relief at the news, prominent Republican lawmakers chided the White House for skirting a legal requirement to notify them about the planned release of Guantanamo inmates. Some criticized the president for breaking with longtime U.S. policy against negotiating with militant groups. “This fundamental shift in U.S. policy signals to terrorists around the world a greater incentive to take US hostages,” Rep. Mike Rogers (R-Mich.), the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said in a statement. The AP reported Hagel, who was traveling to Afghanistan to meet with U.S. troops, as saying that the action was not relayed to Congress because of its urgency. He said intelligence indicated that Bergdahl’s “health was deteriorating.” Bergdahl’s release at 10:30 a.m. in Khost province, which borders Pakistan, capped a week of intense, secret negotiations conducted through the Qataris. A team of dozens of Special Operations forces took custody of Bergdahl from a group of 18 Taliban fighters. The rare encounter on the battlefield between warriors who have spent years killing one another lasted just a few minutes and was peaceful, U.S. officials said. Bergdahl walked onto the aircraft, U.S. officials said, suggesting he is in relatively stable health. Officials said it was too early to know anything definitive about the mental state of a soldier who bewildered his comrades after he walked off base in volatile Paktika province on June 30, 2009. Officials at the Pentagon, who had grown concerned that the end of the U.S. combat mission in Afghanistan at the end of the year would dim the prospect of getting Bergdahl back alive, rejoiced. “It is our ethos that we never leave a fallen comrade,” Gen. Martin E. Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said in a statement. “Today we have back in our ranks the only remaining captured soldier from our conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Welcome home Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl.” There was no indication that the soldier would face any reprimand for the circumstances under which he was taken, which led some of his comrades to call him a deserter. While it is unclear whether he will remain on active duty, a senior U.S. military official said the Army plans to promote Bergdahl to staff sergeant next month. “I can’t imagine there would be repercussions,” said the official, who was among several who would speak about the case only on the condition of anonymity. Defense officials said they were working to get Bergdahl to the United States as soon as possible. After passing through Bagram air base in Afghanistan, Bergdahl was en route to the U.S military hospital in Landstuhl, Germany, according to Pentagon officials traveling with Hagel. They said his first U.S. stop would likely be the Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio, where after a thorough medical screening he will likely be debriefed by intelligence officials. The released inmates include Mullah Mohammad Fazl, a former Taliban deputy defense minister. U.S. officials said that under a memorandum of understanding signed by Washington and Doha, the men will be subject to a year-long travel ban in Qatar. They declined to offer more details about any restrictions the men would face but expressed confidence that their release would not put Americans in harm’s way. “The United States has coordinated closely with Qatar to ensure that security measures are in place and the national security of the United States will not be compromised,” Hagel said in a statement from Singapore, where he was attending a security conference. “Sgt. Bergdahl’s return is a powerful reminder of the enduring, sacred commitment our nation makes to all those who serve in uniform.” Hagel informed members of Congress on Saturday about the prisoner swap deal. The administration is required by law to notify Congress about its intention to release Guantanamo detainees 30 days in advance. “Due to a near-term opportunity to save Sergeant Bergdahl’s life, we moved as quickly as possible,” a senior administration official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to explain the timing of the congressional notification. “The administration determined that given these unique and exigent circumstances, such a transfer should go forward notwithstanding the notice requirement” in the law. The Obama administration began seriously exploring the possibility of negotiating Bergdahl’s release in late 2011, when secret talks between U.S. diplomats and members of the Taliban appeared to be gaining traction. The talks, part of a broader effort to explore a negotiated end of a conflict that had only become deadlier as the White House approved a surge of 30,000 troops in 2009, collapsed in March 2012 when the Taliban suspended them, arguing that the United States was not acting in good faith. Last summer, when the Taliban was allowed to open a political office in the Qatari capital, American officials grew hopeful that prisoner swap negotiations could resume. The effort foundered just hours after the office formally opened after the Afghan government protested that the Taliban had been given de-facto diplomatic status. Unexpectedly, representatives of the Taliban conveyed to U.S. officials last fall that they were once again amenable to discussing the release of Bergdahl, but set as a condition that they would only deal with Washington through intermediaries, American officials said. U.S. officials received a video of Bergdahl last fall after they had demanded proof that he remained alive. Unlike past videos of the captive, the one released last year was delivered privately, rather than through the Taliban’s media operatives. It showed the soldier looking “very gaunt, haggard,” a U.S. military official who has seen clips said. In a departure of its former negotiating stance, the administration sought to enhance the American offer of a prisoner exchange by proposing to release the five men simultaneously. Taliban representatives had objected to the previous proposed plan, under which the inmates would be turned over in stages in an effort to test whether the Taliban and the Qatari intermediaries could guarantee that the men would not return to militancy. A statement issued Saturday by the Taliban said the men would be residing with their families in Qatar, a tiny, wealthy Gulf emirate. U.S. officials said they had no indication that the Taliban was open to more substantive talks but expressed hope that the swap would build trust. “We continue to hope there will be a decision by the Taliban to move forward to initiate a political dialogue with the Afghan government, and it is our hope that the events leading to Sergeant Bergdahl’s return could potentially open the door for broader discussions with the Taliban by building confidence that the two sides can negotiate honestly with each other,” a senior administration official said. The Obama administration has sought to keep Bergdahl’s profile relatively low over the years, fearing that widespread publicity of his plight would boost his value in the eyes of the Taliban and strengthen the group’s negotiating hand. For a period, White House officials asked that several U.S. newspapers refrain from publishing his name in the context of peace talks. As his hopes dimmed, Bergdahl’s father sought to personally secure his son’s release by learning Pashto and attempting to contact the Taliban online. Bergdahl’s parents had traveled to Washington for a Memorial Day event and stayed in town for a few days to attend meetings with senior U.S. officials. They were in Washington when Obama called them Saturday morning to deliver the news, U.S. officials said. “We were so joyful and relieved when President Obama called us today to give us the news that Bowe is finally coming home!” Bergdahl’s parents said in a statement. “We cannot wait to wrap our arms around our only son. Today, we are ecstatic!” In Bergdahl’s home town of Hailey, Idaho, there was jubilation Saturday. Residents had been planning a June 28 concert to call attention to his plight. They were expecting up to 7,000 people to attend, and singer Carole King was going to perform for free. The concert will go on, said organizer Stefanie O’Neill, but it is now going to be “the biggest welcome-home party the country has ever seen.” Kim Harrison, who said she was listed as Bergdahl’s godmother in his military records, said, “I’m excited, I’m kind of numb, and I hope that they take it easy on him when he gets back.” She said she knows Bergdahl as the precocious teenager who took ballet with her daughter and came to spend hours at the Harrison house in Ketchum, Idaho, reading poetry and studying philosophy. She described Bergdahl as a sensitive young man who “questioned everything” and who went to Afghanistan because he wanted to help people. “Now the only thing I can think of worth talking about is protecting him from people criticizing him and trying to find a negative source of why he left in the first place,” she said. Karen DeYoung, traveling in Asia with Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, and Anne Gearan, Julie Tate and Stephanie McCrummen in Washington contributed to this report. Summary:","completion":"In a controversial move, the Obama administration secured the release of US soldier Bowe Bergdahl, held captive by the Taliban for nearly five years, by agreeing to exchange him for five high-profile Afghan detainees held by the US military in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Bergdahl's health and safety were reportedly in jeopardy and officials had to act quickly to save his life. This exchange, which went through Qatari government intermediaries, was hailed by President Obama as a triumph of diplomacy. However, it was met with criticism from some Republican lawmakers for breaking with the long-standing US policy against negotiating with militant groups and for not notifying Congress about the release of Guantanamo inmates. Bowe Bergdahl's release was a result of secret negotiations conducted through the Qataris and marks the only remaining captured soldier from conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan to be returned home alive."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Information: - A symbiotic star is a type of binary star. They are usually a white dwarf with a companion late sequence red giant. They are indicated by the exhibition of spectral lines of the highly contrasting temperatures of the red giant (~3000 K) and the white dwarf (~20 000 K). The white dwarf gains mass from stellar wind from the red giant or gravitational streaming. - In mathematics, the logarithm is the inverse operation to exponentiation. That means the logarithm of a number is the exponent to which another fixed number, the base, must be raised to produce that number. In simple cases the logarithm counts factors in multiplication. For example, the base logarithm of is , as to the power is; 10 is used as a factor three times. More generally, exponentiation allows any positive real number to be raised to any real power, always producing a positive result, so the logarithm can be calculated for any two positive real numbers and where is not equal to . The logarithm of to \\"base\\" , denoted , is the unique real number such that For example, as , then: - A white dwarf, also called a degenerate dwarf, is a stellar core remnant composed mostly of electron-degenerate matter. A white dwarf is very dense: its mass is comparable to that of the Sun, while its volume is comparable to that of Earth. A white dwarf's faint luminosity comes from the emission of stored thermal energy; no fusion takes place in a white dwarf wherein mass is converted to energy. The nearest known white dwarf is Sirius B, at 8.6 light years, the smaller component of the Sirius binary star. There are currently thought to be eight white dwarfs among the hundred star systems nearest the Sun. The unusual faintness of white dwarfs was first recognized in 1910. The name \\"white dwarf\\" was coined by Willem Luyten in 1922. The universe has not existed long enough to experience a white dwarf releasing all of its energy as it will take many billions of years. - Brightness is an attribute of visual perception in which a source appears to be radiating or reflecting light. In other words, brightness is the perception elicited by the luminance of a visual target. This is a subjective attribute/property of an object being observed and one of the color appearance parameters of color appearance models. Brightness refers to an absolute term and should not be confused with Lightness. - A red giant is a luminous giant star of low or intermediate mass (roughly 0.38 solar masses) in a late phase of stellar evolution. The outer atmosphere is inflated and tenuous, making the radius large and the surface temperature as low as 5,000 K and lower. The appearance of the red giant is from yellow-orange to red, including the spectral types K and M, but also class S stars and most carbon stars. - A binary star is a star system consisting of two stars orbiting around their common barycenter. Systems of two or more stars are called \\"multiple star systems\\". These systems, especially when more distant, often appear to the unaided eye as a single point of light, and are then revealed as multiple by other means. Research over the last two centuries suggests that half or more of visible stars are part of multiple star systems. - The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma, with internal convective motion that generates a magnetic field via a dynamo process.<ref name=\\"doi10.1146/annurev-astro-081913-040012\\"></ref> It is by far the most important source of energy for life on Earth. Its diameter is about 109 times that of Earth, and its mass is about 330,000 times that of Earth, accounting for about 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System. About three quarters of the Sun's mass consists of hydrogen (~73%); the rest is mostly helium (~25%), with much smaller quantities of heavier elements, including oxygen, carbon, neon, and iron. - A stellar wind is a flow of gas ejected from the upper atmosphere of a star. It is distinguished from the bipolar outflows characteristic of young stars by being less collimated, although stellar winds are not generally spherically symmetric. - AG Draconis is a binary system consisting of an orange - red giant star and a white dwarf star that revolve around each other every 550 days . It has a baseline apparent magnitude of around 9.8 and flares up to around magnitude 7.3 and is one of the most - studied of symbiotic star systems and its variations in brightness have been observed for 124 years . The outbursts occur every 15 years and last for 3 -- 6 years . The larger star is thought to be an orange giant around 1.5 times as massive as the Sun that has swollen to around 35 times the diameter of the Sun with a spectral type measured at K3IIIep . The smaller star is a compact hot white dwarf around 0.4 times as massive as the Sun , with a surface temperature of around 80,000 K. The star is located in a spherical halo around the Milky Way , and is a nova variable , erupting every 10 -- 15 years . - The apparent magnitude of a celestial object is a number that is a measure of its brightness as seen by an observer on Earth. The brighter an object appears, the lower its magnitude value (i.e. inverse relation). The Sun, at apparent magnitude of 27, is the brightest object in the sky. It is adjusted to the value it would have in the absence of the atmosphere. Furthermore, the magnitude scale is logarithmic; a difference of one in magnitude corresponds to a change in brightness by a factor of , or about 2.512.

Celenda's manservant had purchased two of the biggest and strongest oxen in Fena Kef and they now roasted over the hall's two huge braziers. The smell filled Celenda's nostrils. She closed her eyes and laid back on her silk divan, enjoying the sights and sounds. Her finger fiddled with a torn seam on the divan's armrest and her pleasure faded. She would have flogged her seamstress for allowing such a thing but the woman had fled a year ago. She could barely afford clothing acceptable to a woman of her position, though few could say for certain what that position was, so she simply wore less clothes overall.

Some laughed and shouted on one side, some coupled in the dark shadows and behind silk curtains. Most feasted and drank and everyone partook in the red lotus.

Write an article based on this summary: Actor and comedian John Sessions has criticised BBC \\"management culture\\" as \\"completely out of hand\\".","completion":"Title: John Sessions Blasts BBC's \\"Management Culture\\": When Power Spirals Out of Control Introduction Renowned actor and comedian John Sessions has spoken out against the \\"management culture\\" that he believes is plaguing the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC). His concerns about an imbalance of power at the top levels of the organisation raise important questions about how it's affecting the network's content, creative talent, and overall direction. In this article, we'll examine Mr. Sessions' criticisms of the BBC and explore some potential solutions to this issue. Criticisms of BBC's Management Culture Known for his impressive roles on both stage and screen, John Sessions has never been one to shy away from sharing his thoughts and opinions. Recently, he focused his attention on the BBC, stating that their \\"management culture\\" is \\"completely out of hand.\\" Although he did not provide specific examples or incidents, his criticisms imply that the management team may be exerting too much control over the creative process and the network as a whole. One potential issue with this type of management culture could be the stifling of creativity. The BBC has long been known for producing thought-provoking dramas, hard-hitting news, and iconic comedies. However, if the upper echelons of management are too heavily involved in the creative process, it's possible that they could be unintentionally stifling the voices of the very talent that makes the network so popular. This type of suppression could result in less diverse programming, a lack of innovation, and an overall decline in content quality. Another concern that Mr. Sessions' criticisms allude to is the potential lack of accountability at the BBC. If the management culture is indeed \\"out of hand,\\" it may be unclear who is ultimately responsible for the direction and decision-making of the organisation. This ambiguity within the power structure could lead to a work environment where those in power feel untouchable, leaving them free to make decisions that may not always be in the best interest of the network or its employees. Moreover, this type of management culture could also result in difficulties when it comes to communicating throughout the organisation. Overbearing management practices might stifle open and honest dialogue, making it difficult for individuals to voice concerns or share ideas. This lack of transparency could not only lead to discontent among staff, but may also prevent necessary change and growth from occurring. Potential Solutions To address the concerns raised by John Sessions, it would be essential for the BBC to reassess its management culture and consider new approaches that more effectively nurture collaboration, creativity, and accountability. Some potential steps include: 1. Encourage Open Dialogue: Ensuring that avenues for open and honest communication are readily available at every level of the organisation can help to alleviate issues stemming from overbearing management. This might include establishing regular town-hall meetings, implementing anonymous feedback channels, or simply promoting a more approachable attitude among leadership. 2. Empower Creative Talent: Providing creators with the autonomy and trust they need to explore their ideas can lead to a greater sense of ownership and pride in their work. BBC management should consider taking a step back and allowing writers, directors, and producers more creative freedom, fostering a more innovative culture. 3. Implement Clear Accountability Measures: Establishing clearly defined roles and responsibilities within the organisation can help improve transparency and discourage top-down decision-making. This might involve reassessing current hierarchies and reporting lines, as well as implementing performance metrics for both management and creative staff. 4. Promote Collaboration: Encouraging collaboration between management and creatives can lead to more synergistic and efficient processes. This might involve conducting joint brainstorming sessions or setting up cross-functional teams to work on various projects. By embracing a more collaborative approach, the BBC can ensure that everyone's input is valued and considered. Conclusion BBC is a venerable institution that has long been a pillar of creative achievement in the British and global media landscape. To maintain this status and continue to deliver exceptional content to viewers, it is crucial that the concerns raised by John Sessions be addressed by the organisation. By reassessing its management culture and valuing the input of its creative talent just as much as its executives, the BBC can not only survive, but continue to thrive as a leading global broadcaster."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Research the number of players allowed on an NFL team's active roster. 2. Take into account any additional rules or exceptions that might affect this number for specific games or situations. Step 1: Researching the number of players on an NFL active roster. After researching NFL rules and regulations, I found that each team is allowed to have an active roster of 53 players. Step 2: Considering additional rules or exceptions. Further research indicates that, starting from the 2020 season, NFL teams are allowed to elevate up to two additional players from their practice squad for game day, bringing the total number of players who can suit up for a game to 55. However, if a team chooses to elevate an additional one or two players, their game day roster would include 54 or 55 players, respectively.

Step-by-step justification: 1. Wind and water erode rocks: This is the initial step where natural forces like wind and water cause the breaking down or wearing away of rocks. 2. The wind and water pick up sediment that came off the rocks: As the rocks erode, they produce small particles called sediment. Wind and water carry this sediment away from its source. 3. Sediment is carried to an area by the wind, water, air, or ice: The sediment is transported by various natural agents to a different location. 4. Sediment is deposited on the same spot many times: Over time, more sediment accumulates in the same area, creating layers of sediment. 5. The sediment piles on top of other sediment for a long time: As the process continues, the layers of sediment build upon each other, resulting in a thick layer of accumulated sediment. 6. The sediment near the bottom is compressed by the weight of newer sediment: Finally, the immense weight of the overlying sediment compacts and compresses the sediment at the bottom of the pile. The outcome of this process is the formation of sedimentary rock, which is the result of compacted and cemented sediment layers over time."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article based on this summary: Keeping the current student finance arrangements in Wales is \\"not an option\\", most of the evidence to a major review indicates. Article:","completion":"Title: Maintaining Current Student Finance Arrangements in Wales Deemed Unsustainable Introduction: A major review assessing the current student finance arrangements in Wales has found that the existing system is not sustainable. Critics have pointed to several limitations and issues, suggesting that significant changes are necessary to ensure that education in Wales remains accessible and adequately funded. Body: 1. Reasons for the review The review conducted by the Welsh government aimed to assess the current student finance arrangements in Wales, in light of mounting evidence suggesting it to be flawed. The primary factors contributing to the need for reassessment include ballooning student loan debt, the impact of Brexit on higher education, and the need to ensure the equitable distribution of resources among all students. 2. Unsustainability of the current system The major review noted that the limitations of the existing student finance arrangements in Wales make it an unviable option to maintain in the long run. The primary issues identified include the following: - Insufficient funding: The current system does not provide adequate resources to sustain the growing demand for higher education. This has led to a shortfall in funding for universities, potentially affecting the quality of education. - Rising student debt: With tuition fees and living costs on the rise, students are increasingly dependent on loans to fund their education. As a result, the level of student debt has grown significantly, placing a considerable burden on both the government and individual students. - Inequitable distribution of resources: The existing arrangements disproportionately benefit students from higher-income backgrounds, while students from lower-income households often struggle to access the financial support necessary to complete their studies. 3. Possible solutions The review has made it clear that merely maintaining the current student finance arrangements is not an option. Instead, it calls for a comprehensive overhaul and reform of the existing system. Possible solutions could include: - Introduction of a means-tested grant system: By offering grants to eligible students from lower-income backgrounds, the financial burden on these individuals could be substantially reduced. - Reduction or abolition of tuition fees for qualifying students: Lowering or eliminating tuition fees for students who demonstrate financial need could help promote equitable access to higher education. - Revision of loan repayment terms: Reassessing student loan repayment options, with a focus on income-based repayment plans or lower interest rates, could help to alleviate long-term financial strain for graduates. Conclusion: The findings of the major review make it evident that the current student finance arrangements in Wales are not sustainable. While specific actions must still be determined, the need for systemic change is clear. The Welsh government should prioritize the urgent exploration and implementation of new approaches to ensure that the delivery of a high-quality, accessible education system is achievable for all students in Wales."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A commoner (Kichijiro Ueda) joins them and they tell him that they have witnessed a disturbing story, which they then begin recounting to him. The woodcutter claims he found the body of a murdered samurai three days earlier while looking for wood in the forest; upon discovering the body, he says, he fled in a panic to notify the authorities. The priest says that he saw the samurai with his wife traveling the same day the murder happened. Both men were then summoned to testify in court, where they met the captured bandit TajÅmaru (å¤è¥ä¸¸), who claimed responsibility for killing the samurai and raping his wife. The bandit's story[edit] TajÅmaru (Toshiro Mifune), a notorious brigand, claims that he tricked the samurai to step off the mountain trail with him and look at a cache of ancient swords he discovered. In the grove he tied the samurai to a tree, then brought the samurai's wife there. She initially tried to defend herself with a dagger, but was eventually \\"seduced\\" by the bandit. The woman, filled with shame, then begged him to duel to the death with her husband, to save her from the guilt and shame of having two men know her dishonor. TajÅmaru honorably set the samurai free and dueled with him. In TajÅmaru's recollection they fought skillfully and fiercely, but in the end TajÅmaru was the victor and the woman ran away. At the end of the story to the court, he is asked about an expensive dagger owned by the samurai's wife: he says that, in the confusion, he forgot all about it, and that it was foolish of him to leave behind such a valuable object.

Stallman places great importance on the words and labels people use to talk about the world, including the relationship between software and freedom. He asks people to say free software and GNU/Linux, and to avoid the terms intellectual property and piracy (in relation to copyright). One of his criteria for giving an interview to a journalist is that the journalist agree to use his terminology throughout the article. He has been known to turn down speaking requests over some terminology issues. Stallman argues that the term \\"intellectual property\\" is designed to confuse people, and is used to prevent intelligent discussion on the specifics of copyright, patent, trademark, and other laws by lumping together areas of law that are more dissimilar than similar. He also argues that by referring to these laws as property laws, the term biases the discussion when thinking about how to treat these issues. These laws originated separately, evolved differently, cover different activities, have different rules, and raise different public policy issues. Copyright law was designed to promote authorship and art, and covers the details of a work of authorship or art. Patent law was intended to encourage publication of ideas, at the price of finite monopolies over these ideas - a price that may be worth paying in some fields and not in others. Trademark law was not intended to promote any business activity, but simply to enable buyers to know what they are buying. An example of cautioning others to avoid other terminology while also offering suggestions for possible alternatives is this sentence of an e-mail by Stallman to a public mailing list: I think it is ok for authors (please let's not call them creators, they are not gods) to ask for money for copies of their works (please let's not devalue these works by calling them content) in order to gain income (the term compensation falsely implies it is a matter of making up for some kind of damages).

Information: - Shoot the Living and Pray for the Dead is the original release title of the 1971 Italian dramatic spaghetti western film directed by Giuseppe Vari, and starring Klaus Kinski and Dante Maggio. With its many international releases, the film had additional English titles of \\"Pray to Kill and Return Alive\\", \\"To Kill a Jackal\\", and \\"Renegade Gun\\". The script by Adriano Bolzoni is inspired by American noir-crime films of the 1930s and 1940s, and Kinski's entry into the scene reprises Edward G. Robinson's presence in \\"Key Largo\\" (1948). - Klaus Kinski (born Klaus Günter Karl Nakszynski; 18 October 1926 23 November 1991) was a German actor. He appeared in more than 130 films, and was a leading role actor in the films of Werner Herzog, including \\"Aguirre, the Wrath of God\\" (1972), \\"Nosferatu the Vampyre\\" (1979), \\"Woyzeck\\" (1979), \\"Fitzcarraldo\\" (1982), and \\"Cobra Verde\\" (1987). He also appeared in many Spaghetti Westerns, such as \\"For a Few Dollars More\\" (1965), \\"A Bullet for the General\\" (1966), \\"The Great Silence\\" (1968), \\"And God Said to Cain\\" (1970), \\"Shoot the Living and Pray for the Dead\\" (1971) and \\"A Genius, Two Partners and a Dupe\\" (1975). A controversial figure in Germany, some of Kinski's violent outbursts on set were filmed in Herzog's documentary \\"My Best Fiend\\". - For a Few Dollars More is a 1965 Italian Spaghetti Western film directed by Sergio Leone and starring Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef, and Gian Maria Volontè. German actor Klaus Kinski also plays a supporting role as a secondary villain. The film was released in the United States in 1967 and is the second part of what is commonly known as the \\"Dollars Trilogy\\", following \\"A Fistful of Dollars\\" and preceding \\"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\\". - Aguirre, the Wrath of God, known in the UK as Aguirre, Wrath of God, is a 1972 West German epic film written and directed by Werner Herzog. Klaus Kinski stars in the title role. The soundtrack was composed and performed by West German progressive/Krautrock band Popol Vuh. The story follows the travels of Spanish soldier Lope de Aguirre, who leads a group of conquistadores down the Orinoco and Amazon River in South America in search of the legendary city of gold, El Dorado. Using a minimalist story and dialogue, the film creates a vision of madness and folly, counterpointed by the lush but unforgiving Amazonian jungle. Although based loosely on what is known of the historical figure of Aguirre, the film's storyline is, as Herzog acknowledged years after the film's release, a work of imagination. Some of the people and situations may have been inspired by Gaspar de Carvajal's account of an earlier Amazonian expedition, although Carvajal was not on the historical voyage represented in the film. Other accounts state that the expedition went into the jungles but never returned to civilization. - And God Said to Cain is a 1970 Italian Western film directed by Antonio Margheriti and starring Klaus Kinski. - Nosferatu the Vampyre is a 1979 West German art house vampire horror film written and directed by Werner Herzog. Its original German title is Nosferatu: Phantom der Nacht (\\"Nosferatu: Phantom of the Night\\"). The film is set primarily in 19th-century Wismar, Germany and Transylvania, and was conceived as a stylistic remake of the 1922 German \\"Dracula\\" adaptation \\"Nosferatu\\". It stars Klaus Kinski as Count Dracula, Isabelle Adjani as Lucy Harker, Bruno Ganz as Jonathan Harker, and French artist-writer Roland Topor as Renfield. There are two different versions of the film, one in which the actors speak English, and one in which they speak German. - Fitzcarraldo is a 1982 West German surreal adventure-drama film written and directed by Werner Herzog and starring Klaus Kinski as the title character. It portrays would-be rubber baron Brian Sweeney Fitzgerald, an Irishman known in Peru as Fitzcarraldo, who is determined to transport a steamship over a steep hill in order to access a rich rubber territory in the Amazon Basin. The film is derived from the historic events of Peruvian rubber baron Carlos Fitzcarrald. - Spaghetti Western, also known as Italian Western or Macaroni Western (primarily in Japan), is a broad subgenre of Western films that emerged in the mid-1960s in the wake of Sergio Leone's film-making style and international box-office success. The term was used by American critics and other countries because most of these Westerns were produced and directed by Italians. - Werner Herzog (born 5 September 1942) is a German screenwriter, film director, author, actor, and opera director. - My Best Fiend (literally \\"My Dearest Enemy - Klaus Kinski\\") is a 1999 German documentary film written and directed by Werner Herzog, about his tumultuous yet productive relationship with German actor Klaus Kinski. It was released on DVD in 2000 by Anchor Bay. - A Bullet for the General (Es. \\"Quién sabe?\\"), also known by its international title El Chucho Quién Sabe?, is a 1967 Italian Zapata Western film directed by Damiano Damiani, written by Salvatore Laurani and Franco Solinas, and starring Gian Maria Volontè, Lou Castel, Klaus Kinski and Martine Beswick. The film tells the story of El Chuncho, a bandit, and Bill Tate (or El Nio), who is a counter-revolutionary in Mexico. Chuncho soon learns that social revolution is more important than mere money. This is one of the more famous Zapata Westerns, a subgenre of the spaghetti western which deals with the radicalizing of bad men and bandits into revolutionaries when they are confronted with injustice. Others in this subgenre include \\"Compañeros\\", \\"The Mercenary\\" and perhaps most famously \\"Duck, You Sucker!\\" - A Genius, Two Partners and a Dupe (is a 1975 spaghetti western comedy film directed by Damiano Damiani and Sergio Leone, who directed the opening scene. - Cobra Verde (also known as Slave Coast) is a 1987 German drama film directed by Werner Herzog and starring Klaus Kinski.

It was filmed on location in Brazil, Colombia and Ghana. - The Great Silence, also known by its alternative UK title The Big Silence, is a 1968 revisionist Spaghetti Western film directed and co-written by Sergio Corbucci. An Italian-French co-production, the film stars Jean-Louis Trintignant, Klaus Kinski, Vonetta McGee (in her film début) and Frank Wolff, with Luigi Pistilli, Mario Brega, Marisa Merlini and Carlo D'Angelo in supporting roles. - Rough Justice ( Italian : La belva ) is a 1970 Italian Western film directed by Mario Costa and starring Klaus Kinski .

Bob is particularly harsh, implying that he would not support or house a drug addict, indicating profound disturbance and dissatisfaction with their son's current path. Meanwhile, the mention of the letter and its harshness are part of their argument, but it is not why someone is sickened. The letter seems to have been written as part of their plan to deal with their son's addiction, but the contents or harshness of the letter is not the source of the person's sickness. Therefore albeit both options A and D are correct, if we have to select the one that encapsulates the entirety of the person's emotional state, A. because their son was an addict would be more appropriate.

We need to find the value of z in this equation: -1567 = 128 * z + 481 1. First, we want to get the z term by itself. To do that, let's subtract 481 from both sides of the equation: -1567 - 481 = (128 * z + 481) - 481 2. Now, we will have: -2048 = 128 * z 3. The next step is to isolate z. Since 128 is multiplied by z, we can find the value of z by dividing both sides of the equation by 128: -2048 / 128 = (128 * z) / 128 4.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Hand modeling was never a career I envisioned for myself. I don’t actually think anyone ever dreams of becoming a hand model as a little kid. Hand modeling is something that most people are fairly unaware of -- unless you’ve seen the viral hand model lady video on Youtube, the \\"Zoolander\\" movie, or the episode of \\"Seinfeld\\" where George has a brief hand modeling career. I moved to New York with no intentions of ever being a hand model. I transferred here to finish up my BFA in Fine Arts and Jewelry Design at Parsons the New School of Design. After getting my degree and working at a variety of jewelry companies, I was hired at Bobby Pin Jewelry as a jewelry designer. It was actually while working at Bobby Pin Jewelry that I got thrown into my very first hand shoot. I managed the business’s social media accounts and would often post pictures of my hands wearing rings and bracelets. These pictures would get a high volume of likes, as well as numerous comments about my hands and nails in addition to the jewelry. One fateful day, Bobby Pin Jewelry was being featured in an editorial shoot for TWELV Magazine. The whole shoot was Guy Bourdin-inspired so at the last minute the team painted my nails red and added me to the shoot. In one shot I stood behind the model with my hands on top of her hands, covering her eyes à la Bourdin, and in the second shot I stood behind her again and hugged her from the back. When the editorial finally came out, I figured that I should use the professional looking pictures and reach out to a few beauty photographers to do some test shoots. I managed to get a few test shots as well as some gigs that I found on my own. With the pictures and experience, I was then able to make myself a small hand modeling portfolio. I took my wimpy portfolio and submitted it to a local parts modeling agency in an attempt to see if I could actually do this as a real job. I researched the most reputable parts agencies here in New York and reached out with my new pictures. Without having any real concept of what makes a good hand model, I sent in my pictures and hoped for the best. Fortunately, I got called back and went in for an interview. Suddenly I became very conscious of my hands; I made sure I went out and got a nice manicure before going in to see the agent. During the meeting, the agent checked out my hands and even measured them to determine my glove size. I signed on with her that day and started working soon after. I've since worked on a myriad of shoots that have included advertisements, fashion editorials, cosmetic products, nail art tutorials, artworks, and much more. Like regular modeling, parts modeling can get you a variety of work. I never really know what I'm in for until I arrive on set. On typical shoots I'm chopping food, pouring a drink, holding beauty products, wearing jewelry, or showing off nail art but there can be some odd requests from time to time. My job can get a little strange -- I've been asked to wear a wedding dress so that I could hold a bouquet in front of myself, I've posed with a live Angora rabbit, I've placed my hands on other people’s faces to make it seem like my hands are theirs, and I've been covered in both body paint and glitter. Each job is always a surprise. Hand modeling jobs can also vary in difficulty. Some jobs are as simple as resting your hand flat on a table, while others involve contorting the hell out of your body to get the perfect angle. Usually, the hardest thing about my job is trying to keep my body completely out of frame while holding whatever position my hands are in for a long period of time. My arms and hands have occasionally gone numb from being held up in the air for too long. It also requires a lot of balance and steadiness; your hand cannot be shaking while someone is trying to take a crisp and clear picture. It can be really fun work -- I get to work with some the industries’ most talented and creative individuals, such as well-known photographers and top manicurists. I often shoot nail art tutorials or features so at the end of the day I leave the shoot with amazing manicures. In parts modeling, having the “perfect” part is essential because all of the focus is on one small area of your body. Since working as a hand model professionally, my hand care routine has become much more of a concern. People often ask me how I take care of my hands and, honestly, I don’t go too crazy -- I'm not the type to wear protective gloves all day. I try to be careful to not scratch my hands, bruise them or (of course) break a nail. Moisturizing has become a pretty big deal for me because nothing looks worse on camera than dry or cracked hands. I try keep my skin well moisturized and I pay special attention to my cuticles because mine tend to dry out. Cuticle care is one of my major concerns when it comes to taking care of my hands. Maintaining healthy cuticles helps my nails grow long and strong. I personally don't like cutting my cuticles because I feel like it makes the skin grow back more uneven -- thus causing the need for them to be cut more often. I have no medical evidence for this -- it's just something I've noticed for myself. My hand modeling career has not altered my daily life in any major ways. I might be a little more careful when putting away the dishes or opening a letter, but I still work two other jobs that are pretty hands on in different ways. Hand modeling has been a great way for me to earn extra money and to meet great people. It might not always be the most consistent work or exactly what I dreamed of doing with my life, but I’m enjoying the ride and making it work for me. ||||| These Models Make Money with Hands, Feet Gisele Bundchen, Cindy Crawford and Kate Moss are some of the super-models of the fashion world. But there are other highly paid models whose faces you’ve never seen. These people work in “body parts modeling,” a specialized area of the modeling business. You have probably seen their beautiful hands, exquisite feet or fabulous earlobes in advertisements for elegant gloves, designer shoes or expensive earrings. “Parts models are in huge demand from companies who want the perfect hands, legs, feet or other body parts to advertise their product,” writes Vanessa Helmer, a modeling expert, in a blog on modeling.about.com. Hands, feet and legs are the most requested body parts for both men and women models. But, Helmer notes, if you have beautiful eyes, hair, earlobes, lips or teeth, you can market those, too. It is quite a profitable business. Forbes.com reported that top parts models earn around 1,000 per day for TV commercials, and between 2,000 to 5,000 a day for print work. A female parts model with great legs and feet can earn about 75,000 a year – and even more in New York City, which is home to major advertising agencies. If a modeling agency represents you and finds you modeling work, the agency will take a commission ranging from 10 percent to 20 percent, reports Jobmonkey.com. As with super-models in the fashion world, there are top-of-the-line parts models who get high fees. An example is Ellen Sirot, one of the highest-paid hand and foot models in the U.S. She appeared on a TV show called “The Big Idea,” hosted by Donny Deutsch. Sirot said the very highest-paid hand models can earn as much as 10,000 a day, but “feet modelling doesn’t pay as much because there aren’t as many foot jobs.” Top foot models can earn from 500 to 2,000 per hour, she added. It is not enough to have beautiful hands and feet. You have to be able to “act” with them, too, said Sirot. You need those parts to show emotions and feelings to successfully sell a product. During a photo shoot, feet may need to act “like they’re getting a chill up the spine,” in order to create the right message for a particular product, she explained. To succeed in this area of modeling, you have to keep your hands or feet in exquisite shape. Sirot said she wears shoes one size too big to protect her feet. She said she never wears high heels or pointy shoes – except when she’s modeling. Nicki Donohoe, age 37, is a hand, foot and leg model in Great Britain. She told the Daily Mail that she goes to great lengths to protect them. She wears cotton gloves when she leaves the house -- even when she’s sunbathing. And she moisturizes her hands and feet “up to 10 times a day to keep her fingers and toes in tip-top condition.” Donohoe does about two body-part modeling jobs a week and has appeared on television ads around the world. The former makeup artist told the Daily Mail that being a body parts model is “the hardest work of any job I’ve ever had.” I’m Mary Gotschall.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: Rainfall in an area is important because it influences the rate of weathering. More rain means that more rainwater passes through the soil. The rainwater reacts chemically with the particles. The top layers of soil are in contact with the freshest water, so reactions are greatest there. High rainfall increases the amount of rock that experiences chemical reactions. High rainfall may also carry material away. This means that new surfaces are exposed. This increases the rate of weathering. I am facing a new situation today: Rob is an environmental scientist. He is looking at two samples of soil, sample A and sample B. Sample A is from Amazon Rain-forest, where they get one of the highest rainfall in the world. Sample B is from the Atacama Desert, where they get one of the lowest rainfall in the world. He needs to determine the properties of these samples. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Would new surfaces be exposed or stay covered in sample A? Answer:","completion":"Based on the background article, it can be deduced that more rain leads to increased chemical reactions, which in turn causes weathering of the rocks and soil. In your new situation, sample A is from the Amazon Rainforest where there is one of the highest rainfall levels in the world, while sample B is from the Atacama Desert, which receives one of the lowest rainfall amounts globally. Considering these facts, new surfaces in sample A (from the Amazon Rainforest) would likely be exposed due to the high rainfall in the area. The high amount of precipitation means more water passing through the soil, reacting chemically with the particles, and causing increased weathering. Consequently, material from rocks and soil will be carried away, exposing new surfaces underneath. The increased rate of weathering also leads to the constant exposure of new surfaces in the top layers, as the reactions are more significant there. On the contrary, sample B (from the Atacama Desert) would experience less weathering due to the minimal rainfall, having a lower probability of exposing new surfaces as compared to sample A. Therefore, for sample A, new surfaces would indeed be exposed due to the high rainfall in the Amazon Rainforest, leading to increased chemical reactions and accelerated weathering processes. This scenario presents a stark contrast to the situation in sample B from the Atacama Desert, where the lack of substantial rainfall keeps the surface relatively undisturbed."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I nominate this and BABYLON 5 as the best television sci-fi series made. Both stand out in my mind because unlike early STAR TREK series, there is a consistent evolution of plots and characters. If you look at the original STAR TREK and STAR TREK:TNG, they were fine shows, but there was no overall theme or plot that connected all the episodes. In many ways, you could usually watch the shows totally out of sequence with no difficulty understanding what is occurring. This was less the case with DEEP SPACE 9 (with its giant battles that took up all of the final season) and the other TREK shows, as there was more of a larger story that unified them. This coherence seems to have developed as a concept with BABYLON 5 and saw this to an even greater extent with SG-1. The bottom line is that in many ways this series was like watching a family or a long novel slowly take form. Sure, there were a few \\"throwaway\\" episodes that were not connected to the rest, but these were very few and far between and were also usually pretty funny. And speaking of funny, I loved that SG-1 kept the mood light from time to time and wasn't so dreadfully serious. In this way, I actually enjoyed it more than BABYLON 5. Jack O'Neill was a great character with his sarcasm and love of Homer Simpson--it's really too bad he slowly faded from the series in later seasons. To truly appreciate SG-1, you should watch it from the beginning and see how intricately the plots work. This coherence gives the show exceptional staying power. And, if you don't like SG-1 after giving it a fair chance, then sci-fi is probably NOT the genre for you. Choose your answer.

There are several ways to define \\"money\\", but standard measures usually include currency in circulation and demand deposits (depositors' easily accessed assets on the books of financial institutions). - The Baltic Sea ( ; ) is a sea of the Atlantic Ocean, enclosed by Scandinavia, Finland, the Baltic countries, and the North European Plain. It includes the Gulf of Bothnia, the Bay of Bothnia, the Gulf of Finland, the Gulf of Riga, and the Bay of Gdask. The sea stretches from 53°N to 66°N latitude and from 10°E to 30°E longitude. A mediterranean sea of the Atlantic, with limited water exchange between the two bodies, the Baltic Sea drains through the Danish islands into the Kattegat by way of the straits of Øresund, the Great Belt, and the Little Belt. - Sweden, officially the Kingdom of Sweden (Swedish: ), is a Scandinavian country in Northern Europe. It borders Norway to the west and Finland to the east, and is connected to Denmark in the southwest by a bridge-tunnel across the Öresund. At , Sweden is the third-largest country in the European Union by area, with a total population of 10.0 million. Sweden consequently has a low population density of , with the highest concentration in the southern half of the country. Approximately 85% of the population lives in urban areas. - Legal tender is a medium of payment recognized by a legal system to be valid for meeting a financial obligation. Paper currency and coins are common forms of legal tender in many countries. Legal tender is variously defined in different jurisdictions. Formally, it is anything which when offered in payment extinguishes the debt. Thus, personal cheques, credit cards, and similar non-cash methods of payment are not usually legal tender. The law does not relieve the debt obligation until payment is tendered. Coins and banknotes are usually defined as legal tender. Some jurisdictions may forbid or restrict payment made other than by legal tender. For example, such a law might outlaw the use of foreign coins and bank notes or require a license to perform financial transactions in a foreign currency. - The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of member states that are located primarily in Europe. It has an area of , and an estimated population of over 510 million. The EU has developed an internal single market through a standardised system of laws that apply in all member states. EU policies aim to ensure the free movement of people, goods, services, and capital within the internal market, enact legislation in justice and home affairs, and maintain common policies on trade, agriculture, fisheries, and regional development. Within the Schengen Area, passport controls have been abolished. A monetary union was established in 1999 and came into full force in 2002, and is composed of 19 EU member states which use the euro currency. - Denmark is a Scandinavian country in Europe. The southernmost and smallest of the Nordic countries, it is south-west of Sweden and south of Norway, and bordered to the south by Germany. The Kingdom of Denmark is the sovereign state that comprises Denmark proper and two autonomous constituent countries in the North Atlantic Ocean: the Faroe Islands and Greenland. Denmark has a total area of , and a population of 5.7 million. The country consists of a peninsula, Jutland, and an archipelago of 443 named islands, with the largest being Zealand and Funen. The islands are characterised by flat, arable land and sandy coasts, low elevation and a temperate climate. - An anniversary is the date on which an event took place or an institution was founded in a previous year, and may also refer to the commemoration or celebration of that event. For example, the first event is the initial occurrence or, if planned, the inaugural of the event. One year later would be the first anniversary of that event. The word was first used for Catholic feasts to commemorate saints. - An island or isle is any piece of sub-continental land that is surrounded by water. Very small islands such as emergent land features on atolls can be called islets, skerries, cays or keys. An island in a river or a lake island may be called an eyot or ait, and a small island off the coast may be called a holm. A grouping of geographically or geologically related islands is called an archipelago, e.g. the Philippines. - A currency (from , \\"in circulation\\", from ) in the most specific use of the word refers to money in any form when in actual use or circulation as a medium of exchange, especially circulating banknotes and coins. A more general definition is that a currency is a \\"system of money\\" (monetary units) in common use, especially in a nation. Under this definition, US dollars, British pounds, Australian dollars, and European euros are examples of currency. These various currencies are recognized stores of value and are traded between nations in foreign exchange markets, which determine the relative values of the different currencies. Currencies in this sense are defined by governments, and each type has limited boundaries of acceptance. - Economics (, ) is a social science concerned with the factors that determine the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services. The term \\"economics\\" comes from the Ancient Greek from (', pronounced \\"eekos\\", \\"house\\") and (', \\"custom\\" or \\"law\\"), hence \\"rules of the house (hold for good management)\\". 'Political economy' was the earlier name for the subject, but economists in the late 19th century suggested \\"economics\\" as a shorter term for \\"economic science\\" to establish itself as a separate discipline outside of political science and other social sciences. - Norway (; Norwegian: (Bokmål) or (Nynorsk); Sami: \\"Norgga\\"), officially the Kingdom of Norway, is a sovereign and unitary monarchy whose territory comprises the western portion of the Scandinavian Peninsula plus the island Jan Mayen and the archipelago of Svalbard. The Antarctic Peter I Island and the sub-Antarctic Bouvet Island are dependent territories and thus not considered part of the Kingdom. Norway also lays claim to a section of Antarctica known as Queen Maud Land. Until 1814, the Kingdom included the Faroe Islands (since 1035), Greenland (1261), and Iceland (1262). It also included Shetland and Orkney until 1468. It also included the following provinces, now in Sweden: Jämtland, Härjedalen and Bohuslän. - The Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences (officially , or the Swedish National Bank's Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel), commonly referred to as the Nobel Prize in Economics, is an award for outstanding contributions to the field of economics, and generally regarded as the most prestigious award for that field. - Stockholm (or ) is the capital of Sweden and the most populous city in the Nordic countries; 932,917 people live in the municipality, approximately 1.5 million in the urban area, and 2.3 million in the metropolitan area. The city is spread across 14 islands on the coast in the southeast of Sweden at the mouth of Lake Mälaren, by the Stockholm archipelago and the Baltic Sea. The area has been settled since the Stone Age, in the 6th millennium BC, and was founded as a city in 1252 by a Swedish statesman Birger Jarl. It is also the capital of Stockholm County. - During the 6th millennium BC, agriculture spread from the Balkans to Italy and Eastern Europe, and also from Mesopotamia to Egypt. World population was essentially stable at numbers ranging between approximately 5 and 7 million. - In economics, the monetary base (also base money, money base, high-powered money, reserve money, outside money, central bank money or, in the UK, narrow money) in a country is defined as the portion of a commercial banks' reserves that consist of the commercial bank's accounts with its central bank plus the total currency circulating in the public, plus the currency, also known as \\"vault cash\\", that is physically held in the bank's vault. - The Nobel Prize (; Swedish definite form, singular: \\"Nobelpriset\\") is a set of annual international awards bestowed in a number of categories by Swedish and Norwegian institutions in recognition of academic, cultural, and/or scientific advances. - A saint, also historically known as a hallow, is a term used for a person who is recognized as having an exceptional degree of holiness or likeness to God. Depending on the context and denomination, the term also retains its original Christian meaning, as any believer who is \\"in Christ\\" and in whom Christ dwells, whether in Heaven or on Earth. In Anglican, Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Lutheran, and Oriental Orthodox doctrine, all of their faithful deceased in Heaven are considered to be saints, but some are considered worthy of greater honor or emulation; official ecclesiastical recognition, and consequently veneration, is given to some saints through the process of canonization in the Catholic Church or glorification in the Eastern Orthodox Church. - A monopoly (from Greek \\"mónos\\" (\\"alone\\" or \\"single\\") and \\"pleîn\\" (\\"to sell\\")) exists when a specific person or enterprise is the only supplier of a particular commodity (this contrasts with a monopsony which relates to a single entity's control of a market to purchase a good or service, and with oligopoly which consists of a few sellers dominating a market). Monopolies are thus characterized by a lack of economic competition to produce the good or service, a lack of viable substitute goods, and the possibility of a high monopoly price well above the seller's marginal cost that leads to a high monopoly profit. The verb \\"monopolise\\" or \\"monopolize\\" refers to the \\"process\\" by which a company gains the ability to raise prices or exclude competitors. In economics, a monopoly is a single seller. In law, a monopoly is a business entity that has significant market power, that is, the power to charge overly high prices. Although monopolies may be big businesses, size is not a characteristic of a monopoly. A small business may still have the power to raise prices in a small industry (or market). - Biography. Early life. It is known that Birger grew up and spent his adolescence in Bjälbo, Östergötland but the exact date of his birth remains uncertain and available historical sources are contradictory. Examinations of his mortal remains indicate that he was probably about 50 upon his death in 1266 which would indicate a birth around 1216. However, his father Magnus Minnesköld is assumed to have died no later than 1210, which would lead to an assumed birth a few years earlier. Under any circumstance, he was the son of Ingrid Ylva, who according to Olaus Petri was a daughter of Sune Sik and granddaughter of King Sverker I of Sweden, which would make Birger a matrilineal member of the House of Sverker. His brothers or half-brothers Eskil, Karl, and Bengt were all born long before 1200, and it can therefore be assumed that they had another mother. He was also a nephew of the jarl Birger Brosa from the House of Bjelbo. The combination of this background proved to be of vital importance. - Finland , officially the Republic of Finland, is a sovereign state in Northern Europe. A peninsula with the Gulf of Finland to the south and the Gulf of Bothnia to the west, the country has land borders with Sweden to the northwest, Norway to the north, and Russia to the east. Estonia is south of the country across the Gulf of Finland. Finland is a Nordic country situated in the geographical region of Fennoscandia, which also includes Scandinavia. Finland's population is 5.5 million (2014), staying roughly on the same level over the past two decades. The majority of the population is concentrated in the southern region. In terms of area, it is the eighth largest country in Europe and the most sparsely populated country in the European Union. - A central bank, reserve bank, or monetary authority is an institution that manages a state's currency, money supply, and interest rates. Central banks also usually oversee the commercial banking system of their respective countries. In contrast to a commercial bank, a central bank possesses a monopoly on increasing the monetary base in the state, and usually also prints the national currency, which usually serves as the state's legal tender.

Summarize this article: The dominant home side had endured a frustrating time as Nathan Redmond missed from 12 yards before a Charlie Austin strike hit the crossbar. But just past the hour substitute Austin chested down the ball and sent in a rising shot to put Saints ahead. Gylfi Sigurdsson had a late Swansea chance but saw his low shot saved. Relive Southampton's win over Swansea Southampton, who sold forwards Graziano Pelle and Sadio Mane in the summer, started with Shane Long and Redmond in attack but they struggled as the home side failed to turn their superiority into goals. Long did go close when a low curling shot was saved and was unhappy when Redmond sent an effort high instead of squaring to him. Redmond has been switched from a winger role at former clubs Birmingham and Norwich to striker's duties since his summer switch to St Mary's and showed the lack of a finishing touch. He wasted a glorious chance when he gathered a Dusan Tadic ball and cut inside a defender only to shoot horribly high from 12 yards. Puel brought on Austin for Long, who had been booked for diving, and the the move paid off as he added to his two goals in the midweek Europa League win over Sparta Prague. He had gone close when a shot from a Redmond cross hit the bar and bounced to safety off keeper Lukasz Fabianski's head, but he made amends with a clinical finish after a Tadic cross reached him at the far post. \\"I should have had three,\\" said Austin. \\"I'm frustrated, of course, [to be on the bench] as I scored twice in midweek but if the manager wants to rotate then he is the boss. We have a strong squad.\\" Swansea were clearly hoping to frustrate their hosts and catch them on the counter-attack or with a set-piece but Francesco Guidolin's side lacked the quality to do either. Such was their lack of threat, Southampton comfortably kept their first clean sheet in 17 games, their last one having also come against Swansea in February. Visiting forward Fernando Llorente was provided with little service and when he did get a touch to a Modou Barrow cross Jose Fonte was on hand to block his effort. The next noteworthy chance for the visitors fell to Sigurdsson after 86 minutes - and he would have snatched an undeserved draw had Forster not smartly saved before Oriol Romeu cleared the loose ball to prevent Jefferson Montero turning it in. Swansea are now winless in the league since their opening day victory over Burnley and their next three league games are against Manchester City, Liverpool and Arsenal. Southampton manager Claude Puel: \\"It was a difficult game. I say congratulations to my players - they kept a good spirit and a good attitude. We found the solution to score. \\"It is important for the future. We have to play every few days, many games, and it is hard physically. It is important for the squad to play games and improve and make progress.\\" Media playback is not supported on this device Swansea boss Francesco Guidolin: \\"Southampton deserved to win. For us it was not a good performance. We have to change our attitude - we have to play well and be more aggressive, and this is reason why Southampton won today. \\"Now is not a good moment. To know why, I have to speak with players, my assistants - it is our job.\\" Media playback is not supported on this device Swansea face two home games against in-form Manchester City, with an EFL Cup game on Wednesday, 21 September before a league match three days later.

Bush starred in the 1990 black comedy film Les Dogs, produced by The Comic Strip for BBC television. Bush plays the bride Angela at a wedding set in a post-apocalyptic Britain. In another Comic Strip Presents film, GLC, she produced and sang on the theme song \\"Ken\\". The song was written about Ken Livingstone, the leader of the Greater London Council and future mayor of London, who at the time was working with musicians to help the Labour Party garner the youth vote.Bush wrote and performed the song \\"The Magician\\", using a fairground-like arrangement, for Menahem Golan's 1979 film The Magician of Lublin. The track was scored and arranged by Michael Kamen. In 1986, she wrote and recorded \\"Be Kind to My Mistakes\\" for the Nicolas Roeg film Castaway. An edited version of this track was used as the B-side to her 1989 single \\"This Woman's Work\\". In 1988, the song \\"This Woman's Work\\" was featured in the John Hughes film She's Having a Baby, and a slightly remixed version appeared on Bush's album The Sensual World. The song has since appeared on television shows, and in 2005 reached number-eight on the UK download chart after featuring in a British television advertisement for the charity NSPCC.In 1999, Bush wrote and recorded a song for the Disney film Dinosaur, but the track was not included on the soundtrack. According to the winter 1999 issue of HomeGround, a Bush fanzine, it was scrapped when Disney asked her to rewrite the song and she refused.

The biggest difference is traffic rules. In America there are too much more cars than in China. But there are much fewer traffic jams and accidents in America than in China. We hardly see traffic police in the street, but all cars obey strictly traffic rules, and people hardly find that a car does not obey traffic rules in the street. About American traffic rules, there are many better terms, such as: 1. Stop line: There are stop lines in all crossing without traffic light (some have two stop lines and others have four stop lines). All cars must stop while meeting the stop line. 2. Traffic light: There is traffic light in the crossing of the road. Cars may almost turn every direction. The traffic light can give signal step by step including u-turn. There is a kind of middle lane of turning left. When a car wants to turn left in the road, he may enter into the middle lane of turning left and give a signal of turning left. When he thinks being safe, he may turn left. In many conditions the order of passing is also given very specifically. If people want to change lane or turn, they must look behind and think being safe. Only so, they may do it. 3. Specific item: Such as parking, there are three kinds of lines (their colors are white, blue or red) in the roadside. Every line may park different kinds of cars.

Today, we're going to learn about a super fun and easy way to cook a delicious vegetable called squash. It might look just a little bit funny, like a big, round ball, but it is really yummy and can make us big and strong. We're going to get some help from a magical machine in the kitchen called a microwave. Are you ready? Let's get started! Step 1: Pierce the Squash with a Grown-Up's Help First, we need to get an adult to help us with the squash. Ask them to make little holes all around it using a fork. This is because we don't want our squash to go boom in the microwave! Those little holes let the air come out while the squash is getting warm. Step 2: Use the Magical Microwave Now it's time to put our squash in the microwave. Carefully place it on a microwave-safe plate with a grown-up's help. Set the microwave for 10 to 12 minutes. While it's cooking, we can sing a song or draw a picture of the yummy squash we're going to eat later. Step 3: Wait for the Squash to Cool Down After the microwave beeps, the squash will be very hot! We need to let it cool down for a few minutes, so it's not too hot for our little hands. Maybe you can show a grown-up the picture you drew while waiting. Step 4: Ask a Grown-Up to Cut the Squash Open Now that the squash is not too hot, we can ask a grown-up to cut it open. They will use a big, sharp knife to cut it in half. When it's open, it will have seeds inside, just like a pumpkin! Step 5: Scrape Out the Seeds The last step is to get rid of those seeds. We don't want to eat them, but maybe we can plant them to grow our own squash in the garden! With a grown-up, use a spoon to scrape out the seeds from the inside of the squash. Wow, we did it! Now our squash is ready to eat. You can add a little butter or salt, or even try a tasty recipe with your grown-up. Good job, little chef! You made delicious squash all by yourself using the magical microwave."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

In the solid state, particles are fixed in place, while particles are more free to move in the liquid and gas states. The particles in the solid and liquid states “stick together,” but in the gas state, they move freely about the container. In general, it requires energy to separate individual particles. If we want to make a solid adopt a liquid form, we can add energy in the form of heat, increasing the temperature of the substance. Conversely, if we want to convert a substance from a gas to a liquid or from a liquid to a solid, we remove energy from the system and decrease the temperature.

Large island had a lot of seismic activity, and Small island that presented almost no seismic activity. But I can use this background: Geologists study earthquake waves to “see” Earth's interior. Waves of energy radiate out from an earthquake’s focus. These waves are called seismic waves ( Figure below ). Seismic waves go different speeds through different materials. They change speed when they go from one type of material to another. This causes them to bend. Some seismic waves do not travel through liquids or gases. They just stop. Scientists use information from seismic waves to understand what makes up the Earth’s interior. What is an answer for this question: Which island displayed fewer seismic waves? Answer:","completion":"The Small island displayed fewer seismic waves. In the given situation, the Large island had a lot of seismic activity, and the Small island presented almost no seismic activity.

Reuse: This involves finding new ways to use items that would have otherwise been discarded. For example, you can repurpose glass jars as storage containers or turn old clothing into cleaning rags, which helps to extend the lifecycle of these items and prevent them from ending up in the landfill. 3. Recycle: This step focuses on properly disposing of waste so that materials can be transformed into new products. Recycling reduces the demand for raw materials and helps to save energy.

Article: The focused beam of illumination will make it easier to catch sight of pests tucked away in dark spaces. Whenever possible, hold your flashlight close to the surface you're inspecting at a parallel angle. This will cause bugs and their eggs to cast a more noticeable shadow. While you're at it, turn on all of the lights in the room to maximize your visibility. Contrary to popular belief, light usually doesn't do much to keep bed bugs away. When you spy a cluster of bugs, insert your tool into the infested space and slowly drag it towards you to scrape them out. Hold the edge of the tool firmly against the surface and angle it to cover more ground and ensure that none of the bugs have a chance to scurry free. Ideally, the tool you use should be relatively durable. That way, you won't have to worry about it breaking accidentally. You probably won't be able to fish out every last pest like this, but it can be a good way to thin their numbers. Mash the tape or cloth directly into the pests, aiming to pick up as many as you can. Due to their size, they'll have a hard time escaping from the adhesive or moist, textured cloth. Stickier types of tape, such as duct or packing tape, will offer the best results. If you decide to go with the damp cloth approach, keep a small container of hot, soapy water nearby where you can deposit the bugs you collect. If you're using tape, fold the piece over on itself to make absolutely sure the bed bugs will stay stuck. If you're using a cloth, submerge it in your bucket of water and wring it out thoroughly to loosen the bugs. Throw the tape in a sealed trash receptacle outside and dump bug-filled water a safe distance from your home. After doing battle with bed bugs, always wash the clothes you're wearing as a precautionary measure. You can also heat-treat clothing and accessories in the dryer for 30 minutes if you don't have time to do a full load of laundry. Be sure to scrub your bucket with hot water and a powerful detergent to kill bacteria left behind by bugs or their skin castings or droppings.

Q:Jimbob Blakey wasn't so much given birth to as clambered right out of his mother himself. He weighed in at almost thirteen pounds, came ready-fitted with a shock of fat black hair and a couple of razor teeth. Jimbob's folks loved him like most folks love their little ones, maybe more. They'd been trying so hard for a child, suffered more mid-term miscarriages than the ewes they shuttled off to market most Thursdays. They dressed him in a one-year babygro and took him home to their hill farm. They fought to get up nights and give him his milk. His teeth made breast-feeding impossible. They sat hours gazing down in his cot. They dressed him fine and took him to their church and gave their thanks. Showed him off like the proud parents they were. Others cooed and smiled. But they never asked to hold. They gave thanks the Blakeys were happy, and that the monkey-baby had not been born to them. Jimbob's folks never gave a second thought that their boy might be different. The first Spring he walked, he stomped the moors in his welly-boots helping herd the pregnant ewes down in-by. He copied his father, kicking and cuffing at the stragglers, when the flock was returned to the hills in May. As Jimbob grew, his hair became thicker, his arms longer. His head shrunk down on his shoulders. At check-ups, nurses fixed smiles and pronounced him healthy. Doctors said, 'he'll make you a strapping lad.' His mother smiled, her heart swelled. When he was three, she sent him to nursery. She wanted him to mix with other kids. To taste life off the hard hills. She said, 'it'll do him the world of good.' Jimbob hated leaving the farm. He clung to his mother. She drove away, blinking tears. On the third day, she took a phone call. 'It's Jimbob,' they said. 'He's scaring the other kids.'The truth hit Jimbob's mother like a hammer.

His plan revolves around using his skills in disguise and his knowledge of the inner workings of the Secret Service to get close enough to the president to carry out the assassination. Booth and Lee are historical figures mentioned in the movie but are not directly involved in the plot, as they were real-life assassins who killed US presidents in the past. John Wilkes Booth assassinated President Abraham Lincoln in 1865, and Lee Harvey Oswald assassinated President John F. Kennedy in 1963. Their presence in the movie serves as a haunting background and adds to the tension, as Frank Horrigan (Clint Eastwood), a Secret Service agent, seeks to prevent Leary's assassination plan. Horrigan carries with him the personal guilt for being unable to protect JFK in the past. As the story unfolds, Leary engages Horrigan in a psychological battle, playing a cat and mouse game with him. Leary challenges Horrigan to stop him from carrying out the assassination, which puts Horrigan to the ultimate test - to overcome his guilt, protect the current president, and redeem himself by stopping Leary's plan."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Context: In July, after being off for a month, he played in 21 games and hit .494 (42–85), raising his season average to .390. Brett started a 30-game hitting streak on July 18, which lasted until he went 0–3 on August 19 (the following night he went 3-for-3). During these 30 games Brett hit .467 (57–122). His high mark for the season came a week later, when Bretts batting average was at .407 on August 26, after he went 5-for-5 on a Tuesday night in Milwaukee Brewers. He batted .430 for the month of August (30 games), and his season average was at .403 with five weeks to go. For the three hot months of June, July, and August 1980, George Brett played in 60 American League games and hit .459 (111–242), most of it after a return from a monthlong injury. For these 60 games he had 69 RBIs and 14 home runs. Question: How many days did Brett's hitting spree last? Answer:","completion":"To determine the number of days Brett's hitting spree lasted, we need to look at the start and end dates of his 30-game hitting streak. The hitting streak started on July 18 and ended on August 19. First, we need to find out how many days were left in July: 31 days in July - 18 days (July 1st to July 17th) = 13 days (July 18th to July 31st) Now, we need to consider the days in August until the hitting spree ended: 19 days (August 1st to August 19th) Now, we will add both values to find the total number of days: 13 days (in July) + 19 days (in August) = 32 days So, Brett's hitting spree lasted for 32 days."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Unlike the situation with the states, there is no plenary reception statute at the federal level that continued the common law and thereby granted federal courts the power to formulate legal precedent like their English predecessors. Federal courts are solely creatures of the federal Constitution and the federal Judiciary Acts. However, it is universally accepted that the Founding Fathers of the United States, by vesting \\"judicial power\\" into the Supreme Court and the inferior federal courts in Article Three of the United States Constitution, thereby vested in them the implied judicial power of common law courts to formulate persuasive precedent; this power was widely accepted, understood, and recognized by the Founding Fathers at the time the Constitution was ratified.

What stopped me was that I was afraid to start studying again. I always believed I would learn by myself. One day, however, my son told me that he was sad because his friends would come over and I didn't understand them because I didn't speak English. He was also sad because I could never help him with his homework.

I came in to see if I could join, but the classes were closed already. That night I took the kids to the movies, and on the way back, I told them we would take a new route. I ended up getting lost.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Danzig was born Glenn Allen Anzalone, the third of four sons born to a Protestant family of Italian, German, and Scottish heritage in Lodi, New Jersey. His father was a television repairman and a United States Marine Corps veteran of World War II and the Korean War. His mother worked at a record store. Danzig and his family also spent some time living in Revere, Massachusetts. Danzig has said he wishes to avoid extensive and exhaustive touring in the future, preferring instead to focus on his various music, film and comic book projects: \\"I don't really want to tour. My reason for not doing it is because I'm bored of it. I like being onstage, but I don't like sitting around all day doing nothing. I could be home, working.\\" Danzig has started work on a third Black Aria album, and a covers album is set for release by the end of 2013. Danzig hopes to record a dark blues album involving Jerry Cantrell and Hank III. He is currently working on new Danzig material with Tommy Victor and Johnny Kelly. In 2014, Danzig filed a lawsuit against Misfits bassist Jerry Only claiming Only registered trademarks for everything Misfits-related in 2000 behind Danzig's back, misappropriating exclusive ownership over the trademarks for himself, including the band's iconic \\"Fiend Skull\\" logo, violating a 1994 contract the two had. Danzig claims that after registering the trademarks, Only secretly entered into deals with various merchandisers and cut him out of any potential profits in the process. On August 6, 2014, a U.S. district judge in California dismissed Danzig's lawsuit. On October 21, 2015 during an interview with Loudwire, Danzig stated his current tour with Superjoint could be his last.

It is also the second largest lake in the world. It is an important lake because it is one of the sources for the longest river in the world, the Nile River.Lake Victoria provides a source of water, food, and power for several African countries.Lake Victoria is a big part of African life. Unfortunately, Lake Victoria has a problem. _ .There are several power stations at Lake Victoria in Uganda. These are on the Nile River, and besides producing power, they keep the water of the lake at a certain level.For the past forty years, that level has been 11.9 meters.Over the last several years, the water level has dropped by about 2.5 meters.There seem to be several reasons for this drop. One possible reason is drought .Drought has been very bad in the area since 2000.Lake Victoria gets all of its water from rain, so the drought means less water in the lake. However, some environmentalists believe that the real problem is the power plants(factories) on Lake Victoria. Uganda depends on those power plants for most of its power, and they made the power plants larger in 2000.Many people believe the power plants have been taking too much water off Lake Victoria. As a result, they have been asked to use less water until Lake Victoria goes back to its old level. Whether the low water level is caused by drought or power plants, the result is the same.This is already a poor area of Africa, where many people live a really hard life.People, animals and plants around Lake Victoria will suffer even more from low water levels on the lake.Many people need Lake Victoria for fishing or growing food. Fish need the water to live, and animals need it for water.Plants around the lake will die without the water, and then more animals and people will suffer.Unless the lake fills soon, many people will suffer and die.

Counter terrorism teams are working to trace the girls and bring them back.","completion":"Title: The Perilous Journey of Two British Teens: The Lure of ISIS and the Fight to Bring Them Home Intro: The story of two 16-year-old girls from Manchester, who secretly traveled to Syria in a bid to join their brother, an ISIS fighter, has made headlines and gripped the nation. As their distraught family and counter-terrorism teams work tirelessly to trace the girls and bring them back home, questions arise about just how these two seemingly ordinary teens were compelled to make this perilous journey. The Daring Escape: The girls, whose family settled in Britain from Somalia 10 years ago, managed to fly from Manchester International Airport to Istanbul, Turkey, without raising any suspicion. On the morning of the escape, their parents woke up to find their daughters missing, only to later discover they had made their way to Syria. To comprehend just how these two seemingly ordinary teenagers could make this perilous journey by themselves, it is essential to understand the factors that may have motivated them. The Family Connection: As the sisters of an ISIS fighter, it is believed that the girls' familial ties played a significant part in their journey to Syria. Despite all appearances, the powerful lure of belonging to a group claiming to offer a sense of purpose and a shared cause proved all too strong for these young, impressionable girls. Further investigations into the conditions at their home and the family's move from Somalia to Britain might shed some light on the factors that led to their radicalization. Counter-terrorism Efforts: In the wake of this shocking news and the ongoing threat of ISIS recruitment, counter-terrorism teams are not only working around the clock to trace these missing girls but are also intensifying their efforts to bring them back home. The British government is leveraging the power of international cooperation and is likely engaging with partners in Turkey and Syria to expedite their return. The Greater Problem: This isn't an isolated incident. The unfortunate tale of these two young girls has brought to light the worrying issue of vulnerable teenagers and young adults being targeted by extremist groups such as ISIS. The consequences of radicalization for these individuals and their families are often severe and life-changing. Familial connections, social media influence, and peer circles often play a major role in influencing vulnerable teens to make such life-altering decisions, moving from their relatively safe homes to hostile regions and joining dangerous organizations. Conclusion: The journey made by these 16-year-olds is an unsettling reminder of the allure extremist groups pose to impressionable youths. As the girls' family and authorities continue to work relentlessly to trace their whereabouts and bring them home, it is vital that this tragedy serves as a wake-up call for Britain and beyond. Now, more than ever, the fight against radicalization must also include the development of prevention strategies that focus on the root causes, incorporating education, robust community engagement, and open dialogue, to ensure that such stories become a thing of the past."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Parsees are followers of which religion?","completion":"Parsees, also known as Parsis, are followers of Zoroastrianism, one of the world's oldest monotheistic religions. Zoroastrianism originated in ancient Persia, which is present-day Iran, around the 6th century BCE. It is based on the teachings of the prophet Zoroaster, also known as Zarathustra in the ancient Iranian language, Avestan. Zoroastrianism was the official religion of the Persian Empires, including the Achaemenid, Parthian, and Sassanian Empires, before the advent of Islam in the 7th century CE. Zoroastrianism centers around the concept of the single supreme deity, Ahura Mazda, who represents wisdom, goodness, and truth. According to Zoroastrian beliefs, Ahura Mazda created the world and is constantly in a struggle against the forces of evil, personified by Angra Mainyu (also known as Ahriman). This struggle between good and evil is a central theme in Zoroastrianism and is mirrored in the moral choices and actions of humanity. The primary religious text of Zoroastrianism is the Avesta, which comprises various sections, such as the Yasna, Visperad, Vendidad, and Yashts. The most important part of the Avesta is the Gathas, a collection of 17 hymns believed to be composed by Zoroaster himself. The Gathas serve as the foundation of Zoroastrian theology and philosophy, emphasizing the importance of individual responsibility, free will, and the ultimate consequences of one's moral choices in life. Zoroastrians worship through prayers and rituals that involve the use of various elements like fire, water, and earth. Fire, in particular, is a significant symbol in Zoroastrianism and represents divine light, purity, and the presence of Ahura Mazda. Fire temples, known as Atash Behrams or Agiaries, are the primary places of worship for Zoroastrians, where sacred fires are maintained by priests called Mobeds. The Parsees, as followers of Zoroastrianism, began their journey in India around the 8th or 10th century CE. They migrated from Persia to the western coast of India in response to the Islamic conquest of Persia and the subsequent decline of Zoroastrianism. Upon their arrival, they settled in the region of Gujarat, where they were granted asylum and protection by the local ruler, Jadi Rana. Over time, the Parsees integrated with the local Indian population, while still maintaining their distinct religious and cultural identity. Today, the Parsee community is a small but influential minority in India, particularly in the city of Mumbai. They are known for their significant contributions to Indian society in various fields such as business, philanthropy, science, and arts. Some notable Parsees include Jamsetji Tata, founder of the Tata Group; industrialist J.R.D. Tata; musician Freddie Mercury; and nuclear scientist Homi J. Bhabha. Despite their small numbers, the Parsees continue to play a crucial role in preserving the legacy and traditions of Zoroastrianism for future generations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

John is learning about different states of matter. So far, he recognized three states of matter, state A, state B, and state C. State A is in solid state. State B is in liquid state, and state C is in gaseous state. He needs to learn more about their individual characteristics. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: In which state the particles would be farther, state B or state C? Hint: Start right above point on the temperature axis and follow the red line vertically. At very low pressure, the particles of the substance are far apart from one another and the substance is in the gas state. As the pressure is increased, the particles of the substance are forced closer and closer together. Eventually the particles are pushed so close together that attractive forces cause the substance to condense into the liquid state. Continually increasing the pressure on the liquid will eventually cause the substance to solidify. For the majority of substances, the solid state is denser than the liquid state and so putting a liquid under great pressure will cause it to turn into a solid. The line segment represents the process of sublimation, where the substance changes directly from a solid to a gas. At a sufficiently low pressure, the liquid phase does not exist. The point labeled is called the triple point . The triple point is the one condition of temperature and pressure where the solid, liquid, and vapor states of a substance can all coexist at equilibrium.","completion":"Based on the given information and hint provided, the particles would be farther apart in state C, which is the gaseous state.

Instead, Riley may perceive disagreements or misunderstandings as opportunities to further ignite tension and engage in conflict. This suggests that Riley may possess a confrontational personality, with a proclivity for asserting their viewpoint or standing their ground, even when it might be more harmonious to yield or compromise. Riley's behavior may stem from a strong sense of self and might indicate that they value their opinions or beliefs highly.

And the answer is...","completion":"To solve the given equation 0 = 4*w + 25 - 9 for w, follow these steps: Step 1: Simplify the equation. Combine like terms on the right side of the equation. In this case, the constant terms (25 and -9) can be combined: 0 = 4*w + (25 - 9) Subtract 9 from 25: 0 = 4*w + 16 Step 2: Isolate the variable (w). To isolate the variable w, you need to move the constant term on the right side to the left side. This can be done by subtracting 16 from both sides of the equation: 0 - 16 = 4*w + 16 - 16 Simplifying the equation, we get: -16 = 4*w Step 3: Solve for w.

Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers: How can a molecule containing just 4 different nucleotides specify the sequence of the 20 amino acids that occur in proteins? If each nucleotide coded for 1 amino acid, then obviously the nucleic acids could code for only 4 amino acids. What if amino acids were coded for by groups of 2 nucleotides? There are 42, or 16, different combinations of 2 nucleotides (AA, AU, AC, AG, UU, and so on). Such a code is more extensive but still not adequate to code for 20 amino acids. However, if the nucleotides are arranged in groups of 3, the number of different possible combinations is 43, or 64. Here we have a code that is extensive enough to direct the synthesis of the primary structure of a protein molecule. The genetic code can therefore be described as the identification of each group of three nucleotides and its particular amino acid. The sequence of these triplet groups in the mRNA dictates the sequence of the amino acids in the protein. Each individual three-nucleotide coding unit, as we have seen, is called a codon. Protein synthesis is accomplished by orderly interactions between mRNA and the other ribonucleic acids (transfer RNA [tRNA] and ribosomal RNA [rRNA]), the ribosome, and more than 100 enzymes. The mRNA formed in the nucleus during transcription is transported across the nuclear membrane into the cytoplasm to the ribosomes—carrying with it the genetic instructions. The process in which the information encoded in the mRNA is used to direct the sequencing of amino acids and thus ultimately to synthesize a protein is referred to as translation. Before an amino acid can be incorporated into a polypeptide chain, it must be attached to its unique tRNA. This crucial process requires an enzyme known as aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (Figure 19.12 \\"Binding of an Amino Acid to Its tRNA\\"). There is a specific aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase for each amino acid. This high degree of specificity is vital to the incorporation of the correct amino acid into a protein.

Kimberley Ann \\"Kim\\" Deal (born June 10, 1961) is an American singer, songwriter and musician, best known as the former bassist and backing vocalist of the alternative rock band Pixies, and the lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist for The Breeders. Deal joined Pixies in January 1986 as the band's bassist, adopting the stage name Mrs. John Murphy for the albums Come on Pilgrim and Surfer Rosa. Following Doolittle and The Pixies' hiatus, she formed The Breeders with Tanya Donelly, Josephine Wiggs and later introduced her identical twin sister Kelley Deal. The Pixies broke up in early 1993, and Deal returned her focus to The Breeders, who released the platinum-selling album Last Splash in 1993. Deal was born in Dayton, Ohio. Her father was a laser physicist who worked at the nearby Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. Kim and her identical twin sister Kelley were introduced to music at a young age; the two sang to a \\"two-track, quarter-inch, tape\\" when they were \\"four or five\\" years old, and grew up listening to hard rock bands such as AC/DC and Led Zeppelin. When Deal was 11, she learned Roger Miller's \\"King of the Road\\" on the acoustic guitar. In high school, at Wayne High School in Huber Heights, she was a cheerleader and often got into conflicts with authority. \\"We were popular girls,\\" Kelley explained. \\"We got good grades and played sports.\\" Living in Dayton was for her like living in Russia: a friend of Kelley's living in California used to send them cassettes of artists like James Blood Ulmer, Undertones, [Elvis] Costello, Sex Pistols and Siouxsie [and the Banshees]. \\"These tapes were our most treasured possession, the only link with civilization\\". As a teenager, she formed a folk rock band named The Breeders with her sister. She then became a prolific songwriter, as she found it easier to write songs than cover them. Deal later commented on her songwriting output: \\"I got like a hundred songs when I was like 16, 17 ... The music is pretty good, but the lyrics are just like, OH MY GOD. We were just trying to figure out how blue rhymes with you. When I was writing them, they didn't have anything to do with who I was.\\" The Deals bought microphones, an eight-track tape recorder, a mixer, speakers, and amps for a bedroom studio. According to Kelley, they \\"had the whole thing set up by the time we were 17\\". They later bought a drum machine \\"so it would feel like we were more in a band\\". Following high school, Deal went to seven different colleges, including The Ohio State University, but did not graduate from any of them.

Count the number of diet books on your bookshelf, the e-books on your computer and the magazines on the coffee table. Have any of them given you permanent weight loss? Question: Why do you need to commit totally to your diet? === The answer to the above question is A:","completion":"In order to reach your goals and become in tune with your body. Committing totally to your diet is essential to break free from the diet cycle mentality and experience lasting weight loss. This commitment helps you understand your body's unique physical and emotional needs and find a balanced approach to achieving your goals. Connecting with your body’s hunger signals and eating mindfully are crucial elements that lead to long-term success in weight management. The commitment to a diet doesn't mean following a fad or extreme eating plan but recognizing that there is no magic cure or one-size-fits-all solution. It entails embracing a healthier lifestyle and selecting a sustainable eating pattern that can be maintained over time. An individualized approach, listening to your body, being consistent, and making conscious food choices are essential aspects of total commitment to your diet. Moreover, this commitment supports the development of healthy habits, which eventually replace old, destructive patterns. It promotes discipline, motivation, and a desire for self-improvement, aligning your actions with your health goals. By fully engaging in a healthier lifestyle, you'll be more inclined to overcome challenges and maintain momentum on your journey toward weight loss and better well-being. By committing totally to your diet, you allow yourself to build a healthy relationship with food and remove the emotional baggage often associated with dieting and binge eating. This translates to understanding the purpose of nutrition and how it impacts your overall health and fitness, integrating dietary changes seamlessly into your life, and enjoying the process rather than considering it a punishment or restriction.

Here's the justification for each step: Step 1: The initial sentence states, \\"they are monitored by the state school board.\\" In this sentence, \\"they\\" refers to an unspecified group or entities, and \\"monitored by the state school board\\" is the action being performed on this group or entities. This indicates that the state school board is assigned to supervise or keep a check on these unspecified entities. Step 2: When we rephrase this sentence, the object (the state school board) becomes the subject and the original subject (the unspecified entities) becomes the object. The verb expression (monitors), which indicates the action, remains the same in essence but changes to conjugate correctly with the new subject. Step 3: Putting the newly formed subject, verb, and object together, we get \\"The state school board monitors them.\\" This sentence retains the original meaning -- that the act of monitoring is being done by the state school board over the unspecified entities.

Summarize this article: The fire is continuing to spread in the mountain town of Lake Isabella and officials say at least 1,500 more buildings are at risk. An elderly couple trying to flee the flames were overcome by smoke outside their house and killed, police said. The blaze is one of several fires sparked by recent hot weather across the western United States. Thousands of firefighters have been involved in attempts to control blazes across California, where soaring temperatures and 20mph winds combined with five years of drought have helped fires to spread. The Lake Isabella fire started about 40 miles (65km) north-east of Bakersfield in central California at about 16:00 local time (23:00 GMT) on Thursday. It spread 11 miles in 13 hours, engulfing 8,000 acres (3,240 hectares) of parched grass, officials say. The couple who died were found outside their house near Lake Isabella on Friday, fire department officials said. \\"It's a firefight of epic proportions,\\" said Kern County Fire Department's Brian Marshall said at a news conference. \\"There's not enough firefighters and fire trucks to put in front of every structure.\\" Roads have been closed, power has been knocked out and evacuations ordered in several communities, according to fire information website InciWeb, which says evacuees are being sheltered at a school. Investigators are working to establish the cause of the fire, which remains unknown. TV footage showed firefighting helicopters hovering amid billowing clouds of smoke as flames consumed homes and roared through the Kern County foothills.

What was elijah mccoy famous for? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Elijah McCoy was famous for being a prolific African American inventor and engineer during the 19th and early 20th centuries. He was born on May 2, 1844, in Colchester, Ontario, Canada, to parents who had escaped enslavement in the United States. McCoy was trained as a mechanical engineer in Scotland and ultimately settled in Ypsilanti, Michigan. His most significant and well-known invention was an automatic lubrication system for steam engines, which he patented in 1872 as the \\"Improvement in Lubricators for Steam-Engines.\\" The device, also known as the \\"McCoy Lubricator\\" or \\"Real McCoy,\\" used a drip cup system that allowed oil to flow continuously onto the moving parts of steam engines and other machinery. This invention eliminated the need for frequent stops to manually lubricate the machinery, greatly improving efficiency and reducing wear and tear. Elijah McCoy's automatic lubricator was so effective that it became widely adopted by various industries, revolutionizing the railway and shipping industries. It contributed to the growing momentum of the industrial revolution, as machines could now operate for longer periods without breakdowns and maintenance. Throughout his lifetime, Elijah McCoy held over 50 patents. His other inventions included designs for folding ironing boards, lawn sprinklers, and other devices intended to make daily life more comfortable and efficient. McCoy's reputation led to the popular expression \\"the real McCoy,\\" which signifies authenticity and high quality, in reference to his highly effective and reliable inventions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

In his twilight years, the 89-year-old Philadelphia man was forced to defend himself against accusations that he was more than a mere perimeter guard at the notorious Auschwitz camp, where more than 1 million people, most of them Jews, were killed during World War II. He maintained that he never persecuted anyone. In 2003, a U.S. court ruled that he was not responsible for joining a Nazi unit because he was only 17 years old at the time. But new evidence has emerged, U.S. and German prosecutors say, that shows Breyer had to have been involved in the crimes that occurred in that place. Breyer, who has lived in the United States since the 1950s, is facing possible extradition to Germany following his arrest Tuesday in Philadelphia, authorities said. Federal Magistrate Judge Timothy R. Rice on Wednesday ordered him held without bail, pending an extradition hearing in late August. \\"Extradition is traditionally a very long and complicated process,\\" CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said. \\"It's always possible to fight extradition. It just often takes a long time.\\" German authorities alleged that Breyer served in the Nazi \\"Death's Head Guard Battalion\\" from 1943 to 1945 at the Auschwitz II-Birkenau concentration camp and at another location, according to court papers. German authorities have charged Breyer with complicity in the murder of more than 216,000 European Jews from Hungary, Germany, and Czechoslovakia, who were forcibly deported to Auschwitz, in southern Poland, on 158 trains between May and October 1944, according to court documents filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. 1.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize this article in one sentence. No one was murdered that night in 2009, but panic spread as the Mexican town of San Marcos was submerged in water. The huge Picachos dam, 7km (four miles) away, had flooded during construction work, a disaster that some residents had foreseen. Six small communities in Sinaloa, north-west Mexico, were devastated and 800 families were displaced. For years afterwards, Picachos became synonymous with the residents' fight for compensation, for their lost land and livelihoods. The vast majority of those who lived in the area moved away long ago, but not everyone wanted to leave. Eight years on, a handful of people still live among the ruins. Cipriano Osuna, known as Pani, never thought of going anywhere else, because his family had lived in San Marcos for generations. Every day, he still works on repairing the local church, even though it lost its priest and congregation long ago. He paints it and turns on the lights, just in case someone passes by. It is a special place for Pani, where he was baptised, took his first communion, got married, and later baptised his children and grandchildren. Every year, on the anniversary of his father's death, he hires a priest from a neighbouring village to say mass. \\"A lot of people think I'm crazy to stay. I don't care what they think,\\" he says. Although it hurts him to be constantly reminded of the losses, he insists life goes on much as it ever did. \\"I live at ease here. Who has been killed by loneliness?\\" Pani's only neighbours are Yoya and Jaimito. \\"When you go to the new San Marcos now, they look at us as if we are strange,\\" says Yoya, whose real name is Maria Aura Lamphar. The \\"new San Marcos\\" is where almost all of the 300 inhabitants of the first San Marcos went. Just a kilometre separates the two San Marcos, but they feel worlds apart. \\"[The others] went there and, according to them, they improved. We stayed and we didn't,\\" Yoya says, laughing. There is not much to do in this semi-abandoned area. In the rainy season, it is still partially submerged in water. But Yoya says she is happy, religiously respecting her routine. She keeps herself busy by doing household chores, watering the plants, sewing, watching the TV and reading the Bible. And while Yoya has learnt to enjoy loneliness, Ramiro Osuna fights it every day. He has lived in the area for 50 years. \\"I get bored, I get angry. I would like to see the world, to see another landscape,\\" he says. Although he mostly lives in the new town, he still visits his old home once a week. \\"There is nostalgia, yes, there is nostalgia, and that's life.\\" The new San Marcos has a health centre, a school, a church (also without priest), one butcher and three shops, one of which is owned by Ramiro. Many of its houses remain empty. The abandoned houses in the old San Marcos have now been invaded by the trees. The chirping of countless birds is constant. Lorenzo, Hortensia's husband, walks around the square while a flock of crows flies through a clear sky. He stands in the middle of debris and recalls how it once was. \\"It was big, very pretty. Look at the structure, it had seven bedrooms, a 12-metre corridor,\\" he says. \\"It's very hard to see it like this. I slept there; my children were born here.\\" Lorenzo and Hortensia now live in the port town of Mazatlán, an hour's drive away, but they come to the new San Marcos once a week. Both of them were involved in early protests against the construction of the dam and, later, became involved in the displaced persons' rights campaign. The leader of that movement, Atilano Roman Tirado, was a close friend. He died after he was shot while presenting his radio show in Mazatlán in 2014. The bullets passed close to Hortensia, who was in the studio to sing a corrido - a traditional Mexican genre - about the Picachos dam. \\"He was like a brother. I loved him,\\" she says. The crime was never solved. Two years earlier, Atilano and Hortensia had walked for nine days from San Marcos to the state capital, Culiacan, to protest against what they considered to be unjust compensation for having to leave the town. Both spent weeks in prison after causing a road block. They also organised demonstrations at the construction site, occupied the tourist areas in Mazatlán, and clashed with the police. Local authorities insist the dam was essential for guaranteeing drinking water, producing electricity and irrigating more than 20,000 hectares of agriculture. The government say it has been doing everything it can to provide a fair compensation to everyone affected. Hortensia still plays the same black guitar she had on the day Atilano was murdered. Her voice mingles with the bells of a couple of cows roaming the village. She is still hurt and angry about what happened. When her guitar and singing fall silent, nothing but the birdsong of old San Marcos remains.","completion":"In 2009, the Picachos dam in Mexico flooded, displacing 800 families and devastating six small communities in Sinaloa, but a handful of residents have chosen to remain in the ruins despite the compensation offered by local authorities."},{"prompt":"Question: Who is the Chief of Detectives of the Santa Rosita Police Department?

Just before he dies (literally kicking a bucket), Grogan tells the five men about 350,000 buried in Santa Rosita State Park near the Mexican border under \\"The Big W\\". Initially, the motorists try to reason with each other and share the money, but it soon becomes an all out race to get the money first. Unbeknownst to them all, Captain T.G. Culpeper (Spencer Tracy), Chief of Detectives of the Santa Rosita Police Department, has been patiently working on the Smiler Grogan case for years, hoping to someday solve it and retire.

On 28 May 1854 a protocol of the Vienna Conference was signed by Austria and Russia. One of the aims of the Russian advance had been to encourage the Orthodox Christian Serbs and Bulgarians living under Ottoman rule to rebel. However, when the Russian troops actually crossed the River Pruth into Moldavia, the Orthodox Christians still showed no interest in rising up against the Turks.:131, 137 Adding to the worries of Nicholas I was the concern that Austria would enter the war against the Russians and attack his armies on the western flank. Indeed, after attempting to mediate a peaceful settlement between Russia and Turkey, the Austrians entered the war on the side of Turkey with an attack against the Russians in the Principalities which threatened to cut off the Russian supply lines. Accordingly, the Russians were forced to raise the siege of Silistra on 23 June 1854, and begin abandoning the Principalities.:185 The lifting of the siege reduced the threat of a Russian advance into Bulgaria.

Nicholas Lutz’s tweet included a picture of the letter, complete with red markings fixing the grammar, spelling and syntax errors. He gave the letter a D minus. Read: College student 'grades' apology letter from ex-girlfriend The ex-girlfriend doesn’t go to UCF, but Lutz said he has been suspended from the school. “Looking back at it now, it’s probably the craziest thing that will ever happen in my life,” he said. The tweet was retweeted 121,000 times.

It was to show the emphasis on the letter,” said Lutz. But now, Lutz and his attorney said UCF is using the tweet to suspend him for two semesters and put him on probation. Lutz’s attorney said it’s a violation of his First Amendment right to free speech. “That should really, fundamentally, concern people. Not only those who are students, but people who believe in the idea of freedom of expression,” said attorney Jacob Stuart. At first, the university sent Lutz a letter saying he may have violated the law. Lutz’s lawyer said the ex-girlfriend has filed a cyberbullying report with the Volusia County Sheriff’s Office, but prosecutors never pursued the claim. Watch: Interview with Lutz's lawyer He then got a letter from UCF saying, instead, Lutz’s action violated two portions of the university’s code of conduct; disruption and cyberbullying. “If they can do that to me, it can happen to almost anybody. That’s upsetting,” said Lutz. Lutz is appealing the school’s decision and is standing by the tweet. © 2018 Cox Media Group. ||||| When your ex writes you an apology letter so you grade it to send it back pic.twitter.com/MczdjcCiil — Nick Lutz (@NickLutz12) February 17, 2017 Nick Lutz says the four-page apology note, handwritten on lined white notebook paper, appeared under the windshield wiper of his truck last winter. It came from an ex-girlfriend whom he had blocked by phone and on social media. She wanted to say she was sorry, and she took some liberties with spelling and grammar in the process. Lutz, still feeling betrayed by the breakup, saw an opportunity. Like a teacher grading a paper, he took a bright red pen and savaged it, correcting mistakes and leaving commentary in the voice of a perturbed copy editor. Lutz assigned her a grade, a D-minus and wrote that he would accept “revision for half credit.” Then he posted a picture of it to Twitter. “When your ex writes you an apology letter so you grade it to send it back,” Lutz captioned the tweet, which went predictably viral, shared 121,000 times and liked 337,000 times, and spurred a swarm of journalists from across the globe to write about his “savage” words. That was five months ago. Now, the University of Central Florida, where Lutz is a rising senior studying sports management, has decided to suspend him over the viral tweet because, the school said, it violated the student code of conduct for being “disruptive” and “harmful.” Lutz and his attorney, close family friend Jacob Stuart, claim the university’s ruling is unconstitutional and chills student free speech. This week, they appealed in a letter to the UCF Office of Student Conduct that called the decision a “dangerous precedent.” “I think the damaging thing here is how does UCF decide what’s morally harmful?” Stuart told the Miami Herald. “There was nothing derogatory about it. It was obvious he was making fun of her, but that’s the beauty of the constitution.” Nick Lutz was suspended from the University of Central Florida five months after sharing his ex-girlfriend's apology letter on social media. (Amber Ferguson/The Washington Post) Lutz’s punishment includes a suspension from classes for the summer and fall 2017 semesters, probation until he graduates and an assigned mentor, according to the appeal letter. Lutz also must create a presentation on how his “actions in this incident have impacted others” and write a five-page paper on the “impact of this type of behavior in the future,” the letter said. The university did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Washington Post, but a UCF spokeswoman told the Miami Herald that the ruling is not yet final. “It’s important to understand that the process in this case may yet not be complete,” the spokeswoman said. Lutz and Stuart did not respond to requests for comment late Tuesday night. Stuart wrote in the appeal that the ex-girlfriend, who felt she was cyberbullied, filed a complaint with the Volusia County Sheriff’s Office, but the case was never prosecuted. She then complained to the university, where she is not a student. Several weeks later, Lutz was called into a meeting with the student conduct and Title IX directors to discuss the tweet. “Once that hearing was over I knew that they weren’t happy and they were going to do something about it,” Lutz told ABC affiliate WFTV 9 this week. As most of you know, I graded an apology letter written to me, then proceeded to post it on twitter, where many people… Posted by Nick Lutz on Monday, July 17, 2017 He received a letter July 6 outlining the sanctions he faced, according to the appeal letter. Stuart argued in the appeal that Lutz’s tweet was constitutionally protected speech because he did not say anything demeaning, derogatory or threatening. The ex-girlfriend’s first name is visible on the letter, but Lutz never shared her last name, tagged her social media accounts in the tweet or divulged her personal contact information, Stuart wrote. “The right to enjoy freedom of speech is by no mean absolute,” Stuart said in the appeal. “Yet, there is only specific and extreme situations that this fundamental right is restricted by the government.” He argued “this type of ‘social media trolling’” by university officials “would lead to thousands of UCF students being suspended, much like Mr. Lutz, due to their comments and posts.” Stuart also said the university is violating its own Rules of Conduct introduction, which reads: “The right of all students to seek knowledge, debate ideas, form opinions, and freely express their ideas is fully recognized by the University of Central Florida. The Rules of Conduct apply to student conduct and will not be used to impose discipline for the lawful expression of ideas.” In an interview with WFTV 9, Lutz said that the viral tweet was born out of a “joke” conversation with his friends. He sent them a photo of the letter after he discovered it on his truck and one suggested he “grade it” with a red pen. “My goal was never to expose her,” Lutz said. “It was to show the emphasis on the letter.” Almost immediately after posting the letter online, he was receiving thousands of social media notifications, text messages, emails and phone calls, Lutz told WFTV 9. Everyone thought the tweet was “hilarious” and “relatable,” Lutz said. “This is the right thing to do, and I still feel that way, that there’s nothing wrong with what I did,” Lutz told the TV station, explaining that the post symbolized him standing up for himself after what he had previously claimed was a relationship lacking in trust and fidelity. “I did nothing wrong and I don’t know why [the university is] jumping into my wheelhouse with this because it’s not really much to do with them,” Lutz said.

Back at their house by the cemetery, Paul and Chloe found Bee in her room, what Paul referred to as her sanctum sanctorum - although no one else ever got the joke, and he refused to explain the comic book reference. As always, lighting was minimal (as opposed to Bee's workshop out behind the house, which was flooded with fluorescents). A bank of TV sets and computer monitors covered one whole wall, arranged on a precarious system of metal shelves that Bee had installed herself. A low, flat coffee table squatted below the glowing displays, supporting three keyboards, a bank of video editing tools and four different phone carriages. Bee sat in her accustomed place - in the midst of a pile of cushions on the floor, fiddling with a mouse in one hand and typing on one of the keyboards while she talked quietly into her headset. Paul and Chloe didn't bother to knock as they came in - Bee already knew they were there. Paul glanced at one of the screens mounted on the wall. Its display, divided into four quadrants, showed various images from inside the house, including the front door they'd just come through and the stairs they'd just climbed. The screen next to it - which Paul himself had salvaged from a bar on Duval that'd recently renovated into a finedining restaurant - showed images from four other cameras that covered the house's exterior.

Released in 1968, and written by Jimmy Webb, it was the first top 10 single for country singer Glen Campbell, who died on Monday, aged 81. Like many of his fans, Campbell's reaction to the song was immediate and tender. \\"When I heard it I cried,\\" he told BBC Radio 4 in 2011. \\"It made me cry because I was homesick.\\" The lyrics describe a lineman who is also pining for home and imagines he can hear his absent lover \\"singing in the wire\\". \\"I need you more than want you, and I want you for all time,\\" he tells her. \\"And the Wichita Lineman, is still on the line.\\" Webb, while proud of the song, has always insisted it was unfinished, and says he initially considered that famous couplet \\"the biggest, awfulest, dumbest, most obvious false rhyme in history\\". He wrote the song to order in 1968, after Campbell had found success with another of his songs, By the Time I Get to Phoenix. \\"They called me and said, 'Can you write us a song about a town?'\\" he recalled in a Radio 2 documentary about Campbell's career. \\"And I said, 'I'm not sure I want to write a song about a town right now. I think I've overdone that'. \\"He said, 'well, can you do something geographical?' and I spent the rest of the afternoon sweating over Wichita Lineman.\\" Although the song is set on the Kansas-Oklahoma border, Webb actually wrote it at a grand piano in Hollywood. \\"I was living in a kind of communal environment with 25 or 30 of my best friends,\\" he said in the book Chicken Soup for the Soul: Country Music. \\"There were a couple of clowns who came into my music room and spray-painted my piano green, I think, because of [the lyrics to] MacArthur Park: 'All the sweet, green icing flowing down.' They thought it was pretty funny. \\"So I spent the afternoon trying not to brush up against the piano and writing a song at the same time. That whole afternoon was a comedy, with a sticky green piano and several desperate calls from the recording studio.\\" He had called up the image of a lineman from a childhood journey across the panhandle of Oklahoma. \\"There's a place where the terrain absolutely flattens out,\\" he told the BBC. \\"It's almost like you could take a [spirit] level out of your tool kit and put in on the highway, and that bubble would just sit right there on dead centre. It goes on that way for about 50 miles. \\"In the heat of summer, with the heat rising off the road, the telephone poles gradually materialise out of this far, distant perspective and rush towards you. \\"And then, as it happened, I suddenly looked up at one of these telephone poles and there was a man on top, talking on a telephone. \\"He was gone very quickly, and I had another 25 miles of solitude to meditate on this apparition. It was a splendidly vivid, cinematic image that I lifted out of my deep memory while I was writing this song.\\" \\"I thought, I wonder if I can write something about that? A blue collar, everyman guy we all see everywhere - working on the railroad or working on the telephone wires or digging holes in the street. \\"I just tried to take an ordinary guy and open him up and say, 'Look there's this great soul, and there's this great aching, and this great loneliness inside this person and we're all like that. We all have this capacity for these huge feelings'.\\" But while Webb worked on the lyrics, Campbell and his producer Al DeLory were getting impatient. They were in the recording studio, with a tight deadline, and no song to record. \\"They said, 'We're really in a hurry, send it over'. And I said, 'OK, but the third verse I don't have'.\\" What Webb didn't know was that DeLory's uncle had been a lineman in Kern County, California. \\"As soon as I heard that opening line,\\" he later recalled, \\"I could visualise my uncle up a pole in the middle of nowhere. I loved the song right away.\\" \\"He wrote it for me in no time,\\" Campbell agreed. \\"Jimmy Webb is just that kind of a writer. He's such a gifted man.\\" Campbell cut the song with musicians from The Wrecking Crew - a group of LA session musicians who played on most of Phil Spector's records, as well as the first Monkees' albums and The Byrds' cover of Bob Dylan's Mr Tambourine Man. \\"We knew that this tune was special,\\" said bassist Carol Kaye - who added the descending six-note intro. \\"When he started singing, the hair stood up on my arms and I went, 'Woah, this is deep'.\\" Musically, the song plays a clever trick by starting in the key of F major before switching to the relative minor, D major and never fully resolving - echoing the lineman's disjointed state of mind. DeLory wrote an evocative orchestral arrangement in which the strings mimicked the sighing of the telephone wires. To get around the problem of the unfinished third verse, Campbell picked up Kaye's DanElectro six-string bass guitar and improvised the song's famous solo. Webb, however, thought they'd rejected the song. \\"A couple of weeks later I ran into him [Glen Campbell] somewhere, and I said, 'I guess you guys didn't like the song.'\\" he recalled. \\"He said, 'Oh, we cut that'. I said, 'It wasn't done! I was just humming the last bit!'\\" \\"He said, 'Well it's done now!'\\" Wichita Lineman jump-started Campbell's career, helping the album of the same name go double platinum in the US, and giving the star his first chart hit in the UK. But over the years, Campbell was always careful to highlight Webb's role. \\"He's just an exceptional writer. He pours his heart out,\\" he said. \\"And I think that's where the music comes from: the heart.\\" Webb returned the compliment, telling BBC Four: \\"He made me sound good. He made me sound like a genius. But really, I just did what I did and he had the wherewithal to follow through - and hit some notes that really, honestly, he shouldn't have been able to hit. \\"A lot of other singers would have said, 'Hey, listen - take this home and work on this, son. Because I can't sing on that.'\\" And what about that \\"dumb\\" lyric? Over the years, Webb made his peace with the line - realising his discomfort over the rhyme had blinded him to the words' raw power. \\"Had I known what I was doing, I wouldn't have written that line. I would have found a way to make it rhyme,\\" he told NPR in 2010. \\"It was only years later that I became aware of what a songwriter was even supposed to do. I was really just a kid who was kind of writing from the hip and the heart.\\" David Crary, a real-life lineman who repairs high voltage power lines across America, says he wouldn't change the words for the world. \\"I think Jimmy Webb hit the nail on the head,\\" he told Radio 4. \\"It describes a lot of linemen, what they go through on the road, away from their family. \\"When I hear that song, or when I'm singing it, it brings lots of memories back of storms that I've been on, whether they're ice storms, hurricanes [or] tornadoes. \\"The most important part is getting back to your family in one piece.\\" Campbell - who spent the majority of his life on the road - had an equally personal connection to the lyric. \\"'I want you for all time,' I always say that to my wife, because it cheers her up,\\" he said. \\"We got some grown kids and they say, 'Oh, you guys.

This allows for potential character and plot development related to the quality of the pencils and their impact on the students and the school. Continuation of the story: The school bought a bunch of new pencils, but didn't get any pens, because the pencils were high quality. These high-quality pencils were specifically designed to enhance students' writing ability and give them a sense of pride in their schoolwork. Step 2: Develop characters - Introduce the school principal and art teacher, both of whom were involved in the decision-making process to purchase these pencils. The principal, Mr. Johnson, and the art teacher, Ms. Davis, strongly believed that using these high-quality pencils would not only improve the students' performance but also foster a deeper sense of creativity and artistic expression within them. Step 3: Introduce conflict - The students start to miss using pens and question whether the high-quality pencils are truly beneficial to their learning. As weeks passed, some students began to long for the familiar feel of pens in their hands. They loved the smooth flow of ink on paper when writing essays and taking notes. A group of students, led by Sarah, a passionate lover of calligraphy, decided to start a petition to bring back pens to their school. Step 4: Resolution - The school organizes a writing competition where students use both pencils and pens, discovering the unique strengths of each writing utensil. Facing mounting pressure from the students, Mr. Johnson and Ms. Davis decided to organize a writing competition. The students were allowed to use both the high-quality pencils and pens for various tasks like sketching, calligraphy, and note-taking. After the competition, the students realized that each writing utensil had its unique strengths, and the high-quality pencils were indeed beneficial for particular tasks.

Choose from options. \\"What force causes a compass in Illinois to point towards Wisconsin?\\" Choices: [-] natural magnetism. [-] wind direction. [-] weight. [-] gravity.","completion":"The force that causes a compass in Illinois to point towards Wisconsin is natural magnetism. To understand this, we need to delve into the principles of a compass and Earth's magnetism. A compass is an instrument that is used for navigation and orientation based on the direction of north. It features a magnetized needle that is free to rotate and align itself with Earth's magnetic field. The general principle is that the needle aligns with the magnetic field lines, pointing towards the magnetic north pole. Earth's magnetic field is generated by the movements of molten iron alloys in its outer core. This dynamo effect produces a complex and constantly changing magnetic field that envelops the Earth. The magnetic field lines flow from the magnetic south pole to the magnetic north pole, enabling the compass needle to align itself accordingly. When a compass is used in Illinois, the needle will point towards the magnetic north pole, which is located in northern Canada. Owing to the curvature of the Earth and general alignment of magnetic field lines, the compass will seemingly point towards Wisconsin. However, it is essential to realize that the compass needle is primarily aligning itself with Earth’s magnetic field and not directly pointing to Wisconsin. Wisconsin happens to lie in the approximate direction of the magnetic north pole when viewed from Illinois. Hence, among the choices provided, the correct answer is natural magnetism. Wind direction, weight, and gravity do not influence a compass’s ability to point north. Wind direction affects the movement of air masses, which can impact weather patterns, but it does not influence the alignment of a compass needle. Similarly, weight is a measure of the force exerted on an object due to gravity, and it is not relevant to a compass pointing north. Gravity is the force that keeps objects on the Earth's surface and affects the movement of celestial bodies, but it does not directly impact the compass needle's orientation to the magnetic north. In conclusion, the force causing a compass in Illinois to point towards Wisconsin is natural magnetism, which is attributed to Earth's ever-changing magnetic field generated by the motion of molten iron alloys in its outer core."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It is the most widely spoken constructed language in the world. The Polish-Jewish ophthalmologist L. L. Zamenhof published the first book detailing Esperanto, \\",\\" on 26 July 1887. The name of Esperanto derives from \\" (\\"\\" translates as \\"one who hopes\\"), the pseudonym under which Zamenhof published Unua Libro. - Dr. Esperanto's International Language, usually referred to as Unua Libro, was the first publication to describe Esperanto, then called the International Language. It was first published in Russian on July 26, 1887 in Warsaw, by Polish oculist L. L. Zamenhof. Over the next few years editions were published in Polish, Russian, Hebrew, French, German, and English. This booklet included the Lord's Prayer, some Bible verses, a letter, poetry, the sixteen rules of grammar and 900 roots of vocabulary. In the book Zamenhof declared, \\"an international language, like a national one, is common property\\" and renounced all rights to the language, effectively putting it into the public domain. Zamenhof signed the work as \\"Doktoro Esperanto\\" (Doctor One-Who-Hopes). Those who learned the new language began to call it \\"Esperanto\\" after Zamenhof's pen name, and Esperanto soon became the official name of the language. - Warsaw (; see also other names) is the capital and largest city of Poland. It stands on the Vistula River in east-central Poland, roughly from the Baltic Sea and from the Carpathian Mountains. Its population is estimated at 1.750 million residents within a greater metropolitan area of 3.105 million residents, which makes Warsaw the 9th most-populous capital city in the European Union. The city limits cover , while the metropolitan area covers . - Proto - Esperanto ( Esperanto : pra - Esperanto ) is the modern term for any of the stages in the evolution of L. L. Zamenhof 's language project , prior to the publication of his Unua Libro in 1887 . - An international auxiliary language (sometimes abbreviated as IAL or auxlang) or interlanguage is a language meant for communication between people from different nations who do not share a common first language. An auxiliary language is primarily a second language. - Language is the ability to acquire and use complex systems of communication, particularly the human ability to do so, and a language is any specific example of such a system. The scientific study of language is called linguistics. Questions concerning the philosophy of language, such as whether words can represent experience, have been debated since Gorgias and Plato in Ancient Greece. Thinkers such as Rousseau have argued that language originated from emotions while others like Kant have held that it originated from rational and logical thought. 20th-century philosophers such as Wittgenstein argued that philosophy is really the study of language. Major figures in linguistics include Ferdinand de Saussure and Noam Chomsky. - Poetry (the term derives from a variant of the Greek term, \\"poiesis\\", \\"making\\") is a form of literature that uses aesthetic and rhythmic qualities of languagesuch as phonaesthetics, sound symbolism, and metreto evoke meanings in addition to, or in place of, the prosaic ostensible meaning. - The Bible (from Koine Greek , \\"tà biblía\\", \\"the books\\") is a collection of sacred texts or scriptures that Jews and Christians consider to be a product of divine inspiration and a record of the relationship between God and humans. - A planned or constructed language (sometimes called a conlang) is a language whose phonology, grammar, and vocabulary have been consciously devised for human or human-like communication, instead of having developed naturally. It is also referred to as an artificial or invented language. There are many possible reasons to create a constructed language, such as: to ease human communication (see international auxiliary language and code), to give fiction or an associated constructed setting an added layer of realism, for experimentation in the fields of linguistics, cognitive science, and machine learning, for artistic creation, and for language games. - The Lord's Prayer (also called the Our Father or Pater Noster among other names) is a venerated Christian prayer that, according to the New Testament, was taught by Jesus to his disciples. Two versions of it are recorded: a longer form in the Gospel of Matthew as part of the Sermon on the Mount, and a shorter form in the Gospel of Luke as a response by Jesus to a request by \\"one of his disciples\\" to teach them \\"to pray as John taught his disciples.\\" The context of the prayer in Matthew is a discourse deploring people who pray ostentatiously. - Ludwik Lejzer Zamenhof (), usually credited as L. L. Zamenhof, was a Polish-Jewish medical doctor, inventor, and writer. He is most widely known for creating Esperanto, the most successful constructed language in the world. He grew up fascinated by the idea of a world without war and believed that this could happen with the help of a new international auxiliary language, which he first developed in 1873 while still in school. - The term public domain has two senses of meaning. Anything published is out in the public domain in the sense that it is available to the public. Once published news and information in books is in the public domain, although they may also be copyrighted. In the sense of intellectual property, works in the public domain are those whose exclusive intellectual property rights have expired, have been forfeited, or are inapplicable. For example, the works of Shakespeare and Beethoven, and most of the early silent films, are all now in the public domain by either being created before copyrights existed or leaving the copyright term. Examples for works not covered by copyright which are therefore in the public domain, are the formulae of Newtonian physics, cooking recipes and all software before 1974. Examples for works actively dedicated into public domain by their authors are reference implementations of cryptographic algorithms, NIH's ImageJ, and the CIA's \\"World Factbook\\". The term is not normally applied to situations where the creator of a work retains residual rights, in which case use of the work is referred to as \\"under license\\" or \\"with permission\\".

Options： A. upset B. controversy C. frustration D. pleasure E. relax The answer is:","completion":"B. Controversy Creating art that not everyone agrees with can often lead to controversy. Art is subjective and is open to interpretation, so it's natural for different people to have different reactions and views towards a particular piece of art. Indeed, some historically famous works of art have become iconic due to the controversies instigated around them. When an artist create work that challenges norms, depict sensitive subjects, or are simply beyond the conventional aesthetics, this can lead people into intense discussions, debates, criticisms or even protests - all fall into the domain of controversy. Art can evoke a wide range of emotions and reactions among its viewers, and when these reactions clash, it can lead to public disputes, or controversies. Therefore, while artwork may result in various reactions such as upset (A), frustration (C), pleasure (D) or relaxation (E), the most comprehensive outcome in the context of your question would be controversy (B), because it encompasses the disagreements and discussions that might occur due to differing perspectives and interpretations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the full name of the person whose imperial title was recognized? Charlemagne planned to continue the Frankish tradition of dividing his kingdom between all his heirs, but was unable to do so as only one son, Louis the Pious (r. 814–840), was still alive by 813. Just before Charlemagne died in 814, he crowned Louis as his successor. Louis's reign of 26 years was marked by numerous divisions of the empire among his sons and, after 829, civil wars between various alliances of father and sons over the control of various parts of the empire. Eventually, Louis recognised his eldest son Lothair I (d. 855) as emperor and gave him Italy. Louis divided the rest of the empire between Lothair and Charles the Bald (d. 877), his youngest son. Lothair took East Francia, comprising both banks of the Rhine and eastwards, leaving Charles West Francia with the empire to the west of the Rhineland and the Alps. Louis the German (d. 876), the middle child, who had been rebellious to the last, was allowed to keep Bavaria under the suzerainty of his elder brother. The division was disputed. Pepin II of Aquitaine (d. after 864), the emperor's grandson, rebelled in a contest for Aquitaine, while Louis the German tried to annex all of East Francia. Louis the Pious died in 840, with the empire still in chaos.A three-year civil war followed his death. By the Treaty of Verdun (843), a kingdom between the Rhine and Rhone rivers was created for Lothair to go with his lands in Italy, and his imperial title was recognised. Louis the German was in control of Bavaria and the eastern lands in modern-day Germany. Charles the Bald received the western Frankish lands, comprising most of modern-day France. Charlemagne's grandsons and great-grandsons divided their kingdoms between their descendants, eventually causing all internal cohesion to be lost. In 987 the Carolingian dynasty was replaced in the western lands, with the crowning of Hugh Capet (r. 987–996) as king. In the eastern lands the dynasty had died out earlier, in 911, with the death of Louis the Child, and the selection of the unrelated Conrad I (r....

The Southwestern United States (also known as the American Southwest) is the informal name for a region of the western United States. Definitions vary a great deal and have never been standardized--and many have been proposed. For example, it might include the stretch from east of Los Angeles to El Paso, and from the Mexican border to south of Denver. The population for that particular definition area is around 11 million people, with over half that in the state of Arizona. The largest metropolitan areas are Phoenix (with a population over 4 million people) and Las Vegas (about 2 million); other significant population centers in the Southwest are Albuquerque, El Paso, and Tucson. Most of the area was part of the Viceroyalty of New Spain in the Spanish Empire before becoming part of Mexico. European settlement was almost non-existent outside New Mexico in 1848, when it became part of the United States through the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo; far southern Arizona was added in the later Gadsden Purchase. The geography of the region is mainly made up by four features: the Mojave, Sonoran, and Chihuahuan Deserts, and the Colorado Plateau; although there are other geographical features as well, such as a portion of the Great Basin Desert. The deserts dominate the southern and western reaches of the area, while the plateau (which is largely made up of high desert) is the main feature north of the Mogollon Rim. The two major rivers of the region are the Colorado River, running in the northern and western areas, and the Rio Grande, running in the east, north to south. Answer this series of questions: 1.

Some years ago a woman on our staff came into my office to, basically, tell me off and complain to me about others and about myself. This woman had not been very supportive of me in my role ever since I began working there. I couldn’t figure out if she was arrogant or lacking in self esteem. During this meeting / confrontation, she told me, in no uncertain terms, just what she didn’t like about some recent decisions I had made. I listened to her speak for about 30 minutes. She, quite methodically, tore me apart. Initially, I had planned to hear her out, make a few vague remarks, and send her on her way, thinking that maybe she just needed to be heard. But about 20 minutes into her harangue, I had a change of heart. I decided that, if she asked for a response for me, if she asked my advice, I was going to tell her exactly what I thought. She did, in fact, ask me for a response. I asked her if she was a happy person, and said that I suspected that she was not, as she came across as a bully and was acting like a horrible person. She sat and looked at me, then burst into tears. I waited. Looking up, she said, “Yes, you are correct. I am a horrible person. And I am miserable. What can I do?” We spent some time discussing what she could do, and (even though I didn’t want to take the time to do it) I asked her if she would like a mentor — me? She said that she would like such a thing. This woman and I ended up becoming fairly, no, very good friends and she has been one of my strongest supporters. I didn’t expect that.

Based on the paragraph above can we conclude that \\"You can't complete this job while on an airplane. \\"?","completion":"No, we cannot directly conclude that \\"You can't complete this job while on an airplane\\" based on the given paragraph. The paragraph primarily provides information about gathering the necessary materials to clean your skateboard bearings and emphasizes preparedness to make the job go faster. The paragraph neither mentions nor implies a connection between the job being completed, or not completed, on an airplane. However, it is important to note that attempting to clean skateboard bearings on an airplane may not be practical or feasible for several reasons, which are not mentioned in the provided paragraph. These reasons may include: 1. Limited space: Airplanes typically have limited and confined spaces for passengers, which might not be suitable for cleaning skateboard bearings efficiently. You would most likely need a designated workspace with enough area to disassemble the skateboard and clean the bearings without causing inconvenience to fellow passengers or airline staff. 2. Restricted items: Some of the necessary materials or tools for cleaning skateboard bearings might not be allowed on an airplane. This includes solvents, which are often flammable, and other cleaning solutions that may be restricted due to their potential hazard. 3. Spillage risks: Cleaning skateboard bearings involves the use of liquids that might cause a mess if not handled carefully. These spills can be problematic on an airplane, where it's crucial to maintain cleanliness and avoid damage to the surroundings. 4. Disruption to other passengers: The entire process of cleaning your skateboard bearings involves disassembling your skateboard, using tools, and potentially generating noise. This can be disruptive to other passengers who might be trying to relax or sleep during the flight. In conclusion, while the given paragraph does not explicitly mention it, attempting to clean skateboard bearings on an airplane may not be practical or appropriate.

According to the Hindu, security workers at Vibgyor High School suspected around 4am that there was a leopard inside the school and CCTV \\"confirmed their fear.\\" They called in forestry department workers, and \\"two teams were formed to scour the school,\\" the paper reports. A 10-hour drama followed, with the leopard fleeing to nearby woods before returning to the school, where it made its way from room to room as workers tried to trap it. The Hindu reports that after the big cat was shot by a tranquilizer, it appeared to panic and went on an \\"attacking spree\\" before the drugs kicked in. Six people were mauled, including a wildlife conservationist who tried to scale a wall to escape the leopard when it attacked him by the school's swimming pool but was dragged back down. The leopard was captured after the tranquilizers took effect, and it will be released into a national park, reports the BBC, which notes that habitat loss has caused a rise in leopard-human clashes. (In another Indian city, a leopard terrorized a hospital for 12 hours.) Expand this summary.","completion":"One day in Bangalore, India, a big leopard found its way into a school called Vibgyor High School. Leopards are wild animals and they can be dangerous to humans. Luckily, there were no students or teachers at the school that early morning. The security workers in the school saw the leopard on cameras and they called people from the forestry department to help. They made two teams to search the school and tried to catch the big cat. The leopard was running around the school and tried to hide in different rooms. The people tried to make the leopard sleep by shooting it with a special medicine called a tranquilizer, so they could safely catch it. However, when the leopard felt the shot, it got scared and started to attack people. It hurt six people, including a man who works to protect wild animals like the leopard. He tried to climb a wall to escape, but the leopard caught him and pulled him down. After some time, the medicine in the tranquilizer finally worked and made the leopard sleepy. This made it easier for the workers to catch the leopard. They plan to release the leopard back into a big national park where it can live safely away from people. The reason leopards are coming into places where humans live, like this school, is because we are taking away their natural homes in the forests.

Given the background: Air pollution is harmful to human beings and other living things. About 22 million people die from air pollution each year. Breathing polluted air increases the risk of developing lung diseases such as asthma and lung cancer. Breathing bad air also increases the chances of dying from other diseases. Children are most likely to be affected by air pollution. That’s because their lungs are still developing and growing. Children also take in more air for their size than adults do. Some air pollutants damage the environment as well as the health of living things. The type of damage depends on the pollutant. Air pollution can also harm the environment. and the situation: Sarah and Sophie are sisters living in two different cities. Sarah lives in a very rural area with hardly any air pollution. Sophie lives in a heavily industrialized urban area with many factories and people driving cars to their destinations. This all leads to Sophie's city having a large amount of pollution going into the atmosphere. Answer the following question: Who is more susceptible to other diseases?","completion":"Based on the background and situation provided, it can be concluded that Sophie, who lives in a heavily industrialized urban area with high air pollution levels, is more susceptible to other diseases compared to her sister Sarah, who lives in a rural area with hardly any air pollution. Air pollution, as mentioned, has detrimental effects on human health, increasing the risk of developing lung diseases such as asthma and lung cancer. In addition, exposure to polluted air can lead to higher chances of contracting and dying from other diseases, both respiratory and non-respiratory in nature. Pollutants present in the air, such as particulate matter, ozone, nitrogen dioxide, and sulfur dioxide, can have various adverse effects on human health, leading to heart attacks, strokes, and even negative impacts on the nervous and reproductive systems. Considering that Sophie lives in an environment with heavy industrial activity and high vehicular emissions, she is constantly exposed to air pollutants. This persistent exposure can not only lead to chronic respiratory issues but also makes her more vulnerable to other infections and diseases due to a weakened immune system caused by the pollution. Moreover, air pollution can exacerbate pre-existing health conditions and increase the severity of symptoms, further impacting Sophie's overall well-being. On the other hand, Sarah, living in a very rural area with minimal air pollution, does not face the same heightened risk of developing pollution-related health issues. Her lungs and other organs are subjected to a less toxic environment, allowing her body to maintain a more robust immune system and better overall health. In conclusion, given the contrast in the pollution levels in their respective living environments, Sophie is significantly more susceptible to other diseases as compared to Sarah. It is crucial to recognize the importance of improving air quality in urban, industrialized environments to alleviate the detrimental health consequences faced by individuals like Sophie and promote better health and quality of life for all inhabitants."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

While the world was watching horrified as the baby Gammy scandal unfolded, two men in Australia were terrified the news would mean they may never get to see the faces of their unborn triplets. Shannon Sanderson, 38, and Peter Trigg, 44, were just three months away from meeting their beautiful triplet girls, via a Thai surrogate mother, when a Perth couple reportedly abandoned their disabled son Gammy in Thailand. As the news broke around the world, Thai surrogate agencies went into lockdown, disconnecting their phones and shutting off email connections. The couple, from Kinglake West in Victoria, were worried sick that this could mean the end of their dream of having a family. After spending two years trying to father a child in Australia, the couple decided","completion":"to explore international surrogacy as an alternative route to parenthood. They had faced several complications, health issues, and heartbreaking miscarriages throughout their journey, leaving them emotionally and mentally drained. With each passing day, their dream of holding a child of their own seemed to be slipping away from them. Undeterred, Shannon and Peter meticulously researched their options, ultimately choosing Thailand as their surrogacy destination because of its reputable and successful history in the field of surrogacy. They embarked on the treacherous waters of international surrogacy, investing their time, money, and emotions into the process. The couple spent countless hours researching the laws and regulations surrounding surrogacy, as well as finding the perfect surrogate mother. In their search for the ideal surrogate, Shannon and Peter eventually partnered with a reputable Thai surrogacy agency that guided them through the complex process. They were introduced to their surrogate mother, a warm and caring woman whose sole motivation was to help the couple achieve their dream of having a family. With the help of the agency and the surrogate, they began the arduous process of IVF treatments, multiple appointments, and even more cross-cultural obstacles. Everything seemed to be falling into place for the hopeful couple, until the Gammy scandal shook the world, causing the Thai government to tighten regulations surrounding international surrogacy. The once-promising path to parenthood suddenly appeared to be crashing down around them, and they feared they might lose everything they had worked so hard for. In the midst of the turmoil, Shannon and Peter remained resilient, focusing on the wellbeing of their unborn daughters and the surrogate mother who was carrying them. The couple, with the help of their lawyer and surrogacy agency, scrambled to navigate the new and rapidly evolving regulations, continuously keeping the lines of communication open with the surrogate mother. As the situation around them became increasingly tense, they reassured their surrogate that they would support her in any way they could, regardless of the outcome. Shannon and Peter were determined not to let the actions of one couple overshadow their love and commitment to their unborn daughters. Weeks turned to months, and eventually, the couple managed to wade through the bureaucratic obstacles that stood in their way. The day finally arrived when Shannon and Peter welcomed their triplet daughters into the world – a moment they had longed for and fought tirelessly to achieve. This harrowing experience served as a cautionary tale for both the aspiring parents and the surrogacy industry as a whole. As governments continue to grapple with the complexities of surrogacy regulations, it is imperative that prospective parents are informed about the risks and challenges they may face in their journey to having a child through surrogacy. In the end, Shannon and Peter's story is a testament to the power of love, determination, and an unwavering belief in their dream of creating a family. Despite the obstacles and setbacks, they always remained united in their mission, demonstrating that sometimes even the most daunting barriers can be overcome through sheer will and an unbreakable bond."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer this question: which country has won most davis cups in tennis?","completion":"The country with the most Davis Cup titles in tennis is the United States. The Davis Cup, an international team event in men's tennis, was first held in 1900 and over the years, it has become a prestigious annual event featuring the world's best players, competing for their home nation. The United States has an impressive record in Davis Cup history, having won the title 32 times. Their remarkable legacy in the competition began in 1900 when the event was inaugurated, and they claimed the first championship. Since then, the U.S. has had periods of domination in the Davis Cup, with their victorious years spanning much of the 20th and 21st centuries. Some of the most notable American Davis Cup triumphs include their winning streak from 1920 to 1926, during which they secured seven consecutive titles. Another noteworthy period of success for the U.S. came in the 1960s and 1970s when some of the all-time tennis greats, such as Arthur Ashe, Stan Smith, and Jimmy Connors, played significant roles in winning several titles for their nation. The United States' most recent Davis Cup title came in 2007, under the leadership of captain Patrick McEnroe. This victory was achieved by a talented team that included Andy Roddick, James Blake, Mike Bryan, and Bob Bryan, all of whom had already established themselves as top players in singles and doubles events. In terms of the Davis Cup ranking, the United States is followed by Australia, with 28 titles, and Great Britain, with 10 titles. France and Sweden are next on the list with 9 and 7 titles, respectively. However, it is essential to note that while these countries have also had their share of success in the competition, the United States remains the most successful nation in Davis Cup history. The Davis Cup's format has undergone several changes throughout the years, with the latest revamp introduced in 2019 by Kosmos Tennis. This new structure aims to modernize the event by creating a World Cup-style tournament named the Davis Cup Finals, where 18 nations compete over a single week for the trophy. Despite these alterations, the United States continues to field strong teams and remains a formidable force in the world of tennis."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the full name of the man that hires the bisexual woman's husband to paint a mural? Frida begins just before the traumatic accident Frida Kahlo suffered at the age of 18 when the wooden-bodied bus she was riding in collided with a streetcar. She is impaled by a metal pole and the injuries she sustained plague her for the rest of her life. To help her through convalescence, her father brings her a canvas upon which to start painting. Throughout the film, a scene starts as a painting, then slowly dissolves into a live action scene with actors. Frida also details the artist's dysfunctional relationship with the muralist Diego Rivera. When Rivera proposes to Kahlo, she tells him she expects from him loyalty if not fidelity. Diego's appraisal of her painting ability is one of the reasons that she continues to paint. Throughout the marriage, Rivera has affairs with a wide array of women, while the bisexual Kahlo takes on male and female lovers, including in one case having an affair with the same woman as Rivera. The two travel to New York City so that he may paint the mural Man at the Crossroads at the Rockefeller Center. While in the United States, Kahlo suffers a miscarriage, and her mother dies in Mexico. Rivera refuses to compromise his communist vision of the work to the needs of the patron, Nelson Rockefeller; as a result, the mural is destroyed. The pair return to Mexico, with Rivera the more reluctant of the two. Kahlo's sister Cristina moves in with the two at their San Ángel studio home to work as Rivera's assistant. Soon afterward, Kahlo discovers that Rivera is having an affair with her sister. She leaves him, and subsequently sinks into alcoholism.

From 1936, Ellington began to make recordings with smaller groups (sextets, octets, and nonets) drawn from his then-15-man orchestra and he composed pieces intended to feature a specific instrumentalist, as with \\"Jeep's Blues\\" for Johnny Hodges, \\"Yearning for Love\\" for Lawrence Brown, \\"Trumpet in Spades\\" for Rex Stewart, \\"Echoes of Harlem\\" for Cootie Williams and \\"Clarinet Lament\\" for Barney Bigard. In 1937, Ellington returned to the Cotton Club which had relocated to the mid-town Theater District. In the summer of that year, his father died, and due to many expenses, Ellington's finances were tight, although his situation improved the following year. After leaving agent Irving Mills, he signed on with the William Morris Agency. Mills though continued to record Ellington. After only a year, his Master and Variety labels, the small groups had recorded for the latter, collapsed in late 1937, Mills placed Ellington back on Brunswick and those small group units on Vocalion through to 1940. Well known sides continued to be recorded, \\"Caravan\\" in 1937, and \\"I Let a Song Go Out of My Heart\\" the following year. Billy Strayhorn, originally hired as a lyricist, began his association with Ellington in 1939. Nicknamed \\"Swee' Pea\\" for his mild manner, Strayhorn soon became a vital member of the Ellington organization. Ellington showed great fondness for Strayhorn and never failed to speak glowingly of the man and their collaborative working relationship, \\"my right arm, my left arm, all the eyes in the back of my head, my brain waves in his head, and his in mine\\". Strayhorn, with his training in classical music, not only contributed his original lyrics and music, but also arranged and polished many of Ellington's works, becoming a second Ellington or \\"Duke's doppelganger\\". It was not uncommon for Strayhorn to fill in for Duke, whether in conducting or rehearsing the band, playing the piano, on stage, and in the recording studio.

Each year about a quarter of a million Americans study abroad. For many of them, a summer or a semester in a foreign country now involves more than just sitting in classrooms and hanging out with other American students. Instead, they are encouraged and sometimes required to be involved in the local communities they are studying in. \\"It's ly important that they know something about how people in other parts of the world live and think, and how they behave,\\" says William Finlay, head of the sociology department at the University of Georgia. In 2008, he co-founded a study abroad program with South Africa's Stellenbosch University. It combines traditional academic in-class learning with community involvement. \\"We've been working with a non-government organization in the township. Our students typically either work with little children in day care centers or work in the library and teach very basic computer skills to young children,\\" says Finlay. The three-week program proved to be an unforgettable experience for Hillary Kinsey. She says, \\"It was interesting to learn the history of the area and then talk to these people and see what the social dynamics were, and how certain groups felt about other groups.\\" When Hillary Kinsey returned home from South Africa, she and other students in the program established a non-profit group. Kinsey says the group wants to contribute to advancing education and development in South Africa. \\"One of the purposes of the group is that we hope to raise money and awareness about the situation where those people live and help to promote any sort of educational development that we can, \\" Kinsey added.

Later waves of emigration from Mexico, Cuba, El Salvador and elsewhere in Hispanic America to the United States beginning in the second half of the 19th century to the present-day have strengthened the role of the Spanish language in the country.

You can put it under your pillow and look forward to finding some money there in the morning. And then you can watch your new permanent tooth grow in its place. But if a permanent tooth falls out, that's a problem. There isn't another one under the gum that can replace it. Unfortunately, this happens to some older people. And if permanent teeth fall out-or need to be pulled-an older person might need dentures. Dentures, known as false teeth, are a set of replacement teeth for any teeth that are missing. There are partial dentures, which take the place of only a few teeth and prevent the others from changing position. If all the teeth are gone, the person would need complete dentures, which replace every tooth in the mouth. Dentures can cause pains at first and take little time to get adjusted to. They also need special care. They should be brushed daily with a special denture brush and cleanser and soaked in denture solution when not in the mouth. Dentures are important for older folks because, without teeth, it's hard to smile, talk, and eat properly. But it can be a little _ if you see someone take out his or her dentures. It can also be strange to see someone, like a grandparent, without dentures in because he or she won't have any teeth. Try not to make fun of the person because this could cause hurt feelings. People usually lose their permanent teeth due to periodontal disease, or gum disease, which is caused by bacteria that attacks the gums. Diseased gums aren't strong and healthy, so teeth can get loose and fall out. Older people often have many cavities that have been filled over the years, and these fillings can weaken over time, leading to more tooth decay. Question: If one of your baby teeth falls out, you_. Yes or no, is the answer \\"will gain a permanent tooth in future\\"?","completion":"Yes, the answer \\"will gain a permanent tooth in future\\" is correct. When a baby tooth falls out, it is typically replaced by a permanent tooth that grows in its place. This is a normal part of the process of transitioning from baby teeth to permanent teeth during a child's development. Baby teeth falling out and being replaced by permanent teeth is a natural occurrence, but if a permanent tooth falls out later in life, as the article mentioned, that can be a problem since there is no natural replacement available under the gum."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the biggest pain point in the home automation industry right now? Is there space for another startup to come in and disrupt things? Would you say that these questions are the same?","completion":"The industries that have had archaic fee structure systems in place and were then disrupted by startups are: 1. Banking and Financial Services: Traditional banks have had complex fee structures for various services, including account maintenance, overdraft fees, and ATM fees. Disruptive startups like Revolut, Transferwise (now called Wise), and N26 stepped in to provide simple and transparent fee structures, often eliminating common fees altogether. 2. Investment and Trading: Traditional brokerage firms typically charged fixed, high fees for trading stock and other investment assets. Robinhood, a startup, disrupted this fee system by offering commission-free trading, forcing many traditional brokerages to reevaluate their fee structures. 3. Real Estate: The traditional real estate industry involves high fees (commission) for agents. Startups like Redfin, OpenDoor, and Purplebricks emerged to challenge these high fees by offering lower and fixed commission fees, providing more transparency and affordability in the home buying process. 4. Payment Processing: Payment processing giants like Visa, Mastercard, and PayPal used to charge merchants multiple fees, such as interchange, fixed, and cross-border fees. Startups like Stripe and Square have disrupted this space by simplifying the fee structure and providing more accessible pricing for small businesses and transactions. 5. Ride-hailing and Taxi industry: Traditional taxi services had non-transparent pricing structures. Ridesharing startups like Uber and Lyft introduced transparent, real-time pricing based on demand and distance traveled, disrupting the entire industry. Regarding the pain points in the home automation industry, some of the significant issues include: 1. Fragmentation and compatibility issues: Due to the vast number of devices and platforms available, many smart home devices on the market are not compatible with each other. This fragmentation makes it challenging for consumers to create a seamless, interconnected ecosystem. 2. High entry cost: High-priced hardware and professional installation can make home automation adoption expensive for the average consumer. 3. Privacy and security concerns: There are increasing concerns about the security and privacy of data collected by smart home devices, encouraging potential users to hesitate before investing in such technology. 4. Complex installation and setup process: Many home automation systems require a complicated setup process that may not be user-friendly for an average consumer. There is undoubtedly room for startups to disrupt the home automation industry. If they can address the aforementioned pain points by creating cost-effective, user-friendly devices that offer secure and seamless integration, they will likely gain significant market traction. Regarding whether these questions were the same, they are not the same but related. The first question refers to which industries had archaic fee structures and were disrupted by startups, while the second question discusses the home automation industry's pain points and the potential for disruptive startups to enter the market. Both questions share the theme of industry disruption by innovative startups, but they target different industries and aspects of the problem."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who discusses his plans to marry his childhood sweetheart? After a textual montage summarizing Edgar Allan Poe's life, the film begins in late September 1849 with Poe awakening from a hallucination where he is buried alive. He prepares to take a trip to New York City via a ferry steamboat from Richmond, Virginia, to Baltimore, and from there, another ferry to New York City itself. He discusses his plans to marry his childhood sweetheart Sarah Elmira Royster with a stranger taking the same steamboat, who suggests that he meet with a few potential investors for his planned magazine The Stylus. Though Poe had intended only to pass through Baltimore, he agrees to meet the investors who, one by one, turn down his request for funding. Poe is depicted as having some type of memory loss, which is first evident when he offers to pay his boat fare twice after forgetting he had already paid. In Baltimore, he more than once forgets the arrangements he has made at his hotel as his stay in the city is extended. One night, he chooses to dine in a local tavern rather than at the hotel. There, he meets an old friend from his days at West Point. In desperation, he asks his former classmate and the classmate's companion for money to help start a magazine, saying proudly he has already raised 1,000. Poe leaves the tavern to retrieve his prospectus for the magazine. His classmate follows him and beats him up to steal the 1,000 he had collected. An injured and delirious Poe is then found by organizers of a cooping ring. The author, along with several others, are forced to multiple polling locations around Baltimore to place multiple votes for the candidate for mayor. A couple of victims of the scam die amidst the brutality of their captors.","completion":"The last name of the person who discusses his plans to marry his childhood sweetheart is Poe.

Dans le contexte de l'année 2004, un projet a été approuvé par ONUSIDA, une organisation internationale agissant sous l'égide des Nations Unies, spécifiquement pour le Mozambique. Le but de ce projet était de mener des actions et initiatives en faveur des droits des femmes et des hommes pour supprimer les inégalités entre les sexes qui prévalaient dans la législation mozambicaine, en particulier en ce qui concerne les lois sur la succession et l'héritage. La mise en œuvre de ce projet a impliqué la réalisation d'activités de plaidoyer, c'est-à-dire des actions de défense des droits et d'influence auprès des instances politiques et législatives, afin d'obtenir des changements législatifs et des avancées en matière d'égalité des droits entre les hommes et les femmes. Ces actions ont pour but, entre autres, de sensibiliser les décideurs politiques, les législateurs et l'opinion publique à la nécessité de garantir des droits égaux pour tous, quelle que soit leur sexe, et d'améliorer la situation des femmes en ce qui concerne l'accès à l'héritage et leur protection juridique. Dans le cas spécifique du Mozambique, les lois sur la succession étaient caractérisées par une inégalité manifeste entre les hommes et les femmes, mettant souvent ces dernières dans une situation de vulnérabilité et de précarité sociale. Le projet ONUSIDA a donc concentré ses efforts sur la promotion de l'égalité entre les sexes et la suppression des obstacles juridiques discriminatoires qui affectent principalement les femmes dans le domaine de la succession et de l'héritage. En menant ces actions de plaidoyer, ONUSIDA a contribué à créer un environnement plus favorable à l'égalité des genres et à la justice socio-économique au Mozambique. Grâce à ce projet et à la mobilisation de différentes parties prenantes, il a été possible de progresser dans la modification de la législation mozambicaine et d'œuvrer pour la promotion des droits des femmes et des hommes dans le pays, contribuant ainsi à l'édification d'une société plus égalitaire et juste."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

'The Punter eatType coffee shop': This indicates that 'The Punter' is a business name, likely a food joint, and its eatType is 'coffee shop'. This means that 'The Punter' is primarily a coffee shop, where people can sit and enjoy coffee possibly with some snack items. 2. 'The Punter food Indian': The Punter serves Indian food. This suggests that besides being a coffee shop, it provides Indian cuisine, offering customers a variety of dishes from the Indian subcontinent. 3. 'The Punter priceRange high': This means that the services and food dishes at The Punter are priced at a higher level. Customers visiting this place should expect to pay more compared to average coffee shops or Indian restaurants. 4. 'The Punter familyFriendly no': This identifies that the place is not family-friendly, maybe because it is more suited for adults due to its ambiance, menu, or other aspects which may not be suitable or appealing for families, especially kids. 5.

I think that person we met last week is insane.","completion":"To evaluate whether the sentence is syntactically and semantically acceptable, let's break it down step by step: 1. Syntax: The sentence appears to have a subject (\\"I\\"), a verb (\\"think\\"), and a complement clause (\\"that person we met last week is insane\\"). The word \\"that\\" is used as a pronoun, and its antecedent is \\"person\\". The structure of the sentence seems to follow English grammar rules. Therefore, from a syntactic perspective, the sentence seems acceptable. 2. Semantics: The sentence conveys the meaning that the speaker believes the person they met the previous week is not mentally stable. The words are used in appropriate contexts and convey a clear meaning. Thus, the sentence has semantic acceptability. Based on this analysis, the sentence \\"I think that person we met last week is insane\\" can be considered both syntactically and semantically acceptable. However, it's important to note that the term \\"insane\\" can be considered offensive when referring to someone's mental health. A sensitive alternative could be \\"I think that person we met last week may have some mental health issues.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Solve -z + 41 - 33 = 0 for z.","completion":"The given equation is: -z + 41 - 33 = 0 Before solving for 'z', we need to simplify the equation. First, combine like terms on the left side, which includes 41 and -33: -z + (41 - 33) = 0 -z + 8 = 0 Now you have a simplified equation. It's much easier to solve this equation for 'z'. To solve -z + 8 = 0 for 'z', you will need to isolate 'z' on one side of the equation. If you subtract 8 from both sides of the equation (-z + 8 - 8 = 0 - 8), you will get: -z = -8 Up till now, you're doing operations on both sides of the equation that keeps the meaning to remain same. We're just rearranging it to solve for 'z'. The current equation is -z = -8, and it can be further simplified by dividing both sides of the equation by -1 to isolate 'z': -z / -1 = -8 / -1 This gives: z = 8 So, the solution to the equation -z + 41 - 33 = 0 is z = 8."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Solti recorded throughout his career for the Decca Record Company. He made more than 250 recordings, including 45 complete opera sets. During the 1950s and 1960s Decca had an alliance with RCA Victor, and some of Solti's recordings were first issued on the RCA label.Solti was one of the first conductors who came to international fame as a recording artist before being widely known in the concert hall or opera house. Gordon Parry, the Decca engineer who worked with Solti and Culshaw on the Ring recordings, observed, \\"Many people have said 'Oh well, of course John Culshaw made Solti.' This is not true. He gave him the opportunity to show what he could do.\\"Solti's first recordings were as a piano accompanist, playing at sessions in Zurich for the violinist Georg Kulenkampff in 1947. Decca's senior producer, Victor Olof did not much admire Solti as a conductor (nor did Walter Legge, Olof's opposite number at EMI's Columbia Records), but Olof's younger colleague and successor, Culshaw, held Solti in high regard. As Culshaw, and later James Walker, produced his recordings, Solti's career as a recording artist flourished from the mid-1950s. Among the orchestras with whom Solti recorded were the Berlin Philharmonic, Chicago Symphony, London Philharmonic, London Symphony and Vienna Philharmonic orchestras. Soloists in his operatic recordings included Birgit Nilsson, Joan Sutherland, Régine Crespin, Plácido Domingo, Gottlob Frick, Carlo Bergonzi, Kiri Te Kanawa and José van Dam. In concerto recordings, Solti conducted for, among others, András Schiff, Julius Katchen, Clifford Curzon, Vladimir Ashkenazy and Kyung-wha Chung.Solti's most celebrated recording was Wagner's Der Ring des Nibelungen made in Vienna, produced by Culshaw, between 1958 and 1965. It has twice been voted the greatest recording ever made, the first poll being among readers of Gramophone magazine in 1999, and the second of professional music critics in 2011, for the BBC's Music Magazine.

Question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the full name of the person who had a procedure that took 55 minutes and was a complete success? After Shackleton left with the James Caird, Frank Wild took command of the Elephant Island party, some of whom were in a low state, physically or mentally: Lewis Rickinson had suffered a suspected heart attack; Perce Blackborow was unable to walk, due to frostbitten feet; Hubert Hudson was depressed. The priority for the party was a permanent shelter against the rapidly approaching southern winter. On the suggestion of George Marston and Lionel Greenstreet, a hut—nicknamed the \\"Snuggery\\"—was improvised by upturning the two boats and placing them on low stone walls, to provide around five feet (1.5 m) of headroom. By means of canvas and other materials the structure was made into a crude but effective shelter.Wild initially estimated that they would have to wait one month for rescue, and refused to allow long-term stockpiling of seal and penguin meat because this, in his view, was defeatist. This policy led to sharp disagreements with Thomas Orde-Lees, who was not a popular man and whose presence apparently did little to improve the morale of his companions, unless it was by way of being the butt of their jokes.As the weeks extended well beyond his initial optimistic forecast, Wild established and maintained routines and activities to relieve the tedium. A permanent lookout was kept for the arrival of the rescue ship, cooking and housekeeping rotas were established, and there were hunting trips for seal and penguin. Concerts were held on Saturdays and anniversaries were celebrated, but there were growing feelings of despondency as time passed with no sign of the ship. The toes on Blackborow's left foot became gangrenous from frostbite and, on 15 June, had to be amputated by surgeons Alexander Macklin and James McIlroy in the candle-lit hut. Using the very last of the chloroform in their medical supplies, the whole procedure took 55 minutes and was a complete success.By 23 August, it seemed that Wild's no-stockpiling policy had failed. The surrounding sea was dense with pack ice that would halt any rescue ship,...

In this task, you are given a public comment from online platforms. You are expected to classify the comment into two classes: insult and non-insult. Insult is any lanugage or act that is disrespectful or scornfully abusive. Comment: Ya, well that's a load of crap. The idea is to reduce emissions, not redistribute wealth. Of course, the extremist Christian right doesn't really care what the accord is about since in their view any suggestion that humans can modify climate goes against their fundamentalist religious ideas. So let God take care of it. Ya, well, I'll stick with the scientists, thanks. Much better track record. Just calling a spade spade.","completion":"To perform this task, I will start by examining closely the comment provided and determine if there are any phrases or words used that could be deemed disrespectful or scornfully abusive. Step 1: Carefully read the comment for understanding - The commentor has a negative tone and they seem to be criticizing an ideological perspective and arguing against some religious beliefs. They also express faith in scientific viewpoints. Step 2: Identify potentially insulting phrases - The commentor uses phrases like \\"that's a load of crap\\", “extremist Christian right”, \\"fundamentalist religious ideas\\" and \\"Just calling a spade spade\\". These phrases could potentially be seen as dismissive or disrespectful. Step 3: Analyze the context of the potentially insulting phrases - This comment decidedly criticizes certain political and religious viewpoints, rather than directly insulting an individual. However, it does use language that could be considered disrespectful towards those beliefs and the people who hold them, such as calling views \\"a load of crap\\" or referring to religious ideas as \\"fundamentalist\\". Step 4: Make a judgement based on analysis - Based on the analysis conducted, it can be judged that while this comment doesn't contain any direct personal attacks or highly offensive language, it does have elements of disrespectful language targeted towards ideological and religious viewpoints. Thus, it can be deemed as an insult, considering the broader context. In summary, the comment can be classified as an insult because even though it doesn't directly offend individuals, it can potentially offend the people holding the ideas and beliefs discussed in a disrespectful way."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

He was identified as Steven Kropf, 63, of El Paso, Texas. \\"This is one disgruntled, deranged individual,\\" said Maj. Gen. Dana Pittard, the post's commander. The two female victims were transported to Beaumont Army Medical Center, where one, Bettina Maria Goins, 44, of El Paso was pronounced dead. The unidentified wounded woman remained hospitalized with serious injuries. The gunman entered the busy Shopette Convenience Store on the post around 3 p.m. and shot the two civilian employees in a rear office.

Movie plot title: Salem's Lot Movie plot: At a church in Guatemala, a man and a boy, Ben Mears (David Soul) and Mark Petrie (Lance Kerwin), are filling small bottles with holy water. When one of the bottles begins to emit an eerie supernatural glow, Mears tells Petrie \\"They've found us again.\\" Knowing an evil presence is there, they decide to fight it. Two years earlier, in the small town of Salem's Lot (formally known as Jerusalem's Lot) in Maine in the United States, Ben Mears, an author, has returned to the town after a long absence to write a book about the Marsten House, an ominous old property on a hilltop which has a reputation for being haunted. Mears attempts to rent the house but finds that another new arrival in town, the mysterious Richard Straker (James Mason), has recently bought it. Straker also opens an antique shop with his oft-mentioned but always absent business partner, Kurt Barlow. Meanwhile, Mears moves into a boarding house in town run by Eva Miller (Marie Windsor), and develops a romantic relationship with a local woman, Susan Norton (Bonnie Bedelia). He befriends Susan's father, Dr. Bill Norton (Ed Flanders), and also renews his old friendship with his former school teacher, Jason Burke (Lew Ayres). Mears tells Burke that he feels the Marsten House is somehow inherently evil, and recalls how he was once traumatized inside the house when he was a child. After a large crate is delivered to the Marsten House one night, an increasing number of the townsfolk begin to disappear or die in strange circumstances. Both Mears and Straker are initially the main suspects as they are new in town, but it becomes clear that the crate contained Straker's mysterious business partner, Kurt Barlow (Reggie Nalder), an ancient master vampire who has come to the town after having sent Straker to make way for his arrival. Straker kidnaps a young local boy, Ralphie Glick (Ronnie Scribner), as an offering to Barlow, while Barlow himself kills local realtor Larry Crockett (Fred Willard). The Glick boy then returns as a vampire to claim his brother,...

In the casino, Omar attracts the attention of a beautiful, privileged young woman (Gene Tierney), fresh from a European finishing school. She is out for some excitement. When asked, she gives her name as \\"Poppy\\" Smith. Meanwhile, Gin Sling is informed that she must move her establishment to the much less desirable Chinese sector. She is given five or six weeks, until Chinese New Year, to comply. Gin Sling is confident that she can thwart this threat to her livelihood, and orders her minions to find out everything they can about the man behind it, Englishman Sir Guy Charteris (Walter Huston), a wealthy entrepreneur who has purchased a large area of Shanghai that contains her gambling parlor. Dixie proves to be an unexpected source of information; Charteris had taken her out to dinner a number of times, before dumping her to avoid her meeting his newly arrived daughter, Poppy, whose real name is Victoria Charteris. From Dixie's description, Gin Sling realizes Charteris is someone from her past. Meanwhile, Poppy falls in love with Omar and becomes addicted to gambling and alcohol. Though the spoiled woman is openly contemptuous of the casino owner, Gin Sling allows her credit to cover her ever growing losses. Gin Sling invites Charteris and other important dignitaries to a Chinese New Year dinner party. Charteris at first declines, but then curiosity gets the better of him. At the dinner, she exposes his disgraceful past. Charteris, then calling himself Victor Dawson, had married her. One day, he abandoned her, taking her inheritance, leaving her destitute and alone.

The occurrence of Zugunruhe even in cage-raised birds with no environmental cues (e.g. shortening of day and falling temperature) has pointed to the role of circannual endogenous programs in controlling bird migrations.

Translate this to English?","completion":"I believe that it is essential to maintain the current milk quota system. Preserving the current milk quota system is crucial for a number of reasons. Firstly, it ensures a stable and predictable supply of milk in the market. This stability is important for both farmers and consumers. For farmers, knowing how much milk they are allowed to produce enables them to plan and manage their resources effectively. They can invest in the necessary infrastructure, feed, and livestock to meet their quotas, and they can predict their income for the year. For consumers, a stable supply of milk means that they can count on this essential product to be readily available in stores at a consistent price. The milk quota system also protects small-scale farmers from market fluctuations and the risk of being undercut by larger, more industrialized competitors. Small farmers might not have the resources to adapt quickly to rapid changes in the market, and sudden increases or decreases in milk prices could put them at a significant disadvantage. The quota system thus helps to maintain a diverse and vibrant farming sector, ensuring that farmers of all sizes can make a living from dairy production. In addition, maintaining a milk quota system also has environmental implications. Without quotas, there could potentially be an increase in milk production, which might contribute to overgrazing, habitat loss, and increased greenhouse gas emissions. By putting a cap on how much milk each farmer can produce, the quota system helps to ensure that dairy farming is carried out in a sustainable and environmentally responsible manner. This is particularly important in the face of climate change and the need to reduce our environmental impact. Furthermore, the milk quota system can help to avoid overproduction and waste. In the absence of quotas, farmers might be tempted to produce as much milk as possible, which could lead to surplus and potentially wasted milk. This would not only be bad for the environment but also a waste of valuable resources such as water, fertilizers, and energy, which are used in milk production. By setting limits on milk production, the quota system helps to ensure that resources are used efficiently and milk waste is minimized. Lastly, maintaining the current milk quota system allows for better regulation and monitoring of the dairy industry. Quotas enable policymakers to have a clear overview of the industry and track production trends. This information can be used to make informed decisions on pricing, import/export policies, and other dairy-related issues. Additionally, enforcing quotas can help keep illegal practices in check, such as producing milk beyond the allowed quotas or using hormones to increase milk yield. In conclusion, it is crucial to maintain the current milk quota system to ensure a stable and predictable supply of milk, support small-scale farmers, promote environmental sustainability, prevent overproduction and waste, and allow for better regulation of the dairy industry."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: It was not entirely true that Patch knew there was food in the mountains. He had never been to the mountains. No squirrel in all the Center Kingdom, as far as he knew, had ever been to the mountains. For between the kingdom and the mountains, surrounding it on all sides like a moat around a castle, there lay a blasted concrete wasteland, as wide as fifty squirrels laid nose to tail, and horrific death machines roared up and down this wasteland at terrifying speeds, all day and night. What's more, humans and dogs often crossed between the mountains and the kingdoms. And sometimes the dogs were not leashed. A squirrel would have to be very desperate indeed to dare the wastelands. It was Toro who had told Patch about the food in the mountains. Toro was Patch's friend. And that itself was extraordinary. Patch had always talked to birds. The drey he had grown up in -- Silver's old drey, before she became leader of the Seeker clan -- had been only a few branches away from a nest of robins. Once, in early spring when he was still a baby, Patch had crawled out of Silver's drey and into the robin's nest, and had spent a whole day among the chicks before Silver returned home and retrieved him. The robin mother had been unamused by Silver's profound apologies, and even less amused when Patch had returned to her nest the very next day. Eventually Silver taught Patch to leave the robins alone, but not before he had learned how to speak Bird. Most squirrels of the Center Kingdom could say and understand a few simple things in Bird, but Patch could actually hold conversations. And so, one autumn day when a bluejay swooped past and stole an acorn out of Patch's paws, Patch shouted angrily at the thief in Bird to bring it back; and the thief, intrigued, wheeled around in midair, perched on a branch above Patch, and looked curiously down at the irate squirrel. \\"Thieving feather-brained no-nose hawkbait!\\" Patch shouted up. \\"Stupid blind furry groundworm!\\" the bluejay retorted, and began to peck at the acorn.

Since their domestication, a large number of breeds of chickens have been established, but with the exception of the white Leghorn, most commercial birds are of hybrid origin. In about 1800, chickens began to be kept on a larger scale, and modern high-output poultry farms were present in the United Kingdom from around 1920 and became established in the United States soon after the Second World War. By the mid-20th century, the poultry meat-producing industry was of greater importance than the egg-laying industry. Poultry breeding has produced breeds and strains to fulfil different needs; light-framed, egg-laying birds that can produce 300 eggs a year; fast-growing, fleshy birds destined for consumption at a young age, and utility birds which produce both an acceptable number of eggs and a well-fleshed carcase. Male birds are unwanted in the egg-laying industry and can often be identified as soon as they are hatch for subsequent culling. In meat breeds, these birds are sometimes castrated (often chemically) to prevent aggression. The resulting bird, called a capon, has more tender and flavorful meat, as well. Try to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply \\"unanswerable\\"): How can you normally identify a cock when it doesn't hatch?","completion":"It is unanswerable to identify a cock before it hatches. However, once the chicks have hatched, there are certain ways to identify or distinguish between a male (cockerel) and a female (pullet) at an early stage. Some common methods include vent sexing, feather sexing, chick behavior observation, and color sexing. It is important to understand that sexing chicks is not always 100% accurate, especially for untrained individuals. 1. Vent sexing: This method requires expertise and experience. The professional sexer gently squeezes the chick's abdomen around its vent to expose the sexual organs. In a male chick, a small bump is seen, representing the rudimentary phallus or male reproductive organ. This method is considered one of the most accurate ways to identify gender but should only be done by professionals to avoid injury to the chicks. 2. Feather sexing: This technique can be used in certain breeds that exhibit differences in feather growth rates between males and females. Typically, female chicks will have longer primary wing feathers, while males have shorter, more evenly spaced wing feathers. This method is usually most effective within the first few days after hatching. 3. Chick behavior observation: In general, male chicks tend to be more assertive and active compared to female chicks. They may be observed pecking at their surroundings or other chicks more frequently. Male chicks also often stand taller with a more upright posture. However, this method is relatively subjective and less accurate than other methods. 4. Color sexing: Some chicken breeds have distinct color patterns that allow identification of their sex at hatching. For example, the Rhode Island Red breed has females with darker red feathers, while males have a lighter coloration. The accuracy of this method highly depends on the specific breed of chicken and may not be applicable to all breeds. Despite these methods, it is nearly impossible to accurately determine a cock's gender before it hatches. Only after hatching can the various sexing techniques be implemented to identify and distinguish between male and female chicks."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Answer the following question: Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: For many centuries, the phi song neng (vampires who have vowed never to drink human blood) have lived among the villages of the Far East. One day over 800 years ago, a young human warlord named Niran fell in love with one of the song neng, a woman named Sang. Niran wanted Sang for his own, so he killed her husband and son. In her pain and rage, Sang attacked and bit Niran during a Songkran (New Year) solar eclipse, turning him into a vampire. From Niran's bloodline have come many jai tham (vampires who drink human blood and kill for pleasure). Only Sang can end the jai tham's nightly attacks on humans. Doing so, however, will end the entire bloodline and turn every vampire, song neng as well as jai tham, into mere mortals again. Since the coming Songkran festival will feature the first solar eclipse in 800 years, Sang intends to kill herself by exposing herself to the sun's rays at the end of the eclipse and thus wipe out all the vampires in Thailand. Connor (Colin Egglesfield) and Amanda (Meredith Monroe) are vacationing in Thailand during this year's Songkran festival. Connor, trained since childhood in Muay Thai (Thai boxing), takes Amanda to see a match. However, Amanda cannot take the brutality and goes back to their hotel alone. On the way, she gets lost in the Phang Nga market, and Mr Nice Guy (Dom Hetrakul) offers to show her the way to her hotel. He leads her on a short cut down a deserted alley, then turns into the vampire Niran, drinking her blood and carrying her off on a motorcycle. Connor tries to follow, but he is stopped by another vampire, obviously intent on killing him. Just as the vampire is about to succeed, a bald-headed man appears and chops off the vampire's head. Connor begs for his help finding Amanda, but he warns Connor to leave Thailand immediately and threatens to kill Connor if he follows him. Connor stealthily follows Kiko (Roger Yuan) home to Kong Sai House. When the police refuse to consider Amanda missing until 48 hours have passed, Connor goes back to Kong Sai House, only...

I heard that Casey was dyslexic so Kendall completed their application for a job so that Casey would get an interview and show their skills then. And I was wondering How would Kendall feel afterwards? Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided, it can be inferred that Kendall is a supportive and caring individual who takes the initiative to help Casey in their job application process. With the knowledge of Casey's dyslexia, Kendall wants to ensure that Casey has a fair chance at securing a job interview and showcasing their talents, while not being held back by their learning disability. After completing the application for Casey, Kendall would likely feel a mix of emotions: 1. Satisfaction: Kendall would feel content and satisfied knowing that they have made a positive impact on Casey's life. They were able to use their strengths to help someone they care about overcome a challenge in their lives. By helping Casey, Kendall would feel that they have accomplished something meaningful and significant. 2. Empathy: Given the understanding of Casey's struggles with dyslexia, Kendall might feel a sense of empathy towards them. This empathy would strengthen their bond and could motivate Kendall to continue providing support for Casey in the future. 3. Pride: Kendall could feel a sense of pride in their abilities, both as an individual and a friend. They have used their skills to help another person in need, showcasing their own talents and resourcefulness in the process. 4. Anticipation: After submitting the job application, Kendall may feel anxious and hopeful about the outcome. They would likely be eagerly awaiting the employer’s response, hoping that their efforts lead to a successful interview for Casey and, ultimately, a job offer. 5. Reflection: After completing the job application for Casey and seeing the impact of their actions, Kendall may begin to reevaluate the importance of understanding and supporting others with learning disabilities. They could feel inspired to learn more about dyslexia and how to accommodate or help others who may be struggling with similar issues in their own lives. 6. Concern: While Kendall might feel good about helping Casey at this moment, they could also feel concern about the long-term implications. They may worry about being relied upon too much in the future, or about how Casey will manage tasks on their own at work if they do get the job. This concern could encourage Kendall to help Casey find additional resources that could provide ongoing assistance, such as accommodations at work or tools specifically designed for those with dyslexia. In summary, this act of kindness and support for Casey would likely evoke feelings of satisfaction, empathy, pride, anticipation, reflection, and concern within Kendall. These emotions highlight the complexities of human relationships, personal growth, and the importance of understanding one another's challenges. By addressing these feelings and concerns, Kendall would have the opportunity to strengthen their bond, learn valuable life lessons, and continue their role as a supportive friend to Casey in the future."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: Chopper video shows the scene of the crash between an Amtrak train carrying Republican members of Congress and a truck in Virginia. (Published 2 hours ago) One person is dead and a member of Congress was taken to the hospital after an Amtrak train carrying some Republican members of Congress and their families to a party retreat in West Virginia collided with a garbage truck Wednesday, authorities said. No member of Congress or their staff was seriously hurt, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a statement. But one person is dead and another was seriously hurt, Sanders said, offering the White House's thoughts and prayers for those affected. The fatality and critical injury involved people in the truck, according to Jessica Twohey, a spokeswoman for the Congressional Institute, which sponsors major conferences for members of Congress. One member of Congress was sent to the hospital while another member and a congressional staffer were being examined. Some members of the congressional delegation rushed to the warped, overturned truck after the train stopped near Charlottesville, Virginia, including at least two who did the same at another deadly incident involving a group of Republicans, the shooting at a congressional baseball practice last year that left Rep. Steve Scalise, R-La., severely wounded: Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake and Ohio Rep. Brad Wenstrup. Flake said on CNN he helped secure a very badly injured person onto a stretcher and saw another person who was dead: \\"They worked on him for quite a while but they could not revive him.\\" He said on MSNBC that a third person, who appeared to be the truck's driver, was able to walk away from the wreck. \\"It seems to have been just a horrible, horrible accident,\\" Flake said, adding that, \\"with Brad Wenstrup there, it was all too reminiscent of the Scalise incident.\\" Scalise was not on Wednesday's Amtrak train, one of many Republican members of Congress tweeted or called into cable news channels to say they weren't hurt. Rep. Carlos Curbelo, R-Fla., was on the train with his wife when \\"there was a sudden impact, a loud noise and everyone was jolted,\\" he said on MSNBC. \\"My wife who was in front of me, her cellphone went flying,\\" he continued. \\"It was just uncomfortable for a few minutes and as we started realizing that everyone was okay I think people started feeling a little better.\\" Curbelo said there were some minor injuries but \\"most people are OK here.\\" Minnesota Rep. Jason Lewis was taken to an area hospital for a reported concussion, a source connected to senior leadership told NBC News, but it's not considered a serious injury. House Speaker Paul Ryan was not hurt, sources told NBC News. But a lawyer for his team was taken to a hospital with a suspected concussion, according to a source. A spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he was not on the train. President Donald Trump, who was meeting with his national security team, was made aware of the incident and is receiving regular updates, Sanders said. An Amtrak representative said the train collided with a truck on the tracks in Crozet, Virginia, at 11:20 a.m. ET. The incident is under investigation by local law enforcement, according to the Amtrak statement. Amtrak had said there were no injuries, but in an update said two members of its crew and two passengers received minor injuries. The United States Capitol Police is at the scene and working with other law enforcement agencies, according to a representative. A person died in a separate crash related to a congressional retreat to West Virginia last year. The driver of an SUV was killed in a chain-reaction crash on Jan. 25, 2017, as police blocked traffic in Maryland to clear the way for a motorcade of buses. Congressional Democratic leaders tweeted their support after Wednesday's crash. \\"Awful to hear of my Republican colleagues' train accident. We're praying for the safety of everyone on the train and in the truck,\\" Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said. \\"Praying that all are well both on the train and off,\\" Rep.

Given the question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What are the names of the people Flosshilde pretends to chastise? As the musical prelude climaxes, Woglinde and Wellgunde are seen at play in the depths of the Rhine. Flosshilde joins them after a gentle reminder of their responsibilities as guardians of the gold. They are observed by the Nibelung dwarf Alberich who calls out to them: \\"I'd like to draw near if you would be kind to me\\". The wary Flosshilde cries: \\"Guard the gold! Father warned us of such a foe\\". When Alberich begins his rough wooing the maidens relax: \\"Now I laugh at my fears, our enemy is in love\\", says Flosshilde, and a cruel teasing game ensues. First, Woglinde pretends to respond to the dwarf's advances but swims away as he tries to embrace her. Then Wellgunde takes over, and Alberich's hopes rise until her sharp retort: \\"Ugh, you hairy hunchbacked clown!\\" Flosshilde pretends to chastise her sisters for their cruelty and feigns her own courtship, by which Alberich is quite taken in until she suddenly tears away to join the others in a mocking song. Tormented with lust, Alberich furiously chases the maidens over the rocks, slipping and sliding as they elude him, before he sinks down in impotent rage. At this point the mood changes: as a sudden brightness penetrates the depths, a magical golden light reveals, for the first time, the Rhinegold on its rock. The maidens sing their ecstatic greeting to the gold, which rouses Alberich's curiosity. In response to his question Woglinde and Wellgunde reveal the gold's secret: measureless power would belong to the one who could forge a ring from it. Flosshilde scolds them for giving this secret away, but her concerns are dismissed—only someone who has forsworn love can obtain the gold, and Alberich is clearly so besotted as to present no danger. But their confidence is misplaced; in his humiliation Alberich decides that world mastery is more desirable than love. As the maidens continue to jeer his antics he scrambles up the rock and, uttering a curse on love, seizes the gold and disappears, leaving the Rhinemaidens to dive after him bewailing their loss. The answer is:","completion":"Woglinde and Wellgunde are the names of the people Flosshilde pretends to chastise.

Bennett was born in Sheffield, Yorkshire, the third child and only son of Robert Bennett, the organist of Sheffield parish church, and his wife Elizabeth, née Donn. In addition to his duties as an organist, Robert Bennett was a conductor, composer and piano teacher; he named his son after his friend William Sterndale, some of whose poems the elder Bennett had set to music. His mother died in 1818, aged 27, and his father, after remarrying, died in 1819. Thus orphaned at the age of three, Bennett was brought up in Cambridge by his paternal grandfather, John Bennett, from whom he received his first musical education. John Bennett was a professional bass, who sang as a lay clerk in the choirs of King's, St John's and Trinity colleges. The young Bennett entered the choir of King's College Chapel in February 1824 where he remained for two years. In 1826, at the age of ten, he was accepted into the Royal Academy of Music (RAM), which had been founded in 1822. The examiners were so impressed by the child's talent that they waived all fees for his tuition and board.Bennett was a pupil at the RAM for the next ten years. At his grandfather's wish his principal instrumental studies were at first as a violinist, under Paolo Spagnoletti and later Antonio James Oury. He also studied the piano under W. H. Holmes, and after five years, with his grandfather's agreement, he took the piano as his principal study. He was a shy youth and was diffident about his skill in composition, which he studied under the principal of the RAM, William Crotch, and then under Cipriani Potter, who took over as principal in 1832. Amongst the friends Bennett made at the Academy was the future music critic J. W. Davison. Bennett did not study singing, but when the RAM mounted a student production of The Marriage of Figaro in 1830, Bennett, aged fourteen, was cast in the mezzo-soprano role of the page boy Cherubino (usually played by a woman en travesti). This was among the few failures of his career at the RAM. The Observer wryly commented, \\"of the... Answer:","completion":"Bennett"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

About 25 teen guys and girls are active members of this search, rescue and emergency organization, and they know firsthand that you don't have to be an adult to save lives. These 9th-through-12th graders are the real deal when it comes to emergency services. In fact, they're the only teen-commanded patrol in the nation. Sure they have adult advisers to turn to if necessary, but in the field it's a teen patrol officer calling the shots -- sometimes even giving direction to adults. Members are trained in rock-high-angle,swift-water and avalanche rescue , winter and alpine operation , wilderness life support and emergency care, among other skills. They also regularly ride along with the local fire and police departments, providing support such as security details and evidence searching. When asked what qualities make a good patrol member, founder and president Stan Bush named good physical conditioning and an interest in helping people. \\"We put in lots and lots of hours helping people in trouble,\\" he says. \\"So if a person is not really interested in doing that kind of thing, he won't last as a member.\\" Question: If you want to become a good rescue patrol member, you must _ .

Given the below context: Ben Mockridge is a young man proud of his 4 handgun and enamored of \\"cowboyin'\\". He asks Frank Culpepper if he can join his cattle drive to Fort Lewis, Colorado. Culpepper (a reformed gunslinger) reluctantly agrees and sends Ben to the cook to be his \\"little Mary\\". Ben quickly discovers that the adults have little interest in young'ns, and no interest in \\"showing him the ropes\\". Culpepper nevertheless assigns Ben tasks the greenhorn handles poorly—or simply fails at—repeatedly causing serious trouble. After rustlers stampede the herd, Culpepper tracks them to a box canyon. When the rustlers' leader demands 50 cents a head for having rounded up and taken care of the cattle, Culpepper will have none of it. He and his hands kill the rustlers, not hesitating to gun down disarmed men, or repeatedly shoot anyone still moving. They lose four of their own in the fight. Culpepper directs Ben to a cantina a day's ride off, to find Russ Caldwell. Before he can reach the cantina, Ben is accosted by trappers who take his horse and gun. Once Ben finds Caldwell, he and three of his buddies agree to join the drive. When they cross the trappers' path, there is no parlaying—they immediately kill the trappers and take their possessions. When Ben stands night watch, he's unprepared for a one-eyed man trying to steal the horses. Instead of immediately shooting him, Ben lets the man distract him with his talk, and is overcome by another thief. Culpepper is outraged at Ben's stupidity. Guess a valid title for it!

He'd take the liberty to hide my backpack, borrow my books without consent, doodle scandalous stuff on my notebooks with a pen and yada yada. So one day, I was showing this cool trick I learned on an anatomy program on the TV to a couple of classmates who used to sit around me. The thing was that you can't flex your ring finger upwards if you put your middle finger under the palm (try that) We were all kids, and soon everyone in the class started staring at us weirdos looking laughing at out hands. The bully noticed it too, and came near to inquire about this hand stuff. I described the trick and he was impressed. And then, I saw our teacher walking up the corridor, just a couple paces behind the class door. So, I asked him (the bully) if he wanted to see another trick and to that he nodded a big yes. Cool, What I did was, that I grabbed his right arm by the thumb and put it on my throat right above the larynx. Then I quickly shifted my grip to his wrist. He without batting an eye, asked what I was doing, but then I started beating the desk with my other hand and made squeaking noises while pushing his hand against my throat harder with every turning head. And voilà! Every one in the class (including the teacher) thought he was smothering me. After a few ifs and buts between him and the teacher, he was summoned at the principal’s chambers, from where, later he was sent home, where presumably judging from the look on his face for the next few days, he was beat to crap by his folks.

Narration by Angus the Hangman explains how the corpses of the hanged are transported to Dr Robert Knox for dissection. Knox's rival, Dr Alexander Monro, wants the steady supply of cadavers but is forced to rely on severed limbs for dissection. Monro's assistant Charles Darwin arrives with a forged letter directing that all corpses thenceforth must be sent to Monro. Angus tells Knox's assistant, Patterson, the news. Patterson delivers the message to Knox. William Burke and William Hare, immigrants from Ulster, attempt to sell cheese mould as a patent medicine. When their fraud is discovered, they flee to an inn owned by Hare's wife, Lucky. She tells them that one of the lodgers has died. Burke and Hare decide to sell the corpse to Knox. They are forced to break the corpse's spine to fit it into a barrel in order to smuggle it through the city. They stop at a pub along the way, where a young former prostitute, Ginny Hawkins, loudly performs an excerpt from Macbeth. The patrons ignore her. Burke asks her why she did this, and she says that it is her ambition to become an actress. They share a drink; Hare reminds Burke that they must continue to Knox's house. Burke and Hare present the now-mangled corpse to Knox. After some negotiation, Knox agrees to pay them a good sum of money for each corpse they bring him for dissection. Burke plans to use his money to finance Ginny's theatrical ambitions, and Hare decides to open a funeral parlour. Returning to the inn, they find Lucky drunk and barely conscious. Lucky says she is drinking because Joseph, another lodger at the inn, is near death. Not willing to wait for the outcome, Burke and Hare suffocate Joseph and take the body to Knox. Afterward, Burke tells Ginny about the money. She allows him to take her home. Hare meets Fergus, the henchman of villain Danny McTavish, at a bar.

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Monster Context: The film takes place in Tokyo in 2003, where two reporters - Sarah Sullivan (Sarah Lieving) and Erin Lynch (Erin Sullivan) - have arrived from the United States to document unusual seismic disturbances that have been picked up around Tokyo. The disturbances are originally thought to be aftershocks left over from a supposed massive earthquake on the Kanto Fault that occurred two years previously, causing hundreds of thousands of casualties and several hundred billion dollars in damage(possibly referencing the real-life Fukuoka earthquake or the Miyagi earthquake), although careful analysis of the evidence suggests otherwise. As time goes on, all of Tokyo begins to suffer from abnormal earth tremors similar to those registered in 2005, but the tremors are found not to be caused by an earthquake, but by a gigantic octopus that has been dormant for centuries, but has since been awakened by mankind, and now sees Tokyo as a new feeding-ground, with the filmmakers documenting the catastrophe as it unfolds.It starts as Sarah and Erin are talking about filming Tokyo. The scene then switches to the interior of Sarah's car as the two drive to LAX, to catch their flight to Tokyo. In Tokyo they rent a hotel room, and, the next day, Erin films Sarah talking with the global warming minister. During the interview, an earthquake strikes and the scene again switches to the reporters in the basement of the environmental building trying to find someone who can speak English. Eventually, they find Justin - a worker - who is from America as well. He says that they have to go to the American embassy, and, as they flee, they hear the sounds of panic and plane engines from a tunnel.Later, they find a mall, and another earthquake occurs. In the chaos, Justin is impaled by a pole as the reporters flee in panic. Some small text appears on the screen saying that tape #3 was damaged. As the reporters run toward a mall they find a woman and her grandfather, and they eat and sleep, Sarah not realizing she had left the camera turned on.... Answer:","completion":"In the context of the movie \\"Monster,\\" the earthquake-like disturbances caused by the gigantic octopus promote chaos rather than peace. The unusual seismic activities lead to panic, destruction, and death throughout Tokyo as the octopus wreaks havoc on the city. The film primarily follows Sarah and Erin, two reporters documenting the events, as they encounter the resulting chaos and attempt to survive the catastrophe. The earthquake-like events in the movie serve as a catalyst for the chaos and the unfolding disaster, challenging the characters to navigate the dangerous and unpredictable situation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

But on Friday, he said he and Mrs May had \\"probably never developed a better relationship\\" than during this trip - his first to the UK as president. Meanwhile, a giant blimp of Mr Trump as a baby is floating in central London. It is part of a demonstration in Parliament Square, one of many due to take place across the UK on Friday. In his interview with the Sun, Mr Trump also said that former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - who disagrees with the PM on Brexit and resigned this week - would make a \\"great prime minister\\", adding \\"I think he's got what it takes\\". He also renewed his criticism of London Mayor Sadiq Khan over last year's terror attacks in London, saying he had done \\"a terrible job\\". Downing Street has not yet reacted to Mr Trump's remarks, but Chancellor Philip Hammond said the talks will be \\"very positive\\". Theresa May has been making the case for a US free trade deal, and says Brexit is an \\"unprecedented opportunity\\" to create jobs in the UK and US.

Some 16 balloon minders in yellow vests identifying themselves as \\"babysitters\\" minded lead lines to the 6-meter (20-foot) inflatable as the curious gawked and took pictures. Dominique Blum, 31, and Mia Parker, 50, from Pensacola Florida, were overjoyed with the spectacle. Parker says she hopes the protest will encourage more people to get creative and organized in protesting Trump's policies. She says \\"it's brilliant. I just want to party with these people forever.\\" ___ 9:30 a.m. Demonstrators plan to mock U.S. President Donald Trump with a giant balloon depicting him as a screaming orange baby as tens of thousands march through the streets of London to protest the American leader's visit to the U.K. The diaper-clad balloon infant, with a quiff of hair and a mobile phone for tweeting, is to soar Friday over the Houses of Parliament in London. It's the centerpiece of demonstrations across the country protesting Trump's policies on issues ranging from immigration and race relations to women and climate change. Kevin Smith, one of the 16 people behind the balloon, says \\"this is what people need to be doing — to come together in their communities to organize and work out how to stand against right wing populism and xenophobia that we're seeing not just in the U.S. but in Europe.\\" Protest organizers say they plan to stage demonstrations in some 50 cities around the U.K. ___ 9 a.m. President Donald Trump's visit to Britain is one of the biggest operations for police in recent years, requiring similar resources to the 2014 NATO summit in Wales. Protests are planned Friday in some 50 U.K. cities. In London, a screaming orange baby balloon will be featured in the anti-Trump protest. The 20-foot (6-meter) tall balloon's creators, who call themselves babysitters, admit they borrowed the idea from comedian Jon Stewart, who in 2016 called Trump a \\"man-baby.\\" A crowd-funding campaign raised 20,000 pounds (26,400) to make it a reality. Matthew Bonner, one of the organizers, says \\"depicting Trump as a baby is a great way of targeting his fragile ego, and mocking him is our main motivation.\\" He says Trump \\"doesn't seem to be affected by the moral outrage that comes from his behavior and his policies. You can't reason with him but you can ridicule him.\\" ||||| Sadiq Khan has hit back at “preposterous” claims by Donald Trump after the US president criticised the London mayor for doing a “a bad job” on terrorism and crime in the capital. In an interview in the Sun, Trump lashed out at Khan, who has allowed a Trump protest balloon to float above Westminster during his visit.

I think he has done a very bad job on terrorism. “I think he has done a bad job on crime, if you look, all of the horrible things going on there, with all of the crime that is being brought in.” Khan responded on Friday morning, saying terrorism was a global problem, with people dying all over Europe. “What is interesting is Trump is not criticising mayors of those cities, but he is criticising me,” he said in an interview on the BBC’s Today programme. Trump’s comments blaming immigration for crime in England were “preposterous”, he added. “There has been an increase in violent crime across England and Wales … it’s gone up by more than 20% … and by 4% in London ... We must deal with the causes, but also enforcement and where we have lost £7m in our budget in London I have invested £4m ... [but] the idea to blame immigration from Africa is preposterous, and we should call him out when does,” Khan said. Play Video 0:46 The moment Trump baby blimp lifts off - video Trump’s verbal attack on Khan came after the London mayor refused to block a plan to fly a giant inflatable “Trump baby” near parliament to coincide with the president’s visit to the UK. The 20ft-high blimp depicts the US leader as an angry infant wearing a nappy and clutching a mobile phone. Khan defended the decision, saying to have blocked the inflatable would have been to inhibit freedom of speech. “The UK, like the USA, has a long and rich history of rights and the freedom to protest and freedom of speech. The US ambassador himself commented that one thing [the] USA and the UK have in common is freedom of speech, and the idea of restricting that and [the] right to assemble because someone is offended by something is [a] slippery slope,” he said. “When determining these things [it should be about] ... whether it is safe and peaceful. As a politician I should not be the arbiter of what is good or bad taste.” Khan said there would be far-right and pro-Trump demonstrations taking place on Saturday. “I disagree with their views as well, but letting them protest should not mean endorsing their views ... I am not banning the pro-Trump demo either,” he added. |||||Summary:","completion":"US President Donald Trump criticised UK Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit plan, claiming that it would \\"probably kill\\" any trade deal with the US.

Create an empty set called unique_alphabets to store the unique alphabets found in the input list. 2. Iterate over each element in the input list, and for each element: a. Check if the element is an alphabet by using the isalpha() method. This method returns True if the element is an alphabet, and False otherwise. b. If the element is an alphabet, add it to the unique_alphabets set. Since sets only store unique values, this will ensure that only unique alphabets are stored in it. 3.

But you don't have to win the planet's arguably most prestigious race to make a mint. The richest victory pots lay in places like Japan, Australia and Dubai. The Dubai World Cup, the world's most lucrative race, held in late March, offers a total purse of 6 million. The top race in Japan, the Japan Cup, has a 4.6 million purse. The Derby, meanwhile, dangles 2 million; the Preakness and Belmont Stakes, each 1 million. Winning horses take home 60% of the purse. Of that, jockeys and trainers take 10% each, and the horse's owner gets the rest . Those purses are a big reason seven of the 10 top-earning horses--based on career winnings, tabulated by the Thoroughbred Times' Racing Almanac, a trade publication based in Lexington, Ky.--have hailed from outside the U.S. Six of the seven came from Japan. In Pictures: 10 Top-Earning Horses Successful thoroughbreds typically race for just a few seasons, but many retired champions go on to make hay as studs. Kentucky-born Curlin--the top-earning U.S. horse, and fourth on the list overall, with 10.5 million in career winnings--has garnered another 7.5 million during retirement for fathering 100 new horses at 75,000 a pop. Topping the list: T.M. Opera O, with 16.2 million in career winnings. Born in 1996, the Japanese thoroughbred won 12 major races in his native country between 1999 and 2001, and was inducted into the Japanese Racing Association Hall of Fame in 2004. At No. 2 is Deep Impact, also from Japan, with 12.8 million in winnings. In October 2005, Deep Impact won the Japanese Triple Crown, the first horse to do so in 11 years. Australia's Makybe Diva, the only mare on our list, came in at No. 3, with 10.7 million. Makybe was the first to win the Melbourne Cup three times, in 2003, 2004 and 2005 (four other horses have won it twice). Cigar, another U.S. star, with 10 million in winnings, raced four seasons, bagging the 1995 Breeder's Cup and the inaugural Dubai World Cup in 1996. As part of his retirement celebration, he strolled the streets of New York City and did a lap around Madison Square Garden with his jockey. Sadly, sterility cut his studding career short. Getting into the racing business isn't cheap. Most of the world's best horses are sold as yearlings at auction. The Sotheby's ( BID - news - people ) of thoroughbreds is the Keeneland auction in Lexington, Ky., held in September. Some promising thoroughbreds fetch 1 million or more. Bill Farish, head of Lane's End Farm, a breeder in central Kentucky, sold one named Dunkirk, offspring of two former champion horses, for 3.7 million in 2007. The highest price ever paid at auction: 16 million for 2-year-old Green Monkey at the 2006 Fasig-Tipton Florida sale in Miami. Green didn't produce much green, though: The horse raced just three times, where it landed in third once and fourth twice, before retiring in 2008.

In another way, failure may be a way towards success. The \\"spider-story\\" is often told. Robert Bruce, leader of the Scots in the 13th century, was hiding in a cave from the English. He watched a spider making a web . The spider tried to reach across a rough place in the rock. He tried six times. On the seventh time he made it and went on to make his web. Bruce is said to have been encouraged by this and to have gone on to defeat the English. Edison, the inventor of the light bulb, made hundreds of models that failed before he found the right way to make one. Once he was asked why he kept on trying to make a new type of battery when he had failed so often, he replied, \\"Failure? I have no failure. Now I know 50,000 ways it won't work.\\" So what? First, always think about your failure. What caused it? Were conditions right? Were you in top form yourself? What can you change so things will go right next time? Second, is the goal you're trying to reach the right one? Try to do some thinking about what your real goals may be. Think about this question, \\"If I do succeed in this, where will it get me?\\" This may help you prevent failure in things you shouldn't be doing anyway. The third thing to keep in mind about failure is that it's a part of life. Learn to \\"live with yourself\\" even though you may have failed. Question: Even if we have failed we should _ .

In particular, the third key point in the article directly states that we should \\"Learn to live with yourself\\" despite experiencing failure. This statement implies that we should learn to accept our failures as they are inherent to life and the human experience. Through acceptance, we can effectively manage our failures and use them as a learning and growth opportunity.

With its spectacular performances, magnificent cinematography, and life-changing themes, the film has undeniably stood the test of time and remains one of the greatest movies ever made in the history of cinema. The unparalleled and outstanding performances by the film's cast are the driving force behind The Shawshank Redemption's success. Tim Robbins' portrayal of the protagonist, Andy Dufresne – a mild-mannered banker wrongly incarcerated for the murder of his wife and her lover – is exceptional. Robbins masterfully conveys a wide range of emotions with subtlety, allowing the audience to empathize with his character's journey and resilience. Morgan Freeman, on the other hand, delivers a career-defining role as Ellis Boyd \\"Red\\" Redding, a longtime inmate at Shawshank State Penitentiary who becomes Andy's close friend and confidant over time. Freeman's captivating voiceover narration guides the film's audience through the story while providing unrivaled insight into the minds and hearts of the characters. The supporting cast, including the menacing Warden Norton (played by Bob Gunton) and the vicious guard Captain Hadley (played by Clancy Brown), contribute significantly to the overall atmosphere and narrative of the film. The cinematography, helmed by the talented Roger Deakins, enhances the beauty and depth of The Shawshank Redemption. The film's visuals evoke a plethora of emotions, from the somber and desolate atmosphere of the prison walls to the breathtaking, liberating vistas outside of the penitentiary. Iconic shots, such as Andy raising his arms victoriously in the rain, are now forever etched in the Hollywood lexicon. Deakins' work contributes to the intricate storytelling, showcasing the dichotomy between confinement and freedom, despair and hope. Both the screenplay and the direction by Frank Darabont are noteworthy. Darabont's adaptation of King's novella is highly faithful to the source material, while also expanding and enriching the story with intriguing subplots and well-developed characters. His precise direction delves deep into themes such as justice, spirituality, friendship, and determination, without being overly preachy or heavy-handed. The pacing is spot-on; the film doesn't feel overly long despite its 142-minute runtime. Instead, it immerses the viewers in the story, allowing them to grow with the characters over the decades of their incarceration and the events that unfold within the confines of Shawshank Prison. The evocative score by Thomas Newman perfectly complements the story arc and heightens the emotional impact of pivotal scenes. From its delicate piano melodies to the haunting orchestral arrangements, the music undeniably plays a significant role in making The Shawshank Redemption a stirring and unforgettable cinematic experience. In conclusion, The Shawshank Redemption is a timeless masterpiece that elicits deep emotions while exploring the capacity of the human spirit to overcome adversity and find hope in the darkest of circumstances. With stellar performances, captivating cinematography, an exceptional score, and an engaging story, this film rightfully earns its status as one of the greatest and most uplifting movies of all time."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Multi-choice problem: Choose from the options at the end, and answer how do you do this: board Options are: - is used to being held by ice pick ; - is used to being held by hands ;","completion":"In this multiple-choice problem, we are tasked with choosing between two options related to a board: 1. The board is used to being held by an ice pick. 2. The board is used to being held by hands. It is appropriate to select the second option: The board is used to being held by hands. Here is a detailed explanation of why this is the correct choice and how to use a board in this manner: Boards, in general, are made of different materials like wood, plastic, metal, or a combination of these materials. They come in a variety of shapes and sizes and are versatile objects used for an assortment of purposes. Some common uses for boards include cutting or chopping surfaces in the kitchen, skateboards for recreation, white or blackboards for classrooms, or as game boards for board games. In most cases, boards are held and maneuvered manually by hands, making the second option the most logical choice. To use a board safely and effectively, you should follow these steps: 1. Place the board on a sturdy, flat surface: This will ensure its stability while you perform the intended task. If it is a cutting board, consider using a damp paper towel or non-slip mat beneath the board to prevent it from slipping during use. If it is a game board, place it on a surface that is comfortable for all players to access. 2. Use both hands: When holding the board, utilize both hands to provide optimal control and avoid accidents. Skilled skateboarders may use only one hand to hold their boards, but beginners should always use both hands for safety. 3. Adjust the grip as needed: Depending on the task, you may need to vary your grip strength and positioning. For example, when using a cutting board, a lighter grip may suffice. However, when carrying a heavy plywood board for construction purposes, a firm grip is crucial to maintain control and prevent injury. 4. Clean and store the board appropriately: Once your task or activity is complete, ensure that the board is cleaned, if necessary, and stored per the manufacturer's guidelines. Proper cleaning and storage can help extend the board's lifespan and keep it in good condition for future use. In conclusion, the correct option in this multiple-choice problem is that the board is used to being held by hands. This choice is more suitable as it takes into account the variety of practical uses for boards and emphasizes the essential precautions when handling one."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who was highly influential on later painters? Petrus Christus placed his sitter in a naturalistic setting rather than a flat and featureless background. This approach was in part a reaction against van der Weyden, who, in his emphasis on sculptural figures, utilised very shallow pictorial spaces. In his 1462 Portrait of a Man, Dieric Bouts went further by situating the man in a room complete with a window that looks out at a landscape, while in the 16th century, the full-length portrait became popular in the north. The latter format was practically unseen in earlier northern art, although it had a tradition in Italy going back centuries, most usually in fresco and illuminated manuscripts. Full-length portraits were reserved for depictions of the highest echelon of society, and were associated with princely displays of power. Of the second generation of northern painters, Hans Memling became the leading portraitist, taking commissions from as far as Italy. He was highly influential on later painters and is credited with inspiring Leonardo's positioning of the Mona Lisa in front of a landscape view. Van Eyck and van der Weyden similarly influenced the French artist Jean Fouquet and the Germans Hans Pleydenwurff and Martin Schongauer among others.The Netherlandish artists moved away from the profile view – popularised during the Italian Quattrocento – towards the less formal but more engaging three-quarter view. At this angle, more than one side of the face is visible as the sitter's body is rotated towards the viewer. This pose gives a better view of the shape and features of the head and allows the sitter to look out towards the viewer. The gaze of the sitter rarely engages the viewer. Van Eyck's 1433 Portrait of a Man is an early example, which shows the artist himself looking at the viewer. Although there is often direct eye contact between subject and viewer, the look is normally detached, aloof and uncommunicative, perhaps to reflect the subject's high social position.

Answer the following question: I can use this background: Fish mortality is a parameter used in fisheries population dynamics to account for the loss of fish in a fish stock through death. The mortality can be divided into two types: Natural mortality: the removal of fish from the stock due to causes not associated with fishing. Such causes can include disease, competition, cannibalism, old age, predation, pollution or any other natural factor that causes the death of fish. In fisheries models natural mortality is denoted by (M).[1] Fishing mortality: the removal of fish from the stock due to fishing activities using any fishing gear.[1] It is denoted by (F) in fisheries models. Now, I have a new situation: The fisherman had 2 choices: he could go to Silver Lake situated at a higher altitude and fish there; or he could go to Red lake, a few miles further down the road. Both lakes were natural, but Red Lake had a few pollution problems last year, and the oxygen levels in the water decreased, leading to many fish dying. Silver lake was still pristine, untouched by human activities such as pollution. Answer this question please: Which lake is situated at a lower altitude? Answer:","completion":"Red Lake is situated at a lower altitude.

First, we combine the -87*j and 4*j. -87*j + 4*j = (-87 + 4)*j -83*j = -83*j Now, the equation is 1660 = -83*j. Step 2: Isolate j by dividing by -83 To isolate j, we will divide both sides of the equation by -83. 1660 / -83 = -83*j / -83 Step 3: Simplify to find the value of j Now, simply calculate the value of the division. 1660 / -83 ≈ -20 So, the value of j is: j ≈ -20"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: I read this background article the other day: The refraction of waves across boundaries operates similarly to the method by which tanks are steered. Tanks do not have a steering wheel. Instead, they have an accelerator to produce forward motion and separate brakes on each tread. The operator uses brakes on both treads at the same time in order to stop, but brakes on only one tread to turn the tank. By braking one side, the operator causes that side to slow down or stop while the other side continues at the previous speed, causing the tank to turn towards the slower tread. I am facing a new situation today: Benjamin is taking an Army training class and is learning to operate a tank. Today, he is in a tank with an instructor on a training course. Benjamin drives the tank forward and comes to a large dirt mound blocking his path. He needs to decide whether to break the left tread or right tread. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: If the tread on the right is going faster which direction will the tank turn? Answer:","completion":"The tank will turn to the left. Justification: Based on the principle learned from the background article stating \\"By braking one side, the operator causes that side to slow down or stop while the other side continues at the previous speed, causing the tank to turn towards the slower tread.\\" If the tread on the right is going faster, that means the left tread is going relatively slower or could be stopped. Thus following the principle, the tank would turn towards the slower tread which in this case would be the left. So, the tank will turn to the left."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

How would someone go about accomplishing this goal? To decorate a snowglobe while hiding the hot glue used to put to it together, you can","completion":"follow the step-by-step process below: Step 1: Gather necessary materials To start, gather all the materials you will need to create your snowglobe. This may include items such as a glass jar with a lid, hot glue gun, hot glue sticks, figurines, glitter or faux snow, glycerin, water, ribbon, paint, and other decorative elements. Step 2: Prep the base For this step, prepare the inside of the lid of the snowglobe. Clean and dry it properly. Plan the placement of your figurines and other decorations inside the lid to ensure that they will fit nicely within the snowglobe once it is assembled. Step 3: Attach the figurines Using the hot glue gun, apply a dab of glue to the bottom of each figurine you would like to include in your snowglobe. Press the figurines firmly onto the inside of the lid, holding them in place until the glue dries. Make sure your figurines are securely fixed to the lid. Step 4: Hide the hot glue Now, it's time to hide the hot glue that was used to attach the figurines. You can do this by strategically decorating and covering the glue. Here are some ideas: - Add faux snow, moss, or small pebbles to the bottom of the snowglobe, covering the glue while also creating a more visually appealing base for your figurines. - Use additional decorative items, such as miniature trees, buildings, or other scenery elements, to conceal the glue. Arrange and attach these items in a way that they appear as natural parts of the scene while also hiding the glue. - Paint over the glue with acrylic paint that matches the color of the base or surrounding elements. Once the paint is dry, add various decorative elements or small additional touches to further mask the glue. Step 5: Create the snowglobe liquid Fill the glass jar about three-quarters full of distilled water. Add a few drops of glycerin, which will help slow down the settling of the glitter or faux snow once shaken. Add the desired amount of glitter or faux snow, adjusting the quantity until you achieve the desired look. Step 6: Assemble the snowglobe Carefully screw the lid with the attached figurines onto the jar, ensuring you create a tight seal. It would be best to apply hot glue or waterproof sealant around the inner rim of the lid before closing it to prevent any leaks between the jar and the lid. Make sure the seal is secure and let it dry completely. Step 7: Decorate the exterior Finally, decorate the exterior of your snowglobe as desired. Add a ribbon around the bottom of the lid, paint the lid, or add other decorative elements to make it unique and special. By following these steps, your snowglobe should not only look beautiful and well-designed, but the hot glue used to create it will also be discreetly hidden from sight."},{"prompt":"Given the question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article.

Answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: Some of Antarctica has been warming up; particularly strong warming has been noted on the Antarctic Peninsula. A study by Eric Steig published in 2009 noted for the first time that the continent-wide average surface temperature trend of Antarctica is slightly positive at >0.05 °C (0.09 °F) per decade from 1957 to 2006. This study also noted that West Antarctica has warmed by more than 0.1 °C (0.2 °F) per decade in the last 50 years, and this warming is strongest in winter and spring. This is partly offset by autumn cooling in East Antarctica. There is evidence from one study that Antarctica is warming as a result of human carbon dioxide emissions, but this remains ambiguous. The amount of surface warming in West Antarctica, while large, has not led to appreciable melting at the surface, and is not directly affecting the West Antarctic Ice Sheet's contribution to sea level. Instead the recent increases in glacier outflow are believed to be due to an inflow of warm water from the deep ocean, just off the continental shelf. The net contribution to sea level from the Antarctic Peninsula is more likely to be a direct result of the much greater atmospheric warming there.In 2002 the Antarctic Peninsula's Larsen-B ice shelf collapsed. Between 28 February and 8 March 2008, about 570 km2 (220 sq mi) of ice from the Wilkins Ice Shelf on the southwest part of the peninsula collapsed, putting the remaining 15,000 km2 (5,800 sq mi) of the ice shelf at risk. The ice was being held back by a \\"thread\\" of ice about 6 km (4 mi) wide, prior to its collapse on 5 April 2009. According to NASA, the most widespread Antarctic surface melting of the past 30 years occurred in 2005, when an area of ice comparable in size to California briefly melted and refroze; this may have resulted from temperatures rising to as high as 5 °C (41 °F).A study published in Nature Geoscience in 2013 (online in December 2012) identified central West Antarctica as one of the fastest-warming regions on Earth.

As it catches onto the surrounding material, the heat rises, and the flames spread, turning everything they touch into fiery orange, red, and yellow hues. Soon, an audible crackling sound fills the air as the fire consumes wooden furniture pieces, fabric drapes, or carpet fibres. It is accompanied by a distinct smell of burning materials like wood and plastic, which penetrate the atmosphere and create a sense of urgency. As the blaze grows more ferocious, thick, black smoke begins to waft through the room, filling every nook and cranny, gradually reducing visibility and permeating into the neighboring rooms. Underneath the growing firestorm, the walls and floor of the room begin to show signs of heat stress. Wallpaper and paint crack, peeling away from the surface and revealing the weakening structure beneath. Wooden floorboards start to buckle and creak underfoot, with the potential to collapse under the immense heat burden. The escalating temperatures in the room cause the air to become thick, heavy, and suffocating, making it increasingly difficult for any occupants to draw breath. This results in disorientation and confusion, as well as a sense of panic and heightened anxiety. Fatigued by the lack of oxygen, adjusting to the extreme heat becomes more challenging, and it increases the risk of burns to exposed skin and serious consequences of smoke inhalation. As the fire continues to ravage the room, nearby flammable objects such as books, papers, and upholstered furniture catch fire and contribute to its exponential growth. The roaring flames wrap themselves around cherished personal belongings, photographs, and even the structural bones of the building, threatening the room's very foundations. The surrounding windows succumb to the extreme temperatures within the room, shattering into thousands of glass fragments. This event serves as a double-edged sword; on the one hand, it allows fresh air to enter the room, potentially bringing relief and breathable air to those trapped inside. Conversely, this burst of oxygen further fuels the fire, granting it more power and an even broader reach. Eventually, the fire—having laid waste to everything in its path and having used up the available fuel—starts its gradual decline, leaving the room engulfed in a haze of ash, charred remains, and an overwhelming sense of destruction. Lingering smoke continues to rise from the dying embers of the fire, indicating a battle well-fought but ultimately lost. And yet, amid the devastation and desolation of the fire-gutted room, there stands the tiniest glimmer of hope; the possibility of rebuilding, of returning strength and vitality to the damaged space, and the knowledge that life can once again flourish in the aftermath of such a traumatic and heart-rending event."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A:","completion":"The Hunchback, a 1997 New Zealand fantasy television film, is an adaptation of Victor Hugo's celebrated novel, \\"The Hunchback of Notre-Dame,\\" which was originally published in 1831. Set in 15th-century Paris, the novel offers readers a richly-detailed and vivid glimpse into the lives of its diverse cast of characters. Among these, the primary antagonist is Monseigneur Claude Frollo, a chilling and complex figure who drives much of the story's action forward. In the 1997 film adaptation, Richard Harris takes on the role of Claude Frollo and brings the character to life on screen. Harris was a seasoned actor with a career that spanned several decades, making him an apt choice for the multi-faceted and complicated Frollo. As a highly respected actor, Harris effectively conveys the anguish and darkness that lies within Frollo, which lies at the heart of the character's motivations in both the film and the original novel. In Hugo's novel, Monseigneur Claude Frollo starts as an archdeacon, a position of importance in the church hierarchy. He is a deeply pious man devoted to his faith yet tormented by an unquenchable desire for knowledge. This thirst brings about his moral downfall, as he dabbles in alchemy and the dark arts, which ultimately lead to his obsession with Esmeralda, a beautiful and enigmatic gypsy woman. Frollo's unwavering pursuit of Esmeralda sets the stage for a tragic and turbulent sequence of events in the novel, resulting in pain and suffering for the protagonist, Quasimodo, the hunchback himself, as well as other central characters. Richard Harris' portrayal of Claude Frollo in the 1997 New Zealand adaptation underscores the tragedy that befalls an intelligent and once-virtuous man when he loses himself to his unbridled passions. His subversion from a man of God to a person consumed by darkness and lust is a critical element in the narrative of both the novel and this film adaptation. The Hunchback powerfully captures the turmoil that rages within Frollo and presents a stirring and vivid adaptation of Hugo's classic work for a new generation of audiences."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Answer A (yes) is incorrect because it suggests that the second sentence follows logically from the first, which is not the case here due to the evident contradiction. Answer B (it is not possible to tell) would be correct if there was uncertainty or lack of sufficient information to determine the relationship between the two sentences. However, the contradiction here is clear, allowing us to definitively say that the second sentence is not entailed by the first."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The movie opens when Borat is in his hometown of Kusak in Kazakhstan. He is introducing the entire town to the documentary movie he is going to be filming. There's people like the town mechanic / abortionist, the town rapist, his annoying neighbor, his wife Oxana, and so on and so forth. Borat also talks about his home and his hobbies. Hobbies include ping pong, which he plays rather poorly, and traveling to capital city where he watches women as they do their business. Borat takes you through his home where you meet his wife Oxana and his sons Huey and Lewis, and introduces us to his annoying neighbor Yusuf. Borat and Yusuf have been engaged in a game of coveted goods, where everything Borat gets, Yusuf attempts to get as well, but since Yusuf doesn't have the money that Borat has, everything Yusuf buys is of significantly less quality.Borat is hailed as a hero in his town as he is contracted by the government of Kazakhstan to travel to America to make a documentary which will bring together, hopefully, the cultures of America and Kazakhstan. Borat is to travel to America with his most venerable producer Azamat Bagatov, who will handle all the behind the scenes work of this documentary. After a rather lengthy flight with multiple stops and connections, Borat finally arrives in New York City. On the subway to his hotel, his pet chicken escapes his bag and wrecks havoc on the subway. Borat's attempts to introduce himself to the native New Yorkers is also a complete failure.At the hotel, Borat attempts to bargain with the hotel owners about his negotiated room rate, only to be met with another failure as the hotel has a set rate in which it can rent rooms out.

Answer the following question: Whether you admit it or not, music improves our daily life and makes us feel easy, especially the music of Beethoven and Mozart. But can you believe that a school in England is using classical music to cut down students' bad behavior? The head teacher Brian Walker at the West Park School in Derby asks some students to stay behind after school on Fridays. He forces his students to listen to Mozart and other classical music. He also makes them copy his favorite poems and they have to watch educational videos. Mr. Walker says his main aim is to stop noisy pupils causing trouble in class for students who want to study. He said the students staying behind were \\"not the smokers or drinkers, the truants or the people who are late for school...It's those who have slowed the learning and teaching in class for everyone\\". Mr. Walker said this was unacceptable, because it was making the rest of the students fail to focus their attention on their study. Mr. Walker believes what he does reminds students that education is something to value. \\"It helps them see they are part of something bigger that will improve their life chances,\\" he said. The head teacher thinks students in fact learn from being kept behind after school. \\"Hopefully, I open their ears to an experience they don't normally have and don't want to have again, so it's both educational and acts as a warning.\\" Music has had success elsewhere in reducing bad behavior. In 2004, it reduced crime on London's subway by 25 percent. Researchers from a Belfast university found it helped stop elephants' bad behavior. However, one West Park student called Kieran said, \\"An hour of Mr. Walker's music is a real killer.\\" Why does Mr. Walker say some students' bad behavior is unacceptable? A) Because the rest of the students hate them. B) Because they are wasting their life. C) Because they are disturbing teachers. D) Because they have a bad influence on the other students.

After the disruption of the plot in Amman, it had not escaped notice in Washington that Hijazi had lived in California and driven a cab in Boston and that Deek was a naturalized U.S. citizen who, as Berger reminded President Clinton, had been in touch with extremists in the United States as well as abroad. Before Ressam's arrest, Berger saw no need to raise a public alarm at home- although the FBI put all field offices on alert. Now, following Ressam's arrest, the FBI asked for an unprecedented number of special wiretaps. Both Berger andTenet told us that their impression was that more Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) wiretap requests were processed during the millennium alert than ever before. The next day, writing about Ressam's arrest and links to a cell in Montreal, Berger informed the President that the FBI would advise police in the United States to step up activities but would still try to avoid undue public alarm by stressing that the government had no specific information about planned attacks. At a December 22 meeting of the Small Group of principals, FBI Director Louis Freeh briefed officials from the NSC staff, CIA, and Justice on wiretaps and investigations inside the United States, including a Brooklyn entity tied to the Ressam arrest, a seemingly unreliable foreign report of possible attacks on seven U.S. cities, two Algerians detained on the Canadian border, and searches in Montreal related to a jihadist cell. The Justice Department released a statement on the alert the same day. Clarke's staff warned, \\"Foreign terrorist sleeper cells are present in the US and attacks in the US are likely.\\" Clarke asked Berger to try to make sure that the domestic agencies remained alert.\\" Is there a threat to civilian aircraft?\\"he wrote. Clarke also asked the principals in late December to discuss a foreign security service report about a Bin Laden plan to put bombs on transatlantic flights. The CSG met daily. Berger said that the principals met constantly. Later, when asked what made her decide to ask Ressam to step out of his vehicle, Diana Dean, a Customs inspector who referred Ressam to secondary inspection, testified that it was her \\"training and experience.\\" It appears that the heightened sense of alert at the national level played no role in Ressam's detention. There was a mounting sense of public alarm. The earlier Jordanian arrests had been covered in the press, and Ressam's arrest was featured on network evening news broadcasts throughout the Christmas season. The FBI was more communicative during the millennium crisis than it had ever been.

It is common for people to gather and interact in these areas due to the numerous activities and attractions available. On the other hand, a farm pasture is a large expanse of land typically utilized for agricultural purposes such as raising livestock or growing crops. The atmosphere at a farm pasture differs significantly from a downtown area as it is characterized by open spaces, possibly a rural environment, and, in general, a lower concentration of people.

Let the paint to dry completely after your final coat.\\" Article:","completion":"Title: A Comprehensive Guide to Painting Plastic: Setting Up, Choosing Paint, and Drying Tips Introduction In recent years, more and more people have discovered the joys of upcycling and repurposing items, especially plastic. This not only helps save the environment but also allows for a more creative and personalized touch when it comes to home décor, DIY art projects, and even automotive or other industrial applications. If you've ever wanted to know how to paint plastic effectively, you've come to the right place. In this comprehensive guide, we will share insights on how to set up your workspace, choose the right paint, and tips for ensuring that your paint dries completely for a perfect finish. Setting Up Your Workspace A well-organized workspace is crucial to a successful plastic painting project. Here are a few tips for setting up an efficient and safe workspace: 1. Choose a well-ventilated area: When working with paint, it's essential to have proper airflow, as paint fumes can be hazardous. Make sure that your painting area has good ventilation, with either open windows or a fan for air circulation. 2. Protect your surfaces: Lay down newspapers, a plastic drop cloth, or an old sheet to protect your floors and furniture from any accidental spills or splatters. 3. Gather your supplies: Before starting your project, make sure you have everything you need, including paint, brushes, sandpaper, masking tape, a paint tray, and any other materials required for your particular project. Having everything within reach will save you time and minimize any interruptions during the painting process. 4. Put on your protective gear: To protect yourself from paint fumes and potential skin irritation, wear a mask, gloves, and comfortable clothing that you don't mind getting paint on. Choosing the Right Paint for Plastic The secret to a successful plastic painting project lies primarily in your choice of paint. Here's how to select the most suitable paint for your plastic surfaces: 1. Know your plastic: Familiarize yourself with the type of plastic you will be painting, as different plastics require different paint formulations. Common plastic types include polystyrene, ABS, PVC, and polypropylene. If you're unsure of the type of plastic, consult the product's manufacturer or packaging material for information. 2. Opt for a high-quality paint: While you may be tempted to use standard acrylic or latex paint, these types of paints tend to peel or flake off plastic surfaces, creating an undesirable result. Instead, use paint specifically formulated for plastic, such as Krylon Fusion or Rust-Oleum Specialty Plastic paint. These paints provide better adhesion and can be found at most hardware stores. 3. Choose the right finish: Consider the desired final appearance of your painted plastic. There are various finishes available, including matte, satin, and glossy finishes. Experiment on a small, inconspicuous area before committing to one finish, as the outcome may differ depending on the specific plastic type. 4. Primer, if necessary: If you're painting a lighter color onto a darker plastic or want to ensure proper adhesion, use a plastic primer before applying your paint. This extra step will help ensure that your paint job looks professional and lasts longer. Let the Paint Dry Completely After Your Final Coat Patience is key when it comes to drying time for your painted plastic. Here's how to ensure that your project dries properly: 1. Allow sufficient drying time between coats: Follow the manufacturer's suggested drying times for your chosen paint. Typically, this will be around 15-20 minutes between coats, depending on the paint and environmental conditions. 2. Factor in weather conditions: The temperature and humidity can significantly affect the drying time of your painted plastic. Warmer temperatures accelerate the drying process, while high humidity levels slow drying times. Be prepared to adjust your drying time accordingly. 3. Don't rush the process: After applying your final coat of paint, allow your project to dry undisturbed for at least 24 hours, preferably longer. This will ensure that the paint has cured and hardened properly. 4. Protect your finished project: To further extend the life of your paint job and protect it from wear, consider applying a clear sealer or topcoat. This will provide an added layer of durability and can enhance the overall appearance of your finished project. Conclusion Painting plastic doesn't have to be difficult or intimidating. With the right workspace, paint choice, and attention to drying time, you can transform your plastic items into beautiful, functional works of art. It's a budget-friendly, eco-conscious choice that's perfect for DIY enthusiasts and beginners alike.

Not worth sending back due to the low cost.<br /><br />I really want to give this minus start but at least one star is required to post this. It deserves none. A:","completion":"Step 1: Identify the tone, sentiment, and keywords in the review. - The tone of the review seems to be negative, with a strong focus on dissatisfaction. - Key phrases that indicate sentiment include \\"toxic stench\\", \\"reeks\\", \\"cheaply made\\", \\"went immediately into the trash\\", and \\"not worth sending back\\". Step 2: Look for any points of praise or compliments within the review. - There are no compliments or praise in this review. The closest thing to a positive statement is the reviewer acknowledging the mouse pad's low price. However, this is immediately followed by negative points, showing that the low price does not offset the dissatisfaction experienced. Step 3: Compare the number of positive and negative statements. - The review has a significantly larger number of negative statements compared to positive ones. This imbalance highlights the overall dissatisfaction of the reviewer. Step 4: Determine if there is a clear indication of the reviewer's feelings towards the product. - The reviewer clearly states their negative feelings, saying \\"It deserves none\\" in reference to the rating.

So, I worked with a friend of mine who was a playwright to put together a play to take to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. It was a three person show, and one of the roles was written specifically for me. Many of the lines were written after we improvised the scenes in my living room as she wrote the piece. Took it to Scotland, where it was quite well received. A year or so later, it was being produced in New York in a much more prestigious setting. I auditioned, was called back a couple times, and got to the play the role again. Fantastic! THEN, it was produced by an even larger theatre.

What was strange was meeting the director that evening.

In what country was the man who originally proposed Le Sage's theory of gravitation in 1690 born?","completion":"The person who originally proposed Le Sage's theory of gravitation in 1690 was Nicolas Fatio de Duillier. He was born in the city of Basel in Switzerland on February 16, 1664. Switzerland, a Western European country, is known for its picturesque landscapes, prosperous cities, and rich cultural heritage. The nation is famous for its neutrality and its commitment to maintaining peace and stability both internally and externally. Nicolas Fatio de Duillier was a Swiss mathematician, astronomer, and natural philosopher with significant contributions to various fields. He had a strong friendship with Isaac Newton, and they worked together for some time. Fatio de Duillier started developing his theory of gravitation in the late 1680s and first proposed it in 1690. The theory aimed to provide a mechanical explanation of gravity instead of the mathematical descriptions offered by Newton's law of universal gravitation. His theory, later known as Le Sage's theory, suggested that the mechanism behind gravity involved an omnipresent stream of tiny particles called \\"ultramundane corpuscles.\\" These particles pass through all matter and objects, pushing them towards each other. The shadows created by these particles cause mutual attraction, creating the phenomena of gravity. However, the Le Sage theory was never broadly accepted during Fatio de Duillier's lifetime, as it was unable to match Newton's gravitational theory in terms of precise predictions, and it faced various theoretical difficulties. In 1748, French mathematician Georges-Louis Le Sage developed a similar theory independently. Le Sage made improvements to the original theory proposed by Duillier but it still faced fundamental difficulties. Le Sage's name became associated with the theory, which is why it is often referred to as Le Sage's theory of gravitation. Despite not being a widely accepted alternative to Newton's law of gravitation, the historical importance of Le Sage’s theory is due to its attempts to explain gravitational forces in a mechanical manner. This effort can be seen as an essential step toward understanding the nature of physical interactions and has influenced the development of different scientific theories and ideas in the fields of physics and astronomy."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It also allowed people to settle down in villages and cities for the first time. Birth rates went up because there was more food and settled life had other advantages. Death rates also rose because of crowded living conditions and diseases that spread from domestic animals. Because the higher birth rates were matched by higher death rates, the human population continued to grow very slowly. Now, I have a new situation: Harry and Kim studied ancient humans.

Write an article that answers the following question: How many yards was the Browns penalized for CB Tramon Williams being offsides?","completion":"Title: The Penalties in Play: A Deep Dive into the Sports Incident Entailing Tramon Williams The specifics surrounding a penalty imposed on any sports team need to be re-examined, not solely to assess the outcome of the incident itself, but also to comprehend its implications on the game overall. One such memorable incident involved the Cleveland Browns and their cornerback, Tramon Williams. Many fans and sports enthusiasts alike have found themselves wondering, \\"How many yards was the Browns penalized for CB Tramon Williams being offsides?\\" The rules in the National Football League (NFL) are decidedly strict when it comes to offsides as it is fundamentally structured to ensure the fairness of the game. In the case of cornerback Tramon Williams, he was penalized for an infraction commonly referred to as being \\"offsides\\". This penalty occurs when a defensive player crosses the line of scrimmage before the football is snapped by the offensive team. It's a critical violation that could potentially influence the outcome of a game significantly. In order to provide context, let’s observe the penalty in the context of the rules of NFL. According to the rulebook of the NFL, an offsides penalty implies a five-yard penalty implemented against the offending team. This constitutes the standard penalty for offsides and it is applied irrespective of the player's role or position in the team. However, the severity of the violation can cause coaches, referees, or even fellow players to view the offending player more critically, given the potential damage it can do to the team’s morale, rhythm and overall performance. In the case of Cleveland Browns' cornerback Tramon Williams, this rule remained consistent. Consequently, when Williams was called for being offsides, this five-yard standard was the penalty enforced against his team, the Cleveland Browns. This incident can serve to be a critical reminder of the important role that adherence to rules plays in the game, and that even seemingly small infractions can potentially have considerable implications on the final result of a game. Sportsmanship is not just about playing well and supporting teammates; it's about respecting the boundaries and the rules of the game as well. Small penalties, like being five yards offsides, might seem minor at first, but can drastically affect game strategies, positional advantages, and the momentum of the game. Nevertheless, it is also crucial to remember that errors like these do not necessarily define a player's skills, but are rather seen as opportunities for learning and improvement. Tramon Williams, despite the offsides penalty, has had a commendable career in the NFL with various well-respected teams, proving that incidents like these are just minor bumps in an otherwise prolific professional journey. In conclusion, the specificity of the penalty question for Tramon Williams being offsides stands at five yards as per the NFL rules. Though a seemingly small distance, the effect is broader than it appears on the surface, affecting both the players and the game dynamically. However, it also highlights the importance of professional growth, speaking volumes about the knack of learning from mistakes and consistently striving for improvement in the football realm."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Today we are going to learn about some special tests that doctors do to make sure both mommy and the baby growing inside her are healthy and happy. When a lady is pregnant, she has to visit the doctor a lot, because they want to make sure the baby is growing well. There are some tests that the doctor will do to make sure everything is okay. 1. Checking for Gestational Diabetes One important test is checking for something called \\"gestational diabetes.\\" This is a kind of diabetes that can happen when a mommy is pregnant, but don't worry, it usually goes away after the baby is born. It's important to find out if the mommy has it, because if she does, the doctor can help her and the baby stay healthy. To check for this, the mommy will drink a very sweet drink, and then the doctor will take a little bit of her blood and check if there's too much sugar inside. 2. Having a Fetal Ultrasound Another exciting test is called a \\"fetal ultrasound.\\" This is a special machine that takes a picture of the baby while it's still inside the mommy's tummy. It's like a TV that can see inside mommy's belly! The second trimester (second part) of the pregnancy is an important time to do this ultrasound. The doctor can see how the baby is growing, and if everything is looking good. The best part is, the mommy and daddy can even see the baby wave or kick! 3. Being Prepared for Blood Testing Sometimes, the doctor will want to do more blood tests to make sure everything is okay. The blood tests can tell the doctor a lot about the mommy's and baby's health. Although it might be a little scary for the mommy to have her blood taken, it's very important to make sure the baby is growing well. 4. Having an Amniocentesis One more test that the doctor might do is called \\"amniocentesis.\\" This is a big word, but it just means that the doctor will take a very small amount of the special water that the baby is floating in to check if everything is okay. The doctor will be very gentle and careful when doing this, and it's only done if the doctor thinks it's important to make sure the baby is healthy. In conclusion, during a pregnancy, there are some tests that doctors do to make sure both the mommy and the baby are safe and healthy. These tests, like checking for gestational diabetes, having a fetal ultrasound, blood tests, and amniocentesis, are important to keep both mommy and baby happy. Remember, the doctor is like a detective who is always trying to find clues to make sure everything is going great for the mommy and her little one!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Birds' feeding strategies vary by species. Many birds glean for insects, invertebrates, fruit, or seeds. Some hunt insects by suddenly attacking from a branch. Those species that seek pest insects are considered beneficial 'biological control agents' and their presence encouraged in biological pest control programs. Nectar feeders such as hummingbirds, sunbirds, lories, and lorikeets amongst others have specially adapted brushy tongues and in many cases bills designed to fit co-adapted flowers. Kiwis and shorebirds with long bills probe for invertebrates; shorebirds' varied bill lengths and feeding methods result in the separation of ecological niches. Loons, diving ducks, penguins and auks pursue their prey underwater, using their wings or feet for propulsion, while aerial predators such as sulids, kingfishers and terns plunge dive after their prey. Flamingos, three species of prion, and some ducks are filter feeders. Geese and dabbling ducks are primarily grazers.\\", answer the following question.

A number of writers mentioned Bertin's eventful career, in tones that were, according to art historian Andrew Carrington Shelton, either \\"bitingly sarcastic [or] fawningly reverential\\". There were many satirical reproductions and pointed editorials in the following years. Aware of Bertin's support of the July Monarchy, writers at the La Gazette de France viewed the portrait as the epitome of the \\"opportunism and cynicism\\" of the new regime. Their anonymous critic excitedly wondered \\"what bitter irony it expresses, what hardened skepticism, sarcasm and ... pronounced cynicism\\".Several critics mentioned Bertin's hands. Twentieth-century art historian Albert Boime described them as \\"powerful, vulturine ... grasping his thighs in a gesture ... projecting ... enormous strength controlled\\". Some contemporary critics were not so kind. The photographer and critic Félix Tournachon was harshly critical, and disparaged what he saw as a \\"fantastical bundle of flesh ... under which, instead of bones and muscles, there can only be intestines – this flatulent hand, the rumbling of which I can hear!\\" Bertin's hands made a different impression on the critic F. de Lagenevais, who remarked: \\"A mediocre artist would have modified them, he would have replaced those swollen joints with the cylindrical fingers of the first handy model; but by this single alteration he would have changed the expression of the whole personality ... the energetic and mighty nature\\".The work's realism attracted a large amount of commentary when it was first exhibited. Some saw it as an affront to Romanticism, others said that its small details not only showed an acute likeness, but built a psychological profile of the sitter. Art historian Geraldine Pelles sees Bertin as \\"at once intense, suspicious, and aggressive\\".

Leadbeater arrived around the same time as Fuller, and soon afterward he \\"discovered\\" the person he believed would become a global teacher and orator, Jiddu Krishnamurti (then in his teens). Leadbetter and others tutored Krishnamurti. Fuller may have taught him photography. She also had a small studio built in the grounds, and painted. Her works from the period include a portrait of Leadbeater and Portrait of the Lord Buddha. McFarlane emphasises the significance of the latter work, pointing out that it is \\"strikingly modern\\" in comparison to all of Fuller's other work, and more radical than compositions created by Grace Cossington Smith and Roland Wakelin, half a decade later. The painting owes much to theosophy's emphasis on seeing the subject \\"through a psychic, visionary experience\\". Sources describing Fuller's movements after her time in India sometimes are ambiguous. She arrived in England in June 1911, where she marched with Besant in the suffragette protests associated with the coronation of George V. She continued to paint portraits, but found it difficult to realise the transformation in her art that she had conceptualised in India:I have painted a great many portraits since I have been in England, and have been, I suppose, fairly successful—though I have done nothing in any way remarkable.

In order to help your body get used to sleeping on a normal schedule, try to pick a convenient time for you to go to sleep and get up. Make sure it works every day of the week so you can stay on a consistent schedule. After a while, your body will start to respond to the new schedule. It may be hard at first, especially if you have a hard time getting to sleep or staying asleep. Try to push through so you can get on a schedule. The more tired you are, the more likely you are to be able to fall asleep. This is true for the weekends as well. Even though you may be tempted to get up later on the weekends, try to avoid sleeping more than one hour past your daily wake up time. In order to help you sleep better, try making a nightly routine that you go through every night. Like your sleep schedule, your nightly routine help you get in the habit of sleeping at certain times. Your nightly routine can also help ease your worries and calm your mind before you get to bed. Try incorporating relaxing activities into your nightly routine. Taking a warm bath, reading a book, listening to comforting music, or having a cup of decaffeinated tea or warm milk can all be part of your routine. You can mix your nightly routine up a little if, for example, you don’t need to take a bath each night or you don’t want any milk. Try to keep some similar activities, however, so your body starts to associate the actions with sleep. If you are having a hard time falling asleep at night, you need to allow yourself to unwind at the end of the day. This can be for a few hours before you go to bed, but give yourself plenty of time before you try to go to sleep to decompress. This is especially important if you suffer from depression because you often have much more going on emotionally than most people. This is a great time to focus on things that make you happy or to let go of the things that make you worry or depressed. This is different than your nightly routine as well, since that typically leads up to you going to bed. Your unwind time is meant to just be time for you to enjoy yourself and focus on relaxation with no intention in mind other than your happiness and well-being. This time helps you get in the right head space to help you fall asleep. Try relaxing activities such as meditation or watching your favorite TV show. There are many different herbs that may help you sleep. These herbs, such as chamomile, valerian root, lemon balm, or passionflower, can be found as dried herbs that can be made into teas, as essential oils, and as supplements. Always ask your doctor before you take herbs. This is especially true if you are one medication for depression, since many herbs can interact with medications. Summary:","completion":"Establishing a consistent sleep schedule and sticking to it every day, even on weekends, can help your body adapt to a normal sleep rhythm. This might be challenging initially, but perseverance is key. Transitioning to sleep might be facilitated by a nightly routine involving relaxing activities such as taking a warm bath, reading, or listening to soothing music. Additionally, creating a separate period of time to unwind, particularly if you're dealing with emotional stress or depression, can be beneficial. This is a distinct time for relaxation, intended to help improve your mental wellbeing and ease you into a positive mindset conducive to sleep. Activities such as meditation, watching a favorite TV show, or even drinking herbal teas (like chamomile, valerian root, or lemon balm) can assist in this.

We are given five choices that include locations and facilities. Step 2: Eliminate choices that are not specific to theaters - Shopping mall: Although malls sometimes have movie theaters, shopping malls are not specifically known for theaters. - Skating rink: Skating rinks are spaces designed for ice or roller skating and are not related to theaters. - Military base: Military bases serve as facilities to support and train military personnel, and they generally do not have a reputation for theaters. Step 3: Evaluate the remaining choices We are now left with two choices: \\"New York City\\" and \\"downtown area.\\" - Downtown area: While many downtown areas might have theaters, this choice is not specific enough to identify a location in America known for theaters. Step 4: Choose the answer that best fits the question Since New York City is well-known for its theaters, especially on Broadway, it is the most accurate answer. The rationale to choose \\"New York City\\" as the answer is that it is renowned for its thriving theater scene, particularly Broadway, which draws millions of visitors each year.

Multi-choice problem: Continue writing the next sentence in this paragraph: How to make a habitat for your chameleon Decide what kind of habitat you want. There are two kinds of habitats: vivariums and free range habitats. Vivariums are the more traditional type of chameleon habitat, and are similar to the lizard cages you might see at the zoo. Options are: (1). Free range habitats are more common and well used. These types of habitats do not provide a housing structure, such as because you do not have a lot of room to move.; (2). Though you might not think that a lizard cage will be appealing to most people, a vivarium might be a better option if you want to habitat for a half-lizard and half-reptile creature. An enclosure enclosure can provide some shade, which would be ideal for both species.; (3). You can easily incorporate a vivarium into your enclosure, though a vivarium requires you to provide different environments. Free range habitats may be your best option for your chameleon species.; (4). Open range habitats, by contrast, provide a whole room for your chameleon to wander around in freely. If you have the space in your home available, consider giving your chameleon a room of its own.;","completion":"(4). Open range habitats, by contrast, provide a whole room for your chameleon to wander around in freely. If you have the space in your home available, consider giving your chameleon a room of its own. This answer is correct because it follows the previous sentences that were talking about vivariums and introduces the second type of habitat - free range or open range habitats. It also provides some information on what a free range habitat is and when it could be a good option. Now let's explain why other answers are wrong: (1). This answer is incorrect because it says free range habitats are more common and well used, which is not true. It also doesn't make sense as a sentence, mentioning \\"housing structure\\" and \\"room to move\\" without proper context or explanation. (2). This answer is incorrect because it talks about a half-lizard and half-reptile creature, which is not relevant to the paragraph that specifically talks about chameleon habitats. The answer also is confusing with the use of \\"enclosure enclosure.\\" (3).

The popularity of lip pencils and crayons is soaring, I suspect it’s because they’re just so easy to use. I’ve been trying out two new ones to see which I prefer. In the red corner we have MAC Patent Polish Lip Pencil and in the blue corner we have NARS Velvet Matte Lip Pencil. So let’s get ready to rumble while I put them through their paces…. Although the packaging of these two is quite similar the formulation and finish of the lip colours are very different – MAC Patent Polish is a light gloss and NARS Velvet Matte has a stark matte finish. So whether you prefer your lips sheer and glossy or pigmented and matte there should be something for everyone here. MAC Patent Polish Lip Pencil – this is the first lip pencil that I’ve tried from MAC (apart from lip liner) and I’m really impressed with it. As the name suggests the finish is a very shiny gloss that gives an almost patent shine, it has the feel of a lip gloss but it’s not sticky. The colour is called Spontaneous, MAC describe it as a ‘soft plum with pearl’. It’s definitely a plummy shade, although I can’t really detect any pearl in there. It looks quite dark as a crayon but as it’s very sheer it appears much more natural once it’s on the lips. It’s a great way to introduce darker lip colours to your make-up bag if you’re not used to them. MAC Patent Polish Lip Pencil is a bit like a fabulous giant tinted lip balm! The crayon itself is chunky and easy to hold, the nib is quite chunky and not great for precision application, but you could use a lip brush to apply it. I love to apply MAC Patent Polish straight from the crayon, it’s quick and easy, and as it’s very light and sheer it’s easy to wipe away any mistakes and re-apply. According to the above context, answer the following question. Why was the author trying both lip products? OPT: (I). not enough information. (II). because the products are similar. (III). because she wanted to see which one she preferred. (IV). because she liked both products.

During this competitive event, you could expect to experience the following: - A series of interesting and challenging algorithmic problems designed to test your programming and problem-solving skills. - Networking opportunities with fellow participants, who shared a passion for programming and computer science. - An opportunity to showcase your skills and talent to representatives from Morgan Stanley, which could potentially lead to employment or internships opportunities within the company. - Prizes and recognition for top performers in the competition. As this event has already taken place, you can review the problems and solutions from the competition on various coding websites and forums. 2. What is the correct approach to solve the 3rd problem of the Morgan Stanley Codeathon 2016 - Samantha and Portfolio Management? Unfortunately, without the specific details of the problem statement, I am unable to provide the correct approach to solve the problem. However, I can give you general tips on how to approach competitive programming problems, which may help you tackle this problem and others like it. - Read and understand the problem statement carefully. This is crucial in determining the requirements and constraints of the problem. - Identify the problem type. Many competitive programming problems can be classified into categories (e.g., dynamic programming, graph theory, greedy algorithms), which will help you decide on the appropriate technique or algorithm to solve the problem. - Break the problem into smaller subproblems, if possible. This will make it easier to solve the overall problem and can be particularly helpful for dynamic programming problems. - Consider using standard algorithms or data structures that may be suitable for the problem, such as sorting algorithms, search algorithms, or data structures like stacks, queues, or linked lists. Familiarity with these algorithms and data structures is important in competitive programming. - Implement your solution carefully, ensuring that it meets the requirements and constraints of the problem statement. Be mindful of efficiency and complexity, as these can impact the running time of your solution and whether it meets the problem's time limits. - Test your solution with provided test cases, and also create additional test cases to ensure the correctness and efficiency of your solution. Evaluate edge cases and corner cases to make sure your solution is robust. Regarding the multi-choice question: These questions cannot be considered the same, because the first question seeks information about the event itself while the second question asks for guidance on solving the specific problem from that event. Therefore, the correct answer is: 1) no"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

He appeared in more than 800 commercials for the hamburger chain named for his daughter. \\"As long as it works\\", he said in 1991, \\"I'll continue to do those commercials.\\" Even though he was successful, Thomas remained troubled by his childhood. \\"He still won't let anyone see his feet, which are out of shape because he never had proper fitting shoes,\\" Wendy said in 1993. Born to a single mother, he was adopted as a baby by Rex and Auleva Thomas of Kalamazoo in Michigan. After Auleva died when he was 5, Thomas spent years on the road as Rex traveled around seeking construction work. \\"He fed me,\\" Thomas said, \\"and if I got out of line, he'd beat me.\\" Moving out on his own at 15, Thomas worked, first as a waiter, in many restaurants. But he had something much better in mind. \\"I thought if I owned a restaurant,\\" he said, \\"I could eat for free.\\" A 1956 meeting with Harland Sanders led Thomas to a career as the manager of a Kentucky Chicken restaurant that made him a millionaire in 1968. In 1969, after breaking with Sanders, Thomas started the first Wendy's Old Fashioned Hamburgers, in Columbus, Ohio, which set itself apart by serving made-to-order burgers. With 6,000 restaurants worldwide, the chain now makes 6 billion a year in sales. Although troubled by his own experience with adoption, Thomas, married since 1954 to Lorraine, 66, and with four grown kids besides Wendy, felt it could offer a future for other children. He started the Dave Thomas Foundation for Adoption in 1992. In 1993, Thomas, who had left school at 15, graduated from Coconut Creek High School in Florida.

The Queen of Sweden has boycotted the prestigious Polar Music Prize awards ceremony due to the criminal past of one of the winners, U.S. rock legend Chuck Berry. The 87-year-old rock pioneer was found guilty of human trafficking involving a 14-year-old girl in 1960, whom he was also accused of having a sexual relationship with. Queen Silvia and her youngest daughter, Princess Madeleine of Sweden, both refused to attend the ceremony with the rest of the royal family, citing Berry’s conviction. Royal refusal: Queen Silvia and her daughter Princess Madeleine of Sweden refused to attend the Polar Music Prize awards ceremony due to winner Chuck Berry's trafficking conviction. Conviction: Legendary US rocker Chuck Berry, pictured in 2007, was found guilty of 'transporting an underage female across state lines for immoral purposes' in 1960. The Polar Music Prize is Sweden's most prestigious award for musicians, founded by the late ABBA manager Stig Anderson. Winners Berry and American opera director Peter Sellars were announced in May this year and were honoured and awarded £87,000 (1million Swedish Kroner) at the prize ceremony on Tuesday. Although King Carl XVI Gustaf and the Crown Princess Victoria both attended the ceremony, the Queen and Princess Madeleine were notably absent. The Queen, the founder of children’s charity World Childhood Foundation which also employs Princess Madeleine, later explained that she had decided not to attend due to Berry’s previous conviction, and that she later went to a dinner to honour the second winner, Peter Sellars. God of rock: The 87-year-old musician was awarded the Polar Music Prize along with American opera director Peter Sellars, but could not attend the ceremony due to ill health. Unacceptable: The Queen said that as founder of children's charity World Childhood Foundation, she did not find it acceptable that she and Princess Madeleine attend a celebration of Chuck Berry. Royal decision: The Queen said her husband, King Carl XVI Gustaf and oldest daughter Crown Princess Victoria of Sweden, both pictured with her husband Prince Daniel at the ceremony on Tuesday, respected her decision. Royal representation: Crown Princess Victoria and Prince Daniel, whose daughter Princess Estelle started pre-school this week, attended the Polar Music Prize at Stockholm Concert Hall. ‘I felt that it was not ok for me to. be at the awards ceremony as there are so many people who believe in me,. in World Childhood Foundation and in the princess [Madeleine],’ Queen. Silvia told Expressen. ‘I did not do this for attention, I could not accept it,' ‘It was a family decision and the King respects my opinions and understands the situation very well.’ In. 1959, Chuck Berry was arrested under the Mann Act for ’transporting an. underage female across state lines for immoral purposes’. He. had met 14-year-old Janice Escalante in Mexico and took her to St. Louis, promising her a job as a coat-check girl at his night-club,. effectively taking her over three state lines. Second winner: U.S. theatre director Peter Sellars receives the Swedish Polar Music Prize from Sweden's King Carl XVI Gustaf at the prize ceremony. Escalante, who allegedly also worked as a prostitute, claims she had a sexual relationshiop with Berry, something which the now 87-year-old has always denied. He was convicted in March 1960, sentenced to five years in prison and fined 5,000 (£3,011), but appealed against the conviction on the grounds that the judge had been making racist comments, using the n-word to refer to Berry throughout the trial, and had prejudiced the jury against him. After a second trial in 1961 the sentence was reduced to three years. He served one-and-a-half years from February 1962 to October 1963. Chuck Berry did not attend the Polar Music Prize ceremony this week, citing ill health. What are highlight points for this article?","completion":"1.

We have this equation: 0 = 38*x - 346*x - 1540 First, let's put together those x terms (like putting together apples). We have 38*x and -346*x: 0 = (38 - 346) * x - 1540 Let's do the subtraction 38 - 346, which equals -308. So now we have: 0 = -308 * x - 1540 Now, we want to find the value of x, like solving a little puzzle! Let's start by moving the -1540 to the other side of the equation by adding it to both sides: 1540 = -308 * x Almost there! We just need to find x now. To do this, we'll divide both sides by -308: 1540 / -308 = x When we do that division (1540 divided by -308), we get x = -5. So, x equals -5!

Anchorwoman Christine Chubbuck of WXLT in Sarasota, Fla., as photographed by a co-worker in 1974, less than two weeks before she killed herself on television. (Photo: John Cloud, AP) It's one of the most shocking moments in TV history that virtually no one has ever seen. In the midst of an afternoon broadcast on July 15, 1974, reporter Christine Chubbuck informed viewers that \\"in keeping with Channel 40's policy of bringing you the latest in 'blood and guts' ... you are going to see another first: Attempted suicide.\\" The Sarasota, Fla., newswoman pulled a gun from under the WXLT anchor desk and shot herself in the head, dying hours later at age 29. Since then, the footage has been seemingly impossible to find. It doesn't exist online, and the only known tape has been in the possession of the former TV station owner's widow, Mollie Nelson, who told Vulture she gave it to a law firm for safekeeping after her late husband refused to release it. The irony that Chubbuck wanted her death to be seen, yet it's now lost, is part of what intrigued Robert Greene, writer/director of Kate Plays Christine (now playing in Columbus, Ohio, and Lake Worth, Fla.; expands to 10 additional cities throughout fall).The quasi-documentary follows actress Kate Lyn Sheil as she goes through the exercise of preparing to play the late journalist, conducting interviews and doing research around Sarasota. \\"A lot of people have that vague sense of 'I thought I knew about it,' since it reverberated through pop culture,\\" says Greene, noting how Chubbuck supposedly inspired the 1976 black comedy Network, in which a character vows to kill himself on air. Instead, her suicide has become something of an Internet urban legend, inspiring clickbait lists of \\"most shocking deaths\\" and conspiracy theories that she may have never died at all. That the footage has been kept under wraps for so long is not something \\"that'd exist today,\\" Greene says. \\"It comes from another era where, for good or bad, it was more swept away. People didn't necessarily think they should see that type of thing. We live in an era today where we think we have a right to see everything.\\" In 'Christine,' Rebecca Hall plays the real-life Christine Chubbuck, a reporter for a small Sarasota, Fla., TV station who committed suicide on-air. (Photo: The Orchard) But for actress Rebecca Hall, Chubbuck's life is just as fascinating as her death. Hall plays the troubled reporter in a new drama, Christine (in theaters Friday in New York, Oct. 21 in Los Angeles; expands nationwide throughout fall), which explores how her severe depression and frustrations at work may have contributed to her demise. Chubbuck repeatedly clashed with her dismissive boss (Tracy Letts) over his desire to sensationalize the news to goose ratings. \\"Her story is a harbinger of a lot of things we have trouble talking about,\\" Hall says. \\"We're still having discussions about how we judge a woman in the workplace, the likability factor and different standards\\" that men are held to. Chubbuck struggled with mental health issues and suicidal thoughts long before they entered the national conversation, which is part of what makes her story relatable for many. \\"We all know what it's like to feel stymied at work, to get depressed and feel unloved,\\" Hall says. \\"The film asks you to notice that (with the culmination of) those things — plus arbitrary circumstances of time and place, gender and brain chemistry — we might all go over the edge. ... I related to knowing what it feels like to feel thwarted by life and that you're not going to get over it, but I do, because I have the tools and she didn't.\\" Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2e0Xa9s ||||| The late Christine Chubbuck. A few months back, we published an article that centered around a curious and tragic figure in the history of American broadcasting: Christine Chubbuck, an on-air correspondent for a news station in Sarasota, Florida, who in 1974 shot herself on live television. In an odd coincidence, there were two movies about Chubbuck at Sundance this year, and we explored the ongoing search for footage of her death. It had long been unclear if such a tape exists, despite years of searching by the so-called “death hags” on Findadeath.com. Yesterday, we got a call that confirms the tape’s existence. While reporting the original story we had reached out to Mollie Nelson, the widow of the owner of Chubbuck’s news station, but never heard back from her. She called us back Tuesday to explain that she had the video for years — her late husband Robert Nelson had kept a copy of the tape, though Mollie says he never told her why. When he died, it stayed in her possession. But after the Sundance debut of the quasi-documentary Kate Plays Christine, in which a former news station employee suggests that Nelson might have the tape, people started contacting her asking to see it. The attempts made her uncomfortable, so she gave it to an unnamed “very large law firm” for safekeeping. She says she has no plans to ever make it available and only held on to the tape to honor her husband’s wishes. It seems, then, that the wait to see a tape nobody really needs to see continues. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","completion":"This article is about Christine Chubbuck, a news reporter from Florida who, in 1974, sadly took her own life while on live television. People have been trying to find footage of this shocking event, but it has been very difficult to find. Recently, two movies about her life and this tragic incident have been released. Although the original recording does exist, it is currently with a law firm for safekeeping, and the owners of the tape do not want to make it public. So, the mystery around the footage continues, but it is important to remember that Christine's life was much more than just this tragic event."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. This means learning to drive defensively and not take on a passive role when behind the wheel. In addition to traditional driver's education (which is usually a mandatory part of getting a license in the first place), you can take defensive driving courses and skill-enhancement courses if need be. Part of learning to be a good driver is knowing the rules of the road. Don't overwhelm yourself with details on traffic laws, but do become familiar with major laws and regulations (such as right-of-way guidelines). Taking informal lessons from a friend or family member who is a safe, experienced driver can go a long way toward building your confidence, and won't cost you anything but some time and effort. Before going out on the open road, go to an open lot (such as a store parking lot on days when the business is closed) with a friend and just get used to the feeling of being behind the wheel. Once you feel comfortable enough, practice starting and stopping, turning, and signaling. If even the idea of driving slowly in an empty parking lot frightens you, begin by just sitting in the driver's seat of your car with the engine off. Eventually, start the car; over time, the basic aspects of driving won't seem so scary. These will work differently for different people, but could include things such as meditating, deep breathing, or praying. Find what works for you and do it on a daily basis. If you are naturally prone to panic attacks, this should be part of your daily routine already. If you have suffered a car accident, learning to keep calm when returning to driving is key to regaining self-confidence. If you are in therapy for anxiety already, ask your therapist what you can do to calm yourself down in a situation where you are beginning to panic. Figuring out how to handle your anxiety before you go out on the road will be help your nerves immensely. Keep in mind that it is rare for someone to have an accident while in the midst of a panic attack. A certain degree of anxiety can be relieved by knowing as much as possible about how your car works. If you understand the operations of your vehicle's safety features and how they can protect you in the unlikely event of a crash, you may become less scared to drive. Know how to properly wear your seatbelt. The single biggest thing you can do to protect yourself from becoming injured during a crash is to wear your seatbelt. Seatbelts are most effective when worn low and tight across the lap and with the shoulder strap across your chest. You may also want to consider a built-in emergency contact system, such as On Star. These systems make it easy for you to get help if you are in an accident and they will automatically send help if you can’t respond. Most vehicle operator's manuals have sections devoted to safety features. Some even provide instructions on what to do in the event of an emergency. Alternatively, you can ask your insurance provider for this information. When planning to go out for a drive, make sure you are well-rested. Alertness and quick thinking are critical aspects of driving safely, and you will feel less anxious if you are not tired when you get behind the wheel. Do not rely upon caffeine or other artificial alertness aids to keep you awake. If you take medications that make you drowsy, do not drive while under their influence. Contrary to what you might expect, you could be more likely to have an anxiety attack if you try to drive while tired, as you might panic just knowing that you could fall asleep. Summary:","completion":"To be a good driver, practice driving with someone experienced and learn the rules of the road. Start by practicing in an empty parking lot until you feel comfortable. To stay calm while driving, try meditation or deep breathing and talk to a therapist about managing anxiety. Understand your car's safety features and always wear your seatbelt. Make sure you are well-rested before driving and don't drive if you are taking medications that make you drowsy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

She must have debated whether it was a good idea or not to meet up with me there. After a moment's hesitation, I decided to take the initiative.

As both options, meeting and not meeting, have potential consequences, it was important for me to weigh the pros and cons before proceeding. Step 2: Consider my approach I recalled the recent interactions and conversations I've had with Pagan to figure out the best way to approach her, taking into account her personality and preferences. As she seemed relatively private, I decided to use a gentle and respectful tone to make her feel more comfortable. Step 3: Choose an action I decided to approach Pagan to clarify if my suspicions were correct – was she indeed looking for me? If she was, I could then propose the park meeting more confidently. Step 4: Initiate conversation Walking closer to her, I spoke in a soft yet confident tone. \\"Pagan, it seems like you might be searching for someone. Is it me you're looking for?\\" Step 5: Observe her response I carefully watched her body language and listened to her response to gauge whether she was open to meeting up or not. If Pagan appeared visibly uncomfortable or denied looking for me, I would have offered an alternative solution, such as giving her the space she needed and suggesting she could reach out whenever she felt ready. Step 6: Proceed with the suggestion Assuming Pagan confirmed that she was indeed looking for me, I would reiterate my proposal to meet at the park across the street. \\"If you're looking for me, how about we meet at the park over there? It's a quiet place where we can talk without feeling crowded or rushed.\\" Step 7: Allow her to process the suggestion I would give Pagan some time to think about my suggestion and weigh her options. The decision to meet up should be hers to make, and I would show respect for her choice, whatever it may be. Step 8: Finalize the plan If Pagan agreed to meet up at the park, we would set a time and location to convene. However, if she were still hesitant or declined my invitation, I would reassure her that I understood her feelings and would be available if and when she wanted to talk later. By taking these steps, I aim to navigate the situation effectively and respectfully, while providing Pagan the opportunity to make her own choices and offering my support if needed."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In February 1978, Gaddafi discovered that his head of military intelligence was plotting to kill him, and began to increasingly entrust security to his Qaddadfa tribe. Many who had seen their wealth and property confiscated turned against the administration, and a number of western-funded opposition groups were founded by exiles. Most prominent was the National Front for the Salvation of Libya (NFSL), founded in 1981 by Mohammed Magariaf, which orchestrated militant attacks against Libya's government, while another, al-Borkan, began killing Libyan diplomats abroad. Following Gaddafi's command to kill these \\"stray dogs\\", under Colonel Younis Bilgasim's leadership, the Revolutionary Committees set up overseas branches to suppress counter-revolutionary activity, assassinating various dissidents. Although nearby nations like Syria also used hit squads, Gaddafi was unusual in publicly bragging about his administration's use of them; in June 1980, he ordered all dissidents to return home or be \\"liquidated wherever you are.\\" What Libyan government official allegedly plotted to kill Gaddafi in 1978?","completion":"In February 1978, Gaddafi discovered that his head of military intelligence was allegedly plotting to kill him."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Generate a detailed description of this data.","completion":"The data provided is about a place called Blue Spice with specific mentions of its price range and the area in which it is located. The term 'Blue Spice' is presumably referring to an establishment which could be a restaurant, diner, bar or a lounge, aiming to provide certain services. As the nature of the institution isn't specifically mentioned, it can be reasoned upon that it is a business where food and drinks may be served giving the use of the term 'Spice' traditionally associated with cuisine. Then we have the term 'priceRange high' which indicates that the pricing of the services or the products provided by the Blue Spice establishment is on the higher end. A higher price range could typically indicate a few things about the establishment like they may be using high-quality, premium, or rare ingredients, or offering unique and possibly luxurious experiences to their customers. Such establishments usually cater to a niche, high-income demographic who seek and can afford such experiences. From a customer viewpoint, it can impact their decision-making process regarding whether or not to opt for this service depending on their budget and the value proposition offered. Finally, the term 'area riverside' gives us crucial information about the location of the Blue Spice. It tells us that the establishment is located near or along a riverside. Riverside areas are often considered scenic, serene, and attractive. They could offer great views which could be a significant factor affecting the establishment's ambiance and overall customer experience. Being at a riverside location, the establishment might offer outdoor seating, waterfront views, or maybe even events and activities related to the nearby water body. It could present customers with a relaxing, fresh environment that could again be a possible reason for the high-end pricing, depending on the exact location and the property costs associated with it. In conclusion, Blue Spice seems to reference a potentially high-end establishment located in a picturesque riverside area. Its high price range could reflect on the quality of its services or products, as well as its location, suggesting it offers a potentially elevated, unique, or luxury experience. This information thus provides a significant insight into the nature of the establishment, helping potential customers make informed decisions based on their preferences, requirements, and budgets."},{"prompt":"In this task, you are given a hateful post in English from online platforms.

The answer is:","completion":"From the given bio, we can gather several details about the band Darts: 1. Genre and style: Darts was a British doo-wop revival band, meaning that their musical style drew influence from the doo-wop genre, which emerged in the United States during the 1940s and 1950s. Doo-wop is known for its vocal harmonies, melodic tunes, and rhythm and blues (R&B) influences. 2. Band size and origin: The band consisted of nine members, which indicates the possibility of a diverse instrumental arrangement and complex vocal harmonies. They are London-based, which means they were formed and primarily active in the London metropolitan area. 3. Time period of activity: Darts achieved chart success during the late 1970s and early 1980s. This places the band's popularity and activity within this specific time frame, providing context for their musical style and cultural relevance. 4. Chart success and notable hits: The band had a number of UK Top 20 hits, which demonstrates their commercial success and popularity during their time. Among their successful tracks, three of them managed to reach the number two spot on the UK charts. This highlights that they not only had multiple hits but were also consistent in their success. 5.

Given the question \\"How would Others feel as a result?\\", is \\"responsible\\" a valid answer? A:","completion":"The answer \\"responsible\\" would not typically be valid for the question \\"How would others feel as a result?\\". This is because \\"responsible\\" describes a sense of duty or obligation, rather than an emotional response. In the context of the statement \\"Jordan took their toddler to school as she was a prodigy\\", we can deduce that the main characters are Jordan and their prodigy toddler. Therefore, when asked how \\"others\\" might feel about this situation, it's most likely referring to people outside of Jordan and the child - such as friends, family, or the general public. Emotional responses people might have could range from feelings of surprise, awe, or admiration given the fact that the toddler is a prodigy, meaning unusually gifted or skilled for their age. They could also potentially feel jealous or intimidated. On the other hand, \\"responsible\\" could potentially apply if the question was phrased differently, such as \\"What would others feel responsible for as a result?\\" In that scenario, teachers or school staff might feel a heightened sense of responsibility due to the toddler's prodigious abilities.

For casual music listening, a pair of bookshelf speakers would be more than enough. Those who desire a more intensive experience can upgrade to standing speakers. Surround sound systems are also a high-end option. Subwoofers are additional speakers that add depth to bass, which is low tone. They’re good for movies and music with lower range such as rock and metal. For adding general depth to TV and movies, a soundbar or soundbase is an option. These take up less space, require less wiring, and can be combined with a subwoofer. Wireless and wall-mounted speakers benefit from portability and offer new sound angles in your room. For gaming, small specialized speakers usually offer enough sound. These are placed on a desktop near the computer and have magnetic shielding. Different surfaces affect sound quality. Hard, flat surfaces reflect sound and soft or varying surfaces absorb sound. Sound is also easier to hear in a small room. To get a sense of the room, stand in the center and clap. The less the sound carries, the more powerful the speakers you’ll need. A small room such as a bedroom is fine with bookshelf speakers, but a large carpeted and furnished room benefits from bigger speakers. While bookshelf speakers will fit in a small bedroom, you wouldn’t want to try to fit wide standing speakers in there. The sound can overwhelm a small room even if it has lots of absorbent furnishings. On the other hand, if you want a surround sound system for your television, the speakers need space away from the wall and surround you. Where you’ll put the speakers matters. Speakers inside a cabinet, for instance, can get muffled, but so do speakers in room corners since the sound is distorted by the walls. Speakers benefit from being three to four feet away from the sound source. This helps them project sound into the room. Try to keep your speakers around ear-level. At that level, the sound will be clearest to you. It’s very easy to fall into a price tag trap. You’ll see bigger and better-looking speakers or a salesperson will refer you to them even though quality isn’t completely related to price. A cheaper speaker may work better for you than a more expensive one. Stick to your budget as much as possible. Once you’ve decided on the type of speaker you need, go online or shop around in stores to compare prices. Determine how much you’re willing to pay for the kind of speaker that seems right for you.","completion":"In summary, the selection of speaker builds caters to individual preferences and various tasks. For casual music listening, bookshelf speakers suffice, while standing speakers are ideal for a more immersive experience. Surround sound systems provide a luxurious option, and subwoofers enhance bass depth, suitable for movies and specific music genres like rock and metal.

Answer:","completion":"When planning a trip to the Galapagos Islands, you need to know the best entry points to access this unique and incredible destination. The Galapagos Islands are an archipelago, located about 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) off the coast of Ecuador, and part of its territory. There are no direct flights to the Galapagos Islands from locations outside of Ecuador, so you must first fly into the mainland and then take a domestic flight to the islands. Here is a detailed overview of where you should fly in for the Galapagos Islands: 1. Fly into Ecuador: To visit the Galapagos Islands, you must first fly to Ecuador. The best point of entry is through one of the two international airports in the country: Mariscal Sucre International Airport (UIO) in Quito, the capital city; or José Joaquín de Olmedo International Airport (GYE) in Guayaquil, the largest city in Ecuador. Both airports have numerous connecting flights from major cities across North and South America as well as Europe. Many visitors choose to spend a day or two exploring Quito or Guayaquil before flying out to the Galapagos Islands. 2. Fly to Galapagos Islands: After arriving in mainland Ecuador, you must take a domestic flight to the Galapagos Islands. There are two airports in the archipelago where you can fly into: Seymour Airport (GPS) on Baltra Island and San Cristóbal Airport (SCY) on San Cristóbal Island. - Seymour Airport (GPS) on Baltra Island: Baltra Island is smaller and uninhabited, but it serves as the main gateway to the Galapagos Islands. Seymour Airport is the busiest of the two airports and is commonly used by travelers who plan to visit Santa Cruz Island, which is one of the most popular islands due to its proximity to Baltra. From Seymour Airport, you will need to take a bus to the Itabaca Channel, cross the channel by ferry, and then take a bus or taxi to Puerto Ayora, the main settlement on Santa Cruz Island. Santa Cruz accommodates a wide range of hotels and restaurants for tourists, as well as ample opportunities for wildlife encounters and various boat trips. - San Cristóbal Airport (SCY) on San Cristóbal Island: San Cristóbal Airport may be a better choice if you're looking for a more laid-back experience or if your tour's starting point is on San Cristóbal Island. It is also the airport of choice for cruises that depart from or return to this island. Once you arrive, it’s only a short 5-10 minute drive to Puerto Baquerizo Moreno, where you can find accommodations, restaurants, and activities. 3. Choosing a domestic flight to the Galapagos Islands: There are several airlines that operate daily flights between Quito/Guayaquil and the Galapagos Islands. They usually fly early in the morning. Flights from Guayaquil take approximately 1 hour and 45 minutes, while flights from Quito have a stopover in Guayaquil and take about 3 hours in total. Domestic airlines that operate flights to the Galapagos Islands include Avianca, LATAM, and TAME. It's essential to book your flights well in advance, as they can fill up quickly, especially during high tourism seasons. In conclusion, to access the Galapagos Islands, you should first fly into either Quito or Guayaquil in Ecuador. From there, take a domestic flight to either Seymour Airport on Baltra Island or San Cristóbal Airport on San Cristóbal Island, depending on your preferred destination and tour itinerary."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Please answer the following question about this movie plot.

Here is a breakdown of the differences in the two sentences: First Sentence: \\"In 2006, the team added a second car for Richard Göransson and was replaced by Thed Björk in 2009.\\" This sentence is suggesting that the team expanded in 2006 by adding a second car specifically for Richard Göransson, a racing driver. Then, three years later in 2009, the team underwent another change, which involved Richard Göransson being replaced by another driver, Thed Björk. In this context, Thed Björk took over Richard Göransson's position within the team. Second Sentence: \\"The team added a second car for Thed Bjork in 2006 and was replaced in 2009 by Richard Göransson.\\" In contrast, this sentence is stating that the expansion in 2006 saw the team add a second car for Thed Björk, rather than Richard Göransson. Later, in 2009, Thed Björk was replaced by Richard Göransson. In this instance, it is Richard Göransson who comes into the team to take Thed Björk's position. The essential difference between these two sentences is the timing and order of the drivers' involvement with the team. In the first sentence, Richard Göransson was initially a part of the team and was later replaced by Thed Björk. Conversely, in the second sentence, Thed Björk was initially part of the team, and Richard Göransson later joined by replacing him. Each sentence conveys a distinct series of events related to the drivers and team, and thus, the meanings are not the same."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Q:This article: McVeigh later said that he had contemplated assassinating Attorney General Janet Reno, Lon Horiuchi, and others in preference to attacking a building, and after the bombing he said that he sometimes wished he had carried out a series of assassinations instead. He initially intended only to destroy a federal building, but he later decided that his message would be better received if many people were killed in the bombing. McVeigh's criterion for potential attack sites was that the target should house at least two of three federal law enforcement agencies: the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), or the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). He regarded the presence of additional law enforcement agencies, such as the Secret Service or the U.S. Marshals Service, as a bonus.A resident of Kingman, Arizona, McVeigh considered targets in Missouri, Arizona, Texas, and Arkansas. He stated in his authorized biography that he wanted to minimize non-governmental casualties, so he ruled out a 40-story government building in Little Rock, Arkansas, because of the presence of a florist's shop on the ground floor. In December 1994, McVeigh and Fortier visited Oklahoma City to inspect McVeigh's target: the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building. The Murrah building had been previously targeted in October 1983 by white supremacist group The Covenant, The Sword, and the Arm of the Lord, including founder James Ellison and Richard Snell. The group had plotted to park \\"a van or trailer in front of the Federal Building and blow it up with rockets detonated by a timer.\\" After Snell's appeal for murdering two people in unrelated cases was denied, he was executed the same day as the Murrah bombing.The nine-story building, built in 1977, was named for a federal judge and housed fourteen federal agencies, including the DEA, ATF, Social Security Administration, and recruiting offices for the Army and Marine Corps.

In nature, we often talk about 'producers' and 'consumers'. 'Producers' are things like plants that make their own food from sunlight. 'Consumers', on the other hand, can't make their own food, so they eat other things. Now, a Fennec Fox is a type of ‘consumer’ called a carnivore. Can you guess what that means from the sound of it? Well, 'carni-' sounds a lot like 'carnivorous,' doesn't it? And 'carnivorous' means 'meat-eating.' That's right, the Fennec Fox is a carnivore because it eats other animals. Specifically, it eats insects, rodents, and birds. There's also another word we can use to describe the Fennec Fox's eating habits: it's an 'omnivore.' Just like how 'carnivore' means 'meat-eater,' 'omnivore' means 'everything-eater.' That's because, in addition to meat, the Fennec Fox also eats plants! So, to answer your question in a fun way, a Fennec Fox is a 'meat-and-vegetables-eater' — an omnivore."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Write a summary based on this article: FRESNO, Calif. (AP) — A woman who was stranded in the rugged Sierra Nevada for nine days while suffering from some broken bones survived by using a water filter to drink from a creek, authorities said. Miyuki Harwood, 62, was found Saturday morning in a remote area of the Sierra National Forest after she used a whistle to get the attention of a search and rescue team who were looking for her, Fresno County Sheriff Margaret Mims said at a news conference. Harwood was airlifted to a hospital to treat an unspecified injury sustained on Aug. 20 when she got separated from a group of hikers near Horsehead Lake, about 100 miles northwest of Fresno. She was listed in stable condition, the sheriff said after meeting Harwood at her hospital bed. \\"Her voice was strong. She was extremely thankful that people were looking for her,\\" Mims said. Harwood, of Folsom, Calif., was the focus of an intense search involving several law enforcement agencies after she got lost in the mountains. She broke some bones and couldn't hike back to her base camp, Mims said. She also had very little food and supplies because she was carrying just enough for a day trip. To survive, Harwood crawled for about two days from where she was injured to a creek where she could scoop water into a bottle with a filter inside. \\"She was a fighter,\\" said Rusty Hotchkiss, a California Highway Patrol flight officer and paramedic who flew Harwood to the hospital. \\"She was very exhausted — very tired, but she was very thankful to be saved and to get out of there,\\" he added. Mims said the search for Harwood was hampered by thick smoke from a wildfire that has burned 96 square miles nearby in the Kings Canyon National Park. ||||| Facebook Twitter Google Plus Embed 1:44 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog A 62-year-old woman who vanished while hiking in California was found alive Saturday — more than a week after she was separated from the group she was traveling with, police said.

The search was initially hampered by smoke from a wildfire, called the Rough Fire, which began July 31 and was burning about 10 miles away from the search area. Officials also worried that the smoke would debilitate Harwood as rescuers scrambled to find her. Mims warned that hikers should not separate from their groups and stay away from trails with hazardous conditions. \\"Especially right now with the fires going on, now is not a good time to go up into that area.

Common causes of heat exhaustion include:[1] Hot, sunny, humid weather Physical exertion, especially in hot, humid weather Due to impaired thermoregulation, elderly people and infants can get serious heat illness even at rest, if the weather outside is hot and humid, and they are not getting enough cool air. Some drugs, such as diuretics, antihistamines, beta-blockers, alcohol, ecstasy, and amphetamines can cause an increase in the risk of heat exhaustion.[2] Especially during physical exertion, risk factors for heat exhaustion include:[1] Wearing dark, padded, or insulated clothing; hats; and/or helmets (for example, football pads or turnout gear) Having a higher percentage of body fat Dehydration Fever Some medications, like beta blockers and antipsychotic medicines[2] Two groups of people were out in the sunny, humid weather of Illinois. Group One wore black clothes and helmets, and Group Two wore white, light clothing. Both groups were comprised of people of all ages and fitness levels and exercised in the sun for an hour. Which group had more overweight people experiencing heat illness? Answer:","completion":"Based on the given information, it is more likely that the Group One had more overweight people experiencing heat illness. This conclusion is drawn from the mentioned risk factors for heat exhaustion and the two distinct characteristics of the groups. Group One wore dark, padded or insulated clothing, and helmets. Dark clothes absorb more heat compared to light-colored clothes, which reflects heat. Padded or insulated clothes, as well as helmets, also tend to trap heat and limit the evaporation of sweat, making it difficult for the body to cool itself down. As a result, the people in Group One were more prone to heat exhaustion. Additionally, having a higher percentage of body fat is identified as a risk factor for heat exhaustion, particularly during physical exertion. Overweight individuals have a higher percentage of body fat, which can make it more challenging for their body to regulate its temperature, causing them to become more susceptible to heat illness. So, the more overweight people in either group will be at a higher risk. Since both groups were exercising in hot, sunny, humid weather for an hour, they both faced risks of heat exhaustion. However, the fact that Group One was wearing dark, padded, or insulated clothing and helmets made them more vulnerable to heat illness. Consequently, it can be inferred that more overweight people in Group One experienced heat illness compared to Group Two, which wore white, light clothing, allowing for better heat regulation and reduced chances of heat exhaustion."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Options: - mountains - arctic tundra - great outdoors - open meadow - city Explain why a human would choose \\"great outdoors\\" to answer the question above: The answer to this question is:","completion":"Great outdoors. The term \\"great outdoors\\" refers to a diverse array of natural environments where you can experience and appreciate the beauty and serenity of nature. These environments include mountains, forests, deserts, rivers, lakes, and various other ecosystems. Choosing the \\"great outdoors\\" as the answer to the question \\"Where can you enjoy a hike and maybe encounter a fox?\\" provides a broader range of possibilities compared to the other options presented, as foxes can be found in many different habitats within the great outdoors. First, let's briefly discuss the other options: 1. Mountains: While foxes can indeed be found at high elevations, choosing this option would limit the potential areas for a hike, as not everyone has access to or may be comfortable hiking on steep, rocky terrain. 2. Arctic tundra: This option is even more restrictive, as it is limited to regions near the Arctic Circle where the ground remains frozen and covered in ice and snow for most of the year. Only experienced hikers and adventurers would choose this option, and the likelihood of encountering Arctic foxes is relatively low, given their natural camouflage and difficulty in being spotted against the snowy background. 3. Open meadow: Although an open meadow could provide a suitable habitat for foxes, specifically during their hunting activities and in a rural setting where there is little human presence, it isn't the most common place to encounter a fox while hiking. 4. City: While urban foxes are increasingly common as they adapt to human environments, it is not an ideal place for a hike and wildlife encounter experience. Cities are typically more suitable for short walks, sightseeing, shopping, or other urban activities. On the contrary, the \\"great outdoors\\" option encompasses a variety of ecosystems and habitats where you can not only enjoy a hike and maybe see a fox but also experience the beauty of nature in many forms. In many types of forests, national parks, and nature reserves, hikers will find well-maintained trails, spectacular natural features, and a wide range of plant and animal life. The great outdoors is an ideal setting for a hike where you might encounter a fox because it can include any outdoor environment where foxes may be found, such as mixed forests or wooded areas adjacent to fields and meadows. Foxes often inhabit these areas because they provide the right balance between cover, food sources, and proximity to urban or rural environments. In these locations, human hikers have a higher likelihood of seeing a fox during their adventures, particularly during dawn or dusk when these animals are most active. In conclusion, choosing the great outdoors as the answer to the question \\"Where can you enjoy a hike and maybe encounter a fox?\\" presents a range of opportunities for human hikers to explore different types of natural environments and have a possibly higher chance of seeing a fox in its natural habitat. This option not only makes for a more enjoyable and exciting hiking experience but also allows for an appreciation of the diversity and beauty of our natural world."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: Question: \\"Who was mentioned in the GPC announcement?\\" Context: \\"In 1979, the committees began the redistribution of land in the Jefara plain, continuing through 1981.

A trace of childish innocence in his face gives the lanky Bethlehem lawyer a Jimmy Stewart-like quality of quiet trust. In black jeans and button-down shirt, he's a kind of folk hero in the south Bethlehem melting pot where he's crafted a law practice catering to working-class families - mostly Latino - in the shadow of the hulkish remnants of Bethlehem Steel. A two-hour drive away, at City University of New York Law School in Queens, Rooney spends several days a week helping upstart lawyers develop storefront practices that, like his, provide legal representation to folks who can't afford a 250-an-hour legal counselor. Kristin Booth Glen, the law school's dean, took one look at Rooney and knew he was the right person to head the innovative Community Legal Resources Network. ''Fred's so low-key, he's Midwestern in effect,'' says Glen, a former New York Supreme Court judge. ''He captivates people, he inspires loyalty.'' For bringing legal representation to the poor and a host of other social causes, including finding medical care for seriously ill children in Latin America, the Moravian College Alumni Association has chosen Rooney for its prestigious Haupert Humanitarian Award. The award, given to only a select few alumni, will be presented at 7:30 tonight at a reception on Moravian's Priscilla Payne Hurd campus. Moravian, where he was an undergraduate in the early 1970s, inspired Rooney's deep sense of social justice. The son of a Bethlehem Steel executive in New York, he came to the Bethlehem campus from an affluent upbringing on Long Island. The young Rooney might have set his sights on Washington, D.C., like his uncle, former U.S. Rep. Fred Rooney of Bethlehem. After all, politics run in the Rooney family. His brother, state Rep. T.J. Rooney of Bethlehem, is a power in the state Legislature and the Democratic Party. But on a trip to Colombia when he was a junior at Moravian, the child of privilege saw human suffering, malnutrition and poverty the likes of which he had never imagined. ''I couldn't understand why we live this way and they live that way,'' Rooney recalled. ''It's been the guiding light of my life ever since.'' After graduating in CUNY Law School's first class in 1986, he took a job with Lehigh Valley Legal Services.

'It is a symbol of your noble lineage and the great destiny that awaits you. It is my honor to return this to you, and my hope that it may serve as a reminder of all that you can become.' The tryst between Beleg and their captain was an ongoing mystery to the rest of the company, much to Androg's displeasure. He watched them with a growing suspicion, wondering why their captain chose Beleg as a confidante, and what secrets they were keeping from the rest of the group. The air was thick with tension and unanswered questions. Despite this, Beleg and the captain seemed to share a deep understanding and respect for each other, which only fueled Androg's jealousy. The helm of Hador was a magnificent artifact, an heirloom passed down through the ages, and a symbol of great power and authority. It had once belonged to Hador, a legendary hero who had fought against the forces of darkness, and it was adorned with intricate engravings and precious stones. The helm shone with a radiance that spoke of the courage and strength of its previous wearers. As Beleg handed the helm to Turin, he knew that he was entrusting him with not only his own past, but the history and the future of an entire people. Turin received the helm with a mixture of awe and humility, knowing the great responsibility that came with carrying such a burden. He could feel the weight of countless battles and the spirits of his ancestors within its metal, and he understood the importance of his role in the unfolding story. As he held the helm, Turin allowed himself to be filled with the dreams and goals he had once held dear, and he felt his passion for justice and his determination to protect his people reignited within him. Beleg's hope in bringing the helm of Hador was that Turin would once again see the bigger picture and rise above his current status as the leader of a small, disorganized company. The helm was meant to remind Turin of the great deeds and sacrifices his lineage had made for their people and the duty that still lay ahead of him. In embracing this greater purpose, Turin would be called upon to unite his band and become a symbol of hope for all those who opposed the spread of darkness. And so it was, that as Turin donned the helm of Hador, he felt the weight of history and the responsibility of his destiny upon him. Beleg watched with pride as his friend transformed before his eyes, shedding the lingering doubt and pain that had plagued him for so long, and embracing, once again, the nobility that was his birthright. With the helm in place, Turin stood tall and strong, ready to lead his company to battle and reclaim his place in the pantheon of heroes. And though Androg continued to watch them jealously, he could not deny that a change had taken place, and that perhaps, this tryst between Beleg and their captain held a secret that was crucial to their survival and the fate of the land they fought to protect."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Let's all pitch in and help make life a little easier and brighten both of their day. Help spread the word! Share Tweet 121k shares on Facebook shares on Facebook ||||| LITTLE VILLAGE — In just two days, a spontaneous online campaign brought in more than 150,000 for an 89-year-old man who's spent decades selling ice cream in Little Village, with nearly 7,000 people donating money toward his retirement. On Monday, he showed up to work anyway. Like almost every day since 1993, Fidencio Sanchez arrived at Paletas Poncho, 2513 S. Pulaski Rd., around 11 a.m. He donned a lime-green cap to shield from the midday sun, grabbed his cart stocked with about 300 frozen treats and went out on the road. Sanchez typically pushes a cart for a few hours each day, usually taking in about 60, according to Gustavo Gutierrez, co-owner of Paletas Poncho. \\"I've been doing it all this time, number one, because I like it,\\" Sanchez said Monday. \\"Number two, because I've been trying to keep supporting myself.\\" Sanchez retired two months ago, intending to \\"take it easy\\" and relax with his wife, Gutierrez said. But he returned to work in July, after the death of his only daughter left him with no other way to pay the bills for himself and his ailing wife. \\"My daughter was like a mother to us,\\" Sanchez said. \\"She worked every day, she cooked for us every evening and night. We still don't know what to do without her.\\" Joel Cervantes Macias, one of two people behind the fundraising campaign, had never seen Sanchez before last week, when he drove past the small man doubled over his cart on a hot day, he said. \\"The dude just looked like he was suffering,\\" Cervantes said. \\"I thought, 'This is a guy who aught to be enjoying retirement.'\\" Cervantes bought 20 popsicles for 50, but he wanted to do more, he said. He snapped a picture of Sanchez behind his cart and posted it to Facebook, and a flood of comments and messages came back. \\"That one picture had so much to say, and people really responded to it,\\" Cervantes said of the photo, which showed Sanchez stooping over his cart as he pushed it past a dirty alley in Little Village. \\"It communicated so many things — poverty, struggle, pride — it's like it spoke more words than any amount of writing could.\\" After seeing the post, Joe Loera, a distant acquaintance of Cervantes, reached out and offered to set up a GoFundMe page to raise money for Sanchez's retirement. \\"I thought maybe we could raise 200 for him, just to help him out,\\" Loera said. By Monday 10 a.m. Monday morning, the page registered more than 138,000 in donations from more than 6,400 people. An hour later, Cervantes checked his phone again. \\"We're up to 150,000!\\" he shouted to Loera, who stared back in disbelief. \\"It's really just an example of how the global community really does have a lot of love to give,\\" Loera said. \\"They just need a way to show it.\\" Some of those who gave pointed to the campaign as proof of the underlying care and compassion Chicagoans feel for one another. \\"What a fantabulous way to prove that Chicago is not just about crime and craziness,\\" one donor wrote. \\"It's about our roots and helping those in need when they need it most!\\" RELATED: 90-Year-Old 'Paleta Man' Who Refuses To Stop Working After seeing the total raised on Monday, Sanchez said he was \\"very happy and grateful\\" to see \\"such a great surprise.\\" But, he added, he's not ready to hang up his operation quite yet. \\"Maybe just one more week,\\" he said. Even after taking in so many donations, Guterriez wondered wondered whether the man knew how to stop working. \\"He's a really hardworking gentleman,\\" Gutierrez said. \\"He's always giving. He already got the advice from everybody to take it easy and stop doing it. He just doesn't want to. He's like a little kid. He wants to get going.\\" \\"The man just doesn't get tired,\\" added Blanca Gutierrez, Gustavo Gutierrez's wife and co-owner of Paletas Poncho, on Monday. \\"I think he wants to be like a tree, and die standing up.\\" Sanchez, who attends the same church every Saturday, learned of the fundraiser at services this weekend, Gustavo Gutierrez said. \\"... He knows, and he's taking it with a lot of love,\\" Gutierrez said. \\"We're really for this [support] from the entire community because he deserved it.\\" In a video interview posted on Facebook Saturday, Macias explains that he has opened an account for Sanchez and his wife so they don't have to set it up themselves at the bank, but said they'll have direct access to the money donated from around the globe. Sanchez and his wife Eladia both said in the Facebook video that they value hard work, and don't believe anyone should rely on charity or handouts when they are able to provide for themselves. \\"We used to be poor farmers,\\" Eladia said in the video. \\"We came up here to try to make money for our family, to try to send our daughter to high school and give her a future.\\" You can donate to the campaign online.

But online donors saved the 89-year-old man the trouble of finding out. Through 5 to 2,000 donations, 6,300-plus people collectively raised more than 135,000 - the equivalent of 90,000 paleta sales - for Sanchez in a GoFundMe campaign started by a stranger wanting to offer the older man a little relief from pushing his cart. Crediting friend Joe Loera with coming up with the idea to start an online fundraiser, Joel Cervantes said in this case it took a village – Little Village – to make all the difference to Sanchez and his wife, Eladia. Eladia Sanchez also used to sell paletas but now sells Mexican candies because pushing the heavy cart became too physically demanding and hurt her arm, according to the Sanchez' granddaughter, Dulce Perez. Fidencio Sanchez has been pushing his cart in the area about 23 years, Perez said. “A lot of people knew him,” Cervantes said of Sanchez. “After I put it on Facebook, people started inboxing me and they were like, ‘I know that gentleman, he’s always around town.’ I should’ve expected it because he sells all across the 26th Street area. If it touches me, I should’ve known it touches everybody else who sees him.” Online donors have raised hundreds of thousands of dollars to assist 89-year-old Fidencio Sanchez, who for more than two decades has pushed his cart through Little Village selling paletas and Mexican candies. Cervantes first met Sanchez Thursday, while the older man was pushing his cart and appeared to be struggling a bit. According to his post on GoFundMe, Cervantes bought 20 paletas and intentionally overpaid, giving Sanchez a 50. He also snapped a photo of the man, and said he thinks those 6,000 people were moved to donate because their imaginations were stirred by the photo. “They seen how he’s struggling to pull the cart. He looks like he’s suffering, like he’ll never give up … they put two and two together, like they need to do this to survive,” Cervantes said. The next time the pair met, Cervantes caught up with Sanchez at his church, and delivered the six-figure news. “I set (the fundraiser goal) for a modest 3,000 and in 54 minutes, to be exact, we already reached that,” Cervantes said Sunday afternoon. “Like my brother told me, ‘That picture speaks 1,000 words.’ I think if I wasn’t lucky enough to take that picture, I don’t think it would’ve had the response that it did,” Cervantes said. Cervantes also wrote in the fundraiser description that the Sanchez’s daughter, who may have helped the couple financially, passed away this year. “It broke my heart seeing this man who should be enjoying retirement still working at this age,” Cervantes wrote. “Mr. Fidencio Sanchez and his wife recently lost their only daughter and are still heartbroken about the situation. His elderly wife was selling paletas also to help pay bills, but she fell ill and can't work anymore. We're trying to raise money to help him with whatever we can. Anything helps. Let's all pitch in and help make life a little easier and brighten both of their day.” Dulce Perez, who spoke on behalf of her grandfather Monday, said that goal was achieved and then some. \\"I was very surprised,\\" Fidencio Sanchez said through Perez. \\"I am very thankful for the men that thought of doing this. ... I am very thankful for the favor.\\" Bart Jackson, a San Francisco-based communications manager for GoFundMe said he did a double-take when on Saturday afternoon he saw the fundraiser had been shared 24,000 times on social media. To put that in perspective, he said a fundraiser set up for victims of the tragedy at Pulse Nightclub in Orlando was shared 240,000 times. Monday morning, the post on the paletero had been shared 59,000 times and was still trending. “It's heartwarming to see so many folks rally around Fidencio and donate to the campaign,” Jackson said. Although he worked Sunday, Fidencio Sanchez said Monday it might be time to park his cart for good. \\"Well, seems to me like it won't be necessary anymore and I will be able to rest more at home,\\" Perez said for Sanchez. \\"It means a lot, and the changes will be that there will be no need for me to work, and we will have help in all aspects; Like getting better clothes and things that will improve our life at home.\\" To donate to the campaign go to: www.gofundme.com. ||||| What is a summary?","completion":"A summary is a short version of a larger piece of information, like a story or an article.

Objective: How can I dice garlic without stinky hands after? Which of the following solutions is more sound in terms of naive physics reasoning?","completion":"Solution 1: Use a garlic press Solution 2: Wear food-safe disposable gloves while dicing the garlic To determine which solution is more sound in terms of naive physics reasoning, let's evaluate and compare the effectiveness of each solution in avoiding stinky hands. Solution 1 - Using a garlic press: 1. This device is specifically designed for dealing with garlic. 2. The garlic press minimizes the contact between your hands and the garlic, thus not leaving much smell on your hands. 3. It requires lesser fine motor skills compared to manual dicing, as you only need to press the handles to extract the crushed garlic. Solution 2 - Wearing food-safe disposable gloves: 1. Wearing gloves creates a physical barrier between your hands and the garlic, protecting your hands from the smell. 2. This option still requires manual dicing of the garlic, involving the use of a knife and cutting board. 3. Depending on the gloves' material, it might slightly affect your grip on the knife and the garlic, making dicing a bit more challenging. Comparing the two solutions: - Both options do help to prevent stinky hands after dicing garlic. - Solution 1 allows you to avoid manual dicing, while solution 2 still requires that. - Solution 1's effectiveness largely depends on the garlic press's quality and design. - Solution 2 has a broader application, as you can use gloves while handling not only garlic but also other strong-smelling foods. Based on the naive physics reasoning, Solution 1 (using a garlic press) seems to be more sound, as it specifically targets the problem by reducing the need for manual dicing and minimizing hand contact with the garlic."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Read the following article and select the best answer.

Monks follow the vinaya: meditating, teaching and serving their lay communities. Laypersons can perform good actions, producing merit.\\". Can you tell me what it is? A:","completion":"A: Coming back is a form of rebirth. The sentence \\"Theravadin Buddhists believe that personal effort is required to realize rebirth\\" provides the context we need to answer the question. Theravadin Buddhists, a branch of Buddhism, emphasize the importance of personal effort in realizing rebirth, which in this context refers to the cycle of birth, death, and rebirth known as samsara. The concept of rebirth itself implies \\"coming back,\\" i.e., returning to life in a new form after death. In this tradition, individuals strive to make spiritual progress and accumulate merit through following the vinaya (the set of monastic rules and guidelines), meditating, teaching, and serving their lay communities. This intentional effort to better oneself and work towards the attainment of enlightenment subsequently influences the nature of one's rebirth. Thus, \\"coming back\\" can be interpreted as being directly related to the concept of rebirth in Theravadin Buddhism, as one's actions and efforts in their current life have a direct impact on the conditions of their future rebirth."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: What did samuel de champlain?

Let's analyze each question to understand why they are different: 1. In the first question, the focus is on repairing a damaged relationship between a parent and their daughter. The parent is allowed limited time with their daughter – only 2 hours per week, and their interactions must take place under supervision. This suggests that there may have been some trust issues or conflicts in the past, which have led to this arrangement. The challenge here is for the parent to figure out how they can rebuild the connection and trust with their daughter despite these restrictions. 2. The second question, on the other hand, is about dealing with the emotional impact of a child leaving home for college. The parent and daughter in this scenario have an emotionally close relationship, as evidenced by the tears and the feelings of sadness and missing each other following the daughter's departure. The challenge for the parent in this situation is learning how to cope with their child's absence and adjust to their new life stage, rather than repairing a damaged relationship. In conclusion, the two questions deal with contrasting situations and emotional dynamics.

At the weekend, Tom usually gets up late. He has breakfast. Then he reads an English book and listens to the radio for about one hour. After that he starts to do his homework. At about 11:30, he often cooks lunch for his family. In the afternoon, he usually plays volleyball with his friends. Sometimes he goes to the library in the afternoon. He loves his weekend very much. Question: Tom must be a (an) _ . Yes or no, is the answer \\"student\\"? Answer:","completion":"Yes, the answer is likely \\"student.\\" The text provides several clues that lead us to deduce that Tom is a student. First, the passage mentions that Tom wakes up late and spends his weekend in leisure activities, indicating he does not commit to a traditional, salaried, work schedule usual for adults. One aspect of his weekend routine that supports the conclusion is him reading an English book; this might suggest he is studying, improving his English skills, or preparing for a class or test. However, the most significant clue is the fact he does his \\"homework.\\" The context in which \\"homework\\" is used typically refers to tasks given by teachers for students to complete outside class time, supporting the assumption that Tom is indeed a student. He also spends part of his day cooking lunch. While this isn't definitive proof that he's a student, it could signify that he's a dependent living with family, common among students. Furthermore, his involvement in activities such as playing volleyball and visiting the library suggests that he likely doesn't have a job or professional commitments occupying his time on the weekend. In conclusion, although the text does not explicitly state Tom's status as a student, the activities he engages in and the structure of his day strongly indicate this.

Therefore, I would rate the similarity between these two sentences as 1.5 out of 5. To elaborate, Sentence 1 focuses on an \\"old green bottle sitting on a table.\\" In this sentence, the main subject is an inanimate object - the bottle. The description \\"old green\\" suggests that the bottle has aged and could possibly have a story behind it. The setting is the table, which implies that the bottle may be the focal point of attention or is just resting on the table. On the other hand, Sentence 2 involves \\"three men in suits sitting at a table.\\" Here, the subjects are three people, specifically men, wearing suits. This visual evokes a sense of professionalism or formality in the scene, which potentially sets a different tone from Sentence 1. Yet, similar to the previous sentence, the table is the common element - possibly serving as the shared space where these men are gathered. In conclusion, the table serves as the only commonality between these two sentences; however, the main subjects and their descriptions differ considerably. Based on the scale provided, the similarity between these sentences is minimal, and thus, the rating of 1.5 seems appropriate."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Choices: - directions gas law - shifts gas law - newton's law - combines gas law A:","completion":"The law that relates the pressure, volume, and temperature of a gas is known as \\"combined gas law\\". Let me explain why other options are not correct: - There is no Directions gas law in Physics or Chemistry. - Shifts gas law also doesn't exist in these sciences. - Newton's law relates to motion in Physics and is not linked to the behaviour of gases. Therefore, based on these eliminations and by knowledge, the correct answer is \\"combined gas law\\". This law combines Boyle's Law (relating pressure and volume), Charles's Law (relating volume and temperature) and Gay-Lussac's Law (relating pressure and temperature).

Answer the following question: This article: Kill 'Em All features intricate riffing reminiscent of the NWOBHM bands played at high velocity. The album is considered crucial in the thrash metal genesis because it introduced fast percussion, low-register chords, and shredding leads to the genre. Hammett played some pentatonic patterns in addition to his breakneck solos. Ulrich adopted a double time snare pattern that would become a mainstay on Metallica's subsequent albums. Hetfield's vocals evolved from the melodic wail on No Life 'til Leather to a rough-edged bark, and the entire band played faster and more accurately on Kill 'Em All. Music writer Joel McIver said Burton's and Hetfield's performances were nearly virtuosic, because of the smooth-sounding bass of the former and the precise picking skills of the latter. According to journalist Chuck Eddy, the juvenile lyrical approach to topics such as warfare, violence and life on the road gives the album a \\"naive charm\\". The musical approach on Kill 'Em All was in contrast to the glam metal bands who dominated the charts in the early 1980s. Because of its rebellious nature and Metallica's street appearance, it appealed to fans who were not into the mainstream of hard rock. \\"Phantom Lord\\" is a lyrical nod to devilry. The song begins with synthesized bass drone and contains a middle section with clean, arpeggiated guitar chords. Written by Mustaine, its central riff is in NWOBHM fashion. \\"No Remorse\\" is a mid-tempo song which suddenly accelerates its tempo in the fifth minute. The song is about not feeling any remorse or sense of repentance during battle. \\"Seek & Destroy\\" was inspired by Diamond Head's \\"Dead Reckoning\\" and is the first song Metallica recorded during the Kill 'Em All sessions. Hetfield wrote the main riff in his truck outside a Los Angeles sticker factory where he was working. Because of its simple, one-line chorus, the song became a permanent setlist fixture and a crowd singalong. \\"Metal Militia\\", one of the fastest songs on the album, is about heavy metal's way of life and nonconformity.... contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the band that played faster and more accurately on Kill 'Em All?, what is it ?

Article: Women work harder than men at university and get better degrees as a result, according to a study at Brunel University. The research, which followed 200 students for four years, found that women consistently outperformed men in their studies even though they had started their courses with almost identical A-level grades. An analysis of the results showed that while 65 percent of female graduates were awarded, only 35 percent of male graduates did as well. Girls are known to outperform boys at school, but this research showed that trend continued at university. Fiona Smith, who led the research, said, \\"The research shows that the difference has something to do with schools in general.\\" \\"It also shows something about the inequality for working women in terms of pay and promotion. Women work harder at school, harder at university, and do better at both, but they still receive less pay.\\" The research found that female students were more faithful, less likely to miss lectures, and more likely to believe that their marks reflected their abilities than male students. Female students were also more likely to ask for and receive support from their professors. Women were also more likely to choose their universities because they liked the courses offered. In contrast, men were more likely than women to miss lectures due to \\"other affairs\\" and \\"laziness\\", and to believe that playing sports was an important part of university life. Generally, people think that women's success comes from more emphasis on coursework, but the research showed that female geographers at Brunel did better in their exams than in their coursework. Dr Smith said, \\"Most women feel that getting good grades is the most important part of university life. They believe that they need to work harder in order to compete in the male-dominated environment they will encounter at work. Good grades are viewed as an 'insurance policy' for success. Men, on the other hand, prefer going out and playing sports to academic work.\\" \\"This research shows how... Question: Which of the following about men is TRUE according to the passage? Answer: Select from the following. -- They work as hard as women.; -- They spend as much time on courses as women.; -- They play a lot more than women.; -- They consider good grades to be an \\"insurance policy\\" for success.; Answer:","completion":"According to the passage, it is true that \\"They play a lot more than women.\\" The passage explains that men are more likely to miss lectures due to \\"other affairs\\" and \\"laziness\\", and also place higher importance on playing sports as part of their university life. On the other hand, women were found to be more committed to their studies, less likely to miss lectures, and more likely to value their academic performance. This leads to the conclusion that men, compared to women, spend more time in leisure activities such as playing sports."}]`),Y={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:M},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:W,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const i=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return i?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.prompt&&e.prompt.toLowerCase().includes(i)||e.completion&&e.completion.toLowerCase().includes(i)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(i=>setTimeout(i,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},P={class:"search-container"},H={class:"card-container"},j={key:0,class:"empty-state"},q=["disabled"],D={key:0},R={key:1};function E(i,e,h,m,n,s){const p=f("PoemCard");return a(),o("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",P,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>n.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,n.searchQuery]]),n.searchQuery?(a(),o("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>n.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",H,[(a(!0),o(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,g)=>(a(),k(p,{key:g,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),o("div",j,' No results found for "'+d(n.searchQuery)+'".
