A: Answer:","completion":"Step 1: Understand the question In order to answer the question, I need to determine and explain the process that combines genes from two different parents and produces genetically diverse offspring. Step 2: Identify the process The process that combines genes from two different parents is sexual reproduction. Step 3: Determine the mechanism behind the process The mechanism behind sexual reproduction that leads to genetically diverse offspring is the fusion of male and female gametes through a process called fertilization. Step 4: Explain the process In sexual reproduction, organisms produce gametes (sperm and egg cells) that contain half the number of chromosomes as the parent organism. This is achieved through a process called meiosis, which reduces the chromosome number and increases genetic diversity by shuffling the genes. When the male gamete (sperm) fuses with the female gamete (egg) during fertilization, it forms a zygote that contains a complete set of chromosomes from both parents. This results in offspring with genetic diversity, as they inherit a unique combination of genes from both parents.

Which way makes more sense to accomplish this goal? A). take a small knife and cut a slit at the thickest part to get a peak at the inside color. B). take a small knife and cut a slit at the thinnest part to get a peak at the inside color.","completion":"Option A) which involves taking a small knife and cutting a slit at the thickest part of the meat to get a peek at the inside color, generally makes more sense when trying to determine if meat is properly cooked on a charcoal BBQ. This is due to several reasons. First, the thickest part of the meat is the last to get fully cooked. The heat from the BBQ must pass through the outer layers of the meat to reach the centre, so when the thickest part is cooked, it implies that the other, thinner parts are also cooked. Moreover, observing the color at the thickest part gives a more accurate indication of the overall doneness of the meat. Changes that occur as meat cooks, such as browning and changes in texture, happen from the outside in. That’s why the exterior (especially thinner parts) of a piece of meat can look cooked well before the interior is done to the required level. If you cut into the thinnest part (Option B) and it appears cooked, this does not ensure the entire cut of meat has reached a safe internal temperature as the thicker parts might still be undercooked. This could increase the risk of foodborne illnesses, especially when dealing with meat like chicken or pork that can harbor harmful bacteria. However, it's also important to note that repeatedly cutting into your meat while it's cooking will allow juices to escape, potentially resulting in a drier cut. Therefore, a more reliable method of telling if your meat is properly cooked is to use a meat thermometer. Insert it into the thickest part of the meat (without touching the bone if there is one) because this will give you the most accurate reading. For safety, different types of meat should be cooked to different internal temperatures. For example, chicken should reach an internal temperature of 165 degrees Fahrenheit (74 degrees Celsius) while steak and other whole cuts of beef should reach at least 145 degrees Fahrenheit (63 degrees Celsius). And remember, meat will continue to cook a bit after it's taken off the grill due to residual heat, known as carryover cooking. To sum up, while cutting a slit in the thickest part to see the inside color can give you a general indication of doneness, using a meat thermometer to ensure it's reached the correct internal temperature is the most accurate way to ensure your meat is properly cooked on a charcoal BBQ."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

After a Bills three-and-out, the Patriots raced 48 yards in 4 plays, taking just 1:47, scoring on a 29-yard touchdown run by Woodhead. The Bills drove to Patriots 17, but Fitzpatrick was strip-sacked by Guyton with Mayo recovering at th Patriots 20. The Patriots marched 78 yards on 9 plays, scoring on an 8-yard touchdown pass to Rob Gronkowski, increasing the lead to 14-3. The Bills drove all the way to the Patriots 32 on their next drive, but turned the ball over on downs. The Patriots continued to move the ball easily on their next drive, reaching the 16, and Graham kicked a 34-yard field goal, increasing the lead to 17-3. On the fourth play of the Bills next drive, Fitzpatrick was intercepted at the Bills 46 by Chung who returned it 19 yards to the Bills 27. Seven plays later, Brady hit Alge Crumpler on a 4-yard touchdown pass, widening their lead to 24-3 at halftime. After a Patriots three-and-out, Fitzpatrick was intercepted by Page at the Bills 21. A chop block penalty on Chad Reinhart moved the ball to the Bills 11. Four plays later, Brady hit Gronkowski on an 8-yard touchdown pass, making the score 31-3.

Today he is seeing two patients, patient A and patient B. He noticed that patient A's blood vessels are constricted, but blood vessels of patient B are dilated. He needs to prescribe medicine according to his observation. and a hint : Blood vessels help regulate body processes by either constricting (becoming narrower) or dilating (becoming wider). These actions occur in response to signals from the autonomic nervous system or the endocrine system. Constriction occurs when the muscular walls of blood vessels contract. This reduces the amount of blood that can flow through the vessels (see Figure below ). Dilation occurs when the walls relax. This increases blood flows through the vessels. Please answer this question : Would patient B's blood vessels be narrower or wider than patient A's? Answer:","completion":"Based on the given information, patient B's blood vessels would be wider than patient A's. This is because patient A has constricted blood vessels, meaning the muscular walls of their blood vessels have contracted, causing a reduced diameter and subsequently limiting the flow of blood through these vessels. On the other hand, patient B has dilated blood vessels, indicating that the walls of their blood vessels have relaxed. As a result, the diameter of patient B's blood vessels is increased, allowing for greater blood flow. To elaborate, blood vessels play a crucial role in regulating various body processes, including blood flow and blood pressure. The autonomic nervous system and the endocrine system send signals to control the constriction and dilation of blood vessels. When blood vessels constrict, they become narrower, which can lead to increased blood pressure and reduced flow of blood, potentially affecting the delivery of oxygen and nutrients to the body's tissues. Conversely, when blood vessels dilate or widen, they facilitate better blood flow, thus improving oxygen and nutrient delivery while potentially lowering blood pressure. In this scenario, Greg needs to prescribe medication based on his patients' conditions. For patient A with constricted blood vessels, the appropriate treatment may involve medications that encourage blood vessel dilation or relaxation, such as vasodilators or certain calcium channel blockers. This would increase blood flow and potentially alleviate constriction-related issues. For patient B, who has dilated blood vessels, treatment may depend on the underlying cause of the dilation. If the dilation is causing low blood pressure or other medical concerns, medications that promote vasoconstriction or increase blood pressure, such as alpha-adrenergic agonists or pressors, might be required. However, it is essential for Greg to carefully assess the patients' overall health and medical history before prescribing any medications."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Ryan Zinke to lead the Interior Department, according to a transition official, tapping a freshman Republican congressman who, like the president-elect, is often at odds with environmentalists but has opposed efforts to sell federal lands to states. If confirmed by the Senate, the former U.S. Navy SEAL would lead Mr. Trump’s efforts to open federal lands and waters to fossil-fuel development and reverse environmental policies the Obama administration has pursued over the past... ||||| WASHINGTON (AP) — President-elect Donald Trump has offered Montana Rep. Ryan Zinke the job of interior secretary, though it's unclear whether the congressman has accepted, two people with knowledge of the offer said Tuesday. Zinke, 55, is a retired Navy SEAL who was awarded two Bronze Stars for combat missions in Iraq. He was an early supporter of Trump and met with the president-elect Monday at Trump Tower in Manhattan. He just won re-election to a second term as Montana's only House member, and Republicans had mentioned him as a possible challenger to two-term Democratic Sen. Jon Tester in 2018. Trump was also said to be considering Washington Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers for the job. She wrote on Facebook Tuesday that it was an \\"honor\\" to be invited to meet with Trump. The people with knowledge of the offer to Zinke insisted on anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the transition process publicly. Zinke, who serves on House Natural Resources and Armed Services committees, describes himself as \\"a steadfast advocate for Montana veterans and military personnel and families.\\" He advocates greater use of public lands for energy production such as oil and natural gas. Zinke has prioritized development of oil, gas and other resources on public lands and has advocated for state control of energy development on federal lands, a stance that some environmental groups say threatens national parks. Zinke has voted against efforts to designate new national parks that would diversify the National Park System. Zinke attracted attention in the 2014 campaign for calling Hillary Clinton \\"the antichrist.\\" \\"Do I really believe that she is the antichrist? That answer would be 'no,'\\" Zinke said in an interview with The Associated Press. \\"But I do get a little emotional about Benghazi, and I like the rest of America want answers.\\" In September 2012, when Clinton was secretary of state, the U.S. ambassador to Libya and three other Americans were killed in the eastern city of Benghazi when militants stormed a U.S. diplomatic post and, hours later, fired on a CIA compound nearby. Some Republicans argue the U.S. military held back assets that could have saved lives and believe President Barack Obama and Clinton lied to the public about the nature of the attack. Before being elected to Congress, Zinke served in the Montana State Senate, where he chaired the Education Committee and focused on advancing technology in the classroom, rural access to education and local control over schools. Zinke graduated from the University of Oregon, where he played football and earned a degree in geology. He has master's degrees in business finance and global leadership from the University of San Diego. Interior manages the nation's public lands and minerals and is the steward of 20 percent of the nation's lands, including national parks, national wildlife refuges and other public lands. The department also supplies and manages water in the 17 Western states and upholds federal trust responsibilities to 566 federally recognized Indian tribes and Alaska Natives. Zinke has raised doubts about climate change as \\"unsettled science.\\" Yet he's also said in interviews that \\"something's going on\\" with the climate and promoted an energy strategy that includes renewable sources such as wind and solar would be prudent. His home state boasts the largest coal reserves in the nation, although it trails far behind neighboring Wyoming in mining productivity. Zinke was one of many Western Republicans who criticized the Obama administration's imposition of a January moratorium on new coal sales from public lands. During his re-election campaign, Democrats attempted to label Zinke as a radical conservative who would sell off federal lands to private interests or transfer them to state control. Zinke adamantly denied the charge, which was based on a pledge Democrats alleged he had signed in 2012 stating that Montana's lands were sovereign and not subject to federal control. Zinke has said he doesn't remember signing the pledge. He has instead cast himself as a protector of the public's right to access public lands and made a priority in Congress of trying to fix problems with the management of the nation's forests. During his re-election campaign, he focused largely on national security issues and the need to more thoroughly vet refugees, arguing that terrorism was threatening the homeland and that his more than two decades as a SEAL gave him an advantage on the issue. ___ Associated Press writers Matthew Daly in Washington and Matthew Brown in Billings, Montana, contributed to this report. ||||| WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President-elect Donald Trump has chosen first-term Republican U.S. Representative Ryan Zinke of Montana, a former Navy SEAL commander, as his interior secretary, a senior transition official said on Tuesday. U.S. Representative Ryan Zinke (R-MT) arrives for a meeting with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump at Trump Tower in Manhattan, New York City, U.S., December 12, 2016. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid Zinke, 55, will be nominated to head the Interior Department, which employs more than 70,000 people across the United States and oversees more than 20 percent of federal land, including national parks like Yellowstone and Yosemite. Zinke’s choice was something of a surprise since some Republican officials wanted him to challenge Democratic U.S. Senator Jon Tester of Montana in the 2018 elections. Zinke emerged after Trump had toyed with the idea of nominating U.S. Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington state for the position. He is a proponent of keeping public lands under federal ownership, putting him at odds with some in his Republican Party who are more favorable to privatization or placing them under the control of states. It remains unclear where Zinke would stand on opening up more federal lands to increased drilling and mining, something Trump promised he would do as president. Trump’s official energy platform calls for opening “onshore and offshore leasing on federal lands, eliminate moratorium on coal leasing, and open shale energy deposits.” A Trump aide told Reuters last week that McMorris Rodgers had been picked for the post. She had met Trump at his golf resort in Bedminster, New Jersey, shortly after the president-elect began his Cabinet search. On Tuesday, a source close to the congresswoman said she had never been offered the job. “It was an honor to be invited to spend time with the president-elect, and I’m energized more than ever to continue leading in Congress as we think big, reimagine this government, and put people back at the center of it,” McMorris Rodgers said in a Facebook post. Zinke had been an early Trump supporter, backing the New York businessman for president in May. His nomination must now be confirmed by the Republican-controlled Senate. “Congressman Zinke is a strong advocate for American energy independence, and he supports an all-encompassing energy policy that includes renewables, fossil fuels and alternative energy,” Trump spokesman Jason Miller said before a meeting on Monday between Zinke and Trump at Trump Tower in New York. Zinke, a member of the House of Representatives subcommittee on natural resources, has voted for legislation that would weaken environmental safeguards on public land. But, unlike other candidates who were on the short list for the interior secretary job, Zinke opposes the transfer of public lands to the states, a position that echoes Trump’s. PUBLIC LANDS Trump has said he does not think public land should be turned over to the states and should be protected. “I don’t like the idea because I want to keep the lands great, and you don’t know what the state is going to do,” Trump said in an interview with Field & Stream magazine in January. Trump said putting states in control of public land would make it easier to sell it off for energy or commercial development. He thinks the federal government needs to focus on conservation. “I mean, are they going to sell (states) if they get into a little bit of trouble? I don’t think it’s something that should be sold,” he said. “We have to be great stewards of this land. This is magnificent land.” In July, Zinke resigned as a delegate to the Republican nominating convention because the party platform called for transferring public lands to the states. “What I saw was a platform that was more divisive than uniting,” Zinke told the Billings Gazette. “At this point, I think it’s better to show leadership.” Public land comprises more than 30 percent of Montana, according to the Montana Wilderness Association. The League of Conservation Voters, which ranks lawmakers on their environmental record, gave Zinke an extremely low lifetime score of 3 percent. The Wilderness Society, a leading conservation group, said it was concerned by Zinke’s support for logging, drilling and mining on public lands. The Interior Department also oversees the Bureau of Indian Affairs and handles tribal policy. Under Obama, the department played a big role in efforts to curb the effects of climate change by limiting fossil fuel development in some areas. ||||| Summary:","completion":"President-elect Donald Trump has chosen Montana Republican representative Ryan Zinke as his interior secretary.

The Jets pulled ahead with RB Shonn Greene getting a 3-yard TD run, followed by CB Dwight Lowery returning an interception 20 yards for a touchdown, followed by RB LaDainian Tomlinson getting a 3-yard TD run letting the Jets lead 21-10. The lead was narrowed as QB Jay Cutler scrambled 2 yards for a touchdown, but was soon extended as kicker Nick Folk made a 26-yard field goal. They trailed again with Cutler completing a 40 and a 25-yard TD pass to wide receivers Devin Hester and Johnny Knox respectively, but soon were able to tie the game with QB Mark Sanchez throwing a 23-yard TD pass to WR Santonio Holmes. The Bears escaped the tie with Cutler finding Knox again on a 26-yard TD pass. The Jets tried to come back, but only came away with a 34-yard field goal from Folk. When the Jets got the ball back, Sanchez threw a pass intended for Holmes, only to be intercepted by safety Chris Harris with 0:58 to go. With the loss, the Jets fell to 10-5, but clinched a playoff berth when the Jaguars lost to the Redskins..

American Apparel Inc., the made-in-the-U.S.A. clothing chain known for provocative marketing and boardroom drama, filed for bankruptcy protection after years of losses and a feud with controversial founder Dov Charney. As part of a prearranged Chapter 11 restructuring, the Los Angeles-based company will reorganize its debts, which have ballooned to levels exceeding its assets. More than 200 million of bonds will be exchanged for stock in the reorganized company, according to a statement on Monday. American Apparel will remain in business during the process. Filing for bankruptcy is a “difficult decision that gives American Apparel the opportunity to rebuild the business,” said Bryan Roberts, an analyst with Kantar Retail. “Quite a few U.S. retailers have gone down this route and come out the other side.” Travel with us, drive with us, eat with us. Get our weekly Pursuits newsletter. The move follows a clash between Charney and the board that led to his ouster last year for alleged misconduct -- claims he says are baseless -- but American Apparel’s financial woes stretch back longer. The chain has posted deficits every year since 2010. Chronic losses strained its balance sheet to the point that, as of end of June, American Apparel had 161 million more liabilities than assets, meaning the company had a negative book value.

Photographer: Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images Sufficient Financing As part of the bankruptcy agreement, American Apparel will have access to financing after the restructuring, according to the statement. The debt reorganization may last about six months. Under the accord, creditors will supply enough financing and new capital to fund continuing operations and reduce American Apparel’s debt to no more than 135 million from 300 million. That will help lower annual interest expenses by 20 million, the company said. The plan was supported by 95 percent of secured lenders. “By improving our financial footing, we will be able to refocus our business efforts on the execution of our turnaround strategy,” Chief Executive Officer Paula Schneider said in the statement. The company plans to create new products, introduce new design initiatives, invest in new stores and expand its e-commerce business, she said. American Apparel expects to pay all its suppliers in full, and its international operations aren’t affected by the bankruptcy. The restructuring plan is subject to approval by the bankruptcy court and must meet other certain conditions, it said. Shares Peaked The company, which began trading publicly in 2007, peaked at 16.80 in December of that year. The shares closed at 11 cents on Friday. Dov Charney, former chairman and chief executive officer of American Apparel Inc., stands for a portrait in a company retail store in New York in 2010. Photographer: Keith Bedford/Bloomberg In court papers, the company listed 199.3 million in assets and 397.5 million in debt. Among its largest unsecured creditors listed in court papers were lender Standard General LP of New York, owed 15 million, and the law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP, owed 3.83 million. Charney fought to get his job back and teamed up with Standard General to build up his stake in the company. He later said the investment firm betrayed him. Standard General had pledged to help restore his position in American Apparel but instead he was terminated, the ex-CEO said in a Bloomberg Television interview last December. Charney also said at the time that he had only 100,000 to his name. Sales Decline A Montreal native, Charney started American Apparel in 1989 during his freshman year at Tufts University in Massachusetts. He never graduated, setting off instead for South Carolina, where he employed 20 women to make T-shirts in a barn with no air conditioning. Ten years later he moved the company to Los Angeles, where there was greater manufacturing capacity. The company designs and makes “basic fashion” for women, men, children and even pets. It employs about 8,500 people and has about 230 stores worldwide, according to a court filing. Sales fell in December, a key month for retailers, as Charney said the botched rollout of a new distribution center slowed shipments. The brand also lost favor with some teens and 20-somethings, who shifted to chains such as H&M, Forever 21 and Uniqlo, said Craig Johnson, president of Customer Growth Partners, a New Canaan, Connecticut-based consulting firm. In the second quarter, sales sank 17 percent to 134.4 million and the net loss expanded to 19.4 million from 16.2 million, the company said in August. Young Models Charney, 46, drew attention for his use of young, scantily clad models in ads for his company’s U.S.-made garments. He also attracted litigation and scrutiny from regulators for his employment practices. A company investigation uncovered a history of misconduct that ranged from mistreatment of employees to misuse of corporate funds, a person familiar with the matter said. The turbulence at the top means the company has “arguably not had a firm hand on the tiller,” Roberts said. American Apparel “is the largest apparel manufacturer in North America,” Mark Weinsten, chief restructuring officer, said in a declaration. Its T-shirts bear messages on immigrants’ rights, sweatshop conditions and sexual orientation, among other topics. The company lost more than 30 million between 2009 and 2014, struggling with the need for liquidity, he said. The case is In re American Apparel Inc., 15-12055, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, District of Delaware. (Earlier versions of this story were corrected to fix references to Schneider’s gender, Charney’s age and the year the company was founded.) ||||| A 13.9 million interest payment due on Oct. 15 had loomed large on the horizon; as of mid-August, American Apparel had just over 11 million in cash on hand. The shortfall prompted the company itself to warn it may not have enough capital to cover its costs over the next year. Under the financing agreement, five American Apparel bondholders would convert some 200 million in bonds into equity in the reorganized company. Participating bondholders would also provide 90 million in debtor-in-possession financing, as well as 70 million in new liquidity. The fresh financing would reduce American Apparel’s debt to 120 million from 311 million, and its annual interest expenses would fall by 24 million, the company said. The participating bondholders are Standard General, Monarch Alternative Capital, Coliseum Capital, Goldman Sachs Asset Management and Pentwater Capital Management, all hedge funds or investment firms specializing in distressed debt. Together, they represent 95 percent of the retailer’s secured lenders. Bankruptcy proceedings would also temporarily delay numerous lawsuits against the company, giving its management some breathing room to get the company’s financial house in order. The retailer had been in the middle of a turnaround plan that included freshening up its product lineup, overhauling its supply chain and reining in American Apparel’s notoriously risqué advertising. Paula Schneider, a longtime retail executive brought in last year to salvage American Apparel’s ailing operations, is expected to stay on as chief executive through the bankruptcy proceedings. In an interview on Sunday, Ms. Schneider said that free of its crippling debt and interest payments, American Apparel could finally put that turnaround plan into action. The retailer was able to bring to the store only 15 to 20 percent of its planned lineup for the fall season, because it could not afford to do more, she said. “Our debt load simply wasn’t sustainable. You can’t do a turnaround plan without cash,” Ms. Schneider said. “Every day, we would make choices on what we were going to buy, even though we needed more for everyone. Every day, I have to pick between what I’m buying for retail or wholesale, or giving e-commerce enough money to develop a mobile app,” she said. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","completion":"American Apparel Inc., known for its provocative marketing and U.S.-based manufacturing, filed for bankruptcy after years of losses and controversy with founder Dov Charney.

Despite the bankruptcy announcement, American Apparel will continue its business operations and expects to retain access to financing post-restructuring. The bankruptcy serves as an opportunity to revive the brand, similar to other U.S. retailers who have successfully emerged from bankruptcy. Moreover, creditors will provide sufficient funding to reduce American Apparel's debt from 300 million to no more than 135 million and lower annual interest expenses by 20 million, thus improving the company's financial position for future growth."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In this case, the country with the most coastline is Canada. Canada has the longest coastline of any country in the world, stretching approximately 202,080 kilometers (125,567 miles). This extensive coastline can be attributed to its vast size and numerous islands, as well as its location bordering three major oceans - the Atlantic, Arctic, and Pacific Oceans. The coastline plays a significant role in Canada's economy and diverse ecosystems. The coastal regions are inhabited by various marine species, plants, and endangered animals. Also, fishing, aquaculture, tourism, and international trade are some of the vital economic activities that depend on these natural resources. It is important to note that the measurement of a coastline can be imprecise, as it involves various factors, such as the scale of the map used and the level of detail in considering the inlets and bays. Consequently, different sources may provide slightly varying figures for the length of Canada's coastline. However, it remains widely accepted that Canada has the longest coastline globally. In summary, the answer to the question, \\"What country has the most coastline?\\" is Canada, which can be categorized as an entity representing a location."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: Plan International UK claims 75% of people think the impact of porn should be a compulsory part of the curriculum, while 7% oppose the move. In its survey of 2,000 adults it said 71% of people wanted pupils to get lessons on sexting. Education Secretary Justine Greening said she was looking at the issue, but a law change has not yet been proposed. Plan International UK's chief executive, Tanya Barron, called for \\"children's education to reflect the 21st Century reality of their lives\\". Currently, all secondary schools in England under local authority control have to teach sex education as part of the science curriculum but this is limited to the biological aspects of reproduction and does not cover relationships. But a loophole means academies and free schools - which are controlled by central government rather than local authorities - do not have to follow the national curriculum and are not, therefore, obliged to teach the subject. Sex education is also taught at most secondary schools in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, where there are separate education guidelines. Parents can opt to take their children out of these classes. Ms Barron said children were exposed to sexual imagery on a \\"daily basis\\". \\"Children themselves, girls in particular, are telling us that they feel they need improved, age-appropriate mandatory sex and relationships education,\\" she said. \\"This would help them navigate these difficult issues.\\" Plan UK's poll of UK adults, carried out by Opinium, also found that: The findings come amid growing pressure for sex education to be compulsory in schools. The Local Government Association warned that pupils in England's schools were at risk of contracting sexually transmitted infections when they reached adulthood, because they were not being properly prepared. Labour has also called for compulsory age-appropriate sex education in all schools in England, claiming that sexting among under-16s is on the rise. Conservative MP Maria Miller, who has also backed a change in policy, added that most children will already have seen online pornography by the time they leave primary school. \\"I want compulsory lessons at school to help children better understand the signs of an abusive relationship, issues such as consent and the harm that is done by sexting and underage viewing of pornography,\\" she said. Last year, a parliamentary inquiry said there were \\"alarming inconsistencies\\" in the way schools deal with sexual harassment and violence. The cross-party Women and Equalities Committee said in its report last September that compulsory sex education would \\"help to significantly reduce the incidence of sexual harassment and sexual violence in schools\\".","completion":"A recent survey conducted by Plan International UK found that 75% of respondents believe the impact of pornography should be a compulsory part of sex education in schools, whilst 71% said students should receive lessons about sexting.

After you have some staples you can begin to add with more clothing and accessories that fit your style. Don’t waste money or time on items that you don’t like and donate your old clothes when you get new ones. If you like a more preppy look, and wear more button-downs, add a tie to your wardrobe. While a clean pair of sneakers is great for pairing with sweaters, button-downs, and even a blazer, consider ditching your old dirty pair. Or, upgrade your shoes to casual leather loafers or a pair of brown dress shoes. If you’re always running late to class it might be time to accessorize with a watch. Not only will it keep you punctual, but it adds a bit of class to your look. Dressing classy as a college guy means putting in the effort to look put together, even at that 8:00 am class. Sweatpants and a zipped-up hoodie should be worn at home or the gym. If you love your sweats or the athletic look, you can class it up with little effort. Invest in a pair of joggers or slim structured sweatpants which taper around the ankle. Swap your worn out zip-up hoodie for a solid-colored crew neck sweatshirt or sweater. You can also play with layers. Wear your sweatshirt over a collared shirt. Dressing well will make you feel good, keep your mind sharp, and give you confidence. So dress for the job you want to give you a head start. If you plan on going into a career that is more traditional you will probably be wearing a suit or an outfit that’s close at the office. Invest in a suit and some dress shirts. Being prepared will not only help you think like a man with the job but could benefit you with potential interviews and even your professors. Shower before class and think about how your professors see you. When it’s time to start networking and looking for work these are some people who you may need help from. Wearing a polo instead of a t-shirt and nice jeans or chinos instead of sweats shows you’re responsible and respectful. You can really class up your style with two leather belts. You don’t need to spend a lot of money either, but one brown and one black leather belt should be all you need. Depending on your personal style, feel free to get more belts that go well with a certain season or occasion. A colored leather belt can be a statement piece when you’re going for a casual look.

This meant I was slowly “leaking” blood into the area between my abdominal cavity lining and my skin. I was kept in the hospital for two weeks and every day the same nurse would come along and open the end of the incision in my skin to relieve the pressure caused by the pooling of my blood. That was fine for the first five days, but the weekend came and she was off duty. Apparently, nobody else knew what to do. By Monday morning, I was in agony and when she arrived, she was appalled I had not been drained during the weekend. The other thing that happened during the weekend was the end of the skin incision, which she had opened, had mostly healed meaning there was no convenient hole for the blood to be drained. The nurse used a sharp pair of scissors to reopen one end of the partly-healed incision, but still the blood would not simply drain of its own accord. She used both hands to squeeze downwards onto the swollen blood reservoir. At first, there was no reaction except agonizing pain, but after a few seconds and a very hard squeeze, the stinking, coagulated blood jetted out of the hole she’d made squirting across the ceiling, down the wall and down her full-length coating her face and the front of her uniform. Despite the pain, I couldn’t keep myself from laughing loud and long. She then dressed the wound, directed some junior nurses to clean the ceiling and the wall while she went to clean herself.

Answer the above question based on the context below: The party turned for home after 73 days' southward travel. Rations had been cut several times to extend the return journey time beyond the original 110-day estimate. Shackleton now aimed to reach Hut Point in 50 days, since according to Shackleton's prior orders Nimrod, having returned to take the expedition home, would depart on 1 March at the latest. The four men were now much weakened, yet in the following days they achieved impressive distances, reaching the head of the glacier on 19 January. As they began the descent they had five days' food at half rations, to last them until the Lower Glacier depot; during the ascent the same distance had taken 12 days. Shackleton's physical condition was by now a major concern, yet according to Adams \\"the worse he felt, the harder he pulled\\".The depot was reached on 28 January. Wild, ill with dysentery, was unable to pull or to eat anything but biscuits, which were in short supply. On 31 January Shackleton forced his own breakfast biscuit on Wild, a gesture that moved Wild to write: \\"BY GOD I shall never forget. Thousands of pounds would not have bought that one biscuit\\". A few days later, the rest of the party were struck with severe enteritis, the result of eating tainted pony-meat. But the pace of march had to be maintained; the small amounts of food carried between depots would make any delay fatal. However, a strong wind behind them enabled them to set a sail on the sledge and maintain a good marching rate. \\"We are so thin that our bones ache as we lie on the hard snow\\", wrote Shackleton.

Transcript: The Bulls And The Bears Steve Forbes: What are some of the specific characteristics you look for in value investing? Do you try to size up a management? Do you look at cash flows? What kind of metrics do you use that you find particularly helpful? EBIT I don't think is one of them. Jean-Marie Eveillard (Senior Adviser, First Eagle Funds): No, it is not one of them. Although we are partial in terms of valuations to enterprise value to EBIT, because enterprise value introduces a balance sheet, which price-earnings ratio does not. And EBIT admittedly--earnings before interest and taxes--interest and taxes have to be paid, but to the extent that not always, but most of the time, we buy the stocks of companies that are financially safe, as Marty Whitman puts is, and where there is very little or no debt, then there is no interest expense. And as far as taxes go, I've always been somewhat suspicious--well, except in countries such as Hong Kong, where the corporate rate, your official corporate rate is very low. Otherwise, I'd be somewhat suspicious of companies where the tax rate is lowered. I figure that either they're cheating the tax authorities and maybe the authorities would catch up with them, or they're overstating their profits. Follow Intelligent Investing On Twitter.

Bruce Berkowitz (Founder, CIO & COO, Fairholme Capital Management): Well the one key characteristic is cash. We basically count the cash that a company generates because, after all, what else can you spend? And frankly, I mean, investing, whether you call it value investing, whatever type of investing, is all about comparing what you give vs. what you're gonna get over time. So you give the cash to purchase the investment and then it's our job to estimate how much that investment's going to pay us back over time in cash. Forbes: So you're looking for distressed merchandise that has a huge cash flow. Berkowitz: That's what we're looking for, free cash flow. I think Benjamin Graham called that \\"owner earnings.\\" Yes, what can be given to the owners of the company. I know that's a concept a lot of people aren't using these days, especially management. But yes, we're looking to see what the shareholders will receive over time. Forbes: So how would you describe your investment approach? You have several newsletters. You've got a new mutual fund. Do you have various classes, various approaches, or what's your brand? Tom Gardner (Co-Founder & CEO, The Motley Fool): Well, I think probably more than anything else, it's fundamental analysis. We're not interested in stock price movements over a weekly or quarterly basis. We're really looking at the business and trying to evaluate it. We probably spend more time on the strength of the business than the value of the stock, although both are obviously quite important. And we have a number of different approaches at The Motley Fool. I mean, for example, my brother is a little bit more of a VC-type investor. He's happy to have six or seven disappointments in order to have a company like Marvel Entertainment ( MVL - news - people ) show up in his portfolio and go up 15 times in value. I, on the other hand, like to look at the stock market as an auction market. I like to look for unknown companies that aren't very closely followed. An investor that I really admire, Walter Schloss, did a similar thing. Just going out and seeing merchandise that nobody is paying attention to, bidding on it when there aren't many bidders and letting the company succeed over a number of years. So I spend a lot of time looking at the ownership, how much stock is owned by the CEO, how long has he or she been with the business, and I think we, right now, live in a marketplace where there's such a short-term focus, even after what's happened. And I think if people learned to look at businesses over 10, 15, 20 years, they'd find people like Jim Sinegal at Costco Wholesale ( COST - news - people ). They'd find the Walton family at Wal-Mart Stores ( WMT - news - people ). They'd find Buffett at Berkshire, Gates at Microsoft ( MSFT - news - people ), Jeff Bezos at Amazon.com ( AMZN - news - people ). People who give their life to their company is what I'm looking for, not public companies that have a new CEO every three to five years.

You can find resources online, in your local library, or in your local bookstore. Let them know that you’re there for them and want to them to take the time to get better. In some cases, they may be managing or dealing with their symptoms throughout their entire life, with frequent relapses. Let them know that you will be there for them. Talk to their doctor and/or social worker, when appropriate. Tell your loved one that you’d like to help with their treatment plan, if they feel comfortable. You could say, “I love you and want you to feel better. If you feel comfortable, I’m happy to read over your treatment plan and help in any way I can.” It will likely be necessary for you to confront issues at times. When you must address a problem, always frame it using “I” rather than “you” statements. This makes your comments about you, not them. For example, “I feel threatened when you throw things in frustration. I would feel safer if you worked with your therapist to reduce those urges.” Don’t say, “You always throw stuff and scare me! You need to stop!” Many patients spend their whole lives managing their illness. Even with treatment, they may still experience symptoms. Don’t push them to “act normal” or take on responsibilities. This could cause conflict in the relationship, lead to a setback or worse, both. Sharing your experiences with people in a similar situation can help you cope better. Not only will they listen to you, they may also have helpful advice. You may also be able to learn more about your loved one's condition. Ask the doctor or treatment facility for a recommendation. Call local mental health centers to look for groups, or search online. For example, you may be able to join a local chapter of the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI).

However, it would be wrong to dismiss the long history of the region itself. Archaeologists today are working to uncover Hong Kong's past, which stretches back thousands of years. You can get a glimpse into that past at Lei Cheng Uk Museum's 1,600-year-old burial vault on the mainland just north of Kowloon. In 1992, when construction of the airport on Chek Lap Kok was begun, a 2,000-year-old village, Pak Mong, was discovered, complete with artifacts that indicated a sophisticated rural society. An even older Stone Age site was discovered on Lamma Island in 1996. While Hong Kong remained a relative backwater in early days, nearby Guangzhou (Canton) was developing into a great trading city with connections in India and the Middle East. By a.d. 900, the Hong Kong islands had become a lair for pirates preying on the shipping in the Pearl River Delta and causing a major headache for burgeoning Guangzhou; small bands of pirates were still operating into the early years of the 20th century. In the meantime, the mainland area was being settled by incomers, the \\"Five Great Clans\\": Tang, Hau, Pang, Liu, and Man. First to arrive was the Tang clan, which established a number of walled villages in the New Territories that still exist today. You can visit Kat Hing Wai and Lo Wai, villages with their walls still intact. Adjacent to Lo Wai is the Tang Chung Ling Ancestral Hall, built in the 16th century, which is still the center of clan activities. The first Europeans to arrive in the Pearl River Delta were the Portuguese, who settled in Macau in 1557 and for several centuries had a monopoly on trade between Asia, Europe, and South America. As Macau developed into the greatest port in the East, it also became a base for Jesuit missionaries; it was later a haven for persecuted Japanese Christians. While Christianity was not a great success in China, it made local headway, evidenced today by the numerous Catholic churches in Macau's historic center. Intermarriage with the local Chinese created a community of Macanese, whose culture can still be seen in Macau's architecture and cuisine.

John was studying about the history of Sahara desert. He was amazed to find that ten thousand years ago there were plenty of rainfall in that region. He labeled that era as era A. Then he found that rainfall deceased in the region about eight thousand years ago. He labeled that era as era B. He was wondering how that change in rainfall might have helped emerge the Egyptian civilization. Would era B see less or more rocks with chemical reactions than era A? Hint: Rainfall in an area is important because it influences the rate of weathering. More rain means that more rainwater passes through the soil. The rainwater reacts chemically with the particles. The top layers of soil are in contact with the freshest water, so reactions are greatest there. High rainfall increases the amount of rock that experiences chemical reactions. High rainfall may also carry material away. This means that new surfaces are exposed. This increases the rate of weathering. The answer to this question is:","completion":"Era B, the period with decreased rainfall, would likely see less rocks with chemical reactions than Era A, which experienced substantially more rainfall. To understand the reasons behind this, it's essential to examine the difference in circumstances between the two eras. In Era A, the Sahara Desert received an ample amount of rainfall, leading to increased rates of weathering. The rainwater helped break down rocks by reacting chemically with the rock material and facilitating the dissolution of certain minerals. Moreover, as more rainwater permeated through the soil, the top layers experienced heightened chemical reactions. The high rainfall during Era A also supported a continuous process of material erosion, leading to new surfaces being exposed. This, in turn, boosted the overall rate of weathering, which is the breakdown of rocks influenced by factors such as water, wind, and temperature changes. As a result, Era A would have had a significantly higher number of rocks experiencing chemical reactions due to the higher rainfall and the consequent weathering. In contrast, Era B saw a reduction in rainfall across the Sahara region. With less rain and moisture available, the rates of chemical reactions and weathering experienced by rocks would also decrease. As less water passed through the soil, the top layers did not undergo as many chemical reactions as they did during Era A. Additionally, the decrease in rainfall would lead to less material being carried away, resulting in fewer newly exposed surfaces. Consequently, Era B would have a lesser number of rocks experiencing chemical reactions compared to Era A. In the context of the emergence of the Egyptian civilization, the transition from Era A to Era B had a significant impact on the region's landscape and environmental conditions. As rainfall decreased, the previously lush and green Sahara Desert transformed into a more arid environment. The shift might have pushed human populations toward the Nile River, searching for reliable water sources and fertile land for agriculture. This movement could have facilitated the establishment and development of highly organized agrarian communities, which eventually led to the emergence of the Egyptian civilization. In conclusion, the decreased rainfall during Era B would have resulted in fewer rocks experiencing chemical reactions compared to the high-rainfall Era A. This change in weather patterns and environmental conditions significantly impacted the region's landscape and possibly influenced the development and growth of ancient Egyptian civilization."},{"prompt":"- The waves contain sediment from the ocean - The water and particles in it hit rocks and sand on the beach - The wind and current sometimes push the water and particles harder - Tiny parts of the rocks on the shore come off the larger rocks - The waves pick up sand and small rocks from the beach - The waves go back out into the ocean - The waves carry the new particles with them - Rocks and the beach look a little different.

Given the question: Information: - The Southern United States, commonly referred to as the American South, Dixie, or simply the South, is a region of the United States of America. The South does not exactly match the geographic south, but is predominantly located in the southeastern corner; Arizona and New Mexico, which are geographically in the southern part of the country, are rarely considered part of the Southern United States, while West Virginia, which separated from Virginia in 1863, commonly is. Some scholars have proposed definitions of the South that do not coincide neatly with state boundaries. While the states of Delaware and Maryland, as well as the District of Columbia permitted slavery prior to the start of the Civil War, they remained with the Union. Since the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s, they became more culturally, economically, and politically aligned with the industrial Northern states, and are often identified as part of the Mid-Atlantic and/or Northeast by many residents, businesses, public institutions, and private organizations. However, the United States Census Bureau puts them in the South. - KZZL - FM ( 99.5 FM ) is a radio station broadcasting a country music format . Licensed to Pullman , Washington , USA , the station is currently owned by Inland Northwest Broadcasting , LLC and features programming from Premiere Radio Networks and Dial Global . - The banjo is a four-, five- or six-stringed instrument with a thin membrane stretched over a frame or cavity as a resonator, called the head. The membrane, or head, is typically made of plastic, although animal skin is still occasionally but rarely used, and the frame is typically circular. Early forms of the instrument were fashioned by Africans in America, adapted from African instruments of similar design. - Country music is a genre of United States popular music that originated in the southern United States in the 1920s. It takes its roots from the southeastern genre of United States, such as folk music (especially Appalachian folk music), and blues music. Blues modes have been used extensively throughout its recorded history. Country music often consists of ballads and dance tunes with generally simple forms and harmonies accompanied by mostly string instruments such as banjos, electric and acoustic guitars, dobros and fiddles as well as harmonicas. According to Lindsey Starnes, the term \\"country music\\" gained popularity in the 1940s in preference to the earlier term \\"hillbilly music\\"; it came to encompass Western music, which evolved parallel to hillbilly music from similar roots, in the mid-20th century. The term \\"country music\\" is used today to describe many styles and subgenres. The origins of country music are the folk music of working-class Americans, who blended popular songs, Irish and Celtic fiddle tunes, traditional English ballads, and cowboy songs, and various musical traditions from European immigrant communities. In 2009 country music was the most listened to rush hour radio genre during the evening commute, and second most popular in the morning commute in the United States. - The word Dobro is, in popular usage, the generic term for a wood-bodied, single cone resonator guitar. It is also an American brand of resonator guitar, currently owned by the Gibson Guitar Corporation. The Dobro was originally made by the Dopyera brothers when they formed the Dobro Manufacturing Company. Their design, with a single inverted resonator, was introduced in competition to the patented Tricone and biscuit designs produced by the National String Instrument Corporation. The Dobro name appeared on other instruments, notably electric lap steel guitars and solid body electric guitars and on other resonator instruments such as Safari resonator mandolins. - Appalachia is a cultural region in the Eastern United States that stretches from the Southern Tier of New York to northern Alabama, Mississippi and Georgia. While the Appalachian Mountains stretch from Belle Isle (Newfoundland and Labrador) in Canada to Cheaha Mountain in Alabama, the cultural region of Appalachia typically refers only to the central and southern portions of the range. As of the 2010 United States Census, the region was home to approximately 25 million people. - Recorded history or written history is a historical narrative based on a written record or other documented communication. Recorded history can be contrasted with other narratives of the past, such as mythological, oral or archeological traditions. - Fiddle is another name for the bowed string musical instrument more often called a violin. It is also a colloquial term for the instrument used by players in all genres, including classical music. Fiddle playing, or fiddling, refers to various styles of music. Fiddle is also a common term among musicians who play folk music on the violin. The fiddle is part of many traditional (folk) styles of music which are aural traditions, taught 'by ear' rather than via written music. Fiddle is normally the term used for Irish Traditional Music. - Hillbilly is a term (often derogatory) for people who dwell in rural, mountainous areas in the United States, primarily in Appalachia and the Ozarks, Uwharrie Mountains, and Caraway Mountains. Due to its strongly stereotypical connotations, the term can be offensive to those Americans of Appalachian or Ozark heritage. The first known instances of \\"Hillbilly\\" in print were in \\"The Railroad Trainmen's Journal\\" (vol. ix, July 1892), a 1899 photograph of men and women in West Virginia labeled \\"Camp Hillbilly\\" andin a 1900 \\"New York Journal\\" article, with the definition: \\"a Hill-Billie is a free and untrammeled white citizen of Tennessee, who lives in the hills, has no means to speak of, dresses as he can, talks as he pleases, drinks whiskey when he gets it, and fires off his revolver as the fancy takes him\\". The stereotype is twofold in that it incorporates both positive and negative traits: \\"Hillbillies\\" are often considered independent and self-reliant individuals who resist the modernization of society, but at the same time they are also defined as backward and violent. Scholars argue this duality is reflective of the split ethnic identities in white America. - A radio station is a set of equipment necessary to carry on communication via radio waves. Generally, it is a receiver or transmitter, an antenna, and some smaller additional equipment necessary to operate them. Radio stations play a vital role in communication technology as they are heavily relied on to transfer data and information across the world. - The Palouse is a region of the northwestern United States, encompassing parts of southeastern Washington, north central Idaho and, by some definitions, parts of northeast Oregon. It is a major agricultural area, primarily producing wheat and legumes. Situated about north of the Oregon Trail, the region experienced rapid growth in the late 19th century and was once Washington's most populous region, surpassing even the Puget Sound area. - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries. - An acoustic guitar is a guitar that produces sound acousticallyby transmitting the vibration of the strings to the airas opposed to relying on electronic amplification (see electric guitar). The sound waves from the strings of an acoustic guitar resonate through the guitar's body, creating sound. This typically involves the use of a sound board and a sound box to strengthen the vibrations of the strings. - The Pacific Northwest (in the United States, commonly abbreviated as PNW), sometimes referred to as Cascadia, is a geographic region in western North America bounded by the Pacific Ocean to the west and loosely, by the Rocky Mountains on the east. Though no agreed boundary exists, a common conception includes the U.S. states of Oregon and Washington and the Canadian province of British Columbia. Broader conceptions reach north into Alaska and Yukon, south into far northern California and east to the Continental Divide, thus including Idaho, Western Montana, and western Wyoming. Narrower conceptions may be limited to the northwestern US or to the coastal areas west of the Cascade and Coast mountains. The variety of definitions can be attributed to partially overlapping commonalities of the region's history, geography, society, and other factors. - Blues is a genre and musical form originated by African Americans in the Deep South of the United States around the end of the 19th century. The genre developed from roots in African musical traditions, African-American work songs and European-American folk music. Blues incorporated spirituals, work songs, field hollers, shouts, chants, and rhymed simple narrative ballads. The blues form, ubiquitous in jazz, rhythm and blues and rock and roll, is characterized by the call-and-response pattern, the blues scale and specific chord progressions, of which the twelve-bar blues is the most common. Blue notes (or \\"worried notes\\"), usually thirds or fifths flattened in pitch, are also an essential part of the sound. Blues shuffles or walking bass reinforce the trance-like rhythm and form a repetitive effect known as the groove. - A census is the procedure of systematically acquiring and recording information about the members of a given population. It is a regularly occurring and official count of a particular population. The term is used mostly in connection with national population and housing censuses; other common censuses include agriculture, business, and traffic censuses. The United Nations defines the essential features of population and housing censuses as \\"individual enumeration, universality within a defined territory, simultaneity and defined periodicity\\", and recommends that population censuses be taken at least every 10 years. United Nations recommendations also cover census topics to be collected, official definitions, classifications and other useful information to co-ordinate international practice. - Communication (from Latin \\"commnicre\\", meaning \\"to share\\") is the act of conveying intended meanings from one entity or group to another through the use of mutually understood signs and semiotic rules. - The harmonica, also known as a French harp or mouth organ, is a free reed wind instrument used worldwide in many musical genres, notably in blues, American folk music, classical music, jazz, country, and rock and roll. There are many types of harmonica, including diatonic, chromatic, tremolo, octave, orchestral, and bass versions. A harmonica is played by using the mouth (lips and tongue) to direct air into or out of one or more holes along a mouthpiece. Behind each hole is a chamber containing at least one reed. A harmonica reed is a flat elongated spring typically made of brass, stainless steel, or bronze, which is secured at one end over a slot that serves as an airway. When the free end is made to vibrate by the player's air, it alternately blocks and unblocks the airway to produce sound. - Pullman is the largest city in Whitman County, located in southeastern Washington state within the Palouse region of the Pacific Northwest. The population was 29,799 at the 2010 census, estimated to have reached 31,682 in 2014. Originally incorporated as Three Forks, the city was later renamed after industrialist George Pullman. - Radio waves are a type of electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths in the electromagnetic spectrum longer than infrared light. Radio waves have frequencies as high as 300 GHz to as low as 3 kHz, though some definitions describe waves above 1 or 3 GHz as microwaves, or include waves of any lower frequency. At 300 GHz, the corresponding wavelength is , and at 3 kHz is . Like all other electromagnetic waves, they travel at the speed of light. Naturally occurring radio waves are generated by lightning, or by astronomical objects.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Indigenous languages of the Americas are spoken by indigenous peoples from Alaska and Greenland to the southern tip of South America, encompassing the land masses that constitute the Americas. These indigenous languages consist of dozens of distinct language families, as well as many language isolates and unclassified languages. Many proposals to group these into higher-level families have been made, such as Joseph Greenberg's Amerind hypothesis. This scheme is rejected by nearly all specialists, due to the fact that some of the languages differ too significantly to draw any connections between them. Thousands of languages were spoken by various peoples in North and South America prior to their first contact with Europeans. These encounters occurred between the beginning of the 11th century (with the Nordic settlement of Greenland and failed efforts in Newfoundland and Labrador) and the end of the 15th century (the voyages of Christopher Columbus). Several indigenous cultures of the Americas had also developed their own writing systems, the best known being the Maya script. The indigenous languages of the Americas had widely varying demographics, from the Quechuan languages, Aymara, Guarani, and Nahuatl, which had millions of active speakers, to many languages with only several hundred speakers. After pre-Columbian times, several indigenous creole languages developed in the Americas, based on European, indigenous and African languages. The European colonizers and their successor states had widely varying attitudes towards Native American languages. In Brazil, friars learned and promoted the Tupi language. In many Latin American colonies, Spanish missionaries often learned local languages and culture in order to preach to the natives in their own tongue and relate the Christian message to their indigenous religions. In the British American colonies, John Eliot of the Massachusetts Bay Colony translated the Bible into the Massachusett language, also called Wampanoag, or Natick (1661-1663; he published the first Bible printed in North America, the Eliot Indian Bible. The Europeans also suppressed use of indigenous American languages, establishing their own languages for official communications, destroying texts in other languages, and insisting that indigenous people learn European languages in schools. As a result, indigenous American languages suffered from cultural suppression and loss of speakers. By the 18th and 19th centuries, Spanish, English, Portuguese, French, and Dutch, brought to the Americas by European settlers and administrators, had become the official or national languages of modern nation-states of the Americas. Many indigenous languages have become critically endangered, but others are vigorous and part of daily life for millions of people. Several indigenous languages have been given official status in the countries where they occur, such as Guarani in Paraguay. In other cases official status is limited to certain regions where the languages are most spoken. Although sometimes enshrined in constitutions as official, the languages may be used infrequently in de facto official use. Examples are Quechua in Peru and Aymara in Bolivia, where in practice, Spanish is dominant in all formal contexts. In North America and the Arctic region, Greenland in 2009 adopted Kalaallisut as its sole official language. In the United States, the Navajo language is the most spoken Native American language, with more than 200,000 speakers in the Southwestern United States. The US Marine Corps recruited Navajo men, who were established as code talkers during World War II, to transmit secret US military messages. Neither the Germans nor Japanese ever deciphered the Navajo code, which was a code using the Navajo language. Today, governments, universities, and indigenous peoples are continuing to work for the preservation and revitalization of indigenous American languages. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: What year was this developed?","completion":"It's not clear which specific development you are asking about in your question.

Movie title: Alphaville Movie plot: Lemmy Caution is a secret agent with the code number of 003 from \\"the Outlands\\". Entering Alphaville in his Ford Mustang,[3] called a Ford Galaxie,[4] he poses as a journalist named Ivan Johnson, and claims to work for the Figaro-Pravda. He wears a tan overcoat that stores various items such as an M1911A1 Colt Commander automatic pistol. He carries a cheap Instamatic camera (new in 1965) with him and photographs everything he sees, particularly the things that would ordinarily be unimportant to a journalist. Caution is, in fact, on a series of missions. First, he searches for the missing agent Henri Dickson (Akim Tamiroff); second, he is to capture or kill the creator of Alphaville, Professor von Braun (Howard Vernon); lastly, he aims to destroy Alphaville and its dictatorial computer, Alpha 60. Alpha 60 is a sentient computer system created by von Braun which is in complete control of all of Alphaville. Alpha 60 has outlawed free thought and individualist concepts like love, poetry, and emotion in the city, replacing them with contradictory concepts or eliminating them altogether. One of Alpha 60's dictates is that \\"people should not ask 'why', but only say 'because'.\\" People who show signs of emotion (weeping at the death of a wife, or smiling) are presumed to be acting illogically, and are gathered up, interrogated, and executed. In an image reminiscent of George Orwell's concept of Newspeak, there is a dictionary in every hotel room that is continuously updated when words that are deemed to evoke emotion become banned. As a result, Alphaville is an inhuman, alienated society. Caution is told that men are killed at a ratio of fifty to every one woman executed. He also learns that Swedes, Germans and Americans assimilate well with Alphaville.

Although he was present at court when the warrant was issued, police made no attempt to arrest him and he rapidly returned to his home on the outskirts of the city. He was finally arrested on Friday morning and appeared at court, where a judge ruled that he should be held in custody for two days. The decision to move him from his home to police headquarters appears to be largely procedural. He is expected to appear before an anti-terrorism court in the next 48 hours. His legal team have said they will challenge the order in Pakistan's Supreme Court. Meanwhile, members of Pakistan's Senate passed a resolution that the former president should be tried on charges of high treason relating to his declaration of a state of emergency in 2007. Last month Mr Musharraf returned from years of self-imposed exile hoping to lead his All Pakistan Muslim League (APML) party into the general election next month. Earlier this week his candidacy was rejected in Chitral, one of four seats he had applied to contest. Mr Musharraf had already failed in an attempt to stand in three other seats. The case for which he has been arrested relates to his controversial decision to dismiss judges - including Chief Justice Mohammad Iftikhar Chaudhry - when he imposed emergency rule in 2007. He also faces several other criminal cases and had been trying to stave off arrest ever since he returned. The Pakistani Taliban have also vowed to assassinate the former president, who seized power in a 1999 coup. Summary:","completion":"Former Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf faces arrest and possible trial for high treason relating to his 2007 declaration of a state of emergency, amid several ongoing politically-motivated cases against him."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: If you hear the sound of a handset beeping in a bag or pocket, you could be forgiven for thinking that someone has received a text message. But nowadays there are so many different ways of messaging someone that it could spell the death of the traditional text as we know it. Text messaging, or texting, is the art of sending a short, electronic message between two mobile phones or tablets . Users pay a certain amount to send messages via SMS--short message service. But in the last few years, messaging in this way has been on the decline . The rise of smartphones and tablets has seen an increase in the use of instant messaging apps , which take the place of traditional texts. Using wireless Internet connections, people can send limitless numbers of IMs to their friends for very little cost.

This movie has several things going for it. It is a \\"feel good\\" story. The characters and actors are likable, realistic and present fine performances. Most important, I believe, is that Dennis Quaid knows how to grip and throw a baseball. Robert Redford looked good both throwing and swinging a bat in \\"The Natural, and so did Kevin Costner in \\"For Love of the Game\\" and \\"Bull Durham.\\" In \\"Major League,\\" Tom Berenger and Charlie Sheen looked like they knew what they were doing, but many of the others did not, and that picture was pure silliness - and not very funny. So many earlier baseball movies, even where the stories might be interesting, presented such a lack of baseball ability on the part of the leads, they were ludicrous in this respect. In \\"The Stratton Story\\" and \\"Strategic Air Command,\\" Jimmy Stewart looked about as believable as a professional baseball player, as your overweight, non-athletic, elderly uncle in the softball game at the family reunion. Other virile and physically robust stars (e.g., Gary Cooper as Lou Gehrig; Robald Reagan as Grover Cleveland Alexander; and Dan Dailey as Dizzy Dean) also exhibited a degree of baseball ability that would put them in the late rounds while \\"choosing-up\\" for a game at the Sunday picnic (even if coed, and even if your uncle were involved). The scenes of Quaid's high school team he coached, the ones where he attends his tryout with the Devil Rays, and those with him playing in two minor leagues and in the American League, all ring true. The participants are believable and capable. In addition, he is an engaging actor who always delivers a talented and appropriate characterization (except, to a degree, some of his \\"over-the-top\\" scenes, and his forced accent, in his portrayal of Jerry Lee Lewis).

Add in a few drops of the essential oil of your choice. Begin mixing in the water. Store the toothpaste in a glass jar. Scoop a bit onto your brush. Article:","completion":"Title: DIY Natural Toothpaste: A Simple and Effective Recipe for a Healthier Smile Introduction The increasing awareness of the harmful effects of chemicals and artificial ingredients found in commercial dental products has led to a shift towards more natural and eco-friendly alternatives. From toothbrushes made from biodegradable bamboo to floss that is plastic-free and compostable, there is a growing trend of people seeking out healthier, more sustainable choices for their oral hygiene routine. In keeping with this theme, this article will provide a detailed guide on how to create your own DIY natural toothpaste using just a few simple ingredients. Benefits of Homemade Natural Toothpaste Opting to create your own toothpaste from natural ingredients offers several advantages over store-bought alternatives. Firstly, homemade toothpaste allows you to be in control of the ingredients used, eliminating any potential allergens or irritants. Additionally, DIY toothpaste often contains fewer abrasive elements, resulting in a gentler clean that can be especially beneficial for those with sensitive teeth or gums. Lastly, making your own toothpaste has a lower environmental impact, as it eliminates the consumption of plastic packaging and supports a more sustainable lifestyle. Ingredients To create your own natural toothpaste, gather the following ingredients: 1. 2/3 cup baking soda 2. 1 teaspoon sea salt 3. Essential oil of your choice (peppermint, spearmint, tea tree oil, etc.) 4. Water (amount will vary depending on desired consistency) Step-by-Step Recipe 1. Mix Dry Ingredients: In a medium-sized bowl, combine the 2/3 cup of baking soda with 1 teaspoon of sea salt. Baking soda acts as a gentle abrasive that helps to scrub away plaque, while also neutralizing odors. Sea salt enhances the texture and flavor of the toothpaste and is said to possess natural antibacterial properties. 2. Add Essential Oils: Next, add a few drops of your preferred essential oil into the mixture. Popular choices for toothpaste recipes are peppermint, spearmint, or tea tree oil. These oils not only provide a refreshing taste and aroma, but also contain antibacterial and antifungal properties that promote oral health. Be cautious not to use too much of the essential oil, as they can be potent. Start with approximately 2-3 drops and adjust to taste. 3. Mix in Water: Slowly start mixing water into the dry ingredients, adding small amounts at a time, until you reach the desired consistency. For a thicker toothpaste, use less water; for a thinner, more liquid consistency, add more water. Be sure to mix the ingredients thoroughly as you incorporate the water to ensure a smooth, homogenous paste. 4. Store Toothpaste: Once the toothpaste has reached your preferred consistency, transfer it into a clean glass jar or airtight container. Glass jars are an ideal choice for storage, as they are both reusable and eco-friendly. To avoid contamination, it is important to use a clean utensil or scoop to transfer the toothpaste onto your toothbrush each time you use it. Using Your DIY Natural Toothpaste To use your homemade toothpaste, simply scoop a small amount onto your toothbrush and brush as you would with commercial toothpaste. Keep in mind that this DIY paste will not produce the frothy foam that most store-bought options do, as it lacks the chemical surfactants commonly found in commercial toothpastes. This does not affect its efficacy, however, as the abrasive baking soda and essential oils will still work to clean and freshen your breath. Conclusion Creating your own DIY natural toothpaste is an easy and affordable way to enhance your oral hygiene routine while reducing your exposure to harmful chemicals and supporting a more sustainable lifestyle. With just a few simple ingredients and a bit of experimentation to find the perfect consistency and flavor, you can enjoy the benefits of a cleaner, healthier smile and a greener planet."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The reviewer not only shares their dissatisfaction with the router itself but also implies potential compatibility issues with the web browser they use, Netscape, as opposed to Internet Explorer. This could suggest they believe that the product is not versatile enough to cater to various users who may use different browsers, adding to the negative nature of the review.

Her husband served as art critic for The Sydney Morning Herald for a decade and a half.In 1942, Bellette won the Sir John Sulman Prize with For Whom the Bell Tolls. She won it again in 1944 with her painting Iphigenia in Tauris, inspired by Euripides' play. The composition is set in a dry, open landscape, with several riders on horses whose appearance suggests \\"the Australian present, rather than Greek antiquity\\". The judge awarding the prize actually preferred another of her entries, Electra, depicting the sister of Iphigenia also prominent in Greek tragedy – but it failed to meet the size requirements. Both Iphigenia in Tauris and Electra were among the many works created by Bellette in the 1940s that were inspired by the tragedies of Euripides, Sophocles and Homer. Her choice of subject matter and approach placed her at odds with mainstream modernism, while she seemed to shun explicit links between the classical and the Australian. Bellette reasoned that she preferred to choose her palette and the spatial arrangements of her compositions to evoke a place's atmosphere. Critics identified the influence of European modernists Aristide Maillol and Giorgio de Chirico, as well as Italian Quattrocento painters Masaccio and Piero della Francesca, about some of whom Bellette wrote articles in the journal Art in Australia.The most distinctive feature of the artist's work was this choice of classical subjects.

Charles-Valentin Alkan (French: [ʃaʁl valɑ̃tɛ̃ alkɑ̃]; 30 November 1813 – 29 March 1888) was a French-Jewish composer and virtuoso pianist. At the height of his fame in the 1830s and 1840s he was, alongside his friends and colleagues Frédéric Chopin and Franz Liszt, among the leading pianists in Paris, a city in which he spent virtually his entire life. Alkan earned many awards at the Conservatoire de Paris, which he entered before he was six. His career in the salons and concert halls of Paris was marked by his occasional long withdrawals from public performance, for personal reasons. Although he had a wide circle of friends and acquaintances in the Parisian artistic world, including Eugène Delacroix and George Sand, from 1848 he began to adopt a reclusive life style, while continuing with his compositions – virtually all of which are for the keyboard. During this period he published, among other works, his collections of large-scale studies in all the major keys (Op. 35) and all the minor keys (Op. 39). The latter includes his Symphony for Solo Piano (Op. 39, nos. 4–7) and Concerto for Solo Piano (Op. 39, nos. 8–10), which are often considered among his masterpieces and are of great musical and technical complexity. Alkan emerged from self-imposed retirement in the 1870s to give a series of recitals that were attended by a new generation of French musicians. Alkan's attachment to his Jewish origins is displayed both in his life and his work. He was the first composer to incorporate Jewish melodies in art music. Fluent in Hebrew and Greek, he devoted much time to a complete new translation of the Bible into French. This work, like many of his musical compositions, is now lost. Alkan never married, but his presumed son Élie-Miriam Delaborde was, like Alkan, a virtuoso performer on both the piano and the pedal piano, and edited a number of the elder composer's works. Following his death (which according to persistent but unfounded legend was caused by a falling bookcase) Alkan's music became neglected,...

Wow, this store needs to re visit customer service 101 and T- mobile needs to drop them for representing them!! I have used T- mobile for over 10 years and have always had good service and been a happy user. I lost my earphones for my droid phone and stopped by this store (big sign is T-Mobile on store front). After waiting in line for awhile I was told the skull brand (20) would work fine and I made sure that they would work on my phone and I could use them for the phone. Left store thinking, hmmm, don't think I would ever want to go back there and tried the headset and low and behold, they did not work!!! Was unable to hang up phone from the headset or answer phone from headset. Quick U-turn about a couple of miles down the road and back to this store to return and see if they had another choice. Waited in line again and then the same person (rep#2550714) looked at me like what the heck are you doing back here.........said yes.............and I told him they did not work like he told me they would and I am returning them. Ok he said. So hubby finds another brand that should work and we asked if these would work and he said he didn't know. He asks another guy working there and they conclude that no they are only for listening to music (even though packaging states it is for phone too). Treating me like I am some dumb person, he does the transaction for the return and is clearly done with me. Hubby and I look at each other and give each other the look like are you kidding me and let's get the hell out of here fast!

Article: In the rush to get to school, you drop a piece of toast on the floor. Do you throw it away or dec ide it' s still OK to eat? If you're like most people, you eat it. Maybe you follow the \\"5-second rule\\", which claims foods are safe to eat if you pick them up within 5 seconds after dropping them. But you might want to think again. Scientists now say that 5 seconds is all it takes for foods to become polluted with enough bacteria to make you sick. Bacteria can cause many kinds of illnesses. Some kinds of bacteria can grow on food. If you eat foods on which these bacteria are growing, you can become sick. One of these food-borne bacteria is Salmonella. It makes 1.4 million people sick every year. Salmonella is often found in raw eggs and chicken. Cooking kills these bacteria, which is why it is so important to cook eggs, chicken, and other foods thoroughly. But how long does it take these bacteria to pollute food? A team of scientists in South Carolina did an experiment. First, they placed an amount of Salmonella on three surfaces; wood, tile , and carpet. They placed a piece of bread and a piece of bologna on each surface for 5,30, or 60 seconds. After just 5 seconds, both the bread and the bologna picked up enough bacteria to make you sick. So forget the 5-second rule. If your toast drops on the floor, throw it away and get another piece of clean toast. This time, be careful not to drop it!

This 3-centimetre (1.18 in) diameter by 1-centimetre (0.39 in) thick pendant, made from rock-crystal, gold, garnet, and amethyst coloured-glass, has been worked in a lathe. The workmanship is not of a high standard. Æthelberht of Kent was said to have built a church at Cratendune around 600 AD, about a mile from what is now Ely Cathedral. In 673 AD, Æthelthryth considered restoring this church, thought to have been destroyed by Penda of Mercia, but instead made what is now Ely Cathedral the site of her monastery. An early Anglo-Saxon cemetery, used at some point between 410–1065 AD, was uncovered around 1945 near Little Thetford (52.376N, 0.2375E), and was thought to be this lost village of Cratendune. A deserted Saxon settlement, 410–1065 AD, examined in 1999 in Ely, may also be a candidate for this lost site of worship. Little Thetford means little public or people's ford—Old English lȳtel Thiutforda (c. 972) and Liteltedford [sic] (1086)—compare with Thetford, Norfolk—Old English Thēodford (late 9th century) and Tedfort (1086). The online Domesday Book records the settlement under the name Liteltetford [sic]. The first written evidence that Ely Abbey had inherited the Little Thetford lands was in the 12th-century chronicle, Liber Eliensis. The will of Ælfwaru (d. 1007), an Anglo-Saxon noblewoman, granted estates in Cambridgeshire and Norfolk to the Abbey, which included \\"... that land at Thetford and fisheries around those marshes\\". In 1110, Hervey le Breton, Bishop of Ely, granted the manor to William Brito, his Archdeacon and also his nephew.

Brendan Rodgers has confirmed that Daniel Sturridge is out of Liverpool’s biggest week of the season as he continues his recovery from a calf problem. Liverpool face a trip to Newcastle on Saturday before heading to Spain for a Champions League clash against Real Madrid on Tuesday, and round off a demanding seven days with a showdown against Chelsea at Anfield. Sturridge, who has not played for his club since August 31, 11 matches ago, damaged his calf two weeks ago in training as he was working his way back from a thigh injury. Brendan Rodgers has confirmed Daniel Sturridge will miss Liverpool's match against Newcastle. Sturridge picked up his latest injury on England duty and hasn't played since the beginning of September. Daniel Sturridge went on Twitter on Thursday to reveal he his feeling 'closer to full fitness' Crunch matches he will miss. Newcastle (a) - November 1. Real Madrid (a) - November 4. Chelsea (h) - November 8. England vs Slovenia - November 12. Scotland v England - November 15. Liverpool initially hoped he might recover within a fortnight but there is no prospect of that and Rodgers has reluctantly accepted that time has run out. ‘I don’t think he will be fit,’ said Rodgers. ‘The bottom line is that he is injured. He strained his calf. So he is injured. We will just wait and work with him until he gets back fit. ‘I have to find the solutions without Daniel. You are learning every day about the players. Gradually as each day goes by, I sense and feel we are getting better.’ The ramifications of Sturridge’s absence from those matches is that he will not be available for England’s games against Slovenia and Scotland next month, either. The England striker tweeted that he is getting 'closer to fitness each day' but will be out of a crucial week. Sturridge signs autographs before Liverpool's Capital One Cup game against Swansea on Tuesday. His absence has come as a source of great frustration to his manager, as the 25-year-old’s pace, clinical finishing and dynamism are crucial to Liverpool’s gameplan and they have certainly missed him. Rodgers would not be drawn on Sturridge’s claim on talkSPORT that his fitness problems might be ‘hereditary’ as both his father (Simon) and uncle (Dean) endured muscular injuries like him, but the manager wants to see his striker have a consistent run in his team. ‘When you have that talent, you just have to keep yourself fit and available as you possibly can,’ said Rodgers. Rodgers would not be drawn on Sturridge's claims that his fitness problems might be 'hereditary' ‘We will work with him and hopefully we will get that bit of luck when he comes back. When he comes back, hopefully we will have him for the rest of the season. ‘I can only concentrate on his injury now. He’s just recovering and we will see the length of time it takes. He is probably speaking how he felt. That is the way of the world. ‘I am not an expert on any genetics code, or medicine, so I can’t comment. ‘All I know is it’s a calf strain on the back of his last injury and he’s working to recover.’ Summarize the highlights of this article.","completion":"Liverpool Manager Brendan Rodgers has confirmed that Daniel Sturridge will miss Liverpool's important matches against Newcastle, Real Madrid, and Chelsea due to his ongoing recovery from a calf injury.

While that information circulated within the FAA, we found no evidence that the hijacking was reported to any other agency in Washington before 8:46. Most federal agencies learned about the crash in New York from CNN. Within the FAA, the administrator, Jane Garvey, and her acting deputy, Monte Belger, had not been told of a confirmed hijacking before they learned from television that a plane had crashed. Others in the agency were aware of it, as we explained earlier in this chapter. Inside the National Military Command Center, the deputy director of operations and his assistant began notifying senior Pentagon officials of the incident. At about 9:00, the senior NMCC operations officer reached out to the FAA operations center for information. Although the NMCC was advised of the hijacking of American 11, the scrambling of jets was not discussed. In Sarasota, Florida, the presidential motorcade was arriving at the Emma E. Booker Elementary School, where President Bush was to read to a class and talk about education. White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card told us he was standing with the President outside the classroom when Senior Advisor to the President Karl Rove first informed them that a small, twin-engine plane had crashed into the World Trade Center. The President's reaction was that the incident must have been caused by pilot error. At 8:55, before entering the classroom, the President spoke to National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice, who was at the White House. She recalled first telling the President it was a twin-engine aircraft-and then a commercial aircraft-that had struck the World Trade Center, adding \\"that's all we know right now, Mr. President.\\" At the White House, Vice President Dick Cheney had just sat down for a meeting when his assistant told him to turn on his television because a plane had struck the NorthTower of the World Trade Center. The Vice President was wondering \\"How the hell could a plane hit the World Trade Center\\" when he saw the second aircraft strike the South Tower. Elsewhere in the White House, a series of 9:00 meetings was about to begin.

They were really mad at each other, and it seemed like they might even have a big fight, like a war. The UN wanted to help and stop this war from happening. But, they were also worried that if they tried to stop things too fast, it could make the fighting even worse (like if you're trying to break up a fight and accidentally make everybody more angry). So, the UN had a big decision to make. They needed to figure out if trying to stop the US and Yugoslavia from fighting was worth the risk, or if it might accidentally make things even worse.

He was a very skilled player but sometimes got into trouble. The important people who took care of the team in Milan, like a man named Umberto Gandini, thought it was time for Mario to find a new home and try something new. So, Mario packed his bags and left Milan to join a new team called Liverpool in a faraway place called England. This was a big change for Mario, and he was excited to start a new chapter in his life and try his best to play soccer for his new team. Mario's start at Liverpool was not as smooth as he hoped. In his first eight games, he only managed to score one goal. He was also asked to sit on the bench and not play a few times too. But, Mario is still young at only 24 years old, and he has lots of time to learn, grow, and become a better soccer player. His old friends from Milan, like Umberto Gandini, thought that Mario was not ready yet to be the main soccer player who can carry the club team to win many games. They knew that he needed more time to learn and get better. In the end, Mario Balotelli's journey from Milan to Liverpool is all about finding a new start and a chance to grow.

Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below. Who will increase the strength of their cardiac muscles more? Usain was once a competitive swimmer, but he became bored with the sport and decided to start running very frequently instead. Usain tried to convince his brother, Asafa, to take up running as well. Asafa didn't really like running, though, so he hardly ran much at all. Hint: In exercises such as weight lifting, skeletal muscle contracts against a resisting force (see Figure below ). Using skeletal muscle in this way increases its size and strength. In exercises such as running, the cardiac muscle contracts faster and the heart pumps more blood. Using cardiac muscle in this way increases its strength and efficiency. Continued exercise is necessary to maintain bigger, stronger muscles. If you don’t use a muscle, it will get smaller and weaker—so use it or lose it. Answer:","completion":"Usain will increase the strength of his cardiac muscles more. Justification: The paragraph indicates that Usain, although a former competitive swimmer, has decided to take up running frequently. The hint provided states clearly that exercises such as running lead to a faster contraction of the cardiac muscles and the heart pumping more blood. Using the cardiac muscle in this manner increases its strength and efficiency. On the other hand, Asafa, Usain's brother, does not engage much in running, which in turn implies that he is not contributing much to the strength and efficiency of his cardiac muscles. With the principle of \\"use it or lose it\\" in mind, it can be deducted that Usain, with his frequent running, will be boosting the strength of his cardiac muscles more than Asafa who hardly runs."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

(Photo: Sue Ogrocki, AP) Publicity surrounding the Affordable Care Act's benefits may be meeting supporters' goals. More people view the health law favorably than at any point in nearly seven years. That's the main finding of a Kaiser Family Foundation survey out Friday of 1,160 people last week that shows the Affordable Care Act is as popular as it's been since the summer of 2010. The percent of people with favorable views of the law increased from 43% in December to 48% now. People are still split on whether to repeal the law or not — though far fewer want repeal without details of a replacement plan. \\"It’s not surprising that as Democrats have gone on the offense about the benefits of the law for people, support for the law has gone up,\\" says Paul Howard, director of health policy at the free market Manhattan Institute. More than 1,160 adults were polled Feb. 13-19 for the survey,which has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points. A lack of clarity over what the law would be replaced with if repealed strengthens attachment to the ACA, says Howard. Republican infighting weakens support for the repeal effort and supporters of the law have made \\"effective use of town halls\\" in congressional districts, he added. \\"The devil you know is more popular than the devil you don't,\\" says Howard. Liz Hamel is director of public opinion and survey research at the Kaiser Family Foundation. (Photo: Kaiser Family Foundation) While Democrats and Republicans' opinions of the law haven't changed much, independents seem to have grown more positive about the ACA, says Liz Hamel, Kaiser Family Foundation's director of public opinion and survey research. \\"They're most likely reacting to what they’re hearing in the news and the fact that more of the public discussion of late is about what people stand to lose if it is repealed,\\" says Hamel. The new findings come as insurers and consumers are trying to figure out what to make of Internal Revenue Service guidance on how it would treat tax returns that that appeared to suggest taxpayers without health insurance won’t face penalties at tax time. In recent years, returns that didn't indicate whether the taxpayer had insurance or an exemption were processed, but that was set to change this year. Based on one of President Trump's executive orders, the IRS now plans to continue processing these returns and may follow up at a future date. Read more: \\"Legislative provisions of the ACA law are still in force until changed by the Congress, and taxpayers remain required to follow the law and pay what they may owe‎,\\" the IRS said. The insurance industry trade group, America's Health Insurance Plans, is urging Congress to approve other incentives to keep people enrolled in insurance if the tax penalties are eliminated. If people aren't required to buy insurance, healthy people are more likely to wait to buy it when they are sick or injured and their premiums couldn't offset the costs of insuring those who need more health care. Other findings: • Nearly half of the public worry someone in their family will lose coverage if the ACA is repealed and replaced. • Substantial majorities say it is important that any ACA replacement plan continue to provide federal funds to states that expanded Medicaid under the law. This was true no matter where people lived or what political party they belong to. • About two thirds of people prefers status quo over such changes that would limit federal spending while giving states more flexibility to decide who and what to cover. Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2meTvNc ||||| House Speaker Paul Ryan promised that Republicans would begin marking up a repeal bill next week. | Getty Exclusive: Leaked GOP Obamacare replacement shrinks subsidies, Medicaid expansion The replacement would be paid for by limiting tax breaks on generous health plans people get at work. A draft House Republican repeal bill would dismantle the Obamacare subsidies and scrap its Medicaid expansion, according to a copy of the proposal obtained by POLITICO. The legislation would take down the foundation of Obamacare, including the unpopular individual mandate, subsidies based on people’s income, and all of the law’s taxes. It would significantly roll back Medicaid spending and give states money to create high risk pools for some people with pre-existing conditions. Some elements would be effective right away; others not until 2020. Story Continued Below The replacement would be paid for by limiting tax breaks on generous health plans people get at work — an idea that is similar to the Obamacare “Cadillac tax” that Republicans have fought to repeal. Speaker Paul Ryan said last week that Republicans would introduce repeal legislation after recess. But the GOP has been deeply divided about how much of the law to scrap, and how much to “repair,” and the heated town halls back home during the weeklong recess aren’t making it any easier for them. The key House committees declined to comment on specifics of a draft that will change as the bill moves through the committees. The speaker's office deferred to the House committees. In place of the Obamacare subsidies, the House bill starting in 2020 would give tax credits — based on age instead of income. For a person under age 30, the credit would be 2,000. That amount would double for beneficiaries over the age of 60, according to the proposal. A related document notes that HHS Secretary Tom Price wants the subsidies to be slightly less generous for most age groups. The Republican plan would also eliminate Obamacare’s Medicaid expansion in 2020. States could still cover those people if they chose but they’d get a lot less federal money to do so. And instead of the current open-ended federal entitlement, states would get capped payments to states based on the number of Medicaid enrollees. Another key piece of the Republican proposal: 100 billion in “state innovation grants” to help subsidize extremely expensive enrollees. That aims to address at least a portion of the “pre-existing condition” population, though without the same broad protections as in the Affordable Care Act. It also would eliminate Planned Parenthood funding, which could be an obstacle if the bill gets to the Senate. And it leaves decisions about mandatory or essential benefits to the states. According to the document, there’s only one single revenue generator to pay for the new tax credits and grants. Republicans are proposing to cap the tax exemption for employer sponsored insurance at the 90th percentile of current premiums. That means benefits above that level would be taxed. And while health care economists on both sides of the aisle favor tax-limits along those lines, politically it’s a hard sell. Both businesses and unions fought the Obamacare counterpart, dubbed the Cadillac tax. The document is more detailed than the general powerpoint House leaders circulated before the recess. Lawmakers are still in disagreement about several key issues, including Medicaid and the size and form of subsidies. Discussions within the House, and between House leaders and the White House about the final proposal are ongoing. President Donald Trump, who gives a major speech to Congress on Tuesday night, has said he expects a plan will emerge in early to mid March. The exact details of any legislation will also be shaped by findings from the CBO about how much it will cost and what it will do to the federal deficit. But the draft shows that Republicans are sticking closely to previous plans floated by Ryan and Price in crafting their Obamacare repeal package. “Obamacare has failed,\\" said HHS spokesperson Caitlin Oakley. \\"We welcome any and all efforts to repeal and replace it with real solutions that put patients first and back in charge of their health care rather than government bureaucrats in Washington, D.C.” Other changes proposed by Republicans align with previous ideas for strengthening the individual insurance market, which has been unstable under Obamacare with rising premiums and dwindling competition. For example, the legislation would allow insurers to charge older customers up to five times as much as their younger counterparts. Currently, they can only charge them three times as much in premiums. The insurers have been pushing for that change. The proposal also includes penalties for individuals who fail to maintain coverage continuously. If their coverage lapses and they decide to re-enroll, they would have to pay a 30 percent boost in premiums for a year. Like the unpopular individual mandate, that penalty is designed to discourage individuals from waiting until they get sick to get coverage. Republicans have vowed to dismantle Obamacare ever since it passed with only Democratic votes in 2010. But reaching agreement on what should come next has proven difficult since they gained full control of Congress and the White House. Recent polling has shown that Obamacare is increasingly popular. Supporters of the health care law have been turning out by the hundreds at town hall meetings across the country to demand that Republicans answer questions about what’s going to happen to the 20 million individual who have gained coverage under Obamacare. According to the latest Kaiser Family Foundation tracking poll, released Friday morning, the public now views the Affordable Care Act more favorably than it has since the summer of its enactment. Some 48 percent view the law favorably — up from 43 percent in December. About 42 percent have an unfavorable view of the ACA — down from 46 percent in December. The pollsters say Independents are mostly responsible for the shift. A separate poll by the Pew Research Center found 54 percent approve of the health care law — the highest scores for Obamacare in the poll's history. Meanwhile, 43 percent said they disapprove. CLARIFICATION: This story has been updated with the timing of the House GOP's plans for releasing a health care bill. ||||| Politico has obtained a leaked draft of a Republican replacement plan for Obamacare. The plan may be somewhat outdated already — it is two weeks old, per its time stamp, and Republicans have been working hard on their proposal in the meantime — but it almost certainly reveals an important shift from earlier GOP plans. In broad strokes, the draft bill hews closely to ideas outlined by House Speaker Paul Ryan and Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price. Compared with the Affordable Care Act, this proposal would generally be worse for people who are poorer and sicker — but better for those who are higher-income and healthy. Democrats will near certainly blast this proposal as bad for the 21 million Americans who rely on Obamacare for coverage. But buried in the details of the 106-page document is actually a bit of an evolution on the part of the Republican Party. I’ve spent a lot of time reading Republican replacement plans for Obamacare, and this is definitely a more consumer-friendly version of their ideas than those introduced in the past. This bill — and we don’t know right now which committee it came from or which legislators back it — has more generous financial support for those who buy their own plans, for example, and lower penalties for Americans who do not maintain continuous insurance coverage. Republicans seem pretty wedded to the reform concepts they outlined years ago. This includes things like age-based tax credits, a continuous coverage provision instead of an individual mandate, and a significant scaling back of the Medicaid expansion. But Republicans seem open to changing the details of how those provisions are implemented. What this means for patients will, in a lot of ways, come down to the smaller decisions: how big those age-based tax credits are, for example, or how much an individual who doesn’t maintain continuous coverage could be penalized. On that front, there really is a notable shift on the part of Republicans toward a plan that would be more financially generous. The leaked Republican plan restricts — but doesn’t ban — discriminating against people with preexisting conditions The leaked Republican draft, like Obamacare, requires insurance plans to offer coverage to all patients regardless of how sick they are. But the leaked plan, unlike Obamacare, would let insurers charge sick people more if they did not maintain “continuous coverage.” This continuous coverage policy has shown up a lot in Republican replacement plans. It was part of Speaker Ryan’s A Better Way proposal and Rep. Price’s Empowering Patients First Act. Here’s how it works: If a cancer patient goes straight from insurance at work to her own policy, her insurer has to charge her a standard rate — it can’t take the cost of her condition into account. But if she had a lapse in coverage — perhaps she couldn’t afford a new plan between jobs — and went to the individual market later, insurers could charge her up to 130 percent of the standard rate for her first year of coverage. She would have to pay that higher rate for a full year before getting access to the normal rate. This is a notably less harsh penalty than the one that Price suggested in his 2015 Empowering Patients First Act. In that bill, he would have allowed insurers to charge people like this 150 percent of the standard premium for 18 months. The leaked draft does have a safety net for people who can’t afford to buy this more expensive coverage. It would invest 100 billion over 10 years into funding state efforts to cover “high-risk individuals” or to “help stabilize premiums for health insurance coverage in the individual market.” States could presumably put this money toward high-risk pools, an idea that shows up in many other conservative proposals, although in the leaked draft they wouldn’t necessary have to. This is significantly more generous than other Republican proposals for how much to spend on the especially high-cost patients. Ryan’s plan, for example, would put 25 billion toward the high-risk pools over a decade (2.5 billion per year) and keep them running indefinitely. The Price plan envisions only 3 billion for high risk pools over three years. The leaked bill would generally be worse for people who are poorer and sicker, but better for attracting enrollees who are young and healthy. Perhaps most notably, however, the bill is generally more generous and consumer-friendly to all enrollees than previous policy proposals. Still, it’s unclear whether this would actually meet the needs of Americans with especially costly conditions. I’ve had some conservative health policy experts suggest to me that it would take about 25 billion per year to make high-risk pools function properly. And again, the funds in this leaked bill are not earmarked just for high-risk pools, and could be spent in other ways — meaning the funding could be much lower than the numbers outlined here. The leaked draft makes insurance better for people who are young and healthy. It makes insurance worse for people who are old and sick. One constant Obamacare gripe from Republicans is that the health care law mandates too big of a benefit package. This drives up premiums, they argue, and scares off some healthy and young enrollees who want to buy a skimpier plan. There is some truth to this argument. Obamacare’s marketplaces have struggled to attract young adults at the level the White House had initially hoped. (The Obama administration originally said it wanted one-third of the marketplace to be people between the ages of 18 and 34, but right now it’s only about a quarter.) The leaked draft makes the individual market more advantageous for healthier people. It eliminates the essential health benefits package, which mandated that all insurers cover a set of 10 different types of care, including maternity services and pediatric care. The leaked draft would allow states to decide which benefits are “essential.” Some states might choose skimpier benefit packages that would allow insurers to cut certain benefits they no longer want to cover — they could stop covering maternity benefits, for example, to make their plans less attractive to women who plan to become pregnant. This would likely benefit healthy people, who generally want less robust coverage at a cheaper price. But it’ll send the cost of more comprehensive plans — the plans sicker people need — skyrocketing. And it could leave someone who wants, say, health insurance to cover her maternity costs completely out of luck. There are other ways the leaked draft makes insurance better for young people too: by letting insurance plans charge them lower rates. It does this by allowing insurers to charge their oldest enrollees as much as they want. Right now insurers can only charge the oldest enrollees three times as much as the youngest — that constrains prices for patients in their 50s and 60s. Eliminating this regulation “increases the overall number of people with coverage, but older people end up falling out of the market as premiums rise,” says Christine Eibner, an economist with the RAND Corporation who has modeled similar changes to Obamacare’s age-rating provisions. And while young people might have cheaper premiums and an easier ability to enroll, older Americans could struggle to purchase coverage in this market, where their costs would rise. These are people who tend to have more urgent health care needs and could be in a worse position without health care than a young adult might be. This worries some Obamacare supporters, who say the goal of insurance reform isn’t just to expand coverage — it’s to expand coverage for people who really need health care. “If you replace a 60-year-old with a 20-year-old, that doesn’t change the number of people covered, but it changes the value of the coverage and of the program,” says Jonathan Gruber, the MIT economist who helped the White House model the economic effects of Obamacare. The leaked draft would provide tax credits, but they would help older (and likely richer) people more The leaked draft, like Obamacare, envisions that Americans will use tax credits to purchase individual health insurance, but the structure of the tax credits is very different. Obamacare’s tax credits are based on income, with those who earn less getting more help. The leaked draft’s tax credits would only be based on age, giving more help to those who are older (and who will presumably be charged higher premiums). The tax credits outlined in the bill are as follows: 2,000 for those under 30 2,500 for those between 30 and 40 3,000 for those between 40 and 50 3,500 for those between 50 and 60 4,000 for those over 60 This means that Bill Gates would qualify for the largest tax credit simply because he is 61 years old. Under the Empowering Patients bill, Gates’s net worth of 83 billion — presumably enough to purchase health coverage — would do nothing to disqualify him. Under Obamacare, he gets no help. Conversely, a 23-year-old with little income who has health problems gets minimal help under Price’s plan — despite the fact that she needs support much more than Gates does. But what was especially notable to me about these credits is that they’re significantly more generous than the ones that Price proposed in his 2015 Empowering Patients First Act. He suggested the following tax credits: 900 for children under 18 1,200 for those between 18 and 35 2,100 for those between 36 and 50 3,000 for those 51 and older The plans under the leaked proposal would almost certainly be cheaper because they wouldn’t have to cover so many benefits. A 55-year-old under this health care system, for example, might find lower premiums for plans that cover fewer benefits. But it’s also true that the plans that do offer comprehensive benefits would likely prove financially out of reach for many. The leaked draft repeals Medicaid expansion without any replacement Under this proposal, states could continue to cover the Medicaid expansion population — but they would get significantly less federal funding, which could push some states to drop out of the program entirely. Separate from the Affordable Care Act, the leaked draft suggests dramatically cutting funding for the Medicaid program entirely. Right now states and the federal government split Medicare patients’ bills. Each pays a certain percentage of the costs. The commitment to paying those medical bills is essentially unlimited: The two governments will pay whatever bills rack up. The leaked draft, however, would change that entirely. It suggests a “per capita cap” model, where each state would get a set amount for the number of people it was expected to enroll. If states were able to keep costs low, they might even be able to keep some of that money. But states could get into trouble if they found that they were spending more per person than their federal funding expected. They might need to cut back on the benefits the program offers, for example, or cover fewer people to make the numbers work. You can read more about how a proposal like this works in a longer explainer here. It’s very easy to see the ideas in this draft changing a lot in the coming weeks and months. Republican governors like Ohio’s John Kasich and Michigan’s Rick Snyder have begun to advocate for keeping Medicaid expansion, which covers thousands in their home states. Kasich is meeting with President Trump today and will certainly press the issue, and dozens of governors will be in Washington this weekend for the National Governors Association conference. You can bet this is a section they care about a lot — and will try to change significantly. The leaked draft has a new tax on high-cost health insurance plans that employers offer Most of the changes in the leaked draft have to do with people who get insurance through Medicaid or on the marketplaces. But there is one important change the plan would make to employer-sponsored insurance: It would cap the tax exclusion for employer-sponsored coverage. The health insurance tax break is the biggest in the federal budget; the government loses out on 260 billion annually by not taxing health benefits. And economists across the political spectrum agree that we should eliminate or at least reduce this tax break, which currently gives those with jobs a huge discount on their coverage — and an incentive to buy more coverage than they actually need. The leaked draft proposes taxing any employer-sponsored coverage above the 90th percentile of current premiums. If this sounds familiar, it’s because Obamacare had something awfully similar: the “Cadillac tax,” which was a 40 percent excise tax on especially high-cost health care plans. As popular as this provision will be with economists, you can bet that the public will hate it, as it would make some health plans significantly more expensive. There is already a lobbying campaign to kill this provision — even before Republicans have officially proposed the idea. “During meetings on Capitol Hill last week, there were acknowledgements of the role of the group market and a commitment to not disrupting that,” says Ed Fensholt, a senior vice president at the health brokerage firm Lockton. “I think there was, however, a lack of understanding that certain things they do might have a disruptive effect.” Watch: Obamacare in Trump country ||||| A doctor discusses medical treatment with a patient. (Joe Raedle/Getty Images) The public perception of President Barack Obama's health care law is becoming more positive as the Affordable Care Act faces threats of repeal, according to a new poll. The favorability ratings are at their highest recorded levels since the summer of 2010. The poll, by the Kaiser Family Foundation, has been conducted more than 60 times. To assemble the data researchers surveyed 1,160 adults by phone in mid-February about their opinions regarding different portions of the law, sometimes called Obamacare. They found that 48 percent of those surveyed now have favorable views of the Affordable Care Act – up from 43 percent in December. In comparison, 42 percent of those surveyed had an unfavorable view of Obamacare, down from 46 percent in the December poll. The shift was driven largely by people who identified as being politically independent, and the unfavorability rates did not fall below their lowest levels, recorded in July 2010, when they were at 35 percent. Prior to the most recent poll, the public's views on the law were more unfavorable than favorable, even as its major provisions became enacted and about 21 million people gained coverage or more robust health insurance. Republicans in Congress and President Donald Trump have long vowed to undo the Affordable Care Act, though they haven't said what they would replace it with. Democrats have seized on this lack of unity, holding events across the country to tell people about the dangers of repealing the law. During the past week activists and constituents have been protesting repeal at Republican town halls. In watching lawmakers talk about repealing the law, Americans reported mixed emotions: 56 percent are worried, 53 percent are hopeful, 45 percent are confused, 38 percent are angry and 33 percent are enthusiastic. Nearly half of those surveyed said that they feared someone in their family would lose coverage if the law is repealed and replaced. Despite the change in overall attitudes, the survey reveals people remain split on what should happen to the law next. Most of those who favor repeal, however, would like to see a replacement plan first. The survey also examined people’s views on Medicaid expansion, which was a provision of the law that allowed states to provide no- or low-cost coverage to low-income residents. Republicans in Congress have been discussing what to do about this portion of the law, though GOP governors have cautioned that repealing expansion would be damaging to their constituents. The majority of respondents, regardless of political leanings, said it was important that a replacement plan continues to provide federal funds to the 31 states and District of Columbia that expanded the program under the Affordable Care Act. Republicans have offered other solutions for Medicaid, including a proposal that would allow funds to be distributed through block grants – which may limit funding but gives states more flexibility about what programs to prioritize and which people to cover – or change it to a per-capita allotment system. Most respondents surveyed – 65 percent – reported that they would rather Medicaid continue as it is today than either of the offered alternatives to the current federal funding structure. Under the current structure, the federal government matches state spending but sets specific standards and benefits for states. Corrected on Feb. 24, 2017 : A previous version of this story misstated the law's past popularity. |||||","completion":"Public opinion of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), or Obamacare, is becoming more positive, even as the act faces possible repeal, according to a new poll from the Kaiser Family Foundation.

Carefully fill it to the middle with water that you’d like to sanitize. Don’t go beyond the middle point or you could risk it boiling over. For that reason, the process will go quicker if you use larger pots. Place the water-filled pots on the stove and turn the heat up to the maximum level. Watch the water heat up until the entire surface is continually bubbling. If the water is at risk of boiling over the edge, turn down the heat or you’ll risk contaminating the entire area.

He was the iconic founder and owner of the National Football League's Chicago Bears. He was also lesser known as an inventor, jurist, radio producer, philanthropist, philatelist, and Major League Baseball player. Most notably, he is considered one of the original co-founders of the National Football League (NFL) in 1920. - August Mike Michalske ( April 24 , 1903 - October 26 , 1983 ) was an American football player and coach . He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1964 . Originally a member of the short - lived New York Yankees National Football League team from 1927 to 1928 , Michalske arrived in Green Bay in 1929 for the first of what would be nine seasons with the team . An All - America fullback during his Penn State career , the 6 - foot , 210 pound Michalske convinced Packers coach Curly Lambeau to try him on the offensive line , where he became the first great guard in pro football , known for his combination of speed , agility and power . The first guard inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame , Michalske was a key blocker in the Packers ' championship seasons in 1929 , 1930 , and 1931 , opening holes for the likes of Johnny \`\` Blood '' McNally and Bob Monnett . Michalske also played on the defensive line and was dubbed \`\` Iron Mike '' because despite playing 60 minutes a game , he missed only 9 of 104 games during his Packers tenure , 5 of them in his final season . Moreover , throughout his football career he played with an unrepaired congenital abdominal hernia . Michalske was a six time consensus first team All - Pro in 1927 - 1931 and 1935 . He wore nine uniform numbers over his Packers career , the most by any one player in team history : 19 ( 1932 ) , 24 ( 1934 ) , 28 ( 1931 ) , 30 ( 1932 ) , 31 ( 1933 ) , 33 ( 1935 ) , 36 ( 1929 -- 30 , 37 ) , 40 ( 1935 ) and 63 ( 1934 ) . Following his Packers career , Michalske became a coach , including a head coaching stint at Iowa State from 1942 to 1946 . - American football, referred to as football in the United States and Canada, and also known as gridiron, is a sport played by two teams of eleven players on a rectangular field with goalposts at each end. The offense, the team with control of the oval-shaped football, attempts to advance down the field by running with or passing the ball, while the team without control of the ball, the defense, aims to stop their advance and take control of the ball for themselves. The offense must advance at least ten yards in four downs, or plays, or else they turn over the football to the opposing team; if they succeed, they are given a new set of four downs. Points are primarily scored by advancing the ball into the opposing team's end zone for a touchdown or kicking the ball through the opponent's goalposts for a field goal. The team with the most points at the end of a game wins. - Earl Louis \\"Curly\\" Lambeau (April 9, 1898 June 1, 1965) was a professional American football player and coach in the National Football League (NFL).

He shares the distinction with rival George Halas of the Chicago Bears of coaching his team to the most NFL championships, with six. He was an inaugural inductee to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1963. - The Green Bay Packers are a professional American football team based in Green Bay, Wisconsin. The Packers compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member club of the league's National Football Conference (NFC) North division.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. How does the sentence end? The monthly budget plan Christopher created was blown by Jeffrey, thanks to Options: -Christopher making very bad decisions. -Jeffrey making very bad decisions.","completion":"The monthly budget plan Christopher created was blown by Jeffrey, thanks to Jeffrey making very bad decisions. This scenario suggests that Christopher had taken the initiative to create a monthly budget plan, possibly for their household, a project, or a shared expense, with the intention of managing finances and ensuring that spending remains at a reasonable level. Such a budget plan might have included allocations for a variety of expenses, such as rent or mortgage payments, groceries, utility bills, entertainment, and other personal or shared expenditures. However, the sentence states that Jeffrey was responsible for blowing this carefully-crafted budget, due to his very bad decisions. There could be numerous scenarios in which this might occur, such as the following examples: 1. Impulsive spending: Jeffrey might have a tendency to make impulsive purchases, such as buying items that were not accounted for in the budget, or spending much more on a specific category than the allocated amount. This overspending would lead to the funds planned for other expenses being depleted, ultimately causing the budget to fail. 2. Incurring debts or liabilities: Another way in which Jeffrey could have made decisions that detrimentally impacted the budget is by incurring new debts, perhaps due to poor financial choices or a lack of foresight. Accumulating high levels of debt can strain the monthly budget, as funds must be allocated to pay off these obligations, in addition to the existing expenses. 3. Failing to stick to the budget: Jeffrey could also blow the budget by not adhering to it in the first place. Disregarding Christopher's plan and spending money on unnecessary items or activities would result in an imbalanced financial situation, putting pressure on the limited resources available. 4. Unexpected emergencies: Sometimes, unforeseen events like accidents, medical emergencies, or urgent repairs can lead to significant expenses that were not originally accounted for in the budget. While such situations might not be the direct result of Jeffrey's decisions, his inability or unwillingness to prepare for unforeseen circumstances might contribute to the budget's failure. In conclusion, the sentence ends with \\"Jeffrey making very bad decisions,\\" suggesting that despite Christopher's efforts in creating a comprehensive monthly budget plan, Jeffrey's ill-advised actions led to the downfall of the budget. This unfortunate outcome highlights the importance of responsible financial management and the need for all parties involved to cooperate in adhering to the agreed-upon budget."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize this article: Nicholas Salvador killed 82-year-old Palmira Silva in September last year. The 25-year-old believed he was seeing demons and \\"ran amok\\" through back gardens in Edmonton, north London before the attack, the court heard. He will be detained indefinitely in a psychiatric hospital. Recorder of London Nicholas Hilliard QC told Salvador: \\"It is established beyond any doubt that you killed Mrs Silva in an attack of extraordinary brutality and ferocity. \\"You thought you were encountering some demonic force which had taken on a human form. You could not have been more deluded. \\"Nobody who saw it could forget the mild and trusting way Mrs Silva approached you over the wall while you were brandishing a knife.\\" He said Mrs Silva was a \\"gentle, intelligent\\" woman who deserved to live her life \\"in peace and with security, proud in the achievements of others\\". The Old Bailey heard Salvador vaulted into Mrs Silva's garden and, after a brief exchange, stabbed her repeatedly before cutting her head off. Her granddaughter Christina Silva said: \\"You don't really know how to comprehend this happened, you still to this day think it is a big nightmare and you think you're going to wake up and everything will be fine.\\" She added: \\"Every day I wake up and replay the attack on my grandmother in my head. Since the attack I have completely changed from the person I used to be. \\"The thought of being alone in the house terrifies me.\\" Mrs Silva's daughter, Celestina Muis, said her mother's death had devastated the whole family who \\"no longer feel safe\\". She said: \\"Palmira had a full life, loving her children, grandchildren and great grandchild. She was very much the glue that held us all together. \\"Our lives have been torn apart knowing what happened to my mother.\\" Mrs Silva's family wiped away tears and hugged each other as the verdict was read out in court. CCTV footage showed Salvador killing two cats before targeting Mrs Silva. He lost his job three days before the incident, and smoked skunk cannabis, the court heard. His trial heard two psychiatrists agreed he was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia. When he carried out the killing, he believed Mrs Silva was a supernatural entity, either Adolf Hitler back from the dead or a demon who had taken the form of an old lady, jurors heard. He was staying with friends three doors away from the Italian-born grandmother's house in Nightingale Road when he went on the rampage. Salvador was remanded in custody at Belmarsh prison but, due to his mental state, he was moved to high-security Broadmoor Hospital. Enfield Inspector Doug Skinner said the there were children playing in nearby gardens when Salvador was jumping over fences. \\"We genuinely thought he would kill those children and we were filled with utter terror,\\" he said. In court, Salvador's barrister Bernard Richmond said he was regarded as a decent man, when he was not unwell. He said: \\"Mental illness in whatever circumstances can be terrifying for the person and one of the things we have to bear in mind that, after this case is finished, he will have to continue, as his mental state improves, coming to terms with the horror of what he did when he was unwell.\\"","completion":"In September last year, Nicholas Salvador killed 82-year-old Palmira Silva believing he was seeing demons and \\"ran amok\\" through back gardens in Edmonton, North London.

Question: The answer to the question: What singer was going to work with producers Stock, Aitken & Waterman? is inside the article: During a Fitzroy Football Club benefit concert with other Neighbours cast members, Minogue performed \\"I Got You Babe\\" as a duet with actor John Waters, and \\"The Loco-Motion\\" as an encore. She was subsequently signed to a recording contract with Mushroom Records in 1987. Her first single, \\"The Locomotion\\", spent seven weeks at number one on the Australian singles charts and became the country's highest-selling single in the 1980s. She received the ARIA Award for the year's highest-selling single. Its success resulted in Minogue travelling to England with Mushroom Records executive Gary Ashley to work with producers Stock, Aitken & Waterman. They knew little of Minogue and had forgotten that she was arriving; as a result, they wrote \\"I Should Be So Lucky\\" while she waited outside the studio. The song reached number one in the United Kingdom, Australia, Germany, Finland, Switzerland, Israel and Hong Kong. Minogue won her second consecutive ARIA Award for the year's highest-selling single, and received a \\"Special Achievement Award\\". Minogue's debut album, Kylie was released in July 1988. The album was a collection of dance-oriented pop tunes and spent more than a year on the UK Albums Chart, including several weeks at number one. The album went gold in the United States, and the single, \\"The Locomotion\\", reached number three on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart, and number one on the Canadian Singles Chart. The single \\"Got to Be Certain\\" became her third consecutive number one single on the Australian music charts. Later in the year, she left Neighbours to focus on her music career. Minogue also collaborated with Jason Donovan for the song \\"Especially for You\\", which peaked at number-one in the United Kingdom and in December 2014 sold its one millionth copy in the UK.

Write highlights for this article: The two British women accused of attempting to smuggle cocaine worth £1.5 million out of Peru have been branded liars by the lawyer who prepared the preliminary case against them. And he says their refusal to confess increases their prospect of facing 15 years in prison. In an exclusive interview with The Mail on Sunday, Dr Juan Mendoza Abarca, head of the state attorney’s office anti-drugs unit, dismissed the women’s stories. Scroll down for video. Living a nightmare: Michaella McCollum Connolly, left, and Melissa Reid in a Lima court. He said their excuses were ‘very well practised’, they had been coached in what to say and their ‘demeanour did not suggest that they had been threatened’. The lawyer, who led the investigation for the first 15 days, said that Melissa Reid and Michaella McCollum Connolly, both 20, had no proof to back up any of their claims. Last week The Mail on Sunday printed the women’s police statements in full and revealed that Miss Reid’s father, William, thinks she should plead guilty. Dr Mendoza Abarca said: ‘They don’t even have one element of proof. Unfortunately, their stories are not believable – their stories are incredible. They staged this whole thing from the beginning because they knew it was possible they would get caught and if they did get caught they had the excuses really well planned. ‘The problem is that they received the drugs, they packed the drugs in their bags and they went to the airport. But had they been given the bags packed already – which is what usually happens – then it’s another story. When somebody is threatened, you can tell. I have spoken to the girls and their demeanour did not suggest that they had been threatened because of the way they acted.’ Dr Mendoza Abarca questioned the women for three hours and thinks they will end up pleading guilty to get a shorter sentence. Dr Juan Mendoza Abarca, head of the state attorney's office anti-drugs unit, is interviewed by reporter Simon Murphy. He added: ‘It’s very obvious that they were trained in what to say if they were caught. They were prepared in every sense. They were told to take pictures of themselves having a good time, to try to act as normal as possible. All of the excuses were very well practised.’ This comes as The Mail on Sunday has uncovered fresh information about the women’s capture at Lima airport:. Michaella McCollum Connolly (L) and Melissa Reid (R) were detained allegedly with 11 kilograms of cocaine on their way to Madrid, Spain, at the international airport Jorge Chavez in Callao, near Lima, Peru. The case is now in the hands of the judiciary, but Dr Mendoza Abarca has been privy to all the evidence in the first 15 days of the case. His remarks provide a stark assessment of the women’s hopes of proving their innocence. If they continue to plead not guilty they will receive a minimum of eight and maximum of 15 years behind bars, he warns. ‘The biggest part, for me, was when they started crying when I asked them about their families,’ he said. ‘There’s no way in the world they would risk their families’ safety for that many days when they could have come forward and told the authorities they’d been threatened. ‘They are going to end up pleading guilty to get the minimum sentence, that’s what they always end up doing in my experience.’ He added: ‘When they were first questioned, their demeanour was very flat and they were just repeating their story. Usually when a mule is caught they come out with lots of different stories and explanations – they have lots of detail. These girls’ stories were just too superficial. ‘They could have come forward before. They had the opportunities to. The authorities in this country and their country would have done everything that was necessary to protect their families and to make sure nothing happened to them. ‘If that had happened, they actually would have had the opportunity to catch the real people involved because they would have done whatever was necessary to catch the real bosses. But they didn’t do that. They waited to be caught.’ Dr Mendoza Abarca also ruled out the possibility that the women were sacrificed to let a bigger load of drugs though, explaining that once the girls had been caught all flights were put on high alert. He added that CCTV showing the girls’ movements just before they went to the airport ‘showed nobody was holding a gun to their head’. ‘No one was seen to force them to do anything,’ he said. ‘They may have been used to carry drugs but they may also have been offered compensation for it because they were just freely walking around.’ Joke: Melissa Reid has poured her heart out in a series of letters to friends at home. Melissa Reid has poured her heart out in a series of letters to friends at home, describing her nightmare ordeal in a squalid Peruvian prison. But she has managed to keep her sense of humour and was able to joke: ‘Hope I look good on TV! (as good as I can that is.)’ Reid has spent her first full week behind bars with Michaella McCollum Connolly in a grim prison alongside murderers and terrorists. She describes the experience as ‘frustrating and scary’ but is ‘taking it one day at a time’. Melissa tells friends that Michaella, from Northern Ireland, is ‘like a sister to me now’. Writing to friends at home in Glasgow from Virgen de Fatima prison, Melissa says: ‘Makes me sick to think I was meant to still be having the summer of a lifetime in beefa [Ibiza] baby but instead I am in a woman’s prison in Peru. I suppose it hasn’t quite hit home.’ After complaining that she misses her mother’s cooking, Melissa describes to another friend how she witnessed a hungry inmate sucking chicken bones, calling it ‘a different ball game’. At the prison, the women undergo a military-style regime. There is a head count at 6am, the inmates are locked in their cells from 6pm and lights go out at 9pm. Melissa and Michaella face up to three years there while they await trial. They are forced to take cold showers, which often cut out, and are confined to their cell most of the day. They are kept isolated from the main prison population while officials monitor their progress. Writing to her friends, Melissa said: ‘I am taking it day by day. It’s too hard to look at the long term as I will drive myself insane!’ To another friend she wrote: ‘If it was someone I knew in this position I would set up like a petition for David Cameron or something? I don’t know if it will help but surely it will put pressure on them! I just wish we were back having the summer of our lives everything is so f****d up now!’ She added: ‘My 21st [birthday] will be in a Peruvian prison ahhh!!!!’ The pair could spend up to three years in jail in Peru as they await their trial. Last night, Melissa’s father, William, bid an emotional goodbye to his daughter as he prepared to fly back to Britain. Breaking down in tears, Melissa told him: ‘I’m going to find it so hard not knowing when I’ll next see you or Mum.’ Mr Reid said: ‘I think prison has been a reality check for them both. They now know that this is going to be where they’re going to spend a considerable period of time. ‘Melissa has always been looking forward to my next visit but when I’m gone, she’ll not know when she’ll see her family again. ‘I’ve tried to explain to her why I think she should plead guilty. She is guilty of transporting drugs, but she can say she’s sorry for those actions and the hurt and misery it’s brought to her family. She’s just got to take the medicine that goes with that and move on.’","completion":"In a recent article, two British women, Melissa Reid and Michaella McCollum Connolly, were accused of attempting to smuggle £1.5 million worth of cocaine out of Peru. The women's stories were dismissed by the lawyer who prepared the preliminary case against them, Dr. Juan Mendoza Abarca, head of the state attorney's office anti-drugs unit. According to him, their refusal to confess increases their prospect of facing 15 years in prison. Dr. Mendoza Abarca stated that the women's excuses were \\"very well practised,\\" they had been coached in what to say, and their \\"demeanour did not suggest that they had been threatened.\\" He also mentioned that the accused had no proof to back up any of their claims. Melissa Reid's father, William, believes she should plead guilty. Dr. Mendoza Abarca interviewed the women for three hours and thinks that they will end up pleading guilty to get a shorter sentence. He also shared that it is evident they were trained and prepared for the possibility of being caught. The Mail on Sunday uncovered additional information about the women's capture at Lima airport. The case is now in the hands of the judiciary, but Dr. Mendoza Abarca's remarks provide a stark assessment of the women's hopes of proving their innocence. If the accused continue to plead not guilty, they will receive a minimum of eight and a maximum of 15 years behind bars, warns Dr. Mendoza Abarca. He further explains that their stories were too superficial and they could have come forward before. The authorities in Peru and their home country would have done everything necessary to protect their families and catch the real bosses, but the women did not choose that path. Dr. Mendoza Abarca also dismissed the possibility that the women were sacrificed to let a bigger load of drugs through. He stated that once the girls had been caught, all flights were put on high alert. He added that CCTV of the girls' movements before going to the airport showed that nobody was holding a gun to their head. Currently, Reid and Connolly are spending time in a Peruvian prison, facing a military-style regime. The pair could spend up to three years in jail in Peru as they await their trial. Writing to her friends, Melissa Reid expressed her disappointment over missing the summer in Ibiza and spending her 21st birthday in a Peruvian prison. Melissa's father, William, has tried to explain to her why he thinks she should plead guilty."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Ayers, who has young triplets, had long planned to leave the administration at the end of the year, and had only agreed to serve in an interim basis through next spring. Ayers will run a pro-Trump super PAC, according to a person familiar with his plans who was not authorized to discuss them by name.

Kelly, whose last day on the job is set to be Jan. 2, had been credited with imposing order on a chaotic West Wing after his arrival in June 2017 from his post as homeland security secretary.

Article: More and more pupils are giving teachers presents, but the practice only creates insecurity in parents and staff. I've certainly noticed some pupils being feverishly overgenerous of late. Last year, I received not one bottle of wine but four for helping a disaffected pupil through his GCSEs. By and large, my colleagues report the gifts differing along gender lines. Gentlemen get ties, mugs, booze and, if they're really lucky, tickets to football matches. The ladies are often presented with flowers, jewels, chocolates and so on. When my son was at private school, I noticed there was a real competitiveness between the students about giving presents to teachers, with expensive baskets from fancy stores and huge bouquets being handed out on the last days of term. Since my wife and I only let my son give thank-you cards, it was clear we were not \\"classy\\". Now he is at an inner-city primary, we've noticed that this kind of _ seems to have more or less disappeared. For one thing, there isn't that kind of money floating around - but there isn't that kind of competitive culture either. Personally, I think gifts to teachers should be banned beyond the thank-you card: they cause many more problems than they solve, creating insecurity in both parents and staff. Perhaps the recession and the lack of money in people's pockets might be a good excuse for the government to issue some guidelines to schools that gifts shouldn't be accepted by teachers. The gifts that I really value are the cards which say a genuine thank you. I still keep them in a file at home.

Born on 1st March 1981, Singh, from a young age, displayed immense interested and talent in football. Recognizing this, he was incepted into Tata FA, one of the reputable youth football academies in India, where he gained formal training from 1996 to 1998. This early initiation into the world of football laid the foundation for Singh's illustrious career in the sport. Kickstarting his professional career, Singh joined the prestigious Tata Bank football club in 1998. He showcased commendable skills and versatility, primarily playing as a winger. Over the years, Singh continued to elevate his career, demonstrating his talent with other famed clubs including Mahindra United, Mohun Bagan, Salgaocar, Prayag United, and ITI Limited. His years in these teams spanned from 1998 to 2013, with loan stints in between. In 2002, Singh enjoyed a stint with Mahindra United, a time during which he began to receive acknowledgement at the national level. Following this, he shifted to the Kolkata-based Mohun Bagan in 2005. He then returned to Mahindra United for a three-year period from 2007-2010. After a brief stint with Salgaocar in 2010-2011, he moved on to Prayag United. In 2013, Singh took on a new challenge when he started playing for the United Sikkim Football Club on loan from IMG Reliance. This stint with United Sikkim FC gave Singh a new platform to display his skills, contributing significantly towards the club's prestige. However, Singh's accomplishments weren't limited to the football club territory. He also made striking contributions to his country, representing the Indian National Football team beginning 2003. Even though he predominantly served as a winger, Singh earned a total of 8 caps for India which signifies his major contributions at the national level. Despite not scoring any goals at the international level, his skills, agility, and presence on the field have been invaluable to the team. Singh's physical attributes also lent considerably to his successful career. At 1.70 meters tall, he possessed the perfect height for his winger position, able to maintain agility and speed on the field. Today, Lukaram James Singh stands as one of the celebrated figures in Indian football, remembering for his impressive stints with multiple top-tier clubs as well as his dedicated service to the Indian National team.

They're late to meet with some \\"important people.\\" They find a badly injured dog that was obviously abandoned after a dogfight, and Monty wants to first shoot the dog with Kostya's gun (as a mercy killing) and then when he sees what a scrapper the pup is, he decides to save the dog. He grabs it in his jacket, and sticks it in his trunk, and though the dog bites him, he's very impressed with that fighting spirit. They drive on.PRESENT: Monty is sitting at the pier with the dog, whom he named Doyle. It's early morning; people are jogging. A strung out junkie comes to Monty begging for a fix, and Monty tells him to go to Harlem, because he's been \\"touched\\" and is out of the business. The junkie just doesn't seem to get it, says he's been coming to Monty for 5 years and that he'll remember this! He lurches off, and Monty wanders away with Doyle.Monty and Doyle walk along the streets of NYC, and end up on the campus of what looks like a private prep school. Monty stands looking at a display of sports trophies and old photos, til a school administrator confronts him and tells him to leave with the dog. He tells her that he used to go to this school, and was on the basketball team, was doing well til he was kicked out of the school for fighting. She thaws a little bit as he shows her himself in the photo and says he held some big record. She tells him that record was broken just last year, and she knows because she coaches the girls' team. He's a little taken aback/wistful. He asks if she could help him find Jake Elinsky, his friend.In a classroom, Jakob \\"Jake\\" Elinsky (Philip Seymour Hoffman) is teaching his poetry class.

Movie plot title: Waking Life Movie plot: Waking Life is about an unnamed[3] young man living an ethereal existence that lacks transitions between everyday events and that eventually progresses toward an existential crisis. For most of the film he observes quietly but later participates actively in philosophical discussions involving other charactersâranging from quirky scholars and artists to everyday restaurant-goers and friendsâabout such issues as metaphysics, free will, social philosophy, and the meaning of life. Other scenes do not even include the protagonist's presence, but rather, focus on a random isolated person, group of people, or couple engaging in such topics from a disembodied perspective. Along the way, the film touches also upon existentialism, situationist politics, posthumanity, the film theory of AndrÃ© Bazin, and lucid dreaming, and makes references to various celebrated intellectual and literary figures by name. Gradually, the protagonist begins to realize that he is living out a perpetual dream, broken up only by occasional false awakenings. So far he is mostly a passive onlooker, though this changes during a chat with a passing woman who suddenly approaches him. After she greets him and shares her creative ideas with him, he reminds himself that she is a figment of his own dreaming imagination. Afterwards, he starts to converse more openly with other dream characters, but he begins to despair about being trapped in a dream. The protagonist's final talk is with a character who looks somewhat similar to the protagonist himself and whom he briefly encountered previously, earlier in the film. This last conversation reveals this other character's understanding that reality may be only a single instant that the individual interprets falsely as time (and, thus, life); that living is simply the individual's constant negation of God's invitation to become one with the universe; that dreams offer a glimpse into the infinite nature of reality; and that in order to be free from the illusion called life, the individual need only to...

High salt concentrations can negatively affect a butterfly's habitat. Increased salt content in the soil can alter the types and growth rates of plants, which provide essential food and shelter for butterflies during their life cycle.

He candied apples, pears, plums, and quince. He didn't candy oranges, blueberries, apricots and peaches. Which fruit retained their quality longer, apples or peaches? Hint: Candied fruit, also known as crystallized fruit or glacé fruit, has existed since the 14th century. Whole fruit, smaller pieces of fruit, or pieces of peel, are placed in heated sugar syrup, which absorbs the moisture from within the fruit and eventually preserves it. Depending on size and type of fruit, this process of preservation can take from several days to several months.[1] This process allows the fruit to retain its quality for a year.[2] The continual process of drenching the fruit in syrup causes the fruit to become saturated with sugar, preventing the growth of spoilage microorganisms due to the unfavourable osmotic pressure this creates.[3] A:","completion":"To determine which fruit retained their quality longer between apples and peaches, we need to consider both fresh and candied versions of these fruits. It is important to note that the candying process allows the fruit to retain its quality for up to a year. However, we need to compare the shelf-life of fresh apples and peaches to fully answer the question. Apples are known for their relatively long storage life when compared to other fruits. If stored in optimal conditions (cool, dark, and slightly humid), the quality of fresh apples can be maintained from a few weeks up to several months, depending on the apple variety. Some apple varieties, like Granny Smith and Fuji, can stay fresh for an even longer period when stored properly. On the other hand, peaches are a relatively perishable fruit. If left at room temperature, a ripe peach will usually only last for about a week. Peaches can be stored in the refrigerator for a longer storage life, but even then, they will typically stay fresh for only about two weeks. With this information, we can now compare the shelf-life of apples and peaches: 1. Candied apples: As mentioned earlier, the candying process allows the fruit to retain its quality for up to a year. 2. Fresh apples: Depending on the variety and storage conditions, fresh apples can last from a few weeks up to several months. 3. Candied peaches: Like candied apples, the candying process allows the fruit to retain its quality for up to a year. 4. Fresh peaches: When stored in the refrigerator, fresh peaches can last up to two weeks. Considering both fresh and candied forms, apples in general have a longer shelf-life when compared to peaches. Fresh apples can last up to several months, while fresh peaches can only last up to two weeks. Additionally, both candied apples and candied peaches have a similar shelf-life of up to a year due to the preservation method. Therefore, apples are better at retaining their quality for a longer period compared to peaches."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

He is specifically interested in ant species Acromyrmex heyeri. This semester he studied this ant in Americas. First day when he studied the ants the temperature was 10 degree Centigrade. In the second day of his study the temperature rose to 25 degree Centigrade. In the third day of his study the air humidity was high. But in the fourth day of his study air humidity dropped. David wants to continue his study of this same ant species in Asia next semester. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which day David would see openings in the nest hatch open, third day or fourth day? Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided, it can be inferred that David would likely see openings in the nest hatch on the fourth day of his study. This is because ants, like many other organisms, are sensitive to changes in temperature and humidity. When the temperature rose from 10°C on the first day to 25°C on the second day, the ants in the Acromyrmex heyeri colony may have become more active due to the more favorable conditions. As the temperature increases, ants will move around more to forage and care for their brood. This increased activity often leads to the opening of nest hatch entrances to facilitate the flow of air and maintain the optimal temperature and humidity within the nest. On the third day, there was an increase in air humidity, which would also have an impact on the ants' behavior. High humidity levels can affect ants' ability to maintain their nests' structural integrity and possibly their foraging efficiency. Ants can respond to increased humidity by sealing the nest hatch or creating special chambers within the colony to maintain their preferred humidity levels. In this scenario, it might prevent the openings in the nest hatch from being visible or open. However, on the fourth day, the air humidity dropped, which could signal to the ants that they need to open the nest hatch to maintain the ideal conditions within the nest. As the humidity decreases, ants might increase their activity levels and promote increased airflow within the colony. Thus, it is more likely that David would see the nest hatch openings on the fourth day as the colony adjusts their behavior and environment for the lower humidity conditions. Of course, it is essential to note that David's observations may not be the same when he moves to Asia to study the same species. Environmental conditions, as well as regional behavioral differences, must be taken into consideration when studying ant species as they adapt to their unique environments. Nevertheless, based on the given information, the fourth day seems the most plausible day for observing the nest hatch openings in the Acromyrmex heyeri ants."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Use information from the paragraph to answer the question. Question: A small nation decided to ramp up its production capabilities and built several large factories. Would the river next to the factories have more hazardous waste or less hazardous waste?? Paragraph : Nations that have more industry produce more hazardous waste.","completion":"Based on the information given in the text paragraph, it can be concluded that the river next to the factories in the small nation would likely have more hazardous waste. The paragraph clearly indicates a correlation between industrialization and the production of hazardous waste, stating that, \\"Nations that have more industry produce more hazardous waste.\\" With this, it is reasonable to infer that an increase in industrial activity often brings an increase in the production of hazardous waste. Now, applying this understanding to the question details about a small nation deciding to increase its industrial capacity by building several large factories, we can infer a probable increase in hazardous waste creation. Factories, especially on a large scale, are typically known for manufacturing processes that often produce various forms of waste, including hazardous ones. This is due to the utilization of different materials, chemicals, or production processes that generate waste as a byproduct. It's also pertinent to note that the factories are stated to be next to a river. This implies a likelihood for the waste to find its way into the river either through direct dumping, runoff, accidental spillage or through seepage into groundwater that eventually feeds into the river. Such pollution could have detrimental effects on the river's ecosystem, including the water quality and the variety of life that it supports. However, it's important to remember that these conclusions are assumptive and depend on various factors in real scenarios. For instance, if the small nation enforces strict environmental guidelines and the factories have advanced and effective waste management systems in place to securely contain and properly dispose of hazardous waste, the impact on the river could be minimal despite the increase in industrial activity. But, lacking specifics to this effect, the most straightforward answer, based on the data given, is that the river next to the factories in the small nation would likely have more hazardous waste due to an increase in industrial production."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

If microbes can help an animal to grow and heal, then what can help an animal to grow and heal? Answer choices: - food - heat - bones - energy - cells - microbes - glycogen - proteins","completion":"To answer this question, let us consider each of the given answer choices step by step: 1. Food - Food provides essential nutrients, vitamins, and minerals required for an animal's growth and healing. It is the primary source of energy, and the building blocks for cells, tissues, and organs. 2. Heat - Heat can be beneficial for an animal's healing in some contexts, such as maintaining optimal body temperature for proper functioning. However, it is not a primary factor in growth and healing. 3. Bones - Bones provide structural support for an animal's body, and their growth and repair are essential, particularly during the healing process. However, they are not the primary factor or direct contributor to overall growth and healing. 4. Energy - An animal requires energy for all its metabolic processes, including growth and healing. Though necessary, energy alone is not enough to ensure an animal's growth and healing. 5. Cells - Cells underlie every single process in an animal's body. They multiply and differentiate to contribute to growth and healing, thus playing a vital role. 6. Microbes - As mentioned in the question, microbes can indeed support an animal's growth and healing by contributing to digestion and overall gut health, enhancing immunity, and promoting the synthesis of essential vitamins. 7. Glycogen - Glycogen is a stored form of energy derived from carbohydrates. Although it plays a role in providing energy for an animal, it is not the primary factor for growth and healing. 8. Proteins - Proteins are essential for an animal's growth and healing as they are the building blocks of cells, tissues, and organs. They play a critical role in various processes, including muscle rebuilding and repairing damaged tissues during healing. In conclusion, considering the answer choices given, several factors can help an animal grow and heal. Those factors can include food (source of nutrients), cells (essential for growth and regeneration), microbes (aiding gut health and immunity), and proteins (building blocks for growth and repair)."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

(2:11) AUGUSTA, Ga. -- Dustin Johnson took a serious fall on a staircase Wednesday and injured his lower back, and his manager said it was uncertain whether the world's No. 1 golfer would be able to play in the Masters. It was a stunning development on an otherwise quiet day at Augusta National, where the course was shut down at 1:30 p.m. ET because of storms. The real calamity struck a few hours later. Dustin Johnson took what his agent called a \\"serious fall\\" down a staircase at his rental home on Wednesday, a day before the Masters is set to begin. Andrew Redington/Getty Images David Winkle, Johnson's manager at Hambric Sports, said his client fell on the bare wood stairs at the home he is renting in Augusta. Johnson's trainer, Joey Diovisalvi, told Masters Radio on SiriusXM on Wednesday night that Johnson was going out to the garage to move a car when he slipped on three wooden steps. Johnson landed on his lower back and both elbows. \\"He landed very hard on his lower back and is now resting, although quite uncomfortably,\\" Winkle said in an email Wednesday. Winkle added that Johnson was advised to remain immobile and begin a regimen of anti-inflammatory medication and icing in hopes of being able to play Thursday. Diovisalvi told SiriusXM that they are optimistic Johnson will be able to play Thursday, but first they will have to see how he feels in the morning. What might help Johnson is that he is in the final group for the opening round, scheduled to tee off at 2:03 p.m. ET with two-time Masters champion Bubba Watson and PGA champion Jimmy Walker. Johnson was an 11-2 favorite to win the Masters entering Wednesday, according to the Westgate Las Vegas SuperBook. After news of his injury, his odds dropped to 7-1, the same as Jordan Spieth and Rory McIlroy. Johnson has had his share of mishaps in a major but not before the event even started.

Golfers enjoy family time at rain-soaked Par 3 With their wives and kids in tow, Webb Simpson and Bubba Watson made the most of a weather-shortened Par 3 Contest on a rainy day in Augusta by enjoying quality family time. 1 Related On Tuesday, Winkle described Johnson as being \\"in as good a shape as I've ever seen him in every aspect of his game and his life.\\" On Wednesday, Johnson was at Augusta National to play nine holes before the first wave of storms moved in. Johnson has won three straight tournaments -- including a pair of World Golf Championships -- heading into the Masters to rise to world No. 1. He had been scheduled to attend the Golf Writers Association of America annual dinner Wednesday night to accept its award as male player of the year. He was coming off a season in which he won the U.S. Open for his first major, was voted PGA Tour Player of the Year for the first time, won the PGA Tour money title and captured the Vardon Trophy for the lowest adjusted scoring average. If he is unable to play Thursday, Johnson would be the fourth world No. 1 to miss a major championship, joining McIlroy (2015 Open, ankle), Greg Norman (1988 Open, wrist) and Tiger Woods, who missed the 2014 Masters (back surgery), the 2008 Open (ACL surgery) and the 2008 PGA Championship (ACL surgery). Winkle said he would not have any further comment until he knows more about Johnson's condition. If Johnson cannot play, there are no alternates at the Masters.

His agent David Winkle says he still hopes to play tomorrow. World number one Johnson fell on the stairs on Wednesday and \\"landed hard on his lower back\\". He is said to be uncomfortable but is resting and doctors have advised him to keep the injury stable. Johnson is due to tee off in the last group at 19:03 BST on Thursday evening. \\"Dustin took a serious fall on a staircase in his Augusta rental home,\\" Winkle said in a statement. \\"He landed very hard on his lower back and is now resting, although quite uncomfortably. \\"He has been advised to remain immobile and begin a regimen of anti-inflammatory medication and icing, with the hope of being able to play tomorrow.\\" The American, 32, won his third successive tournament when he beat Spain's Jon Rahm in the World Match Play final in late March. He has won seven of the 17 tournaments he has played since claiming his first major at the US Open at Oakmont in June, racking up another seven top-10 finishes in the process. Analysis BBC golf correspondent Iain Carter: There is the adage of \\"beware the injured golfer\\" but there is no doubt this is a significant blow for Johnson. Since winning last year's US Open he has been a commanding presence and built a telling aura. Now his Masters bid is surrounded by uncertainty.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Given the background: Candied fruit, also known as crystallized fruit or glacé fruit, has existed since the 14th century. Whole fruit, smaller pieces of fruit, or pieces of peel, are placed in heated sugar syrup, which absorbs the moisture from within the fruit and eventually preserves it. Depending on size and type of fruit, this process of preservation can take from several days to several months.[1] This process allows the fruit to retain its quality for a year.[2] The continual process of drenching the fruit in syrup causes the fruit to become saturated with sugar, preventing the growth of spoilage microorganisms due to the unfavourable osmotic pressure this creates.[3] and the situation: John enrolled in a prestigious culinary school. In the very first day his instructor was showing different processes used on fruits. One of them was glace fruit. He showed the class how to prepare glace fruit and kept some of the glace fruits on bowl A. To compare glace fruits with non glace fruits he kept some non glace fruits on bowl B. Answer the following question: Which fruits would not develop unfavorable osmotic pressure, bowl A or bowl B? A:","completion":"Bowl B would be the fruits that would not develop unfavorable osmotic pressure. In Bowl A, the glace or candied fruits have undergone a preservation process in which they are saturated with sugar syrup, which causes them to develop a high osmotic pressure. This high osmotic pressure creates an unfavorable environment for spoilage microorganisms to grow, thus preserving the fruits for an extended period of time. In Bowl B, the non-glace fruits have not been subjected to the candying process and, as a result, they retain their natural moisture, sugar levels, and osmotic pressure. These fruits are more likely to support the growth of spoilage microorganisms, as they lack the high osmotic pressure that would deter microbial growth. In summary, the fruits in Bowl A (the glace fruits) will have unfavorable osmotic pressure preventing the growth of spoilage microorganisms, whereas the fruits in Bowl B (the non-glace fruits) will not develop this unfavorable osmotic pressure."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write highlights for this article: Donington Park has been forced to cancel this year's British round of MotoGP due to the failure of Circuit of Wales (CoW) bosses to fulfil funding obligations. Last year MotoGP rights holders Dorna signed a five-year agreement with CoW from 2015, despite the fact construction work had yet to commence on the troubled Ebbw Vale facility. It resulted in CoW turning to Donington Park chiefs for assistance for this year, believing they would then be able to take up the running of the event. The British Grand Prix in the MotoGP championship is in turmoil after Donington Park pulled out of hosting the 2015 race. Above is the start of the 2014 Grand Prix which took place at Silverstone. CoW, however, continues to face numerous planning hurdles which have clearly had a knock-on effect with regard to the distribution of funds, resulting in delays paying Donington Park. A statement from Donington Park Racing Ltd (DPRL) read: 'The situation at 10th February 2015 is very clear. 'Despite DPRL's best efforts, the time lost with CoW being unable to complete the funding arrangements has resulted in delays in almost all of the event's critically-important operational plans, from track works to equipment hire. 'Therefore, in the judgement of the board of DPRL, this current position could jeopardise the safe and successful running of the 2015 British MotoGP at Donington to such an extent that both the commercial risks and the lack of time are now too great to allow Donington to proceed. 'Therefore, Donington Park must withdraw from any further participation. Donington Park had previously held the British Grand Prix from 1987 through to 2009, with Australia's Casey Stoner (above) winning on a Ducati in 2008. 'Consequently, the 2015 British round of the FIM MotoGP World Championship will not now be held at Donington Park on August 30th 2015.' Christopher Tate, Donington Park managing director, has naturally expressed his bitter disappointment at the fact the race will not now take place at his circuit. 'The whole Donington team who have worked so hard here over the past six months to fulfil our part of the MotoGP planning are as disappointed as the many fans will be who wanted to see the event return to Donington Park,' said Tate. 'The position we are now in is, of course, frustrating and uncomfortable for all concerned. 'We have our overall business, our staff and their futures to consider, as well as our concerns for the fans. 'We have rebuilt so much of this facility and its global reputation in the years since 2010 under new ownership and management. The British round of the 2015 MotoGP season is now without a venue, with Silverstone one alternative. 'We are not going to risk all that, nor risk affecting the quality of the MotoGP fans' experience - looking after the fans is at the heart of what Donington does. 'It is this week, way past any normal deadlines, when we - in partnership with CoW - would have been committing to major expenditures. 'CoW have made it clear to us they are not now in a position to complete, so we have to withdraw and end the planned arrangement.' Donington has confirmed all fans who purchased tickets will be given a full refund due to their monies being held in an escrow account. It now remains to be seen whether CoW will turn to Silverstone, who held the event from 2010-2014, but like Donington they will require financial guarantees, and time may also be too short.

At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 81, based on 13 reviews, which indicates \\"generally favorable reviews\\". MusicOMH's Max Raymond has praised the album as being \\"engrossing\\" due to the emotional depth of the lyrics as well as the warm and relaxed sound of the studio recording. Will Hermes of Rolling Stone gave the album a mixed review, praising the vocal harmonies. The diversity in sound was highlighted by AbsolutePunk's Gregory Robson, Jason Schneider of Exclaim! and The A.V. Club's Chris Martins, ranging from electric blues to psychedelia as well as the atypical lyrics from Guthrie—focusing on the city of Los Angeles rather than his communist-leaning politics and Dustbowl tragedy narratives. American Songwriters Evan Schlansky noted the same apolitical tone of the lyrics, but qualified that with Yames' delivery on \\"My Revolutionary Mind\\". He praised the album's diversity as a strength, allowing each vocalist an opportunity to display his unique talents. Writing for Los Angeles Times, Randy Lewis agrees that the songwriting diversity is a strength, comparing individual tracks with R.E.M., The Velvet Underground, Richard Thompson, and John Mellencamp. Graham Reid of The New Zealand Herald also notes similarities to R.E.M., fellow Guthrie admirer Bob Dylan, The Byrds, and Eagles. The PopMatters review by Jeff Strowe points out the blues influences in the album, adding to its emotional depth. About.com's Kim Ruehl has criticized the diversity and complexity of the album as contrary to the simplicity of Guthrie's actual recordings, concluding that \\"If this weren't presented so staunchly as being at least part 'Woody Guthrie album,' it might be a little easier to swallow.\\" Doug Collette of All About Jazz also reviewed the deluxe edition bonus disc, comparing it favorably to the proper album as well as the previous Farrar–Parker collaboration Gob Iron.

Context: The U.S. has long had the unenviable distinction of holding the world's largest prison population, in part because of tough-on-crime policies enacted in the 1990s. But sentencing reforms passed in recent years appear to have made a dent, leading to declines in the population over the past eight years. A criminal justice reform organization reported Friday that in 2017, the U.S. prison population dropped below 1.5 million for the first time in more than a decade. The decline, according to the Washington-based Vera Institute for Justice, was driven by a sharp decrease in the number of inmates in federal prisons and decreases in several states with large prison populations. Total U.S. prison population dropped to 1,486,000 last year, a decline of nearly 16,000. The number of federal prisoners fell to 183,000, and the number of inmates in state prisons declined to 1.3 million, according to the report. (The overall figure does not include the more than 600,000 defendants held in local, state and federal jails.) The decline extended an eight-year downward trend in U.S. prison population that has been driven by federal and state sentencing reforms enacted over the past decade. But the Vera institute cautioned that it was unclear whether the trend would continue. \\"Whether criminal justice reform can continue to fuel this sustained decline in the prison population remains to be seen,\\" said Jacob Kang-Brown, senior research associate at Vera. \\"We must continue to do the hard work, as advocates and agents of change, to ensure that all our communities feel the relief of decarceration.\\" The report came as President Donald Trump called on Congress to pass legislation to help former inmates reintegrate into society and avoid going back to prison, as many do. \\"We want former inmates to find a path to success so they can support their families and support their communities,\\" Trump said at a White House summit on prison reform attended by two state governors and Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law, who is spearheading... Question: How did the prison population drop below 1.5 million? Options: - There was a sharp increase in the number of inmates in federal prisons. - Sentencing reforms were passed in recent years. - not enough information - Tough-on-crime policies were enacted in the 1990s. The answer is:","completion":"Sentencing reforms were passed in recent years.

Led by a stellar performance from Liam Williams, who scored two tries, Scarlets defeated the reigning champions Connacht, leaving the Irish side winless at the bottom of the table. Body: 1. A turn of events for Scarlets Before this match, Scarlets had endured a challenging start to their season. However, the much-needed win against Connacht could potentially signal a turnaround in their fortunes. The victory instilled a fresh sense of belief and confidence within the squad and provided a morale boost to the players, coaching staff, and supporters. 2. Liam Williams shines in the victory The star of the match was undoubtedly Liam Williams, who scored two crucial tries that ultimately sealed the victory for Scarlets. As a versatile winger and full-back, Williams showcased his skill set and rugby intelligence throughout the game to help his team secure the crucial points that led to their first win. 3. Connacht's early season struggles The outcome of the match leaves the defending champions, Connacht, winless in their current Pro12 campaign. As the title-holders, the pressure is on for the Irish side to improve their performance and recover from their sluggish start. Coach Pat Lam will undoubtedly be looking for ways to motivate his side to turn their season around and climb up from the bottom of the league table. 4. Potential turning point for both teams This match outcome may serve as a critical turning point for both Scarlets and Connacht. With their first win in hand, Scarlets could carry their newfound momentum into future matches and continue climbing the ranks. Simultaneously, Connacht may well take this humbling defeat as a wakeup call, revisiting their training and strategies, to ensure they do not fall further behind in their title defence. Conclusion: In what could prove to be a pivotal match for both teams, Liam Williams' heroics led Scarlets to their inaugural win of the Pro12 2016-17 season, relegating defending champions Connacht to the bottom of the table without a victory to their name. With plenty of games left in the season, it remains to be seen how both teams will build upon this contest's outcome, ultimately shaping their respective campaigns."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Buhari is the first sub-Saharan African leader to have a White House summit with Trump, who has been criticized for reportedly making derogatory comments about Africa. During his public remarks with Buhari, Trump focused mostly on common goals and shared interests, such as fighting terrorism and expanding trade. \\"We love helicopters — he loves them more than I do,\\" joked Trump, referring to his administration's decision to approve a 600 million military sales deal to Nigeria. Buhari thanked Trump for approving the deal, which the administration of former President Barack Obama had suspended over allegations of human rights abuses. \\"I worked it out so that now you can buy the helicopters that you want,\\" Trump said, adding, \\"We make the best military equipment in the world, and our friends can now buy it.\\" Human rights groups have accused the Nigerian military of torture, rape and extrajudicial killing in its almost decade-long campaign against the Boko Haram extremist group. Tens of thousands of people have been killed in the insurgency, and hundreds of schoolgirls kidnapped, as the group gained notoriety and spread to neighboring countries, posing one of the most severe threats to West Africa's Sahel region in recent years. Although Nigeria has been a major partner in the U.S. fight against Islamist extremists in Africa, relations have faced challenges over the past year. In January, Nigeria joined a list of outraged African countries demanding an explanation from the U.S. ambassador after Trump's reported vulgar comments referring to African countries. Asked whether those comments came up during his private meeting with Trump, Buhari declined to comment. \\"I'm very careful with what the press says about other than myself.

Question: For a commuter rushito catch a train, a minute can mean the difference between dinner with the family and foods in the microwave. What most passengers don't realize is that their minute is already there. Every commuter train that departs from New York Cityabout 900 a d leaves a minute later than scheduled. If the timetable says 8:14, the train will actually leave at 8:15.In other words, if you think you have only a minute to get that trainwell, relax. You have two. The courtesy minute , in place for decades and published only in private timetables for employees, is meant for those who need the extra time to get off the platform and onto the train. \\"If everyone knows they get an extra minute, they're going to waste time doing unimportant things,\\" explained Marjorie Anders, a spokeswoman for the Metro-North Railroad. Told of this article, Ms. Anders laughed. \\"Don't blow our cover!\\"she said. Entirely hidden from the riding public, the secret minute is an odd departure from the railroad culture of down-to-the-second accuracy. The railroad industry helped invent the concept* of standard time, and time zones were established in the United States in the 1880s, 35 years before they were written into law. And most commuters know their train by the accurate minute it departs. The trains quickly make up the minute:at all other stops, the public timetable is carried out. The courtesy minute does not exist at commuter railroads in Chicago, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, or San Francisco. But in New York, the secret minute dates back decades. \\"That's been done forever, from my knowledge,\\" said Jack Swanberg, 70, an unofficial historian of Metro-North. \\"I was the trainmaster starting in 1970 and I'm sure it's been the case since 1870 for all I know.\\" What can we conclude from the passage?

How was the character Subtle known in the title of a play by Ben Jonson????","completion":"The character Subtle is known in the title of a play by Ben Jonson as \\"The Alchemist.\\" The full title of the play is \\"The Alchymist, or the Comical Elixir: A Comedy.\\" Ben Jonson, an accomplished Elizabethan playwright, wrote this Jacobean-era play in 1610. It is a satirical comedy that underscores the greed, gullibility, and folly of the English society of the time. Subtle, the Alchemist, is one of the primary characters in the play. He conspires with two other principal characters, Face (a butler named Jeremy) and Dol Common (a prostitute), to swindle their targets by taking advantage of their desire to achieve quick wealth and social success. Subtle presents himself as a knowledgeable, skilled, and well-connected alchemist who can transform base metals into gold, perform mystical healing, and engage in various pursuits of self-improvement. Throughout the play, Subtle's primary role is to manipulate his targets through elaborate schemes and false promises, extracting wealth and even high social status from them. He pretends to have connections with various influential figures, access to information about royalty, and insight into secret techniques for advancing one's position in life. By feigning expertise in alchemy, astrology, and other supernatural fields, Subtle gains the trust of his victims and leads them further into his elaborate con. His character serves to criticize the widespread interest in occultism and supernatural practices that thrived during the Renaissance, as well as the human tendency to be excessively greedy, especially those who sought shortcuts to wealth and power. The Alchemist demonstrates the pitfalls of such beliefs and behaviors while entertaining its audience with Subtle's cunning schemes and the comical interactions between the characters. Ben Jonson's play explores themes of deceit, exploitation, and personal ambition, painting a portrait of a society where people were easily swayed by the allure of quick solutions to their problems. Through Subtle, Jonson reminds the audience about the importance of vigilance, skepticism, and awareness of our own vulnerabilities. By presenting these lessons in a humorous and satirical manner, Jonson effectively conveys a moral message while keeping his audience engaged in this delightful farce."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This is due to the greenhouse effect, which is caused by greenhouse gases, which trap heat inside the Earth's atmosphere because of their more complex molecular structure which allows them to vibrate and in turn trap heat and release it back towards the Earth. This warming is also responsible for the extinction of natural habitats, which in turn leads to a reduction in wildlife population.The most recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (the group of the leading climate scientists in the world) concluded that the earth will warm anywhere from 2.7 to almost 11 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 to 6 degrees Celsius) between 1990 and 2100. Please answer this question : Will the number of animals increase or decrease under Jessica's plan? A:","completion":"Under Jessica's plan, the number of animals is likely to decrease. Her proposal to emit more anthropogenic gases would exacerbate the issues associated with global warming and climate change. As the Earth's atmosphere becomes more saturated with greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, the greenhouse effect would intensify, leading to a rapid increase in global temperatures. As mentioned in the given information, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has projected a significant rise in global temperatures by 2100. This increase in temperature would have a wide range of negative impacts on the environment and wildlife populations. Warmer temperatures can result in the loss of natural habitats, such as ice caps, coral reefs, and forests. These habitats are crucial for the survival of countless animal species. Furthermore, the changing climate conditions can disrupt the delicate balance of ecosystems and food chains, leading to an imbalance in predator-prey relationships, competition for resources, and increased vulnerability to diseases. These factors can contribute to a decline in animal populations and potentially drive some species towards extinction. Additionally, extreme weather events, which are expected to become more frequent due to climate change, can cause significant harm to animal populations by disrupting their habitats and causing injury or death. In conclusion, Jessica's plan to emit more anthropogenic gases would likely lead to a decrease in animal populations due to the exacerbation of global warming, the consequent loss of natural habitats, disrupted ecosystems, and other negative effects on wildlife. Conversely, Milly's proposal of reducing carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere aligns more with the goal of saving the planet and its animals."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer this question: where does ground pepper come from? Answer:","completion":"Ground pepper, a widely used and popular spice across the globe, comes from the dried berries of the Piper nigrum plant. Piper nigrum is a perennial flowering vine, native to Southern India and Sri Lanka, but now cultivated in various tropical regions such as Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia, Brazil, and Madagascar. The plant bears small, green, unripe berries that turn red as they ripen. The resulting ground pepper differs in color (black, green, or white) depending on the time the berries are harvested and the processing method employed. Black ground pepper, which is the most common variety, is derived from the unripe green berries of the Piper nigrum plant. These berries are harvested and then blanched briefly in boiling water, a process that activates the enzyme responsible for the oxidation of the outer skin, promoting its dark coloration. The berries are then spread out in the sun or other drying methods to dry over several days. The outer skin wrinkles, and the remaining seed dries out, developing its characteristic black color and distinct pungent aroma. Once fully dried, the berries, known as black peppercorns, are ground to produce black ground pepper. Green ground pepper is produced from fresh green berries that are harvested before they ripen. Rather than being dried, these unripe berries are treated to preserve their green color, either through freeze-drying or by soaking them in a saltwater or vinegar solution. This process retains the green hue and a milder, herbaceous flavor profile compared to black pepper. After preservation, green peppercorns are ground into green ground pepper. White ground pepper, on the other hand, comes from ripe red berries. The red berries are harvested at full maturity and soaked in water for an extended period, a process that softens and loosens their outer skin. The outer skin is then removed, leaving behind the inner seed, which is pale in color. These seeds are then dried and ground to create white ground pepper. This variety has a milder and slightly less pungent flavor compared to black pepper. All three varieties (black, green, and white) of ground pepper are used in various cuisines worldwide, each imparting unique flavors to culinary dishes. Today, ground pepper is not only a primary seasoning ingredient in countless recipes but also a staple condiment on restaurant tables and in home kitchens. As a testament to its universal appeal, ground pepper remains one of the most traded commodities in the global spice market."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Kenneth Branagh attempts to turn William Shakspeare's obscure, rarely-produced comedy into a 1930s-era musical, with the result being both bad Shakespeare and bad musical comedy as the actors are rarely adept at one or the other of the two styles and in some cases flounder badly in both.

But Nichelle Nichols might have left to pursue a career on Broadway were it not for the intervention of a very unlikely Trekkie - Dr Martin Luther King Jr. Although he's best known for his rousing speeches promising a future of freedom and equality for downpressed African Americans, it transpires the civil rights leader also had in mind a far more distant future. Trailblazers: Nichelle Nichols is pictured left as Lieutenant Uhura, on board the Star Ship Enterprise. She nearly left the role after the show's first season until Dr Martin Luther King, right, persuaded her to stay. 'He said, \\"You have one of the most important roles, this is a first. It's non-stereotypical, it's brilliant, it's beauty and it's intelligence\\",' Nichols told Neil DeGrasse Tyson, the astrophysicist and broadcaster. 'He said, \\"You cannot leave, do you understand? It has been heavenly ordained. This is God's gift and onus for you. You have changed the face of television forever.\\" Now 82, Nichols 1966 debut on Star Trek as a black woman playing an educated character was groundbreaking for its time. It was the era of the Black Panthers, and of race riots in Watts, Newark and Detroit, as black communities fought to realise the potential of the Civil Rights and Voting Rights Acts passed to enshrine equality in law. Nichols pictured in 2010: Her 1966 debut on Star Trek as a black woman playing an educated character was groundbreaking for its time. But even with all the turmoil of the age, Nichols hadn't fully grasped the racial and cultural implications of her Star Trek role, still thinking of herself as just a cast member on the show. In fact, she had already decided to move on from the role and even handed her letter of resignation to producer Gene Roddenberry when she met King. 'I had been invited as a celebrity guest at a NAACP fundraiser in Beverly Hills,' she told Tyson, in the interview first aired in 2011 but still available on his website. 'One of the promoters came up and said someone wanted to meet me. He said he's your greatest fan ... I'm thinking it's a Trekker, maybe a child, maybe a young man. 'And so I turned and I see this man across the room with this brilliant smile, which you didn't often see on his face. And I remember saying to myself, 'Whoever this little Trekker is they're going to have to wait because this is my leader, Dr Martin Luther King, walking towards me with a smile on his face.\\" 'And he walks to me and with this smile he says, \\"Miss Nichols, I am your greatest fan.\\"' Nichols says King spoke to her about her role in Star Trek and how important it was to the future of the civil rights movement. He praised Roddenberry, the producer, as a visionary, adding 'we [black people] are there, because you are there.' Said to be one of the first black women to appear in a major television series in a role not portraying a servant, Nichols did prove to be an inspiration to a generation of young people. Mae Jemison, an American doctor who became the first black woman in space on board the Space Shuttle Endeavour in 1992, has said she was she was inspired to join Nasa by Nichols' portrayal of Uhura. And Nichols is also credited with having the first interracial kiss on network television, with William Shatner's Captain Kirk, during a 1968 episode of the show.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Secretariat (March 30, 1970 - October 4, 1989) was an American Thoroughbred racehorse who, in 1973, became the first Triple Crown winner in 25 years. His record-breaking win in the Belmont Stakes, where he left the field 31 lengths behind him, is widely regarded as one of the greatest races of all time. During his racing career, he won five Eclipse Awards, including Horse of the Year honors at ages two and three. He was elected to the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in 1974. The syndication deal for Secretariat precluded the horse racing past age three. Accordingly, Secretariat's last race was against older horses in the Canadian International Stakes over one and five-eighths miles on the turf at Woodbine Racetrack in Toronto, Ontario, Canada on October 28, 1973. The race was chosen in part because of long-time ties between E.P. Taylor and the Chenery family, and partly to honor Secretariat's Canadian connections, Laurin and Turcotte. Unfortunately, Turcotte missed the race with a five-day suspension: Eddie Maple got the mount. The day of the race was cold, windy and wet, but the Marshall turf course was firm. Despite the weather, some 35,000 people turned out to greet Secretariat in a \\"virtual hysteria\\" that Secretariat seemed not to notice. His biggest opponents were Kennedy Road, who he had already beaten in the Marlboro Cup, and Big Spruce, who had finished third in the Man o' War. Kennedy Road went to the early lead, while Secretariat moved to second after breaking from an outside post. On the backstretch, Secretariat made his move and forged to the lead. \\"Snorting steam in the raw twilight\\", he rounded the far turn with a 12-length lead before gearing down in the final furlong, ultimately winning by 6 1/2 lengths. Once again, many winning tickets went uncashed by souvenir hunters. After the race, Secretariat was brought to Aqueduct Racetrack where he was paraded with Turcotte dressed in the Meadow silks before a crowd of 32,990 in his final public appearance. \\"It's a sad day, and yet it's a great day\\", said Laurin. \\"I certainly wish he could run as a 4-year-old. He's a great horse and he loves to run.\\" Altogether, Secretariat won 16 of his 21 career races, with three seconds and one third, and total earnings of 1,316,808. For 1973, Secretariat was again named Horse of the Year, and won Eclipse Awards as the American Champion Three-Year-Old Male Horse and the American Champion Male Turf Horse. what happened there?","completion":"In the Canadian International Stakes, which was Secretariat's last race, he competed against older horses on the turf at Woodbine Racetrack in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

Add spaces: Tocotrienolsalsoseemtobeapowerfulwatchdogagainstbothoestrogenpositiveandoestrogennegativebreastcancercells.","completion":"Tocotrienols also seem to be a powerful watchdog against both oestrogen positive and oestrogen negative breast cancer cells. Tocotrienols are a group of compounds found in the Vitamin E family, which are known for their strong antioxidant properties and potential health benefits. Studies have shown that these compounds may have a significant impact on reducing the risk and progression of various types of cancers, including breast cancer. Breast cancer is classified into two primary categories based on the presence or absence of oestrogen receptors. Oestrogen positive breast cancers have oestrogen receptors on their surface, while oestrogen negative breast cancers do not. The presence or absence of these hormone receptors plays a crucial role in determining the appropriate treatment and prognosis for individuals with breast cancer. Research suggests that tocotrienols exhibit a protective effect against both oestrogen positive and oestrogen negative breast cancer cells. The following are some key points about how tocotrienols work against these cancer cells: 1. Antioxidant activity: The potent antioxidant properties of tocotrienols neutralize harmful free radicals and promote cellular health. By doing so, tocotrienols may prevent oxidative damage to the DNA of cells, potentially reducing the risk of mutations that can lead to cancer. 2. Anti-proliferative effect: Tocotrienols have been found to inhibit the growth of cancer cells, including breast cancer cells, by suppressing key enzymes and signalling pathways involved in cell proliferation and growth. This may help slow down or halt the progression of the disease. 3. Induction of apoptosis: Apoptosis, also known as programmed cell death, is a natural process that is essential for maintaining tissue homeostasis. Tocotrienols can induce apoptosis in cancer cells, including breast cancer cells, by triggering a chain of reactions that ultimately lead to the destruction of these cells. This can help prevent cancer from spreading further. 4. Inhibition of metastasis: Metastasis is the process by which cancer cells spread from the primary tumor site to other parts of the body. Tocotrienols have been shown to inhibit the migration, invasion, and adhesion of breast cancer cells, potentially reducing the risk of metastatic progression. 5. Hormone-mediated effects: Tocotrienols have been shown to exhibit hormone-mediated effects that can potentially impact the growth and proliferation of oestrogen positive breast cancer cells. They may modulate hormone signalling pathways or directly interact with oestrogen receptors, blocking the effects of oestrogen and thus inhibiting the growth of cancer cells. In conclusion, tocotrienols appear to be a powerful watchdog against both oestrogen positive and oestrogen negative breast cancer cells, demonstrating their potential as a therapeutic agent for the prevention or treatment of this prevalent disease. Furthermore, tocotrienols may be beneficial for overall health due to their antioxidant properties and ability to support the immune system."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Nitrogen oxides are formed when atmospheric nitrogen reacts with oxygen at the high temperatures found in a car engine. Carbon monoxide is a by-product of incomplete combustion of hydrocarbons. Evaporated and unused fuel releases volatile hydrocarbons into the atmosphere to help form smog. The presence of a catalytic converter in the exhaust system of the car causes these materials to react and be changed into less harmful products. Now, I have a new situation: Hill town was full of gasoline powered vehicles, while Valley town 50 miles away, banned all gas powered vehicles and allows only electrical vehicles or horse-and-buggies. Answer this question please: Which town had more evaporated and unused fuel? A:","completion":"Considering the provided background information and the given situation, it can be deduced that Hill town had more evaporated and unused fuel. This conclusion is based on the fact that Hill town was full of gasoline-powered vehicles, which, as stated in the background, release evaporated and unused fuel into the atmosphere, contributing to smog formation. The emissions from these vehicles contain volatile hydrocarbons that are released when gasoline evaporates or when fuel remains unburned. On the other hand, Valley town banned all gas-powered vehicles and allowed only electric vehicles or horse-and-buggies. Electric vehicles do not run on gasoline, so there would be no evaporated or unused fuel emissions from these vehicles. Horse-and-buggies, being a non-motorized mode of transport, do not produce evaporated and unused fuel emissions either. Thus, it is evident that Hill town, with its prevalent gasoline-powered vehicles, had a higher amount of evaporated and unused fuel emissions compared to Valley town, which utilized cleaner modes of transportation, resulting in fewer pollutants being released into the environment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize the following: Not all hiking trips will be the same and there are varying styles of backpacks that can meet the demands of these differences. Depending on the length of your hike and the gear you need to carry you will need to purchase a backpack with the correct frame style. Backpacks with external frames are mainly used for heavy and asymmetrical loads. An internal frame backpack might be right for you if you need to maintain stability and don't need to carry heavy items. Frame-less backpacks are for those hikers who don't need to carry much gear with them and like to move quickly on their hike. Hiking backpacks will need to be fitted exactly to the size of your torso. Any backpack that isn't the right size won't fit correctly and will be uncomfortable or may cause injury. Measure your torso's length and hip width before you buy your backpack to ensure a great fit. Measure your torso's length by starting from the top bump at the base of your neck down to your hip level. Measure your hips to make sure that the hip belt will fit. Your hip measurement will be taken just above where your pants normally rest. Before you load up your backpack and head out hiking you will need to properly fit your backpack. Try wearing your backpack and then making adjustments using the straps on your backpack where needed. There will generally be four main areas to adjust including the hip-belt, shoulder straps, load lifters, and sternum straps. The hip-belt should fit snugly around your hips and will support much of the weight. Shoulder straps should pull the bag tight against your back but not actually carry much of the weight. Some backpacks will have load-lifting straps. These should relieve the weight from your shoulders and help keep it properly distributed. The sternum strap will pull the weight up and away from your shoulders and should fight tightly and comfortably across your chest. When it comes to hiking backpacks, it is ideal to visit a store where you can try on the backpacks in person. Although you might know your measurements, each backpack might fight differently in actuality. Try on plenty of backpacks before purchasing one to make sure you find the right fit. If you are unable to visit a store you may still be able to try a backpack and return it free of charge if the manufacturer allows for it. Summary:","completion":"Hiking backpacks come in different styles, including external frame, internal frame, and frame-less, to cater to varying hike lengths, gear requirements, and hiker preferences. To ensure the right fit, measure your torso length and hip width before purchasing a backpack. Proper fitting involves adjusting the hip-belt, shoulder straps, load lifters, and sternum straps as necessary. Ideally, try on backpacks in a store for the best fit, or choose a manufacturer that allows returns if the fit is not right."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

After the 1998 embassy bombings, the U.S. government tried to develop a clearer picture of Bin Laden's finances. A U.S. interagency group traveled to Saudi Arabia twice, in 1999 and 2000, to get information from the Saudis about their understanding of those finances. The group eventually concluded that the oft-repeated assertion that Bin Laden was funding al Qaeda from his personal fortune was in fact not true. The officials developed a new theory: al Qaeda was getting its money elsewhere, and the United States needed to focus on other sources of funding, such as charities, wealthy donors, and financial facilitators. Ultimately, although the intelligence community devoted more resources to the issue and produced somewhat more intelligence, it remained difficult to distinguish al Qaeda's financial transactions among the vast sums moving in the international financial system. The CIA was not able to find or disrupt al Qaeda's money flows. The NSC staff thought that one possible solution to these weaknesses in the intelligence community was to create an all-source terrorist-financing intelligence analysis center. Clarke pushed for the funding of such a center at Treasury, but neither Treasury nor the CIA was willing to commit the resources. Within the United States, various FBI field offices gathered intelligence on organizations suspected of raising funds for al Qaeda or other terrorist groups. By 9/11, FBI agents understood that there were extremist organizations operating within the United States supporting a global jihadist movement and with substantial connections to al Qaeda. The FBI operated a web of informants, conducted electronic surveillance, and had opened significant investigations in a number of field offices, including New York, Chicago, Detroit, San Diego, and Minneapolis. On a national level, however, the FBI never used the information to gain a systematic or strategic understanding of the nature and extent of al Qaeda fundraising. Treasury regulators, as well as U.S. financial institutions, were generally focused on finding and deterring or disrupting the vast flows of U.S. currency generated by drug trafficking and high-level international fraud. Large-scale scandals, such as the use of the Bank of New York by Russian money launderers to move millions of dollars out of Russia, captured the attention of the Department of the Treasury and of Congress. Before 9/11, Treasury did not consider terrorist financing important enough to mention in its national strategy for money laundering.

Question: Given the following context: In 1870, concerned at the dominance of German music and the lack of opportunity for young French composers to have their works played, Saint-Saëns and Romain Bussine, professor of singing at the Conservatoire, discussed the founding of a society to promote new French music. Before they could take the proposal further, the Franco-Prussian War broke out. Saint-Saëns served in the National Guard during the war. During the brief but bloody Paris Commune that followed, his superior at the Madeleine, the Abbé Deguerry, was murdered by rebels; Saint-Saëns was fortunate to escape to temporary exile in England where he arrived in May 1871. With the help of George Grove and others he supported himself while there, giving recitals. Returning to Paris in the same year, he found that anti-German sentiments had considerably enhanced support for the idea of a pro-French musical society. The Société Nationale de Musique, with its motto, \\"Ars Gallica\\", had been established in February 1871, with Bussine as president, Saint-Saëns as vice-president and Henri Duparc, Fauré, Franck and Jules Massenet among its founder-members. As an admirer of Liszt's innovative symphonic poems, Saint-Saëns enthusiastically adopted the form; his first \\"poème symphonique\\" was Le Rouet d'Omphale (1871), premiered at a concert of the Sociéte Nationale in January 1872. In the same year, after more than a decade of intermittent work on operatic scores, Saint-Saëns finally had one of his operas staged. La princesse jaune (\\"The Yellow Princess\\"), a one-act, light romantic piece, was given at the Opéra-Comique, Paris in June. It ran for five performances.Throughout the 1860s and early 1870s, Saint-Saëns had continued to live a bachelor existence, sharing a large fourth-floor flat in the Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré with his mother. In 1875, he surprised many by marrying. The groom was approaching forty and his bride was nineteen; she was Marie-Laure Truffot, the sister of one of the composer's pupils.

What might be the first step of the process? A:","completion":"The first step in the recycling process, as described, involves the collection and transportation of recyclable materials to a recycling center. This step typically starts at residential homes and businesses, where individuals and employees are responsible for sorting out recyclable materials from the rest of their waste. These materials commonly include paper, cardboard, plastics, glass, and metals. In many urban areas, local waste management organizations provide special recycling bins to households and offices for segregating recyclables from the general waste stream. Some localities may also have separate containers for different types of materials. Once the recyclables are sorted, they are picked up by waste management services or, in some cases, this collection service might be performed by specialized recycling companies. There may also be local recycling stations or drop-off locations where individuals can bring their recyclables if curbside pickup is not available. The collected materials are then transported to a recycling center. This might involve smaller local collection vehicles transferring their loads to larger vehicles for more efficient transport. In some cases, the recyclable materials might also be sorted into different categories at a local level before being sent for recycling. This step is crucial for the entire process: if waste is not correctly sorted and collected, it cannot be recycled, and the items may end up in a landfill instead. Therefore, raising awareness about proper waste disposal and recycling habits can play a significant part in making the recycling process more efficient and effective. At this stage, it is also pivotal to note that not all materials are recyclable, and even among those that are, the feasibility and methods of recycling can vary. Some materials, like certain types of plastic, are difficult to recycle and may require special facilities or processes. In conclusion, the first step in the recycling process is the collection and transportation of recyclable materials to a recycling center.

Write an article with the title: \\"North Korea reportedly relieves top army chief of posts\\" Article:","completion":"Title: North Korea reportedly relieves top army chief of posts Introduction: In a surprise move, North Korea has reportedly relieved its top-ranking army chief of his various posts. The unexpected action has sparked a slew of speculations and analyses on the consequences and rationale behind such a decision. In this article, we aim to shed light on the possible factors behind this development and discuss the implications of this change for North Korea's military and political structure. Reasons behind the decision: 1. Internal power struggles: One plausible reason for the dismissal of the army chief could be internal power struggles within the North Korean regime. The top brass in the army wield significant influence and authority, making them potential competitors to the supreme leader, Kim Jong-un. As a result, removing such a figure might be a preemptive measure by Kim to maintain his grip on power and quash potential dissent within the ranks. 2. Performance-related issues: It is also possible that the dismissal is related to the army chief's performance. North Korea has faced numerous challenges, including economic sanctions, famine, and international pressure. If the army chief is deemed incapable of managing and addressing these challenges, a change in leadership becomes crucial to improve the situation. 3. Shift in military strategy: Another reason might be a shift in North Korea's military strategy. The regime could be reevaluating its policies and adapting its approach due to new external factors, such as evolving global dynamics, technological advancements, or ongoing diplomatic efforts. In such cases, a new army chief could bring fresh perspectives and align the military with these changes. Implications for North Korea's military and political structure: 1. Centralization of power: The removal of the army chief could lead to the further centralization of power in Kim Jong-un's hands. By purging potential challengers, Kim can ensure that he maintains absolute control over both the military and political domains, tightening his grip over the entire nation. 2. Potential for instability: Such a sudden change in the military's top leadership could create internal rifts and tensions among different factions. In the short term, this might have implications on the stability and morale among the military ranks, potentially leading to discontent and unrest. 3. Impact on diplomatic efforts: The dismissal might have consequences for North Korea's ongoing diplomatic efforts with countries like South Korea and the United States. If the new army chief is seen as an advocate for aggressive military measures, it could hamper negotiations and discords, exacerbating existing tensions in the region. Conclusion: The reported removal of North Korea's top army chief warrants attention and vigilance from both regional and global observers. While the motivations behind such a decision may not be fully known, the consequences of this development have the potential to unsettle regional dynamics and reshape North Korea's internal power structures. Understanding those implications and monitoring further developments within the reclusive nation are essential for maintaining stability and peace on the Korean Peninsula and beyond."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the internal mechanism behind? Please don't answer external factors like pollinators. \\"What external and internal factors have caused the Roma people in Europe to suffer consistently high rates of poverty while 'natives' thrive?\\" OPTIONS: 1). no; 2). yes;","completion":"1). No, these questions do not have the same meaning. The first question is focused on the biological aspect of the nocturnal flowers and seeks to understand the internal mechanisms that cause them to bloom at night. It is specifically interested in the physiological and genetic factors that enable these plants to exhibit this distinct behavior. Answer to the first question: Nocturnal flowers open their blooms at night due to a set of internal mechanisms and genetic factors. These factors consist primarily of circadian rhythms, phytohormones, and the genes responsible for the nocturnal behavior of plants. Circadian rhythms are biological processes that follow a 24-hour cycle, allowing organisms to adapt to the daily cycles of light and darkness. Plant circadian rhythms control various aspects of growth, including the opening and closing of flowers. In nocturnal flowers, their circadian rhythms are regulated in such a way that they promote blooming during the nighttime hours. Phytohormones (plant hormones) play a significant role in the blooming of flowers. These hormones, such as auxins, gibberellins, and abscisic acid, help regulate the processes that ultimately lead to flowers opening and closing. In nocturnal flowers, the balance and interactions between these hormones are modulated to promote nighttime blooming. Lastly, the genetic factors responsible for the nocturnal behavior of flowers lie in specific genes that control their daily rhythms. These specific genes and their expressions, under the influence of external factors such as light quality and temperature, coordinate the plant's circadian rhythms and promote nighttime blooming. The second question is centered on the social, cultural, and economic aspects of the Roma people in Europe. It aims to understand both external and internal factors that have contributed to their consistently high rates of poverty compared to the 'natives.' Answer to the second question: The Roma people in Europe have consistently experienced high rates of poverty due to a complex interplay of external and internal factors. These factors can be broadly categorized into social, cultural, economic, and political aspects. External factors: 1. Discrimination and prejudice: The Roma people have faced long-standing discrimination and prejudice throughout history. This marginalization has limited their access to education, healthcare, housing, and employment opportunities, perpetuating the cycle of poverty. 2. Integration challenges: Due to their nomadic lifestyle, language barriers, and cultural differences, the Roma people often face difficulties integrating into mainstream society. This contributes to the isolation and discrimination that they experience, which further exacerbates their economic status. Internal factors: 1. Traditional lifestyle and values: Some Roma communities adhere to a traditional lifestyle that may not prioritize formal education or steady employment. This can create challenges when attempting to integrate into a modern, competitive economy. 2. Access to resources and support: In some cases, Roma communities may have limited access to resources and support systems within their own community or from external sources. This disadvantage can hinder social and economic mobility, perpetuating poverty within the Roma population. Though these questions are both examining causes of different phenomena, they are not exploring the same meaning or topic. One question is related to the science of nocturnal plant biology, while the other investigates societal issues concerning the Roma people in Europe."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A 'nervous, happy and desperate to get on with it' Nick Grimshaw made his debut as the new host of the BBC Radio 1 Breakfast Show today. The Oldham-native, 28, took to the microphone at 6.30am for his first day, kicking off the show with Kanye West and Jay-Z's duet N***** In Paris. Before his first track, Nick introduced himself: 'So this is happening, it's actually happening. Good morning Britain, I'm Nick Grimshaw. Scroll down for video. New boy: Nick Grimshaw looks contemplative on his first day hosting the Radio 1 Breakfast Show. 'It's time to follow in the footsteps. of people I like, like Chris Moyles and Sara Cox. I'm nervous, happy. and desperate to get on with it. 'It's. time to start the difficult job of talking between records. I've been. dreaming about this since I was a little boy. Let's do it.' Nick's appointment in the role comes after previous breakfast show host Chris Moyles left following eight and half years. Nick himself had previously hosted a late night show before his new role was announced in July. Support: Fellow Radio 1 DJs (L-R) Scott Mills, Fearne Cotton, Dev, Zane Lowe and Huw Stephens came to visit. Although Nick played the radio edit. of the foul-mouthed Jay-Z and Kanye track, he joked if he had played the. unedited version it would have been 'the world's shortest stint on the Radio 1 breakfast show - three and a half minutes'. Among. the celebrity guests on the show were his good friend Harry Styles, who. talked about One Direction's new video and album on the phone, and a. pre-recorded interview with Justin Bieber. Nick ended up teasing a mumbling Harry by playing a brief bit of the wrong track instead of One Direction's new song Live While We're Young, joking: 'Sorry, my finger slipped.' After fellow Radio 1 DJ Fearne Cotton later noted Harry didn't sound too happy by Nick's 'slip-up', the new breakfast show host replied: 'After he said Radio 1 instead of Capital Radio by mistake at the Brit Awards, he needs us - where else is he going to go? \\"Oh I’m just popping into Heart\\" – I don’t think so!' Time to get up! Nick was greeted by people in chicken costumes for his first morning on the Radio 1 Breakfast Show. Ahead of his arrival at the Radio 1 studios in central London, Nick was greeted outside the building by two people in chicken costumes, who gave him a year's supply of Kenco coffee to help him get up in the morning. Speaking to Radio 1’s Newsbeat after the show, he said: “It feels weird, I feel a relief now, the first day is done and it was the first show. Obviously a lot of people were waiting to hear it and there was a lot of anticipation of what the show would sound like, so yes it’s good to get the first one done. 'Today I guess was a lot like an introduction and repeating myself, saying my name a lot. Tomorrow I can do a more regular show and tell a few more stories.' On his own: Nick is the main star of the show, in contrast to Chris Moyles's 'zoo' format. 'In between the celeb guests, Nick was funny, cool, collected, and played actual - gasp - music.' Now magazine. 'Grimmy’s first show was fast-paced, full of celebrity banter and, most importantly, fun.' Daily Mirror. 'A promising start – and a clear break from what went before. It was out with dad rock, cynicism and bloatedly self-indulgent banter; in with dance beats, youthful energy and enthusiasm for new music... The show has swapped one who prefers music to the sound of his own voice; one much more in touch with its target audience of teens and twentysomethings.' Daily Telegraph. 'The message in the opening show – which was a likeable mix of music, self-deprecating chat, interaction on social media, interviews, silly features and funny, often quite bitchy quips – was that the power here has shifted and lies squarely in the music... A very promising, refreshing start that politely suggested the over-30s might like to retune.' The Guardian. The T4 presenter's new role on the breakfast show is a bid to lower Radio 1's demographic after a report by the BBC Trust found the station needed to work harder to attract younger listeners. In research published last November, it was claimed the average Radio 1 listener was 32 and went up to 33 for 38-year-old Moyles' breakfast show. In a bid to attract younger listeners, the music policy seems a lot younger, with a heavier dance influence than had been broadcast on Moyles' show. Nick will aim to play between eight to 10 songs an hour - double the amount played on Moyles' show. Instead of Moyles' 'zoo' format of his production team, the Grimes show will mostly feature his voice with more phone-ins from the audience. Nick previously admitted he had problems. getting up in the morning and told his listeners he had bought a. wake-up light that gradually uses light and bird song to wake him up. gently in the morning. Showing. there was no hard feelings, Chris actually sent a good luck gift to. Nick, who read out the card live on air: 'Good luck with the new show,. enjoy it see you soon, from Chris, former owner of the breakfast show.' Nick told his listeners: 'Ahh! I texted him on holiday and said \\"Thank you for being nice to me in the paper.\\" 'Chris replied, \\"You'll be great, but not as great as me.\\" 'And. now he's sent me some cakes, thank you Christopher, very nice. No. pressure. And weird to not listen to him in the morning! I used to be. able to tell how late I was based on which feature.' Friendly face: Nick's close friend Pixie Geldof and her dog paid a visit to the Radio 1 studios. One of his biggest cheerleaders was close friend Pixie Geldof, who woke up early to listen to her pal, before heading in to visit him at the studio at the end of his shift. She. wrote on Twitter: 'Up early for @grimmers !!!!! So proud!!! Epic music. at the beginning of the radio one breakfast show with NICK GRIMSHAW! '@grimmers obsessed with when they say \\"radio 1 breakfast show with nick grimshaw\\" so emo.' Among those to give him praise were veteran DJ Simon Mayo, who presented the R1 morning show from 1987-1993. Simon tweeted: 'Nick Grimshaw sounding a lot less terrified and a lot more organised than I did. In 1987.' End of an era: Chris Moyles and his team (L-R) Pippa Taylor Hackett, Dominic Byrne, Tina Daheley, Aled Jones, Freya Last and Comedy Dave on their last show on September 14. VIDEO: Move over Chris!

However, her aunt and uncle (who have raised her) insist that she marry the town mayor, the rotund and bullying Don Pedro (Walter Slezak). Shortly before her wedding, Manuela visits a nearby town, Port Sebastian. A traveling circus has arrived, and Serafin (Gene Kelly), its handsome leader, flirts with all the girls in the song \\"Nina.\\" When he encounters Manuela, however, he falls in love with her at first sight. Serafin compliments Manuela's beauty and begs her not to marry Don Pedro, but, angered, she hurries away. That night, however, Manuela cannot sleep, and she sneaks out to go see Serafin's show. At the show, Serafin hypnotizes Manuela, thinking that she will admit she loves him. Instead, the hypnotized girl wildly sings and dances about her love for \\"Mack the Black.\\" Serafin awakens Manuela with a kiss, and she flees in horror. On Manuela's wedding day, the traveling players arrive in Calvados. Serafin begs Manuela to join his troupe, and asks her to admit that she loves him. Don Pedro, hearing noise in Manuela's room, arrives at her door, and asks Manuela to go away so that he can teach Serafin a lesson. Serafin recognizes Don Pedro as Macoco, retired and obese. He blackmails Pedro with this information, swearing to tell it to Manuela if Don Pedro forbids the performers from putting on a show.

Article: Some people say that today, reading is not as important as it was. These days we have photographs, films, radio and television. Why read a description of something when you can look at a photograph? Why read a newspaper when the latest news is brought to us every hour on radio and TV? Photography was certainly a wonderful invention. Photographs can give a very clear idea of places and of people that we have never seen. An encyclopedia , for example, is always better when it has good illustrations. But we also need words to explain the photographs and drawings. A photograph of an elephant may give us a very good idea of what an elephant looks like, but it tells us nothing about the different sorts of elephants there are and where they are found, their exact size and weight, how they can be useful to man and so on. In the same way, a good film has action, movement, color, and maybe music. These are things we do not find on the printed page. But reading a novel has certain advantages over watching even an excellent feature film. Reading a novel requires imagination. Each of us imagines a story differently. Watching news on television can certainly be exciting. But we need newspapers as well. Some important news stories happen when there are no cameras around. More importantly, a newspaper does not just report the news. It explains why something has been happening. It also contains interesting articles on different subjects. Newspapers are an important part of our lives, if we want to understand what is going on in the places we live as well as in other parts of the world.

Heavy metal fans have been warned that headbanging can be bad for you after a Motorhead fan suffered a blood clot on his brain after performing the 'violent and rhythmic' movement at a concert. The 50-year-old German fan developed the potentially fatal condition after getting carried away at one of the hardcore British rock band's concerts. It is the fourth documented case of subdural haematoma linked to headbanging - one of which proved fatal. Headbanger: A 50-year-old German fan suffered a blood clot on his brain after headbanging while watching Motorhead, fronted by Lemmy, play. Specialists treated the fan at the Hannover Medical School two weeks after he started suffering a constant, worsening headache that affected his entire head. A CT scan confirmed that the man had a suffered a subdural haematoma, a clot caused by blood leaking into the space between the skull and the brain, on his right side. Surgeons successfully removed the clot via a hole drilled into the skull, and fortunately he was able to make a full recovery. Subdural haematomas are most often caused by blows to the head, but the patient could not recall suffering such an injury. However, a month before attending hospital he had been to a Motorhead concert where he joined other fans headbanging to the fast and furious music performed by frontman Ian Fraser Kilmister, aka Lemmy, and his bandmates. Medical attention: Specialists treated the fan at the Hannover Medical School two weeks after he started suffering a constant, worsening headache that affected his entire head. 'Our patient had no history of head trauma so we assume that headbanging, with its brisk forward and backward acceleration and deceleration forces, led to rupturing of bridging veins causing haemorrhage into the subdural space,' said doctors writing in The Lancet medical journal. A review of the medical literature revealed three previous cases where headbanging led to blood clots. One, an acute haematoma, resulted in sudden death. Other conditions attributed to headbanging have included a torn carotid artery, whiplash injury, fractured neck, and air in the chest cavity. The doctors defined headbanging as 'a contemporary dance form consisting of abrupt flexion-extension movements of the head to the rhythm of rock music, most commonly seen in the heavy metal genre'. Motorhead were one of the pioneers of 'speed metal', marked by fast tempos of more than 200 beats per minute. The surgeons, led by Dr Ariyan Pirayesh Islamian, ended their report by paying the band a veiled compliment. 'This case serves as evidence in support of Motorhead's reputation as one of the most hardcore rock'n'roll acts on earth, if nothing else because of their contagious speed drive and the hazardous potential for headbanging fans to suffer brain injury,' they wrote.

Continue the following story. the nail chipped when it hit the rock as he was running in the morning because the","completion":"sun had just risen, casting a golden hue on the landscape around him. With every exhale, his breath formed small clouds in the crisp air. The world seemed to be waking up with him, the birds singing sweet melodies, and the gentle rustling of leaves completing the symphony of nature. Though his worn sneakers protested, he paid little heed to them and continued his morning ritual. Running was his sanctuary, a time to find solace and peace from the chaotic life he lived. This quaint little town, nestled between lush forests and majestic mountains, had been his home for the past few months, providing him with the reprieve he so desperately needed. As his route led him past an ancient oak tree, a site which he had grown fond of, he took a moment to catch his breath. Specks of green moss adorned the tree, a testament to its age. Propping himself up against the tree, he took in the surroundings with a renewed appreciation for the beauty within the mundane. The sudden chipping of a nail brought him back to reality. Looking down, he found the rock that had been the culprit - a small, sharp stone that lay stubbornly in the middle of the trail. A faint smile crossed his lips as he made a mental note to be more cautious on his runs. He dusted off his hand, and his smile widened, knowing this was just another experience to enrich his journey. As he resumed his running, the town gradually came into view. The old-fashioned brick buildings had an air of nostalgia that he couldn't help but find endearing, and the narrow cobblestone streets boasted a history that spanned centuries. A light breeze wound its way through the quiet lanes, carrying the delightful scent of freshly baked bread from a nearby bakery. The aroma filled him with anticipation for his post-run breakfast. Entering the town, his exhaustion was briefly forgotten as he marveled at the sights he'd come to know and love. Children played in the local park, their laughter echoing through the air. Elderly townsfolk walked their dogs, greeting one another with warm smiles and kind words. In those moments, the simplicity of their lives made his once complicated existence feel almost otherworldly. As he approached an old, well-trodden bridge, he took one last pause to soak in the ambiance. The flowing river below served as a constant reminder of the passage of time, its wisdom unstoppable and impartial. The sun, now higher in the sky, bathed everything in a gentle glow, a sign that another day had begun with the promise of opportunities. With a renewed sense of purpose and determination, he continued his journey over the bridge and back toward his temporary home in this small, peaceful town. It was truly astounding how something as mundane as a chipped nail could spark such profound contemplation, reminding him that sometimes, it is the smallest of life's obstacles that give us the opportunity to refocus, reflect, and progress. And as he reached the porch of his small cottage, his breath ragged and his legs weary, he knew that those moments of reflection would carry him forward through whatever challenges lay ahead. The town and its people, the trails and the ancient oak tree, and even the chipped nail would remain indelible memories - small reminders of a time in his life when he learned to truly appreciate the beauty of the simple and the significance of life's smallest details."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Is it possible to conclude that \\"A girl in a karate outfit is talking to a man in a white shirt.\\" if \\"A short girl talking.\\"?","completion":"Based solely on the statement \\"A short girl talking,\\" it is not possible to conclude that \\"A girl in a karate outfit is talking to a man in a white shirt.\\" This is due to the lack of sufficient information in the initial statement, as well as potential alternative scenarios that could exist. Let's dive deeper into why we cannot reach this conclusion. 1. Lack of information about the girl's attire: The initial statement only mentions that a short girl is talking, providing no insight into her clothing or outfit. It could be entirely possible that she is wearing a karate outfit, but she could also be wearing a dress, jeans, or any other attire. Without specific information about her clothing, we cannot assume she is in a karate outfit. 2. Missing details about the conversation partner: Even if we knew the girl was in a karate outfit, we still wouldn't have any information about the person she is talking to. We don't know if the conversation partner is a man, woman, or even a group of people. Additionally, we have no information about the other person's clothing or appearance, so we cannot assume they are wearing a white shirt. 3. Alternative scenarios: The initial statement could represent countless different scenarios that preclude the proposed conclusion. The girl could be talking to another girl, to someone dressed differently, or even to herself. She could be speaking to someone over the phone, so we wouldn't even know the appearance of the person she is talking to. The possibilities are vast, and without additional information, we cannot narrow it down to the proposed situation. 4. Location or context: We have no information about where this conversation is taking place, which could impact any assumptions made about the girl's outfit and the man in question. For example, if the conversation were happening at a karate studio, one could rationalize why the girl might be wearing a karate outfit. However, we have insufficient context to ascertain the conversation's location or situation. In summary, while it's not impossible that \\"a girl in a karate outfit is talking to a man in a white shirt,\\" it is indisputable that we cannot reach this conclusion based solely on the information provided in the statement \\"A short girl talking.\\" We would need more details about the girl's attire, her conversation partner, the context and location, or other relevant factors to determine if the proposed conclusion is accurate."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

As the Germans invade Poland in September 1939, the former horse racing-correspondent Colin Metcalfe is placed as a foreign correspondent in neutral Norway. Eight months later he meets a Norwegian fisherman, Captain Alstad, in a sailors' bar, where a scuffle breaks out between British and Norwegian sailors (singing \\"Rule Britannia\\", egged on by Metcalfe) and German ones (singing the Nazi Party anthem the \\"Horst-Wessel-Lied\\"). Alstad takes him aboard his boat during a sea voyage in Norway's territorial waters, during which they sight the Altmark and are fired upon by a German U-boat, despite Norway's neutrality. They then come back to his home port of Langedal, and Metcalfe goes to Oslo to report this to the British embassy there, despite the best efforts of the German Kommandant and the German-sympathising local police chief Ottoman Gunter. There Metcalfe meets Frank Lockwood en route back to England from the Winter War in Finland. It was Lockwood who had got him the foreign correspondent job at the outbreak of war, but he now passes on the news to Metcalfe that he has been fired from it for sailing out with the fisherman rather than staying on dry land where the paper can contact him.

When historian Jonathan Bass wrote of the incident in 2001, he noted that news of King's incarceration was spread quickly by Wyatt Tee Walker, as planned. King's supporters sent telegrams about his arrest to the White House. He could have been released on bail at any time, and jail administrators wished him to be released as soon as possible to avoid the media attention while King was in custody. However, campaign organizers offered no bail in order \\"to focus the attention of the media and national public opinion on the Birmingham situation\\".Twenty-four hours after his arrest, King was allowed to see local attorneys from the SCLC. When Coretta Scott King did not hear from her husband, she called Walker and he suggested that she call President Kennedy directly. Mrs. King was recuperating at home after the birth of their fourth child when she received a call from President Kennedy the Monday after the arrest. The president told her she could expect a call from her husband soon. When Martin Luther King Jr. called his wife, their conversation was brief and guarded; he correctly assumed that his phones were tapped. Several days later, Jacqueline Kennedy called Coretta Scott King to express her concern for King while he was incarcerated.Using scraps of paper given to him by a janitor, notes written on the margins of a newspaper, and later a legal pad given to him by SCLC attorneys, King wrote his essay \\"Letter from Birmingham Jail\\". It responded to eight politically moderate white clergymen who accused King of agitating local residents and not giving the incoming mayor a chance to make any changes.

Which friend had an excessive secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH)? Two friends went to the doctor because they weren't feeling well. As it turns out Danny had a condition called hypercalcaemia, while Greg had hypocalcaemia. Hint: Excess intake of calcium may cause hypercalcaemia. However, because calcium is absorbed rather inefficiently by the intestines, high serum calcium is more likely caused by excessive secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH) or possibly by excessive intake of vitamin D, both which facilitate calcium absorption. It may also be due to bone destruction that occurs when tumours metastasize within bone. All these conditions result in excess calcium salts being deposited in the heart, blood vessels, or kidneys. Symptoms include anorexia, nausea, vomiting, memory loss, confusion, muscle weakness, increased urination, dehydration, and metabolic bone disease. Chronic hypercalcaemia typically leads to calcification of soft tissue and its serious consequences: for example, calcification can cause loss of elasticity of vascular walls and disruption of laminar blood flow—and thence to plaque rupture and thrombosis. Conversely, inadequate calcium or vitamin D intakes may result in hypocalcaemia, often caused also by inadequate secretion of parathyroid hormone or defective PTH receptors in cells. Symptoms include neuromuscular excitability, which potentially causes tetany and disruption of conductivity in cardiac tissue.

Farewell Friend aka Adieu L'Ami/Honour Among Thieves isn't perfect but it is a neat and entertaining thriller that sees mismatched demobbed French Algerian War veterans Alain Delon and Charles Bronson trapped in the same basement vault, one to return stolen bonds, the other to clean out the two million in wages sitting there over the Christmas weekend. Naturally things aren't quite that simple even after they open the vault, leading to some neat twists and turns. On the debit side, there's a very bizarre striptease scene in a car park, Bronson has a very irritating Fonzie-like catchphrase he uses at the most inopportune moments, Brigitte Fossey, sporting perhaps the most hideously misconceived hairstyle of the 60s (it makes her look like a bald woman whose wig is blown back off the top of her head by a high wind), is something of a liability  her \\"I'll cook spaghetti!

Their members were called Rederijkers (singular Rederijker), from the French word 'rhétoricien', and during the 15th and 16th centuries were mainly interested in dramas and lyrics. These societies were closely connected with local civic leaders and their public plays were a form of early public relations for the city. - Chrétien de Troyes (\\"Christian\\") was a late-12th-century French poet and trouvère known for his work on Arthurian subjects, and for originating the character Lancelot. This work represents some of the best-regarded of medieval literature. His use of structure, particularly in \\"Yvain, the Knight of the Lion\\", has been seen as a step towards the modern novel. Little is known of his life, but he seems to have been from Troyes, or at least intimately connected with it, and between 1160 and 1172 he served at the court of his patroness Marie of France, Countess of Champagne, daughter of Eleanor of Aquitaine, perhaps as herald-at-arms (as Gaston Paris speculated). - Lyric poetry is a formal type of poetry which expresses personal emotions or feelings, typically spoken in the first person. The term derives from a form of Ancient Greek literature, the lyric, which was defined by its musical accompaniment, usually on a stringed instrument known as a lyre. The term owes its importance in literary theory to the division developed by Aristotle between three broad categories of poetry: lyrical, dramatic and epic. - Thibaut de Blaison , Blason , or Blazon ( died after March 1229 ) was a Poitevin nobleman , Crusader , and trouvère from a noble family with lands in Blason and Mirabel . Eleven poems -- one contested and one definitely spurious -- have been ascribed to Thibaut in the chansonniers . Three further anonymous songs have also been attributed to him by Terence H. Newcombe , his modern editor . Thibaut was the seneschal of Poitou and his uncle was Maurice , Bishop of Poitiers . In 1214 Thibaut helped negotiate a truce between Philip II of France and John of England . In 1212 he was taking part in the Reconquista in Spain and he was among the Albigensian Crusaders besieging Toulouse in 1218 . He appears alongside the trouvère Amauri de Craon in a document of 1219 . He attended the coronation of Louis IX in 1226 , along with the trouvère Hue de la Ferté . Theobald I of Navarre , also a trouvère , dedicated the song De ma dame souvenir to Thibaut and also used Thibaut 's Amours , que porra devenir as a model for a religious poem of his own . Gautier d'Espinal also borrowed the melody of Amours for one piece . Thibaut himself borrowed from rhythms from the polyphonic repertoire of the day . He may have based his Bien font Amours lor talent on the conductus Quid frustra consumeris and Chanter et renvoisier seuil on Sol sub nube latuit . With the exception of three chansons that are restricted to a sixth -- Amours , que porra devenir , Chanter et renvoisier seuil , and Huimain par un ajourant -- and one , Li miens chanters ne puet mais remanoir , which is severely restricted in movement , most of Thibaut 's melodies move freely . They are all basically syllabic , with only Li miens chanters exhibiting more complex melisma . Compared to his melodies ( all recorded in bar form ) , his prosody is usually simple , though three songs -- Bien font Amours lor talent , Bon jour ait hui cele a cui sui amis , and Quant je voi esté venir -- exhibit some variety . The simplicity of Bien font Amours is more in keeping with Thibaut 's... - Trouvère, sometimes spelled trouveur , is the Northern French (langue d'oïl) form of the langue d'oc (Occitan) word \\"trobador\\". It refers to poet-composers who were roughly contemporary with and influenced by the troubadours (composers and performers of Old Occitan lyric poetry during the High Middle Ages) but who composed their works in the northern dialects of France. The first known \\"trouvère\\" was Chrétien de Troyes (\\"fl\\". 1160s-1180s) (Butterfield, 1997) and the \\"trouvères\\" continued to flourish until about 1300. Some 2130 \\"trouvère\\" poems have survived; of these, at least two-thirds have melodies. - Blason is a form of poetry. The term originally comes from the heraldic term \\"blazon\\" in French heraldry, which means either the codified description of a coat of arms or the coat of arms itself. The Dutch term is Blazoen, and in either Dutch or French, the term is often used to refer to the coat of arms of a chamber of rhetoric. - A troubadour was a composer and performer of Old Occitan lyric poetry during the High Middle Ages (11001350). Since the word \\"troubadour\\" is etymologically masculine, a female troubadour is usually called a trobairitz. - In heraldry and heraldic vexillology, a blazon is a formal description of a coat of arms, flag or similar emblem, from which the reader can reconstruct the appropriate image. The verb \\"to blazon\\" means to create such a description. The visual depiction of a coat of arms or flag traditionally has considerable latitude in design, while a blazon specifies the essentially distinctive elements; thus it can be said that a coat of arms or flag is primarily defined not by a picture but rather by the wording of its blazon (though often flags are in modern usage additionally and more precisely defined using geometrical specifications). \\"Blazon\\" also refers to the specialized language in which a blazon is written, and, as a verb, to the act of writing such a description. This language has its own vocabulary, grammar and syntax, or rules governing word order, which becomes essential for comprehension when blazoning a complex coat of arms. After reading the paragraphs above, choose the best answer for the entity that related to 'thibaut de blaison' with the relationship of 'occupation'. Choices: - composer - literary - performer - poet - public relations - reader - rhetoric - troubadour - trouvère","completion":"Based on the information provided in the paragraphs, the entity that best relates to 'Thibaut de Blaison' in the relationship of 'occupation' would be that of a poet and trouvère. A trouvère refers to poet-composers who composed their works in the northern dialects of France during the High Middle Ages. Thibaut de Blaison, as described, was a Poitevin nobleman, Crusader, and trouvère. His works primarily consisted of poems and songs, some of the melodies of which have been borrowed by other poet-composers such as Theobald I of Navarre and Gautier d'Espinal. Further highlighting his influence and involvement in the poetry and song composition scene of his time. He has been attributed to certain poems and songs in the chansonniers (songbooks), including the pieces such as 'Amours, que porra devenir' and 'Bien font Amours lor talent'. Thus, qualifying him as both a poet and a troubadour would be the correct characterization of Thibaut de Blaison's occupation, as both these roles involve the creation and composition of poetry, which Thibaut was known for. It's worth mentioning that a trouvère's role could potentially cover both categories, that of a poet and a composer, given their involvement in writing lyrical poems that are often set to music. This dual role makes them significant figures in the history of music and literature."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Just as it becomes clear that Kaufman may have no real talent, he puts on a rhinestone jacket and does a dead-on Elvis impersonation and song. The audience bursts into applause, realizing Kaufman had tricked them making his big Elvis payoff all the more enjoyable. This is the first of many times we see Kaufman trick the audience, as \\"fooling the audience\\" is his performance style.His autistic, eccentric style catches the eye of talent agent George Shapiro (Danny DeVito), who signs him as a client and immediately gets Kaufman on a new sitcom, 'Taxi' in 1975, much to the dismay of sitcom-hating Kaufman. Because of the money, visibility, and chance to do his own television special, Kaufman acts on Taxi, but secretly hates it and works a second menial job as a restaurant busboy.

Libyan relations with Lebanon and Shi'ite communities across the world also deteriorated due to the August 1978 disappearance of imam Musa al-Sadr when visiting Libya; the Lebanese accused Gaddafi of having him killed or imprisoned, a charge he denied. Relations with Syria improved, as Gaddafi and Syrian President Hafez al-Assad shared an enmity with Israel and Egypt's Sadat. In 1980, they proposed a political union, with Libya paying off Syria's £1 billion debt to the Soviet Union; although pressures led Assad to pull out, they remained allies. Another key ally was Uganda, and in 1979, Gaddafi sent 2,500 troops into Uganda to defend the regime of President Idi Amin from Tanzanian invaders. The mission failed; 400 Libyans were killed and they were forced to retreat. Gaddafi later came to regret his alliance with Amin, openly criticising him.\\", answer the following question. Note that the answer is present within the text. Question: Who sent soldiers into Uganda, Lebanon or Libya? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Libya. Justification: The passage states, \\"Gaddafi sent 2,500 troops into Uganda to defend the regime of President Idi Amin from Tanzanian invaders.\\" This indicates that it was Libya, under the leadership of Gaddafi, that sent soldiers into Uganda."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: With more and more cars on the road, the traffic _ will happen. How do we see it and how can we solve the problem? We know that the traffic jam happens in many places, especially in big cities. What are reasons for the problem? On one hand, some people think that they should have a car when they have enough money, and then it's easy to go out and they can feel comfortable. On the other hand, a growing number of people hope to use their cars to show off . What's more, years of research has shown that one of other reasons for the traffic jam is the driving habit. For example, many young people enjoy driving very fast, so they can feel excited. At last, most of them hardly care about the speed rules. Many governments are working at how to make the traffic better. In my opinion, firstly, the governments should educate those people who have cars or plan to buy cars. The governments must make them know that the traffic jam is very serious, and set up a much more perfect traffic system to solve the traffic pressure.

Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","completion":"Yes, the premise does entail the hypothesis to a certain extent. Let's analyze the components of the premise and how it relates to the hypothesis. The premise focuses on two aspects: the impact of hedonics and computers on Real GDP. Let's break down these terms for better understanding. 1. Hedonics: This refers to an adjustment method used in economics, primarily to account for changes in the quality of goods and services over time. Hedonic adjustments aim at measuring the true value of products by considering the improvements in efficiency and quality, which have an obvious impact on the overall economy. Applying hedonic adjustments enables economists to accurately assess the effect of innovation and technological developments on the economy. 2. Computers: In the context of this premise, computers represent a significant technological development that has transformed various sectors of the economy since their inception, including communication, manufacturing, and information processing, among others. The integration of computer technology in various industries has undoubtedly contributed to economic growth, productivity and efficiency improvements. Now, let's focus on Real GDP (Gross Domestic Product). Real GDP is an inflation-adjusted measure reflecting the value of all final goods and services produced by an economy in a given period, expressed in constant prices. It is a key indicator of a nation's economic growth and standard of living. Higher Real GDP signifies a more productive and prosperous society. Given the premise, we can deduce that the document aims at discussing the relationship between hedonic adjustments and computer technology, and their combined impact on Real GDP. This connection suggests that the document is concerned with examining the extent to which hedonics and advancements in computer technology affect the growth and development of an economy as measured by Real GDP. Therefore, the hypothesis stating that this document contains information on Real GDP is relevant and connected to the premise, as the premise focuses on factors influencing Real GDP (i.e., hedonics and computers). The document will likely delve into the methods, effects and nuances of how hedonic adjustments and computers contribute to the dynamics of Real GDP."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: how much time can store on dvd dl? Would \\"Pre-recorded DVDs are mass-produced using molding machines that physically stamp data onto the DVD.\\" be a reasonable answer?","completion":"Step 1: Identify the user's primary question The primary question here is how much time can be stored on DVD DL (dual layer). Step 2: Address the primary question To answer the primary question, we need to first understand the storage capacity of a DVD DL. DVD DL, or dual-layer DVDs, have two layers on a single-sided disc, offering almost double the storage capacity of a standard single-layer DVD. The storage capacity for a DVD DL is typically around 8.5 GB. Step 3: Convert storage capacity to time To find out how much time we can store on a DVD DL, we need to know the bit rate of the content. The bit rate is the amount of data that a video or audio file uses per second, usually measured in bits per second or kilobits per second (kbps). Let's assume we're storing a video with a standard bit rate of 4800kbps, which includes both video and audio. To calculate the amount of time we can store, we need to first convert the storage capacity into bits or kilobits. 8.5 GB = 8.5 * 1024 MB = 8704 MB = 8704 * 1024 KB = 8,913,920 KB Now, we can divide this amount by the bit rate: 8,913,920 KB / 4800 kbps = 1,856.65 seconds To get the amount of time in minutes, we divide by 60: 1,856.65 seconds / 60 = 30.94 minutes So, a DVD DL can store approximately 30.94 minutes of video at a standard bit rate of 4800kbps. Step 4: Address the secondary question The secondary question asks if the statement \\"Pre-recorded DVDs are mass-produced using molding machines that physically stamp data onto the DVD.\\" would be a reasonable answer. The statement is true but does not directly answer the primary question. Pre-recorded DVD manufacturing is indeed done using molding machines to physically stamp data onto the discs, but this statement is about the manufacturing process and not about how much time can be stored on a DVD DL. Conclusion: A DVD DL can store approximately 30.94 minutes of video at a standard bit rate of 4800kbps. The statement about the manufacturing process is accurate, but not relevant to the primary question."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Q:And once again, high blood pressure is making headlines in the news: the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology (AHA/ACC) have just released new guidelines about hypertension. Since this development is likely to cause confusion and concern for many, I’m writing this post to help you understand the debate and what this might mean for you and your family. By the way, if you’ve read any of my other blood pressure articles on this site, let me reassure you: I am not changing my clinical practice or what I recommend to others, based on the new AHA/ACC guidelines. The core principles of better blood pressure management for older adults remain the same: * Take care in how you and your doctors measure blood pressure (more on that here), * Start by aiming to get blood pressure less than 150/90 mm Hg, as recommended by these expert guidelines issued in 2017 and in 2014, * And then learn more about what are the likely benefits versus risks of aiming for more intensive BP control. Perhaps the most important thing to understand is this: treatment of high blood pressure in older adults offers “diminishing returns” as we treat BP to get lower and lower. Scientific evidence indicates that the greatest health benefit, when it comes to reducing the risk of strokes and heart attacks, is in getting systolic blood pressure from high (i.e. 160-180) down to moderate (140-150). From there, the famous SPRINT study, published in 2015, did show a further reduction in cardiovascular risk, when participants were treated to a lower systolic BP, such as a target of 120. However, this was in a carefully selected group of participants, it required taking three blood pressure medications on average, and the reduction in risk was small. As I note in my article explaining SPRINT Senior, in participants aged 75 or older, pushing to that lower goal was associated with an estimated 1-in-27 chance of avoiding a cardiovascular event.

Please answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the last name of the person whose mother gave him piano lessons? Wood was born in Oxford Street, London, the only child of Henry Joseph Wood and his wife Martha, née Morris. Wood senior had started in his family's pawnbroking business, but by the time of his son's birth he was trading as a jeweller, optician and engineering modeller, much sought-after for his model engines. It was a musical household: Wood senior was an amateur cellist and sang as principal tenor in the choir of St Sepulchre-without-Newgate, known as \\"the musicians' church\\". His wife played the piano and sang songs from her native Wales. They encouraged their son's interest in music, buying him a Broadwood piano, on which his mother gave him lessons. The young Wood also learned to play the violin and viola. Wood received little religious inspiration at St Sepulchre, but was deeply stirred by the playing of the resident organist, George Cooper, who allowed him into the organ loft and gave him his first lessons on the instrument. Cooper died when Wood was seven, and the boy took further lessons from Cooper's successor, Edwin M. Lott, for whom Wood had much less regard. At the age of ten, through the influence of one of his uncles, Wood made his first paid appearance as an organist at St Mary Aldermanbury, being paid half a crown. In June 1883, visiting the Fisheries Exhibition at South Kensington with his father, Wood was invited to play the organ in one of the galleries, making a good enough impression to be engaged to give recitals at the exhibition building over the next three months. At this time in his life, painting was nearly as strong an interest as music, and he studied in his spare time at the Slade School of Fine Art. He remained a life-long amateur painter.After taking private lessons from the musicologist Ebenezer Prout, Wood entered the Royal Academy of Music at the age of seventeen, studying harmony and composition with Prout, organ with Charles Steggall, and piano with Walter Macfarren.

Answer the following question: who played bones in the new star trek?","completion":"In the new Star Trek film series, also referred to as the \\"Kelvin Timeline\\" or \\"Alternate Reality\\" series, the character of Dr. Leonard \\"Bones\\" McCoy is portrayed by actor Karl-Heinz Urban. Urban, born on June 7, 1972, is a New Zealand actor known for his roles in various film and television projects. Karl Urban took on the role of Dr. McCoy in the 2009 relaunch of Star Trek, directed by J.J. Abrams. The film was a reboot of the original Star Trek series, which focused on the early years of the iconic characters from the USS Enterprise. The movie aimed to breathe new life into the franchise by featuring a younger ensemble cast, which included Chris Pine as James T. Kirk, Zachary Quinto as Spock, Zoe Saldana as Nyota Uhura, Simon Pegg as Montgomery \\"Scotty\\" Scott, John Cho as Hikaru Sulu, and Anton Yelchin as Pavel Chekov. Karl Urban's portrayal of Bones stayed true to the essence of the character, originally played by DeForest Kelley in the initial Star Trek television series (created by Gene Roddenberry) that aired in the late 1960s and the series of films that followed. Urban effectively captured the distinctive qualities and quirks that made Bones a beloved character among Star Trek fans, such as his dry sense of humor, his pessimistic outlook, and his deep friendship with Captain Kirk and Spock. Following the 2009 film, Urban reprised his role as Dr. McCoy in the 2013 sequel, Star Trek Into Darkness, and again in the 2016 film, Star Trek Beyond. The latter film, in particular, allowed for deeper exploration of the character's dynamic with Spock as they faced an uncertain future following the destruction of the Enterprise. Throughout his career, Karl Urban has appeared in various high-profile movies and television projects, including the Lord of the Rings trilogy where he played Éomer, the lead role in 2012's Dredd, and the Amazon Prime series The Boys, in which he stars as Billy Butcher. Within the Kelvin Timeline Star Trek films, Urban's distinct and memorable portrayal of Bones has pleased fans of the franchise, creating a credible representation of the well-known character while maintaining a connection to the Star Trek legacy."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer a question about this article: White light can be formed by mixing differently colored lights; the most common method is to use red, green, and blue (RGB). Hence the method is called multi-color white LEDs (sometimes referred to as RGB LEDs). Because these need electronic circuits to control the blending and diffusion of different colors, and because the individual color LEDs typically have slightly different emission patterns (leading to variation of the color depending on direction) even if they are made as a single unit, these are seldom used to produce white lighting. Nonetheless, this method has many applications because of the flexibility of mixing different colors, and in principle, this mechanism also has higher quantum efficiency in producing white light.[citation needed] What is another name to reference the multi-color white LED method?","completion":"Another name to reference the multi-color white LED method is RGB LEDs, which stands for Red, Green, and Blue LEDs.

The second part of the sentence states that Oliver is aware of the historical events suggesting that he (Oliver) loses the siege. It suggests that Oliver may have an ulterior motive or an alternative plan for helping Johnston, given the historical context. Sentence 2: \\"Johnston helps Oliver develop a weapon, knowing that historically Oliver loses the siege.\\" In this case, the primary subject is Johnston, and the focus is on his actions and intentions: providing help to Oliver in developing a weapon. The second part of the sentence is similar to the first example in that it refers to Oliver's historical losing outcome in the siege. However, the difference comes from the fact that the one who is aware of history is now Johnston, rather than Oliver himself. It further implies that Johnston might have a specific reason or intention for helping Oliver, given the historical context. To sum up, although both sentences involve Oliver, Johnston, and the development of a weapon, the subtle difference that arises from their variation lies in who the primary subject is and who has the knowledge of the historical events. In the first sentence, Oliver is the main focus and the person aware of history, while in the second sentence, Johnston takes up the primary focus and has the historical knowledge. This difference affects the interpretation of each sentence and causes them to not hold the same meaning."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

A:","completion":"Edward Smith Fatu, known by his ring name Umaga, was a Samoan-American professional wrestler who gained prominence in WWE between 2002 and 2009. Umaga had a successful wrestling career in WWE, winning the WWE Intercontinental Championship twice and engaging in feuds with top WWE superstars like John Cena, Triple H, Ric Flair, and Jeff Hardy, among others. Umaga was unexpectedly released from his WWE contract on June 8, 2009, following a violation of the company's Wellness Policy and his refusal to attend rehab. The violation was reportedly due to use of a banned substance, and it was Umaga's second offense against the policy. WWE, at the time, maintained a strict stance about drug abuse and taking appropriate actions to rehabilitate its talent. Umaga's refusal to comply led to his release from the company. Tragically, on December 4, 2009, Umaga passed away at the age of 36. The cause of death was determined to be a heart attack, which was brought on by acute toxicity due to combined effects of hydrocodone, carisoprodol, and diazepam. These substances were found in his system during the autopsy. His early death was a massive loss to the wrestling industry, as he was a supremely talented and charismatic wrestler with a loyal fan base. Umaga's legacy lives on through his family's strong connections to the professional wrestling industry. Known as the Anoa'i wrestling family, they have produced many famous wrestling superstars, including current WWE superstar Roman Reigns, WWE Hall of Famer Yokozuna, and The Usos, among others. Umaga's impact on WWE and professional wrestling as a whole can also be seen through the numerous wrestlers who regard him as a source of inspiration and pay tribute to his in-ring work and abilities."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Cameron was born in 1954 in Kapuskasing, Ontario, Canada, the son of Shirley (nee Lowe), an artist and nurse, and Phillip Cameron, an electrical engineer. His paternal great-great-great-grandfather emigrated from Balquhidder, Scotland, in 1825. Cameron grew up in Chippawa, Ontario, and attended Stamford Collegiate School in Niagara Falls, Ontario. His family moved to Brea, California in 1971, when Cameron was 17 years old. Cameron expressed interest in the 1912 sinking of the ship RMS Titanic and decided to script and film his next project based on this event. The picture revolved around a fictional romance story between two young lovers from different social classes who meet on board. Before production began, he took dives to the bottom of the Atlantic and shot actual footage of the ship underwater, which he inserted into the final film. Much of the film's dialogue was also written during these dives. Subsequently, Cameron cast Leonardo DiCaprio, Kate Winslet, Billy Zane, Kathy Bates, Frances Fisher, Gloria Stuart, Bernard Hill, Jonathan Hyde, Victor Garber, Danny Nucci, David Warner, Suzy Amis, and Bill Paxton as the film's principal cast. Cameron's budget for the film reached about 200 million, making it the most expensive movie ever made at the time. Before its release, the film was widely ridiculed for its expense and protracted production schedule. Released to theaters on December 19, 1997, Titanic grossed less in its first weekend (28.6 million) than in its second (35.4 million), an increase of 23.8%. This is unheard of for a widely released film, which is a testament to the movie's appeal. This was especially noteworthy, considering that the film's running time of more than three hours limited the number of showings each theater could schedule. It held the No. 1 spot on the box-office charts for months, eventually grossing a total of 600.8 million in the United States and Canada and more than 1.84 billion worldwide. Titanic became the highest-grossing film of all time, both worldwide and in the United States and Canada, and was also the first film to gross more than 1 billion worldwide. It was the highest-grossing film from 1998 until 2010, when Cameron's 2009 film Avatar surpassed its gross. The CG visuals surrounding the sinking and destruction of the ship were considered spectacular. Despite criticism during production of the film, it received a record-tying 14 Oscar nominations (tied with All About Eve) at the 1998 Academy Awards. It won 11 Oscars (also tying the record for most Oscar wins with Ben-Hur and later The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King), including: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Art Direction, Best Cinematography, Best Visual Effects, Best Film Editing, Best Costume Design, Best Sound Mixing, Best Sound Editing, Best Original Dramatic Score, Best Original Song. Upon receiving the Best Director Oscar, Cameron exclaimed, \\"I'm king of the world!\\", in reference to one of the main characters' lines from the film. After receiving the Best Picture Oscar along with Jon Landau, Cameron asked for a moment of silence for the 1,500 men, women, and children who died when the ship sank. In March 2010, Cameron revealed that Titanic would be re-released in 3D in April 2012, to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the sinking of the real ship. On March 27, 2012, Cameron attended the world premiere with Kate Winslet at the Royal Albert Hall in London. Following the re-release, Titanic's domestic total was pushed to 658.6 million and more than 2.18 billion worldwide. It became the second film to gross more than 2 billion worldwide (the first being Avatar).

Let's analyze each sentence to better understand their similarities and differences. 1. It will be convenient to write the acceleration vector as formula _ 26 and also to set: - This sentence is stating that writing the acceleration vector using Formula 26 is a convenient choice, and it implies that another action will also be executed, which involves setting something. - The subject of the sentence is the acceleration vector. - The use of \\"and\\" suggests that there might be two closely related yet distinct processes involved. One process is to represent the acceleration vector using Formula 26, and the other process is setting something, possibly related to this formula or the vector itself. - The word \\"formula\\" is written without capitalization, which is not an issue but can affect the readability. 2. It will be convenient to write and also to set the accelerator as Formula 26. - This sentence still focuses on the convenience of using Formula 26 for representing a certain parameter. However, the terminology has shifted from \\"acceleration vector\\" to \\"accelerator.\\" Depending on the context, this might not make a difference, but in some cases, it could: \\"acceleration vector\\" typically refers to a vector quantity describing an object's change in velocity, while \\"accelerator\\" might imply a device or component causing this change in velocity. Nevertheless, the overall message remains similar. - The subject of the sentence has changed to \\"the accelerator.\\" - Rather than dividing the sentence into two closely related processes with \\"and,\\" this structure combines the writing and setting aspects into one unified action. - In this sentence, \\"Formula 26\\" is capitalized, potentially making it easier to read and understand. Overall, both sentences convey the same primary message, indicating the convenience of using Formula 26 for representing a certain parameter related to acceleration. Nevertheless, differences in sentence structure and terminology might cause variations in comprehension or confusion for some readers.

How much should I charge for advertising space?","completion":"No, the two questions are not the same. They address different topics and require different analyses to answer. Let me break down each question and provide a step-by-step plan for answering each one. Question 1: How much should I charge monthly to give boarding to a cat at my residence for six months? To answer this question, consider the following steps: 1. Research current market rates for cat boarding in your area. This can be done by searching for local cat boarding services and noting the prices they charge. 2. Determine the expenses involved in providing cat boarding services. These expenses may include food, litter, toys, any additional equipment, and the time you spend in taking care of the cat. 3. Calculate the monthly cost of providing the service by adding up all the expenses. This will give you the minimum amount you should charge to cover your costs. 4. Determine your desired profit margin and add it to the calculated monthly costs. This will give you the price you should charge per month to make a profit. 5. Compare your price with the market rates found in step 1. If your price is significantly higher or lower, adjust it accordingly while considering your costs and desired profit. Question 2: How many visitors do I need to attract onto my travel blog daily/monthly, before I offer advertising space? How much should I charge for advertising space? To answer this question, consider the following steps: 1. Determine your target revenue from selling advertising space. This could be based on covering your blog's operating costs, your desired income, or any other financial goal. 2. Research advertising market rates and decide on the pricing strategy for your blog's ad space. This could be Cost-per-Click (CPC), Cost-per-Impression (CPM), or a fixed fee. 3. Based on your chosen pricing strategy, calculate how many clicks, impressions, or ad placements are needed to achieve your target revenue. 4. Analyze your blog's traffic data to understand the average number of daily or monthly visitors. Use this information to estimate the number of ad placements, clicks, or impressions you can potentially deliver to advertisers. 5. Compare your blog's potential ad performance with the calculated values from step 3. If your blog can deliver the required ad placements, clicks, or impressions, you can start offering advertising space at the determined price. If not, focus on increasing your blog's traffic until it reaches the required level. In conclusion, both questions deal with different aspects of generating income, but they are not the same. The first question focuses on pricing for cat boarding services, while the second question addresses attracting visitors to a travel blog and selling advertising space."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie title: A Cat in the Brain Movie plot: Haunted by his own bloody horror film visions and with news of real life murders happening in Rome, splatter film director Lucio Fulci (playing himself) seeks the advice of a psychiatrist.[2][5] Dr. Lucio Fulci (more or less playing himself) is a former medical doctor-turned director of gory horror films. He wraps up shooting for the day on his latest film 'Touch of Death' with Brett Halsey playing the human monster/cannibal of women. Fulci leaves the Cincettia Studios for a local restaurant down the street. The young friendly waiter recognizes him and suggests his typical meal: a fillet of steak, or steak tarter. Fulci cannot look at the sample plates of meat without having flashbacks to the cannibalistic scene he'd been filming earlier. Shaken, he leaves the restaurant without ordering a meal. Later, while checking an effects shot from another movie, Fulci irritably snaps at a technician to get a plate of animal eyeballs out of his sight. Returning home to his row house in an old suburb of Rome, the troubled director tries to sleep, but the noise of a handyman's chainsaw outside keeps him awake with recollections of his own recently shot chainsaw mayhem. In a rage, Fulci storms outside and smashes a hatchet into cans of paint belonging to the handyman. The spilled red paint reminds Fulci of the acid/blood scene in 'The Beyond'. Fulci walks from his home and discovers that one of his neighbors is a psychiatrist. Meanwhile, Professor Egon Swharz (David L. Thompson) is arguing with his wife Katya (Melissa Lang). Their bitter routine row is interrupted by the intercom buzzing where his secretary Nurse Lilly (Judy Morrow) informing him of this latest walk-in. Professor Swharz walks in and accepts Fulci into his books for a session. After walking out of the reception area, Nurse Lilly immediately phones a friend saying \\"guess who just walked in as a patient!\\" Swhartz discusses Fulci's recent problems and suggests that he's \\"breaking down the barrier, the boundary between what you film and what's real.\\" The next...

Every week, it seemed, another pretty young girl from a nice family, who was happy and popular and always did well at school, was being kidnapped or murdered by what the Sun newspaper cheerfully termed 'evil paedo scum'. Naming and shaming was as popular a feature in the Murdoch press as Page Three girls and discounted holidays to Butlin's. Of course you can't blame parents for wanting to keep their children safe; that's pretty much the job description of a parent. And, on the face of it, the tabloids were doing a public service in warning us about the paedophile menace lurking in our midst. The problem came when it turned out that a huge number of these concerned tabloid-reading parents were also absolute fucking morons. For every story of an actual sex offender being driven from their house by a baying mob there was one like that of Dr Yvette Cloete, a doctor at the Royal Gwent Hospital in Newport, South Wales, who returned home from work to find that a group of 'concerned parents' had daubed the word 'paedo' on her front door in bright red paint. Dr Cloete was a consultant paediatrician. Easy mistake. If you're an absolute fucking moron. And so it was that one hung-over morning, after reading yet another story about vigilantes who had threatened to stone Maxine Carr, the girlfriend of Soham killer Ian Huntley, to death during her high-profile trial for perverting the course of justice, I decided to set up a website parodying this collective national madness.

Shermerki's governorship had an instant effect on the city, as he manoeuvred to monopolize as much of the regional trade as possible, with his sights set as far as Harar and the Ogaden. Shermerki was later succeeded as Governor of Zeila by Abu Bakr Pasha, a local Afar statesman. In 1874-75, the Egyptians obtained a firman from the Ottomans by which they secured claims over the city. At the same time, the Egyptians received British recognition of their nominal jurisdiction as far east as Cape Guardafui. In actuality, however, Egypt had little authority over the interior and their period of rule on the coast was brief, lasting only a few years . The British Somaliland protectorate was subsequently established in the late 1880s, after the ruling Somali authorities signed a series of protection treaties granting the British access to their territories on the northwestern coast. Among the Somali signatories were the Gadabuursi , Habar Awal , and Warsangali. When the Egyptian garrison in Harar was eventually evacuated in 1885, Zeila became caught up in the competition between the Tadjoura-based French and the British for control of the strategic Gulf of Aden littoral. By the end of 1885, the two powers were on the brink of armed confrontation, but opted instead to turn negotiations. They later signed a convention on 1 February 1888 defining the border between French Somaliland and British Somaliland. How many years did Egyptians obtain a firman from the Ottomans?","completion":"The Egyptians obtained a firman from the Ottomans in 1874-75. This means they secured claims over the city during this period, which lasted for around one to two years."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Answer this question: who was green bay packers quarterback before brett favre??","completion":"Before Brett Favre became the starting quarterback for the Green Bay Packers in 1992, the team's starting quarterback was Don Majkowski. Donald Francis Majkowski was born on February 25, 1964, in Buffalo, New York. He attended the University of Virginia, where he played college football for the Virginia Cavaliers. He amassed 9,218 yards and 57 touchdowns during his collegiate career. Majkowski was drafted by the Green Bay Packers in the 10th round (255th overall) of the 1987 NFL Draft. Throughout his career with the Packers (1987-1992), he displayed an impressive passing ability and earned the nickname \\"Majik Man.\\" The 1989 season was the pinnacle of his career. During that year, he led the NFL in several statistical categories, including passing yards (4,318) and completions (353), as he helped the Packers achieve a 10-6 record, narrowly missing the playoffs. Majkowski's most memorable moment came in a game against the Chicago Bears on November 5, 1989. In the closing seconds, Majkowski threw a game-winning touchdown pass to wide receiver Sterling Sharpe. The play was initially ruled as an illegal forward pass, but after further review, it was deemed legal, and the Packers emerged victorious with a 14-13 win over the Bears. This come-from-behind victory helped define Majkowski's reputation as a clutch player. Unfortunately, Majkowski's career took a downward turn as he struggled with injuries. He suffered a severe ankle injury during the 1990 season, which required surgery and limited his playing time. In 1992, during Week 3 of the regular season, Majkowski was injured again, this time with a torn ligament in his left ankle. This injury led to Brett Favre taking over as the Packers' starting quarterback, marking the beginning of a new era in Green Bay. After his time with the Packers, Majkowski played for the Indianapolis Colts (1993-1994) and the Detroit Lions (1995-1996) before retiring from professional football. Despite facing adversities in his career, Majkowski left a lasting impression on the Green Bay Packers and their fans and will always be remembered as the quarterback who came before Brett Favre's illustrious tenure with the team."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

From her Parkville jail cell, Vergie Winters watches the funeral procession of Senator John Shadwell and remembers her twenty-year past with him: The moment young lawyer John returns to Parkville from an extended honeymoon with his social climbing wife Laura, he visits Vergie, his former lover. After a passionate embrace, John explains to the youthful milliner that he had abandoned their romance because Vergie's father had told him that she was pregnant by laborer Hugo McQueen and would be forced to marry. Vergie then tells John that, to keep her from marrying John, Laura's father had paid her father 10,000 to tell him that devastating lie. Still deeply in love, John and Vergie continue to see each other, but when John starts to campaign for Congress, Preston, a political boss, informs Vergie that, if John is to receive his vital support, she must forego their affair. Although Vergie agrees to Preston's terms, John refuses to end the relationship and spends a long evening with her before the election. After a victorious win, John moves to Washington, D.C. with Laura, Vergie bears his child under an assumed name. John then adopts the baby, named Joan, whom he claims is the child of a destitute family friend. At the start of World War I, John returns to Parkville and once again resumes his affair with Vergie. When one of John's late night rendezvous is witnessed by a town gossip and reported to Mike Davey, John's only political enemy, Vergie's successful millinery shop is boycotted, and she is shunned by all but the local prostitutes. In addition, Davey hires Preston's son Barry to steal from Preston's home safe a page from a hotel register on which Vergie had written her assumed name.

On the drive, Chad Pennington converted key third downs to Brad Smith and Tim Dwight, and was soon faced with a 3rd-and-goal at the Bears' 6-yard line. Apparently unable to see an open Laveranues Coles, Pennington lobbed a pass towards Chris Baker that was intercepted by Brian Urlacher.

As one of the world's leading contemporary recording artists, she is known for narrative songs about her personal life, which have received widespread media coverage. Born and raised in Pennsylvania, Swift moved to Nashville, Tennessee, at the age of 14 to pursue a career in country music. She signed with the label Big Machine Records and became the youngest artist ever signed by the Sony/ATV Music publishing house. Her 2006 self-titled debut album peaked at number five on the Billboard 200 and spent the most weeks on the chart in the 2000s. The album's third single, \\"Our Song\\", made her the youngest person to single-handedly write and perform a number-one song on the Hot Country Songs chart. Swift's second album, Fearless, was released in 2008. Buoyed by the success of pop crossover singles \\"Love Story\\" and \\"You Belong with Me\\", Fearless became the best-selling album of 2009 in the US. The album won four Grammy Awards, with Swift becoming the youngest Album of the Year winner. Swift was the sole writer of her 2010 album, Speak Now. It debuted at number one in the United States and the single \\"Mean\\" won two Grammy Awards. Her fourth album, Red (2012), yielded the successful singles \\"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\\" and \\"I Knew You Were Trouble\\". For her fifth album, the pop-focused 1989 (2014), she received three Grammys, and became the first woman and fifth act overall to win Album of the Year twice.

Particularly since the mid-1960s there have been advances in understanding of the physics of plant physiological processes such as transpiration (the transport of water within plant tissues), the temperature dependence of rates of water evaporation from the leaf surface and the molecular diffusion of water vapour and carbon dioxide through stomatal apertures. These developments, coupled with new methods for measuring the size of stomatal apertures, and the rate of photosynthesis have enabled precise description of the rates of gas exchange between plants and the atmosphere. Innovations in statistical analysis by Ronald Fisher, Frank Yates and others at Rothamsted Experimental Station facilitated rational experimental design and data analysis in botanical research.

Born in Smara and being one of the founding members of the POLISARIO , Mohamed Lamine Ould Ahmed became the first Prime Minister of the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic ( SADR ) in 1976 , and held the post until 1982 . He returned to office in 1985 -- 88 and has been a member of the National Secretariat of the Polisario since . According to Amnesty International , 11 of his family members have been \`\` disappeared '' by Moroccan security personnel for political reasons . - Western Sahara (\\"\\") is a disputed territory in the Maghreb region of North Africa, bordered by Morocco to the north, Algeria to the northeast, Mauritania to the east and south, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. Its surface area amounts to . It is one of the most sparsely populated territories in the world, mainly consisting of desert flatlands. The population is estimated at just over 500,000, of which nearly 40% live in Laayoune, the largest city in Western Sahara. - The Polisario Front, Frente Polisario, FRELISARIO or simply POLISARIO, from the Spanish abbreviation of \\"Frente Popular de Liberación de Saguía el Hamra y Río de Oro\\" (\\"Popular Front for the Liberation of Saguia el-Hamra and Río de Oro\\" \\"Al-Jabhat Al-Sha'abiyah Li-Tahrir Saqiya Al-Hamra'a wa Wadi Al-Dhahab\\"), is a Sahrawi rebel national liberation movement aiming to end Moroccan presence in the Western Sahara.

James' mother died when he was very young and he had difficulty getting along with his stepmother. Black ran away from home to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania at age 8 and was apprenticed to a silversmith. At age 18 he migrated westward and took jobs on the Ohio and Mississippi rivers. In 1830, Black made the famous Bowie knife for Jim Bowie who was already famous for knife-fighting from his 1827 sandbar duel. Bowie's killing of three assassins in Texas and his death at the Battle of the Alamo made him, and Black's knife, legends. After Bowie's death in 1836, Black did a brisk business selling his knives to pioneers bound for Texas. Everyone seemed to want \\"Jim Bowie's knife.\\" Black forged his knives behind a leather curtain and kept his process a secret. Black's knives were known to be exceedingly tough yet flexible. Many claimed that Black had rediscovered the process to make Damascus steel. James Black's wife Anne died in 1838; and in 1839, while Black was in bed from an illness, his father-in-law Shaw broke into Black's house and brutally attacked him with a club. Black's life was saved by the family dog; he survived, but his eyes were severely damaged by the attack. He went north to seek medical advice, where his eyes were further damaged by the inept ministrations of a Cincinnati, Ohio, physician. When Black returned to Arkansas he discovered that his father-in-law had sold his business and property, illegally, and disappeared with the cash. Black lived on a local plantation for a couple of years until Dr. Isaac Newton Jones took him into his home. Black lived with the Jones family for the next 30 years. He attempted to pass on his knife-making secrets to Daniel Webster Jones, but unfortunately he could not remember the technique. Jones would later become Governor of Arkansas.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the nickname of the person who invites the passenger of a coach that was robbed to take refuge in their castle? Nearing the end of the 18th century, Napoleon's vast army is sailing towards the Irish coast. The national poet and freedom fighter who goes by the name of \\"The O'Flynn\\" is traveling back to the castle where he was born, when he encounters a coach being robbed by rogues. The leader of the outlaws is a man named Hendrigg. The robbery fails thanks to O'Flynn's efforts. He invites the passenger, Lady Benedetta, to take refuge in his castle. Lady Benedetta eventually agrees to take up the invitation from the elegant O'Flynn, who rode ahead to prepare the castle. When O'Flynn arrives at the castle, Dooley is waiting to arrest him for unpaid debts. O'Flynn gets off by telling the man of a treasure buried inside the castle. O'Flynn is unaware that Lady Benedetta is really the daughter of the Viceroy of Ireland. She is in turn unaware that agents have been sent out by Napoleon to spy on her, disguised as travelers. They have been informed that Lady Benedetta has Napoleon's plans to invade Britain and is to deliver them to her father. Both Lady Benedetta and the agents arrive to the castle in the night. Dooley fends off the agents and saves both Lady Benedetta and the unsuspecting O'Flynn. Napoleon's men attack them on their way to Dublin, but again they escape. They manage to give the plans to Lady Benedetta's father. Because of his leadership qualities, O'Flynn is made a captain in the Irish Army. O'Flynn is attracted to Lady Benedetta, and when he finds out that her fiancé, Lord Sedgemouth, is in favor of Napoleon, he challenges his rival to a duel. Being a swordsman, he wins the duel quite easily, and decides to win Lady Benedetta's heart. The lord counters by letting Lady Benedetta believe that O'Flynn is involved with a courtesan named Fancy Free, which leads the lady to denounce him.

It's important to consider the context and potential consequences of being fired in order to understand the emotional state of a person in that situation. Generally, losing a job can have many negative effects on a person's life, such as loss of income, damage to their reputation and professional relationships, increased stress and anxiety, and lower self-esteem. Additionally, the fact that Robin was constantly late to work suggests that there could be some underlying issues in their life that may also contribute to a negative response to being fired.

Please answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: Hemophilia is the name of a group of hereditary diseases that affect the body's ability to control blood clotting. Hemophilia is caused by a lack of clotting factors in the blood. Clotting factors are normally released by platelets. Since people with hemophilia cannot produce clots, any cut can put a person at risk of bleeding to death. The risk of internal bleeding is also increased in hemophilia, especially into muscles and joints. This disease affected the royal families of Europe. I am facing a new situation today: Two women go into a doctor's office for a routine physical. As is usual for a physical, the doctor takes a blood sample from both women to analyze for any issues. Upon looking at the blood, the doctor notices that Jan's platelet count is low, but other than that her blood is fine. Marcia's platelet count is not low and she has no other issues. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which woman is less likely to have hemophilia? A:","completion":"A: Marcia is less likely to have hemophilia. Based on the background article on hemophilia and the information given about the two women, it can be inferred that Marcia is less likely to have hemophilia because her platelet count is normal, and she has no other issues. Hemophilia is a hereditary disease that affects the body's ability to control blood clotting. This is due to the lack of clotting factors in the blood. Clotting factors are normally released by platelets. In the case of Jan, her platelet count is found to be low, which might indicate that her blood has a decreased ability to produce clots. This could put her at a higher risk of bleeding, both externally and internally. Since hemophilia is characterized by the inability to produce blood clots effectively, Jan's low platelet count can be considered a red flag for the possibility of having hemophilia. On the other hand, Marcia's blood test shows normal levels of platelets and no other issues. This indicates that her blood has a typical clotting factor level and, therefore, a normal ability to form clots in case of injury. Due to her normal platelet count and the absence of any other issues, Marcia is less likely to have hemophilia compared to Jan. However, it is important to note that a single blood test with a low platelet count might not be enough to diagnose hemophilia definitively. Further testing and more information about family medical history would be required to make a definitive diagnosis."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Водители, которые оставляют свои машины на парковке, практически не замечают вложенные субсидии, поэтому парковочные места и выглядят больше как естественный результат рыночной деятельности или даже как должное. Translate to English","completion":"Drivers who leave their cars in parking lots hardly notice the embedded subsidies, which is why parking spaces appear more like a natural outcome of market activity or even as something expected. In many places, parking spaces are provided by private businesses, local governments, or public facilities, and in most cases, the cost of parking is not directly visible to drivers as it may be included in the prices of products, services, or taxes. Consequently, these hidden costs create a perception that parking spaces are the natural outcome of market activity, reflecting supply and demand forces. In reality, however, parking lots often require significant financial investment and ongoing maintenance, and they occupy valuable land that could be put to other productive uses. Subsidizing parking spaces has several implications for urban planning, economic efficiency, and environmental sustainability. First, it encourages car use, even in congested urban areas where public transportation would be more efficient both in terms of time and space utilization. Second, it distorts the efficient allocation of resources, as building and maintaining parking lots may be more expensive than other potential uses of the land. Third, it contributes to environmental problems, such as air and noise pollution, as well as increased greenhouse gas emissions from fuel consumption. Moreover, these hidden subsidies can perpetuate social inequities, as lower-income individuals, who may use public transportation more frequently, are forced to indirectly subsidize parking for wealthier car owners. This cost burden is often regressive, especially when it comes to financing parking infrastructure through property taxes or other fees that are not linked to direct usage of parking spaces. To address these issues, policymakers and urban planners should consider implementing measures that better align the costs of parking with its usage. Some potential solutions include pricing mechanisms, such as parking fees that reflect the true cost of providing parking spaces, and \\"unbundling\\" parking costs from other fees, like rent, so that people only pay for the parking they need and use. Additionally, investing in more efficient public transportation and promoting other sustainable modes of transport, such as cycling and walking, can help to reduce reliance on cars and the demand for parking spaces. In conclusion, while parking spaces may seem like a natural outcome of market activity, they often result from hidden subsidies that distort resource allocation, encourage car use, and contribute to environmental issues. By internalizing the real costs of parking and promoting alternative transportation options, policymakers and urban planners can create more efficient and sustainable urban landscapes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Wild animals are our friends, but many of them are getting fewer and fewer. We should try to protect them. The four animals below are now in danger. Tibetan Antelopes Tibetan antelopes are medium-sized animals. They mainly feed on grass. They are usually found in groups of about 20. They are killed for their wool, which is warm, soft and fine and can be made into expensive clothes. Although people can get the wool without killing the animals, people simply kill them before taking the wool. The number of them is dropping year by year. There are less than 75,000 Tibetan antelopes left in the world, down from a million 50 years ago. Golden Monkeys Golden monkeys are mainly found in Sichuan, Gansu, Shanxi provinces and Shengnongjia mountainous area of Hubei Province. Golden monkeys have golden-orange fur. They move around in the daytime, usually in groups of as many as 100 to 200 heads, or 20 to 30 heads. They feed on fruits and young leaves of bamboos. But people are destroying the environment where they live. Trees and bamboos are disappearing, so golden monkeys have less and less to eat. Elephans ks5u Elephants are very big and strong. They are bigger than any other animals on land. They are grey and have long trunks and tusks. They have poor eyesight, but very good hearing and smell. They can lift heavy things and break down branches with their trunks. Elephants are very friendly towards each other and towards their neighbours. Normally, they live in a group for many years. Young male elephants do not leave the group until they are about 12 years old. Now, there are very few elephants in the world. The number of them is becoming smaller and smaller because their living areas are used for farming. Also, people hunt them for their tusks. Wolves Wolves are not very big. They have grey fur. Wolves have very good eyesight, hearing and smell. Wolves' food is vavious. They eat animals, insects and snails. They are friendly to each other and never attack people. They do not kill for fun. Wolves are in danger,... Which of the following sentences is right? A) There are less than 7,500 Tibetan antelopes left in the world now. B) Golden monkeys usually move around during the night. C) Elephants have good eyesight, but very poor hearing and smell. D) Wolves are friendly to each other and they never attack people. The answer to this question is:","completion":"D) Wolves are friendly to each other and they never attack people. Each of the four endangered animals listed faces various challenges that have contributed to their declining populations. Here's a summary of the threats they face and reasons why the other options in the question are false: Tibetan Antelopes: They are poached for their wool, known as shahtoosh, which is incredibly fine and valuable. This wool is used to make luxury clothing items, but obtaining it often results in the killing of the animal rather than shearing. The population has dwindled from around a million 50 years ago to less than 75,000 today. Hence, option A is false. Golden Monkeys: These monkeys are suffering from habitat loss and destruction as a result of human development. As the deforestation continues, they lose their sources of food, such as bamboo and fruit, causing their populations to decline. They are active during the day, not at night, making option B false. Elephants: Elephants have poor eyesight but excellent hearing and sense of smell. They face habitat loss due to agricultural expansion, and they are also hunted for their valuable ivory tusks. This has caused a decline in their overall numbers. Option C falsely states that elephants have poor hearing and smell, making it incorrect. Wolves: While some species of wolves are endangered, it's important to note that they are social animals, exhibiting friendly behavior with each other and do not typically attack humans. Though wolves are predators, they don't kill for fun, and their prey mainly includes other animals. Option D accurately describes the nature of wolves and their behavior, making it the right answer."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You should describe the task and explain your answer.

(CNN) -- Al Qaeda warnings against the United States emerged Friday as the materials taken from Osama bin Laden's compound continued to yield a trove of intelligence, including details about a possible attack on the 10th anniversary of 9/11. Al Qaeda, the bin Laden terrorist network that carried out the deadly attack in 2001, confirmed its leader's death on Friday in a Web statement and used that opportunity to taunt and threaten the United States. \\"Sheikh Osama didn't build an organization that will vanish with his death or fades away with his departure,\\" according to the statement, which CNN could not independently authenticate.

Explanation: The paragraph is discussing the al Qaeda network and their statements following the death of Osama bin Laden. The fact that al Qaeda confirmed bin Laden's death and took the opportunity to threaten the United States in a web statement indicates that the organization is the most relevant subject for mentioning the release of the message. - Abbottabad is the location of bin Laden's compound, not a party likely to announce a message. - CNN is reporting on the story, not announcing a message from al Qaeda. - Obama refers to the former U.S. president, not a source for an al Qaeda message. - Osama bin Laden was confirmed dead in the paragraph, so he could not announce a message. - Pakistani refers to the nationality, not a source for an al Qaeda statement. - Sheikh Osama is another name for Osama bin Laden, who was confirmed dead. - United States would not announce an al Qaeda message. - al Qaeda (with lowercase \\"a\\") is an alternate spelling of Al Qaeda, but consistency should be maintained in the text. - bin Laden refers to Osama bin Laden, who was confirmed dead in the paragraph."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the below context: Gauguin was foremost a painter; he came to ceramics around 1886, when he was taught by the French sculptor and ceramist Ernest Chaplet. They had been introduced by Félix Bracquemond who, inspired by the new French art pottery, was experimenting with the form. During that winter of 1886–87, Gauguin visited Chaplet's workshop at Vaugirard, where they collaborated on stoneware pots with applied figures or ornamental fragments and multiple handles. Gauguin first visited Tahiti in 1891 and, attracted by the beauty of Tahitian women, undertook a set of sculptural mask-like portraits on paper. They evoke both melancholy and death, and conjure the state of faaturuma (brooding or melancholy); imagery and moods later used in the Oviri ceramic. Gauguin's first wood carvings in Tahiti were with a guava wood that quickly crumbled and have not survived. He completed Oviri in the winter of 1894, during his return from Tahiti, and submitted it to the Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts 1895 salon opening in April the following year. There are two versions of what ensued: Charles Morice claimed in 1920 that Gauguin was \\"literally expelled\\" from the exhibition; in 1937 Ambroise Vollard wrote that the piece was admitted only when Chaplet threatened to withdraw his own works in protest. According to Bengt Danielsson, Gauguin was keen to increase his public exposure and availed of this opportunity by writing an outraged letter to Le Soir, bemoaning the state of modern ceramics.At the outset of 1897, Vollard addressed a letter to Gauguin about the possibility of casting his sculptures in bronze. Gauguin's response centred on Oviri: I believe that my large statue in ceramic, the Tueuse (\\"The Murderess\\"), is an exceptional piece such as no ceramist has made until now and that, in addition, it would look very well cast in bronze (without retouching and without patina). In this way the buyer would not only have the ceramic piece itself, but also a bronze edition with which to make money. Art historian Christopher Gray mentions three... Guess a valid title for it!

Options: A. desktop B. headphones C. connect D. concert E. conference Answer:","completion":"E. Conference You are likely on a conference call if you are hearing several people over speakers. Conference calls are communication methods widely used in the business and professional world, allowing multiple participants to engage in conversation and discussions from different locations. This type of call is an efficient and economical way to bring together people from diverse geographical areas for meetings, presentations, or collaborative discussions. Conference calls typically involve a group of individuals, where each participant connects to the call through their phone or computer, using a speakerphone or headset for better audio clarity. Most conference call platforms allow users to utilize built-in features like mute, screen sharing, chat messaging, and call recording to facilitate the collaboration process. In contrast, the other options provided do not align with the context of a call involving multiple people speaking simultaneously over speakers. Let's go through them: A. Desktop: A desktop generally refers to a personal computer system placed on a desk or table, including components like a monitor, keyboard, and mouse. It doesn't indicate a specific type of call. B. Headphones: Headphones are audio devices, typically worn on or around the ears, allowing the user to listen to audio privately. While they can be used during a conference call, the term \\"headphones\\" by itself does not indicate a call involving multiple people. C. Connect: The term \\"connect\\" usually refers to establishing a link or connection between devices or individuals. It is a generic term that does not provide any information about the type of call you are on. D. Concert: A concert is a live music performance, usually featuring a musician or group of musicians playing instruments and/or singing. While it may involve amplified sound through speakers, it is not a call type involving several people.

Answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the last name of the person Auber believed had more promise than Léonce Cohen?, using the article: In 1848, at the age of thirteen, Saint-Saëns was admitted to the Paris Conservatoire, France's foremost music academy. The director, Daniel Auber, had succeeded Luigi Cherubini in 1842, and brought a more relaxed regime than that of his martinet predecessor, though the curriculum remained conservative. Students, even outstanding pianists like Saint-Saëns, were encouraged to specialise in organ studies, because a career as a church organist was seen to offer more opportunities than that of a solo pianist. His organ professor was François Benoist, whom Saint-Saëns considered a mediocre organist but a first-rate teacher; his pupils included Adolphe Adam, César Franck, Charles Alkan, Louis Lefébure-Wély and Georges Bizet. In 1851 Saint-Saëns won the Conservatoire's top prize for organists, and in the same year he began formal composition studies. His professor was a protégé of Cherubini, Fromental Halévy, whose pupils included Charles Gounod and Bizet.Saint-Saëns's student compositions included a symphony in A major (1850) and a choral piece, Les Djinns (1850), after an eponymous poem by Victor Hugo. He competed for France's premier musical award, the Prix de Rome, in 1852 but was unsuccessful. Auber believed that the prize should have gone to Saint-Saëns, considering him to have more promise than the winner, Léonce Cohen, who made little mark during the rest of his career. In the same year Saint-Saëns had greater success in a competition organised by the Société Sainte-Cécile, Paris, with his Ode à Sainte-Cécile, for which the judges unanimously voted him the first prize. The first piece the composer acknowledged as a mature work and gave an opus number was Trois Morceaux for harmonium (1852)., what would be the answer ? Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided in the article, the last name of the person Auber believed had more promise than Léonce Cohen is Saint-Saëns. Auber thought Saint-Saëns should have won the Prix de Rome, considering him more promising than the winner, Léonce Cohen."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

And the answer is?","completion":"A wasp, like all insects belonging to the class Insecta, has six legs. However, let's delve deeper into the world of wasps to better understand these fascinating creatures. Wasps are part of the order Hymenoptera, which also includes other insects such as bees and ants. Thousands of wasp species exist throughout the world. These insects display a wide variety of colors, shapes, and sizes, but they all possess a common trait: their six legs. The six legs of a wasp are attached to the thorax, which is the middle section of the insect's body. These legs are divided into three pairs, with each pair originating from a distinct portion of the thorax. The legs consist of several segments connected by joints, with names like coxa, trochanter, femur, tibia, and tarsi. The tarsi, which form the wasp's feet, are subdivided into smaller sections known as tarsomeres and end in claws that allow the insect to grip surfaces. In addition to their six legs, wasps have two sets of wings attached to their thorax. The forewings are generally larger than the hindwings. With their wings and legs combined, wasps are very agile and can maneuver efficiently through various environments, whether they are crawling, walking, or flying. Wasps have diverse lifestyles and habits. Some species are solitary, whereas others live in social colonies. They often gather caterpillars, spiders, or other small insects to feed their young. Additionally, adult wasps typically consume nectar from flowers, which contributes to the pollination process. Based on their diet and nesting habits, some wasps are considered pests, while others are beneficial to humans. For example, some species of parasitic wasps help control agricultural pests by parasitizing their larvae and eggs. Moreover, several wasps are vital for biological pest control – their preference for eating harmful insects aids in maintaining a balanced ecosystem. In conclusion, wasps have six legs, as is the case with most insects. These legs provide stability, mobility, and versatility to the wasp as it navigates its environment. Even though they may appear intimidating or bothersome, these insects play a crucial role in the ecosystem and contribute to the health of the planet."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

When Amy was a little girl,she got her first doll from Joyce for her birthday.Then the second,the third...A doll a year never arrived late. \\" Why always a doll? \\" This question had been in Amy's mind until one day her father gave the answer. Little Joyce dreamed to have a doll.Her parents promised one for her fifth birthday.Sadly ,they both died in a traffic accident before it arrived.The never-received gift was the most precious in her eyes. Her mother's story being recalled,Amy got an idea. It was Joyce's birthday.A package was sent to her with a card that read: Dear Joyce , I forget to send you the package that you should have received on May 20,1 956,your fifth Birthday.The gift inside has aged ,but I thought that you might still wish to have it.

Answer:","completion":"Yes, the answer is \\"Joyce had never got the dream doll from her parents.\\" The reason behind Joyce thinking dolls were the best birthday gifts for Amy is rooted in her own childhood experience.

However, tragically, they passed away in a traffic accident before they could fulfill their promise. As a result, the never-received doll became the most precious gift in her eyes.

I never turn back, though often so inclined, and in this particular instance, amid such surroundings, everything seemed singularly unfavorable for the calm acceptance of so grim a company. Suppressing my fears, I soon discovered that although as hairy as bears and as crooked as summit pines, the strange creatures were sufficiently erect to belong to our own species.

Input: Media playback is not supported on this device Joleon Lescott gave England the lead with a header from captain Steven Gerrard's free-kick - but France were level before the interval with a fine 20-yard finish from Lescott's Manchester City team-mate Samir Nasri. It was a game that dulled the early sparkle of this tournament, and was played out in searing temperatures inside the Donbass Arena by two teams who may well take satisfaction from a point from their first game. James Milner wasted an early chance for England, while new manager Roy Hodgson was grateful to goalkeeper Joe Hart for a fine block from Alou Diarra's header. Hodgson made the bold choice of Arsenal teenager Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain ahead of Stewart Downing. Opportunities for him to shine were rare but he can be pleased with his efforts in strength-sapping conditions. Karim Benzema carried France's greatest threat after the break and a late save from Hart ensured England go into their second game against Sweden in Kiev on Friday unbeaten. Once again England were tactically disciplined and highly organised - an early trademark under Hodgson since he succeeded Fabio Capello. And the manager knows this was a game safely negotiated as he waits for the return of striker Wayne Rooney after he completes his suspension against Sweden. England's preparation for Euro 2012 were disrupted by injuries - and not even Hodgson's backroom staff were safe as veteran coach Ray Clemence injured himself in the warm-up and had to be carried off. The failure to cut the supply line to Nasri did not cost England when he pulled an early shot wide. England created the best opportunity of what was some early sparring, played out in an occasionally eerie silence in this giant arena. Such was the lack of noise from the stands that players could constantly be heard shouting instructions. \\"England scored and the French came into the ascendancy, with England dropping deeper and deeper and they paid the ultimate price. Scott Parker and Steven Gerrard should have been where Samir Nasri was for the goal, they were too deep and then could not get to him in time. Roy Hodgson will be delighted with that result though.\\" Ashley Young played in Milner behind the ponderous France central defensive pair of Adil Rami and Philippe Mexes. He evaded goalkeeper Hugo Lloris but found the angle too acute and failed to hit the target. Oxlade-Chamberlain was not seeing a great deal of possession - and he was yellow carded for a foul on the outstanding right-back Mathieu Debuchy. However, one impressive change of feet and a pass that found Young just offside hinted at his rich potential. England took the lead on the half-hour when captain Gerrard's inviting free-kick was headed by past Lloris by Lescott after he escaped his marker Diarra. It was an advantage they held for only nine minutes, paying the price for carelessness in possession. Media playback is not supported on this device Diarra almost made amends for his part in Lescott's goal with a point-blank header that was blocked by Hart, before Nasri was able to take control. He was not put off by Gerrard's attempted challenge and scored low to Hart's right from 20 yards. France visibly grew in confidence as the interval approached and both Hart and Ashley Cole combined to block Benzema as he closed in on the angle. Benzema once again demonstrated his danger with a powerful drive that was saved by Hart - but this came in the middle of cagey, attritional exchanges. Glen Johnson was also forced into a timely penalty area interception as Benzema threatened once more. Hodgson made a double change with 13 minutes left when he sent on Jermain Defoe for Oxlade-Chamberlain and Jordan Henderson for the visibly tiring Scott Parker. England were grateful for a crucial Danny Welbeck deflection that took Yohan Cabaye's shot wide as France continued to play with the greater momentum. Media playback is not supported on this device Hodgson's side continued to show resilience to get the reward for a dogged display - and they can look forward to taking the next step in Euro 2012 against Sweden.

Paul Reynolds crisscrossed his sketchbook with furious strokes, filling the pages with images of the vengeance he would take on his former coworkers at Fear and Loading Games. He'd founded the company three years back and, just a few hours ago, his partners and erstwhile friends had fired him without cause or warning. He concentrated hard as his pen brought to life demonic figures from one of the best-selling comics he'd created, scythe wielding cyber-men called Myrmidons who tore into surprised computer programmers with fangs and claws. Elsewhere on the page, computers assembled themselves into 21st century Golems, rising up against traitorous CEO's and producers to crush them to bloody pulp as they cowered beneath their desks. Sitting at the bar in Señor Goldstein's Mexican Restaurant in San Jose, California, Paul's own artwork engaged him for the first time in months, maybe years. Under other circumstances, that would have made him happy. But today's circumstances allowed only two emotions: despair and a burning desire for revenge. Not wanting to succumb to the former, and not quite wanting to find a gun and go back to the office, he instead drew.

With no official figures available, it is estimated that 600,000-900,000 persons fled the country during the Lebanese Civil War . Although some have since returned, this permanently disturbed Lebanese population growth and greatly complicated demographic statistics. Another result of the war was a large number of internally displaced persons. This especially affected the southern Shia community, as Israeli invasion of southern Lebanon in 1978, 1982 and 1996 prompted waves of mass emigration, in addition to the continual strain of occupation and fighting between Israel and Hezbollah . Many Shias from Southern Lebanon resettled in the suburbs south of Beirut. After the war, the pace of Christian emigration accelerated, as many Christians felt discriminated against in a Lebanon under increasingly oppressive Syrian occupation. According to a UNDP study, as much as 10% of the Lebanese had a disability in 1990.

I agree with Governor Bush that we should have new accountability, testing of students. I think that we should require states to test all students, test schools and school districts, and I think that we should go further and require teacher testing for new teachers also. Hypothesis: The schools will be better if people are tested more.","completion":"Based on the given context, we can draw the following hypothesis and provide a detailed explanation: Hypothesis: Improved educational outcomes and school performance can be achieved through increased testing and accountability measures, targeting students, schools, and teachers. Explanation: The context provided highlights the speaker's perspective on the significance of education and the need for transformative change in their country. To achieve this change, the speaker agrees with Governor Bush on some key measures, including testing and accountability improvements. The hypothesis derived from this context implies that higher testing frequency and better accountability would improve school performance. 1. Student Testing: The speaker suggests that testing should be required for all students, at the state level. This proposed increase in testing would potentially provide a more accurate picture of students' progress and capabilities, uncover their strengths and weaknesses, and enable targeted intervention and support when needed. Moreover, consistent testing encourages students to engage actively in their learning and aligns their academic goals with the expectations set by educators and the schooling system. 2. Testing Schools and School Districts: In addition to student testing, the speaker advocates for testing and accountability measures at the school and school district levels, which would contribute to the hypothesis. This approach would likely involve monitoring schools' academic performance, staff qualifications, resource allocation, and learning environment. By subjecting schools and school districts to regular evaluation and monitoring, areas requiring attention and improvement can be identified, leading to a higher-performing education system. 3. Teacher Testing: The speaker further recommends implementing teacher testing for new teachers as part of their professional requirements, which expands upon the hypothesis. By requiring newly-appointed teachers to undergo examinations that evaluate their pedagogical knowledge, skills, and proficiencies, a higher standard of education can be ensured. Additionally, this measure introduces an element of quality control in the teaching workforce and emphasizes the importance of competent educators in driving school performance. In conclusion, the hypothesis derived from the context suggests that increased testing and accountability measures at various levels within the education system, targeting students, schools, and teachers, can lead to better school performance and improved educational outcomes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In fact, it may not freeze at all if the temperature remains consistently above the freezing point. As for the second effect mentioned – the formation of clear ice cubes without cracks due to the absence of trapped gasses – a malfunctioning freezer would likely have no direct effect on this aspect. The clarity of the ice cubes mainly depends on the use of warm water, which helps to eliminate gasses within the water before freezing.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: A Samoan airline says that it is the world's first carrier to charge passengers by their weight. Samoa Air, which opened in 2012, asks passengers to give their personal weight during booking, which is then charged according to the length of a flight. The customers will also be weighed just before they board the plane. \\"It is believed that all people throughout the world are the same size,\\" Samoa Air CEO Chris Langton said. \\"Airplanes always run on weight, not seats.\\" \\"There is no doubt in my mind that this is the concept of the future. This is the fairest way of your travelling with your family or yourself.\\" Though the airline introduced the plan last November, it caught people's attention last week when the carrier began international flights to neighboring American Samoa. Almost at the same time, a Norwegian economist, Bharat Bhatta, published a report suggesting that airlines should charge obese passengers more. The Pacific Islands contain some of the world's most common countries for obesity, many ranking in the top 10, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Samoa is ranked number four, with 59.6 percent of the population considered obese, said the most recent WHO report. According to Samoa Air's latest schedule, the airline charges up to 0.57 per kg for flights in Samoa and 1.03 per kg for its only international flight to American Samoa, around 250 miles. Children under 12 are charged 75 percent of the adult rate, with fares also based on weight. Any overweight baggage is calculated at the same rate as the passenger's personal weight. The plan could actually prove cheaper in some cases, such as for families travelling with small children, and Langton said customer reaction has mainly been \\"amazingly positive\\".

The movie was exaggerated for dramatic effect.October 6, 1970. Opening scene has a xenophobic soundtrack of machine guns, Muslim prayer cries, and synthesizer music and a glimpse of Istanbul, Turkey during twilight with shots of the Bosphorus Strait, a mosque, and the downtown area with seagulls flying about . It is portrayed as a very spooky, forbidding place.While finishing up on his vacation in Istanbul, Turkey, American college student Billy Hayes (Brad Davis) is in his hotel room and straps several pounds of hashish (about two kilograms) to his body.

An expedition led by a young man called Valerian (Clarke) seeks the last sorcerer, Ulrich of Craggenmoor (Richardson), for help. A brutish soldier from Urland named Tyrian (Hallam), who has followed the expedition, intimidates the wizard. Ulrich invites Tyrian to stab him to prove his magical powers. Tyrian does so and Ulrich dies instantly, to the horror of his young apprentice Galen Bradwarden (MacNicol) and his elderly servant Hodge (Sydney Bromley). Hodge cremates Ulrich's body and places the ashes in a leather pouch, informing Galen that Ulrich wanted his ashes spread over a lake of burning water. Galen inherits the wizard's magical amulet, and takes it upon himself to journey to Urland. On the way, he discovers Valerian is really a young woman, who disguised herself to avoid being selected in the lottery. In an effort to discourage the expedition, Tyrian kills Hodge; before dying, he hands Galen the pouch and dies with the words \\"Burning water...\\" on his lips. Arriving in Urland, Galen inspects the dragon's lair and attempts to seal its entrance by causing rocks to fall from the cliff. Tyrian apprehends Galen and takes him to the court of King Casiodorus. King Casiodorus guesses that Galen is not a real wizard and complains that his attack may have angered the dragon instead of killing it, as his own brother and predecessor once did. The king confiscates the amulet and imprisons Galen. His daughter Elspeth (Chloe Salaman) comes to taunt Galen, but is shocked when he informs her of rumours that the lottery is rigged to exclude her name and those who are rich enough to pay to have their children' names removed.

In the first sentence, the statement given is, \\"When ordering, it is customary to be taken to the kitchen to look at the various dishes you will find printed menus only in tourist restaurants.\\" This sentence implies that local or non-tourist restaurants tend to follow the custom of showing customers the dishes in the kitchen, instead of handing out printed menus. Consequently, the presence of printed menus is indicated as something typically associated with tourist restaurants. The second sentence, \\"Only tourists restaurants give out printed menus,\\" conveys a similar idea. It explicitly states that only tourist restaurants provide printed menus to customers. While it has a more definitive tone than the first sentence, it still indicates that printed menus are characteristic of tourist restaurants.

Philosophy of space and time is the branch of philosophy concerned with the issues surrounding the ontology, epistemology, and character of space and time. While such ideas have been central to philosophy from its inception, the philosophy of space and time was both an inspiration for and a central aspect of early analytic philosophy. The subject focuses on a number of basic issues, including whether or not time and space exist independently of the mind, whether they exist independently of one another, what accounts for time's apparently unidirectional flow, whether times other than the present moment exist, and questions about the nature of identity (particularly the nature of identity over time). The earliest recorded Western philosophy of time was expounded by the ancient Egyptian thinker Ptahhotep (c. 2650–2600 BC), who said, \\"Do not lessen the time of following desire, for the wasting of time is an abomination to the spirit.\\" The Vedas, the earliest texts on Indian philosophy and Hindu philosophy, dating back to the late 2nd millennium BC, describe ancient Hindu cosmology, in which the universe goes through repeated cycles of creation, destruction, and rebirth, with each cycle lasting 4,320,000 years.

Giacomo Costa (14 December 1919 - 22 January 2000) was an Italian Australian professional wrestler best known by his ring name, Al Costello. Costello was the first professional wrestler to be nicknamed \\"The Man of a Thousand Holds\\" because of his innovative and very technical style. Costello was the creator and original member of the tag team The Fabulous Kangaroos, whose \\"Ultra Australian\\" gimmick complete with boomerangs, bush hats and the song \\"Waltzing Matilda\\" as their entrance music, existed in various forms from 1957 until 1983. Costello was either an active wrestler, or a manager in all versions of The Fabulous Kangaroos. Heffernan returned to Australia and began working for World Championship Wrestling (the Australian version, not the North American wrestling federation) under booker Jim Barnett as a singles wrestler. Costello was originally supposed to return to Australia as well and work for WCW, but those plans never came through. Instead, Costello remained in the United States and kept working in the tag team division, never seeking a career as a singles wrestler. Costello began wrestling for Georgia Championship Wrestling, where he teamed up with Louis Tillet to form a tag team known as \\"The Globetrotters\\"; a name that played off Costello's Australian and Tillet's French heritage. The Globetrotters defeated the Mysterious Medics in the finals of the Georgia NWA World Tag Team Championship but only held the titles for a week before losing them to Kurt and Karl Von Brauner on 4 February 1966. After this, the Globetrotters broke up due to differences in their approach to tag teaming. Costello then moved to the NWA Mid-America territory near Nashville, Tennessee. In Mid-American, Costello teamed with Herb Welch to win the Mid-American version of the NWA World Tag Team Championship, which they held for just over 2 months. While still working in Mid-America, Costello began to team with Karl Von Brauner, who used a \\"German Nazi\\" gimmick despite being American. Under the management of \\"Playboy\\" Gary Hart, Costello and Von Brauner were billed as \\"The Internationals\\"; the team was later managed by George \\"Crybaby\\" Cannon. The Internationals worked mainly in Tennessee and Texas for NWA Western States. In Texas, Costello and Von Brauner won the Texas version of the NWA World Tag Team Championship, a title Costello and Heffernan had held in 1958. The team was also billed as the first NWA American Tag Team Champions, titles that were also recognized by World Class Championship Wrestling in addition to the Western States promotion. The Internationals lost the American Tag Team title to Fritz and Waldo Von Erich on 21 February 1967. Kurt then decided to go back to teaming with his storyline brother, Karl Von Brauner. After the Internationals broke up, Costello returned to Australia to visit friends and relatives and to recuperate after many years on the road. On his way back to the United States, Costello had a stop over in Detroit, Michigan, where he met Cleo Williams. The two fell in love and married shortly afterwards, remaining together for the rest of Costello's life.","completion":"This text is about Giacomo Costa, an Italian Australian professional wrestler best known by his ring name, Al Costello.

Crew pulled the man onto the floor and resuscitated him, says witness. Fellow traveller Richard Woods said flight attendants were 'exceptional' Plane returned to Dunedin International Airport after emergency declared. Article:","completion":"Title: A Life-Saving Moment at 35,000 Feet: Crew and Passengers Rally to Save Man on Dunedin-Wellington Flight A dramatic and heart-wrenching incident unfolded high in the skies over New Zealand, as passengers and crew joined together in a brave and concerted effort to save the life of a fellow traveler in medical distress during a flight from Dunedin to Wellington. The passenger's life hung in the balance for several minutes, during which time the flight attendants and nearby passengers worked tirelessly to ensure his survival. The harrowing event began shortly after take-off when the man on the flight, who has chosen to remain anonymous, suddenly experienced severe chest pains and began gasping for breath. According to onboard witness Richard Woods, flight attendants quickly assessed the situation and moved the man into the aisle, where they determined that he would require immediate CPR. Working together with the professionalism and efficiency that can only come from years of training, the flight attendants pulled the man onto the floor and began administering chest compressions and practicing other first-aid techniques. Woods noted that the crew's actions were nothing short of 'exceptional', as they took charge of the situation and prevented it from escalating further. Throughout the entire crisis, the flight attendants communicated calmly with the captain and other concerned passengers, who looked on with a mixture of shock and relief as the man's condition gradually began to stabilize. As Mr. Woods put it, \\"You could feel the palpable sense of relief wash over the cabin.\\" However, not wanting to take any chances with the man's fragile health, the decision was made to return the plane to Dunedin International Airport, prioritizing his well-being over the travel itinerary. Upon landing, the man was quickly whisked away by waiting paramedics and taken to a nearby hospital for further evaluation and treatment. Reflecting on the events of that fateful flight, Woods praised the flight attendants for their quick thinking and decisive actions, which undoubtedly played a crucial role in saving the man's life. From assessing the situation, administering first aid, and communicating effectively, the exceptional crew demonstrated that they were more than capable of handling a life-or-death scenario. This remarkable incident serves as a powerful reminder of the importance of airline staff training, as well as the vital role passengers can also play in emergencies. Their teamwork and determination under high-pressure conditions not only saved a man's life but also shone a spotlight on the incredible work flight attendants do every day. As Mr. Woods so aptly summarized, \\"I will never look at flight attendants the same way again. They are truly heroes in the sky.\\" In a world where we often hear about the challenges of air travel and the difficulties faced by passengers and crew alike, this touching story underscores the extraordinary dedication and professionalism of those responsible for our comfort and, in some cases, our very lives during flights both short and long."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Almost a decade ago, the federal government dropped 10 million for an Earth-monitoring satellite that never made it into space. Today it sits in a closet in Maryland. Cost to taxpayers for storing it: 1 million a year. And _ . Who knows what's in the rest of them? Because we think the government should be held to at least the same standards as a publicly traded company, and because as taxpayers, we're America's shareholders, we performed an audit of sorts of the federal books. We're not economists, but we do have common sense. We tried to get help from Congressional staffers from both parties, as well as various watchdog groups and agencies. In the end, we found that the federal government wastes nearly 1 trillion every year. That's roughly equal to the amount collected annually by the Internal Revenue Service in personal income taxes. Put another way, it's also equal to about one-third of the country's 2.9 trillion total annual budget. And reclaiming that lost trillion could help wipe out the country's annual budget deficit , improve education, and provide health insurance for those who don't have it. So how do you define \\"waste\\"? David Walker of the Government Accountability Office (GAO), a federal watchdog agency, calls it \\"the government's failure to give taxpayers the most for their money.\\" For our part, we used the kind of household test you would use on a piece of meat sitting in your refrigerator: If it smells rotten, it's waste.

(CNN) -- U.S. health officials expressed concern Friday that a swine flu virus that has infected eight people in the United States matches samples of a virus that has killed at least 68 people in Mexico. Swine flu is usually diagnosed only in pigs or people in regular contact with them. U.S. health experts also are concerned because more than 1,000 people have fallen ill in Mexico City in a short period of time. \\"This situation has been developing quickly,\\" said acting CDC director Richard Besser. \\"This is something we are worried about.\\" New York health officials announced Friday they are testing about 75 students at a Queens school for swine flu after the students exhibited flu-like symptoms this week. All of the eight","completion":"U.S. cases recovered fully, with only one person requiring hospitalization. However, the situation escalated rapidly, as the virus began to spread across the country and around the world. As the number of cases continued to grow, it soon became evident that this strain of swine flu, later named the H1N1 virus, was highly contagious and posed a significant threat to public health. In response to the escalating crisis, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO) began closely monitoring the situation, collaborating with international partners to provide guidance and support to the affected countries. Public health officials worked diligently to identify cases, track the spread of the virus, and provide care to those in need. As the virus continued to spread, several countries imposed travel restrictions in an effort to contain its transmission. Schools and businesses closed, while public gatherings were canceled in an attempt to limit human contact and slow the virus's progression. These measures were met with mixed success, as the virus continued to spread globally. Scientists and researchers quickly mobilized in an effort to develop a vaccine that would protect against this new strain of swine flu. By October 2009, just a few months after the initial outbreak, the first doses of the H1N1 vaccine were distributed to healthcare providers and high-risk populations, such as pregnant women, young children, and individuals with compromised immune systems. Although the initial rollout of the vaccine met with some public resistance and logistical challenges, it eventually gained widespread acceptance, with millions of people receiving the immunization. Over time, the H1N1 vaccine was incorporated into the seasonal flu vaccine, offering protection against both seasonal flu strains and the H1N1 virus. By August 2010, the WHO declared an end to the H1N1 pandemic. Although the H1N1 virus continues to circulate worldwide as a seasonal flu strain, public health officials and the medical community remain vigilant and well-prepared, carefully monitoring new outbreaks and adjusting the vaccine composition as needed to ensure continued protection against emerging strains of the flu virus. In the end, the swift actions of health officials, scientists, and researchers, along with the cooperation of an informed public, mitigated the impact of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. While the world faced significant challenges during this time, the lessons learned from the response to the swine flu pandemic better prepared society for future public health threats and reinforced the importance of global collaboration in addressing emerging health crises."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You might say that it’s how warm or cool something feels. In physics, temperature is defined as the average kinetic energy of the particles of matter. When particles of matter move more quickly, they have more kinetic energy, so their temperature is higher. With a higher temperature, matter feels warmer. When particles move more slowly, they have less kinetic energy on average, so their temperature is lower. With a lower temperature, matter feels cooler. Paragraph: David is trying to understand temperature and the science behind it. He took two objects, object A and object B, to his physics professor. Object A had higher temperature, but object B had lower temperature. His physics professor explained him why one object's temperature was higher while other object's temperature was lower. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Would particles move slower or faster in object A than in object B? Answer:","completion":"In the given paragraph, it is mentioned that Object A has a higher temperature, while Object B has a lower temperature. Based on the background provided, we know that temperature is defined as the average kinetic energy of the particles of matter. When particles move more quickly, they have more kinetic energy, resulting in a higher temperature. Conversely, when particles move more slowly, they have less kinetic energy, leading to a lower temperature. Since Object A has a higher temperature than Object B, we can conclude that the particles in Object A move faster compared to those in Object B. The physics professor's explanation must have revolved around this relationship between the speed of particles and the temperature of the objects. Therefore, particles in Object A move faster than the particles in Object B due to the difference in their temperatures."},{"prompt":"Q:Title: Less than desired Product review: I bought these balls for my Bostons and they LOVED them!

What do you think about RBI's new move of banning 500 and 1000 notes? Multi-choice problem: Are these two questions inquiring about the same information? Select from the following. 1. no 2. yes","completion":"2. yes The two questions are both asking about the same topic, that of the Indian government's policy decision to demonetize the 500 and 1000 rupee notes. In November 2016, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the government's decision to demonetize or withdraw the 500 and 1000 rupee notes as legal tender. The decision was taken with the aim of eradicating black money, counterfeit notes, and corruption from the system. This significant policy brought forth a huge impact, leading to nationwide discussions and debates. To elaborate further, the 500 and 1000 rupee notes, which accounted for around 86% of the total currency in circulation by value at that time, were abruptly declared as no longer legal tender. This move was aimed at bringing unaccounted wealth into the mainstream economic system, therefore intending to enhance transparency and accountability. On one hand, the move has been appreciated for its intention to curb corruption and bring black money to the forefront. It signals a move towards an economy that is less reliant on cash transactions, thereby potentially making transactions more traceable and deterring financial crimes. On the other hand, the demonetization policy led to numerous short-term disruptions. There was a significant cash shortage, contributing to economic slowdown as consumers had less cash for ordinary transactions. Especially hit hard were the rural and informal sectors, where cash transactions predominate. There were long queues outside banks and ATMs across the country, as people rushed to exchange old notes. The sudden announcement also created a sense of panic among many people, particularly those with lower income who found it more difficult to transition smoothly through this period. As for the centre's interventions in the policy's implementation, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) alongside the government managed the note exchange process. Nonetheless, RBI faced criticism for frequently altering the rules related to deposit and exchange of old notes, causing confusion among the public. In the long term, it was expected that this policy move would have positive effects by expanding the base of income tax payers, digitizing the economy, and promoting a culture of compliance. Economic data since the implementation suggests a mixed outcome; while formalization of the economy has arguably advanced, it remains an open question whether the temporary disruption resulted in long-term benefits. In summary, the two questions inquire about the same subject matter, the Indian government's demonetization policy of 500 and 1000 notes which became a defining moment in Indian economic history. Evaluating these policies and their effects fully requires a deep understanding of India's economic context and an examination of data and outcomes over the long term. Consequently, opinions about this move can vary significantly."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

Which chemical element is named after the old name for Copenhagen????","completion":"The chemical element named after the old name for Copenhagen is Hafnium (symbol Hf), which has an atomic number of 72. Hafnium is a transition metal in the periodic table and belongs to the group 4 elements, often referred to as the titanium group. The element was named after the Latin word \\"Hafnia,\\" which is the old name for the city of Copenhagen, Denmark. This choice was made in tribute to the city where Hafnium was discovered. It was first identified in 1922 by the famous Danish scientist and physicist Niels Bohr, along with two other Danish chemists, Dirk Coster and George de Hevesy. They discovered the new element by examining the x-ray spectroscopic analysis of a zirconium-containing mineral called zircon. Hafnium is relatively rare in nature, with an abundance similar to that of the more well-known element lead. Zircon, the mineral in which Hafnium was discovered, is the most common source of the element, and it is usually found together with zirconium, which it is closely related to both chemically and physically. Hafnium has various uses, and one of its most notable applications is in the nuclear industry. Due to its excellent ability to absorb neutrons, Hafnium is commonly used as a control rod material in nuclear reactors. It plays a vital role in regulating the fission process that takes place within the reactor, thus ensuring the safe production of nuclear energy. Another important application of Hafnium is in the electronics industry, where it has been used in the production of capacitors and integrated circuits due to its high dielectric constant. Moreover, Hafnium and its alloys possess excellent heat and wear resistance, which makes them suitable for high-temperature applications such as the aerospace industry, where the element is utilized in manufacturing rocket engines and thrusters, as well as in gas turbines. To summarize, Hafnium is a chemical element named after the old name for Copenhagen, \\"Hafnia,\\" in honor of the city where it was discovered. It is a transition metal with an atomic number of 72, mainly derived from zircon mineral deposits.

An extra 3,500 Calories of energy results in the storage of almost half a kilogram (1 pound) of stored body fat. People who consistently consume more food energy then they need may become obese. Obesity occurs when the body mass index is 30.0 kg/m 2 or greater. Body mass index (BMI) is an estimate of the fat content of the body. It is calculated by dividing a person’s weight (in kilograms) by the square of the person’s height (in meters). Obesity increases the risk of health problems such as type 2 diabetes and hypertension.

Q: Read the following context and answer the question. Context: \\"That's Glenn Miller,\\" my father said. \\"But it can't be.\\" He had the back of the hospital bed cranked upright, the lower lid of his left eye creeping up in a warning signal I'd learned to recognize as a child. My older sister Ann had settled deep in the recliner, and she glared at me too, blaming me for winding him up. The jam box sat on the rolling tray table and my father was working the remote as he talked, backing up my newly burned CD and letting it spin forward to play a few seconds of low fidelity trombone solo. \\"You know the tune, of course,\\" he said. \\"'King Porter Stomp.'\\" Those childhood years of listening to him play Glenn Miller on the console phonograph were finally paying off. \\"He muffed the notes the same way on the Victor version.\\" \\"So why can't it be Miller?\\" I asked. \\"He wouldn't have played with a rabble like that.\\" The backup musicians teetered on the edge of chaos, playing with an abandon somewhere between Dixieland and bebop. \\"They sound drunk.\\" My father had a major emotional investment in Miller. He and my mother had danced to the Miller band at Glen Island Casino on Long Island Sound in the summer of 1942, when they were both sixteen. That signature sound of clarinet and four saxes was forever tied up for him with first love and the early, idealistic months of the war. But there was a better reason why it couldn't have been Miller playing that solo. If the date on the original recording was correct, he was supposed to have died three days earlier. The date was in India ink on a piece of surgical tape, stuck to the top of a spool of recording wire. The handwritten numerals had the hooks and day-first order of Europe: 18/12/44. I'd won it on eBay the week before as part of a lot that included a wire recorder and a stack of 78s by French pop stars like Charles Trenent and Edith Piaf.

Now that you’ve made a list of all the new things you would like to do, it’s time to determine what you'll need to make your dream a reality! Take the time to research what equipment you should buy, what preparation you’ll need to do, etc. Consider the financial aspect of doing this activity. If there are monetary restrictions, don’t give up on the idea. Try finding a workaround. For example, if you want to learn to cook in Paris, but can't afford the plane ticket, try finding a local, French cooking class. Remember, you can and you should do more than one new thing - start researching all of your ideas! For example, if you would like to try a new hair color, you may want to start with a temporary dye. This would allow you to try out that new hue, without having to commit to it. A simulator may also come in handy if your new activity is particularly costly. By simulating the activity, such as flying a plane, you can see how you'd like it before you commit to the expense of actually taking flying lessons. This may not be applicable for everything. Don’t worry if you can’t do a trial run beforehand. That’s part of the fun! If you’d still like to learn more, talk to someone you know who has already done that particular activity, or gone to that place.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize the following: Are you writing to introduce yourself to a particular audience, or is your bio to provide a general introduction to whomever? A bio written for your Facebook page will be very different than a bio written for a website. Some social media sites, such as Twitter, restrict your bio to a certain number of words or characters. Make sure you use that space to make the biggest impact possible. This information will vary depending on who you're targeting as your audience. For a strictly personal bio, you can include details such as hobbies, personal beliefs, and mottos. For a bio that falls somewhere between \\"professional\\" and \\"completely personal,\\" consider sharing details that give a sense of who you are but are not likely to alienate others. Like a professional bio, your personal bio should give your reader a clear idea of who you are, what you do, and how well you do it. However, you can be more informal in your tone than you would in a professional bio. Joann Smith is a passionate knitter who also happens to own and run her own paper supply company.

In the early 1990s, parodies appeared in the form of films within a film in Home Alone and its sequel, Home Alone 2: Lost in New York. These parodies are called Angels with Filthy Souls and Angels with Even Filthier Souls. In an episode of Sesame Street, a segment entitled Monsters with Dirty Faces features \`\`Officer Grover showing a gang leader named Rocky how to effectively wash his face.'' Furthermore, the film's plot inspired an episode of Batman: The Animated Series called It's Never Too Late.","completion":"Angels with Filthy Souls is not a real movie in the sense of being a standalone, feature-length film. Instead, it is a fictional movie that exists within the universe of the Home Alone films. The parody film was created specifically for use in Home Alone and its sequel, Home Alone 2: Lost in New York, where it appears as a plot element. The text you provided illustrates how Angels with Dirty Faces, a 1938 crime film starring James Cagney and Pat O'Brien, has inspired various parodies, adaptations, and references in popular culture over the years. Thugs with Dirty Mugs, a 1939 Warner Bros. cartoon short, spoofed the \\"cycle\\" of crime films popular at the time. The Home Alone films from the early 1990s took inspiration from Angels with Dirty Faces for their in-universe faux films Angels with Filthy Souls and Angels with Even Filthier Souls. Angels with Filthy Souls, as seen in Home Alone, is a black-and-white gangster movie that the young protagonist, Kevin McCallister, uses to his advantage to trick people. In the sequel, Angels with Even Filthier Souls is shown, where Kevin once again cleverly employs the film to deceive others. The text also mentions other parodies and adaptations based on Angels with Dirty Faces, highlighting its influence on various media forms. These include a Sesame Street segment called Monsters with Dirty Faces, featuring \\"Officer Grover showing a gang leader named Rocky how to effectively wash his face,\\" and an episode of Batman: The Animated Series called It's Never Too Late, which uses the film's plot as an inspiration.

Read the following paragraph and determine if the hypothesis is true: In a separate mass shooting on Saturday in Pittsburgh, a man donned a bulletproof vest and killed three police officers after he had been driven into a murderous rage by an argument with his mother over a dog. According to court papers, Richard Poplawski — who had recently been dishonourably discharged from the US Marines — had been arguing with his mother about the dog urinating inside their home early on Saturday morning when she threatened to evict him. When the argument escalated, she called the police. By the time a patrol car turned up at after 7am, Mr Poplawski, 23, had armed himself with an assault rifle, a long-arm rifle, a pistol and several rounds of ammunition. Hypothesis: The mother and the dog is the sole reason for this rampage","completion":"To determine the truth value of the hypothesis, I will analyze the given paragraph step by step: 1. The man had an argument with his mother over a dog. 2. The man was recently dishonorably discharged from the US Marines. 3. The argument with his mother led her to threaten eviction. 4. The mother called the police due to the escalating argument. 5. The man had armed himself before the arrival of the police and went on a rampage. Justification: The hypothesis states that the mother and the dog are the sole reasons for the rampage. However, based on the information provided, it becomes evident there might be additional factors at play. The man's recent dishonorable discharge from the US Marines suggests that there could be more to consider regarding his mental state or circumstances. Conclusion: While the argument with the mother and the dog could have been the trigger for the rampage, it may not be accurate to declare that they are the sole reasons for it.

Trump's approval hit 43 percent in the latest NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll, with 52 percent disapproving. That represents a 3 percent improvement from last month in the same survey. Several other new surveys also show Trump at or slightly above 40 percent. The RealClearPolitics polling average puts the president's approval rating at 41 percent, a noticeable bump from August, when the rating was often in the mid-30s. For much of the second half of August, Trump's approval rating in the Gallup Daily Tracking poll was either 34 percent or 35 percent, historically a low mark for a new president. On Thursday, Gallup had Trump at 37 percent. The previous day, Trump hit 39 percent, his highest mark since late July. Trump's recent outreach to Democrats on budget issues and, possibly, immigration has boosted his poll numbers, as has his administration's response to Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. The NBC/Wall Street Journal poll found that 71 percent of those surveyed approved of Trump's deal with Democrats to fund the government until December and raise the debt ceiling, while 8 percent disapproved. The question is whether Trump has turned a political corner, or is merely seeing a temporary respite from the low poll ratings that have plagued him since the beginning of his presidency. That could depend on whether working with Democrats is a long-range goal or a passing fad, and experts said that making a forecast on that could turn out to be foolish. \\"When it comes to President Trump, I have gotten out of the prediction business,\\" said Brookings Institution scholar Bill Galston. \\"For now, this is a significant shift of strategy and tactics.

Fields disapproves of this match, especially after the starry-eyed daughter attempts to elope with her lover. Fields locks his daughter in her upstairs bedroom which is located above his dental office, where she proceeds to stamp her feet, causing plaster chunks to fall as he attempts to treat his patients.

They also agreed to a secret clause that promised the restoration of Silesia and the countship of Glatz (now Kłodzko, Poland) to Austria in the event of hostilities with Prussia. Their real desire, however, was to destroy Frederick’s power altogether, reducing his sway to his electorate of Brandenburg and giving East Prussia to Poland, an exchange that would be accompanied by the cession of the Polish Duchy of Courland to Russia. Aleksey Petrovich, Graf (count) Bestuzhev-Ryumin, grand chancellor of Russia under Empress Elizabeth, was hostile to both France and Prussia, but he could not persuade Austrian statesman Wenzel Anton von Kaunitz to commit to offensive designs against Prussia so long as Prussia was able to rely on French support.

There is mounting evidence that biodiversity increases the stability of ecosystem functions through time... Diverse communities are more productive because they contain key species that have a large influence on productivity and differences in functional traits among organisms increase total resource capture... The impacts of diversity loss on ecological processes might be sufficiently large to rival the impacts of many other global drivers of environmental change... Maintaining multiple ecosystem processes at multiple places and times requires higher levels of biodiversity than does a single process at a single place and time.\\" Now, I have a new situation: Nicaragua is one of the most biodiverse countries in the Americas.

According to the background information, a higher level of biodiversity is necessary for maintaining multiple ecosystem processes at multiple places and times. 6. With a higher level of biodiversity, Nicaragua is likely to have healthier and more functional ecosystems, showing increased stability and resilience. Therefore, the ecosystem functions in Nicaragua would likely be more stable compared to those in England due to a higher level of biodiversity, which is known to support the stability of ecosystem functions over time."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the answer?","completion":"The Australian city of Adelaide, which serves as the capital of South Australia, is located on the Torrens River. The river was named after Colonel Robert Torrens, one of the founding fathers of the city, and it plays a significant role in the city's history, planning, and development. The River Torrens has its source in the Mount Lofty Ranges, close to the town of Charleston. It flows approximately 85 kilometers (52 miles) to reach the Gulf St Vincent on the western side of Adelaide's central business district. The river's water catchment area is about 508 square kilometers (196 square miles), consisting of rugged forest and farmland. Throughout Adelaide's history, the Torrens River has been vital for the city's development and played a crucial role in its urban planning. One notable feature of Adelaide's design is a green belt of parklands surrounding the central business district. The parklands were deliberately placed around the city to create open and easily accessible recreation areas for the public. The River Torrens and its surrounding parklands have provided a lush, scenic landscape and recreational area for Adelaide residents and visitors. The creation of recreational areas was further boosted with the construction of the Torrens Lake in 1881. This artificially created lake was formed by building a dam across the river near the city. Consequently, Torrens Lake has become a popular destination for picnicking, boating, and sightseeing. A popular attraction along the river's bank is Elder Park, which hosts numerous cultural events and music festivals throughout the year. While the Adelaide Oval, a famous sports stadium that hosts cricket and football matches, lies just across the river. Moreover, the Adelaide Zoo can be found on the River Torrens' northern bank. Established in 1883, this renowned zoo houses various native Australian animals as well as a diverse array of species from around the world in specialized habitats. The River Torrens Linear Park, which stretches from the eastern end of the city to the coast, offers walking and cycling paths alongside the river, allowing people to enjoy and appreciate the natural charm and beauty of the river while staying active. In conclusion, the River Torrens is a significant natural feature of Adelaide, South Australia. It has not only contributed to the unique city layout and planning but also provided the city with a picturesque and valuable recreational resource. The river has indubitably played a central role in shaping the identity and lifestyle of Adelaide's residents and visitors by bestowing them with numerous opportunities to enjoy and engage with nature and the city's vibrant culture."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who performed a fertility dance, while Westenberg took pictures of him? ? Pod was released in the UK on May 29, 1990 by 4AD. Watts-Russell planned the date to be not too close to the release of the Pixies' Bossanova two and a half months later, for more effective publicity of both albums. Watts-Russell believed the album would be better suited to a US independent distribution label rather than the Pixies' American distributor Elektra, and licensed Pod to Rough Trade America. When this division of Rough Trade went bankrupt, Elektra assumed distribution of Pod in the US. Deal has noted that the Breeders did not receive any royalties from initial US sales because of Rough Trade's bankruptcy.The album was widely anticipated by the British music press due to the involvement of Deal and Donelly—known from their highly regarded work with the Pixies and Throwing Muses, respectively—and Albini, who likewise had a strong reputation for his previous engineering work. It reached number 22 in the UK, where it was promoted by a full-page ad in Melody Maker, and number 73 in the Netherlands. Pod sold moderately well, although Deal has noted it \\"never sold [anything]\\" compared to their next album, Last Splash (1993), which was certified platinum in the US and silver in the UK.Deal took the idea for the album's title from a painting that she saw in Boston; for her, the word \\"pod\\" evoked a uterus, which Wiggs has noted relates to the theme of fertility and the group's name. The cover art was designed by longtime 4AD album designer Vaughan Oliver and employs photography by Kevin Westenberg. Oliver, in an attempt to seduce Deal, whom he believed would appreciate the humor, attached a belt of dead eels over his underwear, which he intended as phallic symbols. He performed a fertility dance, while Westenberg took pictures of him using a long exposure to achieve the blurring and other visual effects.

The Love for Three Oranges, Op. 33, also known by its French language title L'amour des trois oranges (Russian: Любовь к трём апельсинам , \\"Lyubov' k tryom apel'sinam\\"), is a satirical opera by Sergei Prokofiev. Its French libretto was based on the Italian play \\"L'amore delle tre melarance\\" by Carlo Gozzi. The opera premiered at the Auditorium Theatre in Chicago, Illinois, on 30 December 1921. Can we infer the following? The Love for Three Oranges was meant to be taken seriously.","completion":"No, we cannot infer that The Love for Three Oranges was meant to be taken seriously. The opera, by Sergei Prokofiev, is based on the Italian play \\"L'amore delle tre melarance\\" by Carlo Gozzi, which is a work from the commedia dell'arte tradition. This theatrical style is known for its use of satire, improvisation, and humor, often with an intention to poke fun at serious subjects or to provide a light-hearted perspective. The Love for Three Oranges, Op. 33, incorporates elements of satirical comedy, exemplified through caricatured characters, a fantastical plot, and absurd situations. The opera tells the story of a melancholic prince whose laughter is provoked by the sight of a witch falling while trying to curse him. As a result, she casts another spell upon him, making him fall in love with three oranges. Throughout the story, various attempts are made to thwart the prince's quest to find the oranges and cure his newfound love obsession. The comedic nature of the opera is further emphasized through the use of parodic elements, both in the music and the libretto. Prokofiev's score cleverly blends traditional operatic themes with more unexpected and satirical musical moments, underscoring the humorous intentions of the work. Additionally, the opera's text makes use of witty and ironic exchanges between the characters, adding a layer of verbal comedy to the proceedings. Given the satirical and comedic roots of The Love for Three Oranges, it is clear that the opera was not intended to be taken seriously. Instead, it represents Prokofiev's embrace of the commedia dell'arte tradition and his desire to create a light, humorous, and entertaining experience for audiences."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Graduating from the Macon, Georgia, class of 1959 gathered together in 2009, even though many of them never had an opportunity to meet during their high school days. Schools in the 1950's, like most other public locations, were segregated in Georgia. Kids were forced to attend different schools depending on the color1 of their skin, and those with white skin were further separated by gender. Fifty years later these people who were not allowed to associate with each other were finally able to connect. It all began with the personal journey of a man named Tom Johnson. He grew up in Macon and enjoyed a very successful career which included serving as the publisher of the Los Angeles Times and president of CNN. Tom's life changed drastically over the years, but he still felt the desire to reconnect with his roots. In 2005 Johnson returned to Macon with his son, Wyatt. As the pair drove around town, the father recounted high school stories to his son. He talked about how students attended one of three schools: BallardHudson, Lanier or Miller. Wyatt looked over at his father and said:\\"Dad think about how many friends you missed getting to know.\\" Johnson thought about the people he never got the chance to meet. He decided to do something about it. The first step was to find people who graduated from all three schools. Johnson wrote to each person and proposed they all get together for a luncheon. He explained that even though they were kept apart during their youth, they didn't have to be separated any more. His classmates received the message with open hearts. A reunion date was set for October. More than 200 former Macon students traveled hundreds of miles to reunite with people who went to high school with them. It was an unprecedented event, former students coming together to make up for the time they had lost during the days of segregation.

But now I thought I might get some idea if I went down to where it was all happening, the being born and the dying. Mostly the dying. It was the dying that interested me. I sat on a bench in a sort of waiting room. I wanted to call it a green room; it wasn't a place where the patients would wait to be called by the doctor; it was a place where the relatives would wait while the patient was in their room. It had a coffee bar, and comfortable couches, with trendy, muted colors on the walls and floor. Everything was clean and modern without being cold, a homogenized balancing act designed to keep everyone calm during their stressful time. It was a green room; patients were \\"guests\\"; their families were \\"guests\\" as well. Here was where the families would sit and be feted while they waited to be called out to perform, to smile and encourage or to don faces of appropriate mournfulness. The old ones would put on smiles, the young ones would look sad. I think I went there because it seemed to me that it was the place richest in emotional impact. It reeked of spent emotions, and the emotions were made all the stronger, here in the green room, by the efforts at suppression--the muted walls and gourmet coffees and scones, the overstuffed loveseats and couches, as if those in grief should not be permitted to sit on benches or folding chairs. It absolutely reeked of hush and hidden feeling. It was worse than a church. It was worse than a highschool hallway. It was more universal, more basic, something even the children could comprehend.

It helps you slow down enough to breathe deeply, to calm your thoughts, and to research the natural world filled with wonders. And yes, to love yourself more. Try to spend one day for a long travel on foot--far from the requirements of work and family. First, choose a date and mark it as your \\"relaxing day\\". Next, choose a place that you want to visit on foot. If you enjoy being out in nature, head to a wide and open place. Try to choose a place that's no more than 15 minutes from your home. You want to spend your time walking, not driving. Walk at an easy speed so you can walk longer and farther. If you normally walk two miles a day, go for four to six miles. Wear comfortable clothes. If it's warm, wear a hat to protect your face. And don't forget your sunglasses-- not only to protect your eyes but also to give you a sense of privacy while you walk. Before you go out, get up early so you can spend a few minutes relaxing. Relaxing is something few people spend in their spare time, but it leaves you feeling much lighter and less annoyed.

Background: Reptiles are a class of animals comprising turtles, tuataras, lizards, snakes and crocodiles. They are tetrapods, but the snakes and a few species of lizard either have no limbs or their limbs are much reduced in size. Their bones are better ossified and their skeletons stronger than those of amphibians. The teeth are conical and mostly uniform in size. The surface cells of the epidermis are modified into horny scales which create a waterproof layer. Reptiles are unable to use their skin for respiration as do amphibians and have a more efficient respiratory system drawing air into their lungs by expanding their chest walls. The heart resembles that of the amphibian but there is a septum which more completely separates the oxygenated and deoxygenated bloodstreams. The reproductive system has evolved for internal fertilization, with a copulatory organ present in most species. The eggs are surrounded by amniotic membranes which prevents them from drying out and are laid on land, or develop internally in some species. The bladder is small as nitrogenous waste is excreted as uric acid.Turtles are notable for their protective shells. They have an inflexible trunk encased in a horny carapace above and a plastron below. These are formed from bony plates embedded in the dermis which are overlain by horny ones and are partially fused with the ribs and spine. The neck is long and flexible and the head and the legs can be drawn back inside the shell. Turtles are vegetarians and the typical reptile teeth have been replaced by sharp, horny plates. In aquatic species, the front legs are modified into flippers.Tuataras superficially resemble lizards but the lineages diverged in the Triassic period. There is one living species, Sphenodon punctatus. The skull has two openings (fenestrae) on either side and the jaw is rigidly attached to the skull. There is one row of teeth in the lower jaw and this fits between the two rows in the upper jaw when the animal chews. The teeth are merely projections of bony material from the jaw... Paragraph: An archipelago in the Indian ocean included two very different islands. Snake island was a reptile paradise, inhabited by many species of reptiles. Bird island had few reptiles on it, but had various birds inhabiting it. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which island was inhabited by fewer turtles?

This revelation sends shockwaves through society, as people begin to imagine the implications of living forever. The story follows two parallel narratives: that of Dr. Smith's research, and that of journalist Isabel James. Isabel is a skeptical investigative reporter who senses something amiss in the groundbreaking discovery and is determined to unveil the truth behind the potential for eternal life. As Dr. Smith's reputation and influence grow, he attracts the attention of billionaire entrepreneur Aaron Krieger and the enigmatic Luna Corporation. Krieger is obsessed with the idea of eternal life and becomes Dr. Smith's primary benefactor, financing his research and helping him establish labs and research centers across the globe. Meanwhile, Isabel embarks on a worldwide journey to interview and understand the lives of several people who have supposedly been successfully treated by Dr. Smith's methods. Her exploration intertwines with Dr. Smith's story, as she tries to shadow his every move and collect evidence. As the two storylines converge, Isabel discovers a startling truth about Dr. Smith's past. He is not merely a brilliant scientist but a living testament to his own research. He is, in fact, centuries old – a well-preserved, ageless man who has been conducting experiments for generations in a quest to unravel the secret to eternal youth. This revelation leads to a moral dilemma for Isabel: Should she expose Dr. Smith as a living experiment, potentially undermining the credibility of his work and causing widespread panic? Or should she keep his secret and allow the world to continue benefiting from his groundbreaking discovery? As the three main characters' paths intersect, Isabel is thrust into a whirlwind of intrigue, ethical conundrums, and powerful players vying for control of the secret to eternal life. Dr. Smith, on the other hand, is faced with a choice – does he continue his work against the wishes of his adversaries or sacrifice his life's mission for the greater good? In the climax of the movie, Isabel makes her decision, which has far-reaching consequences for the entire world. As some clamor for immortality, others reject it outright, and the balance of global power shifts in unforeseen ways. The final scene leaves the audience contemplating the true value of life and the moral complexities surrounding the pursuit of eternal youth. \\"Eternity's Enigma\\" compels the viewer to reevaluate their own mortality, the ethics of scientific discovery, and the impact of choices made on humanity's future."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: When looking at Western Europe,we don't usually think about poverty--but in fact,some people in modern--day Britain are so hard up that they can't afford to buy food. Back in 2008,the financial crisis caused a lot of unemployment.Then there were the cuts to the welfare system in 2013 which added to the problem--and many British people fell into debt.It's estimated that 500,000 people in the UK have turned to food banks,just to get by. Steph Hagen,who works in a Nottingham food bank,says, \\"People do not go to a food bank because it's an open door.It's a case where they go to it because they need to.With our food bank--we are an independent one.and we have limited stocks--everyone who comes through our door has no income.\\" There are checks to make sure nobody is abusing the system.If a doctor or a social worker thinks someone needs to use a food bank--even for a short time--they can give them vouchers .Then the people in need take _ along to the food bank and they get handouts for three days. Churches and individual donors provide most of the food in the banks.But some businesses might help out too. And what sort of food is offered in food banks? Hagen says, \\"Basically,we've got porridge.We do occasionally get fresh produce but it's very rare,especially in the winter months.It's like tinned fruit,tinned ready meals.We have to give out 'no-cooking' food parcels because people can't afford the gas and electricity\\". Community spirit has a lot to do with food banks.Volunteers say they are a great meeting place for people who are lonely and depressed.And when facing a crisis,some beneficiaries might need to feed not only their belly--but also their soul. Question: Why do food banks mainly offer \\"no-cooking \\" food? Options: A: Poor people have no money for gas and electricity. B: The volunteers hate to supply cooked food.

At the very least, it likely set the stage for immigration to be a key issue in November. Trump was in combat mode Wednesday during a political rally in Duluth, Minnesota, where he vowed to make immigration a central focus in the upcoming congressional campaign. “If you want to create a humane, lawful system of immigration then you need to retire the Democrats and elect Republicans to finally secure our borders,” Trump said to an enthusiastic crowd, some chanting, “Build the wall!” Just hours earlier, the president reversed his controversial policy of separating children from their parents by signing an executive order in the White House. “We are going to have strong, very strong, borders. But we are going to keep the families together,” he said. Trump decided to back away from the controversial policy of separating families after an outcry from around the country that included protests in several states, including Arizona, Texas, Pennsylvania and Massachusetts. Also driving the outrage was a recording of children crying out for their parents released by the investigative journalist group ProPublica. The separation policy drew condemnation from Republicans including former first lady Laura Bush and a host of Democrats. “We should be able to agree that we will not keep kids in child internment camps indefinitely and hidden away from public view,” said Maryland Democratic Congressman Elijah Cummings. “What country is that? This is the United States of America!” Advocates for a tough border policy sided with the president including Art Arthur of the Center for Immigration Studies. He cited a recent upsurge in attempted border crossings. Question: Where is Elijah Cummings a Congressman from? Options: - Texas - Pennsylvania - Maryland - not enough information Answer:","completion":"Elijah Cummings is a Congressman from Maryland."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Between 1941 and 1946, the left-wing British historian E.H. Carr was Assistant Editor. Carr was well known for the strongly pro-Soviet tone of his editorials. In December 1944, when fighting broke out in Athens between the Greek Communist ELAS and the British Army, Carr in a Times editorial sided with the Communists, leading Winston Churchill to condemn him and that leader in a speech to the House of Commons. As a result of Carr's editorial, The Times became popularly known during that stage of World War II as the threepenny Daily Worker (the price of the Daily Worker being one penny).

Plot title: Hannibal Rising Movie plot: In 1941, an eight-year-old Hannibal Lecter lives in Lecter Castle in Lithuania. Hitler's invasion of the Soviet Union turns the Baltic region into part of the bloodiest front line of World War II. Lecter, his younger sister Mischa, and their parents travel to the family's hunting lodge in the woods to elude the advancing German troops. After three years, the Nazis are finally driven out of the countries soon to be occupied by the Soviet Union. During their retreat, however, they destroy a Soviet tank that had stopped at the Lecter family's lodge looking for water. The explosion kills everyone but Lecter and Mischa. They survive in the cottage until five former Lithuanian militiamen, led by a Nazi collaborator named Vladis Grutas, storm and loot it. Finding no other food in the bitterly cold Baltic winter, the men look menacingly at Lecter and Mischa. By 1949, Lecter Castle has been turned into a Soviet orphanage and is ironically housing the interned orphan Hannibal Lecter. After dealing violently with a bully, Lecter escapes from the castle orphanage to Paris to live with his widowed aunt, the Lady Murasaki. While in France, Lecter flourishes as a student. He commits his first murder as a teenager, killing a local butcher who insults his aunt. He is suspected of the murder by Inspector Popil, a French detective who also lost his family in the war. Thanks in part to his aunt's intervention, Lecter escapes responsibility for the crime. Eventually, Lecter becomes the youngest person ever admitted to medical school in France. He works in Paris, where he is given a job preparing cadavers. One day, Lecter witnesses a condemned war criminal receiving a sodium thiopental injection, allowing him to recall details about his war crimes. Consequently, in an attempt to recall the names of those responsible for his sister's death, Lecter injects himself with the solution. His subsequent flashback reveals to the viewers the men who had killed Mischa, had also cannibalized her as well. Lecter returns to Lithuania in search... My question: What did Lector find at the ruins of the lodge to help him hunt Misha's killers? Answer:","completion":"Hannibal Lecter finds a collection of dog tags belonging to the men who killed and cannibalized his sister Mischa at the ruins of the lodge.

His first costumes and scenery were for the Sadler's Wells Ballet's Pineapple Poll (1951), John Cranko's ballet with a story based on a Gilbert poem and music by Sullivan. His last were for the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company's revival of The Sorcerer (1973). In between, he designed more productions for the Royal Ballet, as well as for Glyndebourne Festival Opera, the Old Vic and the West End. It was a matter of mild regret to him that of the twenty plays, operas and ballets that he designed between the two, only one was for a thoroughly serious piece, Britten's Peter Grimes, for the Bulgarian National Opera in Sofia in 1964.Only two of Lancaster's theatre designs have remained in use in 21st-century productions, both by the Royal Ballet: Pineapple Poll and La fille mal gardée. In an article on the latter in 2016, Danielle Buckley wrote, \\"Lancaster's surrealist and stylized designs for Fille amplify the story's pantomime quality, and the exaggerated burlesque of its comedy – but the backdrops of fields that roll into the distance, bundles of hay, dreamy skies and village cottages provide the idealized, pastoral context that the story needs\\". Buckley adds that Lancaster’s designs have been criticised for locating the ballet in no particular time or place – \\"except, that is, of a 1960s London view of idyllic country life\\".Lancaster's stated view was that stage sets and costumes should reflect reality, but \\"through a lens, magnifying and slightly over-emphasising everything which it reflects\\". Sir Geraint Evans commented on how Lancaster's designs helped the performer: \\"[His] design for Falstaff was superb: it gave me clues to understanding the character, and reflected that marvellous, subtle sense of humour which was present in all his work.\\", can you guess it ?

Question: A metal ball has a constant velocity of zero. Which other quantity must also be zero? Pick your answer from: -weight of the ball -energy of the ball -acceleration of the ball -inertia of the ball Answer:","completion":"Step 1: Identify the relationship between given quantities and the motion of the object. - Weight is the force acting on an object due to gravity and is independent of the object's motion. - Energy is the capacity to do work and has several forms, like kinetic and potential energy. - Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity of an object. - Inertia is the resistance of an object to a change in its motion, which depends on the mass of the object. Step 2: Analyze which quantity must be zero given the constant velocity of zero. - The weight of the ball is independent of the motion; it still has weight because of the force of gravity acting on it. - The energy of the ball would have kinetic energy if it were moving; however, it is at rest, so it has no kinetic energy but can have potential energy if it has height. - Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity. A constant velocity of zero means there is no change in the velocity; hence, acceleration must be zero. - Inertia depends on the mass of the object and does not change due to motion; it remains non-zero as long as the object has mass.

The issue being discussed here refers to a situation that is causing worry with regard to the personal freedom of individuals to move and settle within Europe. The European Union allows people living in the member states to move and settle freely under certain rules and regulations. This is one of the main pillars of the European Union, as it promotes cooperation, understanding, and growth among the member states. However, when this freedom is questioned or put at risk, this can be considered as a concern for the members of the European community. In this context, European citizenship plays a vital role in providing a sense of unity and belonging to its citizens. It encompasses a set of rights, including the right to move and reside freely within the territory of the member states, the right to vote in and stand as a candidate in the European Parliament and municipal elections, and the right to be protected by the diplomatic and consular authorities of any other member state when they are in a non-European Union country. We can infer that the situation in question could be related to some changes or threats that are affecting the rights and freedoms of European citizens, including their ability to freely move and establish themselves within the EU. This could be a result of various factors, such as political disputes, social unrest, or economic challenges that different member countries might be facing. As European citizenship is an essential aspect of the EU project that aims to bring people together and provide them with the same rights and opportunities, it is important to address any problems that might threaten these fundamental rights and freedoms. In conclusion, the phrase mentioned raises concern about the potential limitations or challenges that individuals may be facing, which could impact their free movement and freedom of establishment within Europe. Furthermore, this situation is closely related to European citizenship, which plays a significant role in ensuring that these rights and freedoms are upheld and that member states continue to pursue the goals and vision of a united and prosperous Europe. Addressing these concerns and finding solutions that protect the rights of European citizens is crucial in maintaining the integrity of the European Union and preserving the benefits and opportunities that it offers to its people."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

HARARE, Zimbabwe (CNN) -- The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) has introduced a 1,000 note -- 10 trillion in the old value -- as the country battles to end cash shortages in the hyper-inflationary environment. Zimbabwe's currency is trading around Z350 -- 35 trillion in the old value -- against U.S. dollar. However, analysts said the new note -- which can only buy a loaf of bread -- will not ease pressure on cash shortages because of the ever-increasing prices. \\"It will not make even a small impact. What we need in Zimbabwe is a clear change of policies, start production and then inflation will start easing up,\\" said John Robertson, an economic consultant. \\"The zeros seem to be coming back no matter how often they slash them.\\" In August, Zimbabwe slashed ten zeroes on the currency; two years earlier the country slashed three zeros. The zeroes keep bouncing back in the country that has an inflation rate of 11.2 million -- the highest in the world. Zimbabwe's agro-based economy has been on a free-fall for more than a decade now. The situation was exacerbated by the destruction of commercial agriculture in 2000 when President Robert Mugabe's government embarked on a violent land grab from white farmers and gave it to inexperienced black farmers. Mugabe denies that he is to blame for the country's economic collapse, citing economic sanctions that have been placed on Zimbabwe. Since 2000, Zimbabwe's currency has been depreciating against major currency. It is trading around 350 Zimbabwean dollars -- 35 trillion in the old value -- against the U.S. dollar.

The country's economy is not doing well, and it has been having problems for more than ten years. One reason is because some farmland was taken from experienced farmers and given to people who didn't know how to farm well.

Article: The war entered a new phase with the unprecedented defeat of the Japanese at Battle of Suixian-Zaoyang and 1st Battle of Changsha. After these victories, Chinese nationalist forces launched a large-scale counter-offensive in early 1940; however, due to its low military-industrial capacity, it was repulsed by Japanese army in late March 1940. In August of 1940, Chinese communists launched an offensive in Central China; in retaliation, Japan instituted the \\"Three Alls Policy\\" (\\"Kill all, Burn all, Loot all\\") in occupied areas to reduce human and material resources for the communists. By 1941 the conflict had become a stalemate. Although Japan had occupied much of northern, central, and coastal China, the Nationalist Government had retreated to the interior with a provisional capital set up at Chungking while the Chinese communists remained in control of base areas in Shaanxi. In addition, Japanese control of northern and central China was somewhat tenuous, in that Japan was usually able to control railroads and the major cities (\\"points and lines\\"), but did not have a major military or administrative presence in the vast Chinese countryside.

On his next album, Planet Waves, he used the Band as backing group, while rehearsing for a tour. The album included two versions of \\"Forever Young\\", which became one of his most popular songs. As one critic described it, the song projected \\"something hymnal and heartfelt that spoke of the father in Dylan\\", and Dylan himself commented: \\"I wrote it thinking about one of my boys and not wanting to be too sentimental.\\"Columbia Records simultaneously released Dylan, a collection of studio outtakes (almost exclusively covers), widely interpreted as a churlish response to Dylan's signing with a rival record label. In January 1974, Dylan returned to touring after seven years; backed by the Band, he embarked on a North American tour of 40 concerts. A live double album, Before the Flood, was on Asylum Records. Soon, according to Clive Davis, Columbia Records sent word they \\"will spare nothing to bring Dylan back into the fold\\". Dylan had second thoughts about Asylum, miffed that while there had been millions of unfulfilled ticket requests for the 1974 tour, Geffen had sold only 700,000 copies of Planet Waves. Dylan returned to Columbia Records, which reissued his two Asylum albums. After the tour, Dylan and his wife became estranged. He filled a small red notebook with songs about relationships and ruptures, and recorded an album entitled Blood on the Tracks in September 1974. Dylan delayed the release and re-recorded half the songs at Sound 80 Studios in Minneapolis with production assistance from his brother, David Zimmerman.Released in early 1975, Blood on the Tracks received mixed reviews. In the NME, Nick Kent described \\"the accompaniments [as] often so trashy they sound like mere practice takes.\\" In Rolling Stone, Jon Landau wrote that \\"the record has been made with typical shoddiness.\\" Over the years critics came to see it as one of Dylan's greatest achievements.

What is the answer to this question? who is the film the blind side based on?","completion":"The film \\"The Blind Side\\" is based on the life of Michael Oher, a former American football offensive tackle who played in the National Football League (NFL) for multiple teams. The movie, released in 2009, is an adaptation of the book \\"The Blind Side: Evolution of a Game\\" written by Michael Lewis in 2006. \\"The Blind Side\\" tells the inspirational story of Michael Oher's journey from a homeless and struggling teenager to a successful professional athlete, with the help and support of a caring and loving family. Michael Oher was born on May 28, 1986, in Memphis, Tennessee. He had a difficult childhood, as his father was frequently in prison, and his mother was addicted to drugs. Due to these circumstances, Michael grew up in various foster homes or was homeless for several periods. Throughout his early life, he faced significant adversity and lacked stability and guidance, which affected his education and behavioral development. \\"The Blind Side\\" focuses on the Tuohy family's relationship with Michael and their dedication to nurturing his potential. Leigh Anne Tuohy, played by Sandra Bullock, discovers Michael one cold night and offers him a temporary place to stay. However, when she realizes Michael's unstable background and challenging circumstances, she and her family decide to adopt him and invest in his education and well-being. With the Tuohy family's support, Michael enrolls at Wingate Christian School, a private institution, where academic coach Miss Sue, played by Kathy Bates, helps him improve his grades and qualify for a football scholarship. As he begins to integrate into school and family life, Michael discovers his talent for American football. Under the guidance of coach Bert Cotton, played by Ray McKinnon, Michael starts on the path to a professional football career. His hard work and natural talent lead him to receive several offers from Division I colleges. Eventually, he chooses to attend the University of Mississippi, the Tuohys' alma mater. In the film, Sandra Bullock earned an Academy Award for Best Actress for her portrayal of Leigh Anne Tuohy, while the film was nominated for Best Picture. Michael Oher's real-life story transcended the movie screen as he went on to excel in football throughout college and eventually become a first-round NFL draft pick in 2009. He was drafted by the Baltimore Ravens and played for them when they won Super Bowl XLVII. Oher also played for the Tennessee Titans and the Carolina Panthers during his NFL career, which ended in 2017. \\"The Blind Side\\" showcases the power of love, determination, and support from family, friends, and mentors. It's a story that highlights the importance of second chances and how the care and dedication of others can help unlock potential and create opportunities for those who may have otherwise experienced a life without access to life-changing resources."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Information: - Schwyz is a canton in central Switzerland between the Alps in the south, Lake Lucerne to the west and Lake Zürich in the north, centered on and named after the town of Schwyz. - Stauffacher is a tram junction ( lines 2 , 3 , 8 , 9 , 14 ) in Aussersihl , Zurich , next to the St. Jakob church , situated along the Badenerstrasse between the Bäcker and the Stauffacher streets . The tram stop was named after the street , which had been named for Werner Stauffacher in 1893 . Stauffacher is officially just the name of the tram stop , not the square , and there was formerly a Stauffacherplatz some 200 m farther along the street towards the Sihl ( named in 1898 ) . Since the name of the tram stop induced common usage to associate Stauffacherplatz with the tram stop , leading to confusion with the actual Stauffacherplatz , the latter was renamed to Ernst - Nobs - Platz in 2003 . St. Jakob was the site of a sick - house outside the town of Zurich and an associated chapel since the 11th century . The first historical mention of the St. Jakob church dates to 1221 . It was the site of the Battle of St. Jakob an der Sihl in 1443 . In 1677 , the sick - house was transformed into a Pfrundhaus ( senior citizens ' residence ) , disestablished in 1842 . The current St. Jakob church building was inaugurated in 1901 . - The Limmat is a river in Switzerland. The river commences at the outfall of Lake Zurich, in the southern part of the city of Zurich. From Zurich it flows in a northwesterly direction, after 35 km reaching the river Aare. The confluence is located north of the small town of Brugg and shortly after the mouth of the Reuss. - A river is a natural flowing watercourse, usually freshwater, flowing towards an ocean, sea, lake or another river. In some cases a river flows into the ground and becomes dry at the end of its course without reaching another body of water. Small rivers can be referred to using names such as stream, creek, brook, rivulet, and rill. There are no official definitions for the generic term river as applied to geographic features, although in some countries or communities a stream is defined by its size. Many names for small rivers are specific to geographic location; examples are \\"run\\" in some parts of the United States, \\"burn\\" in Scotland and northeast England, and \\"beck\\" in northern England. Sometimes a river is defined as being larger than a creek, but not always: the language is vague. - The Sihl is a Swiss river that rises near the Druesberg mountain in the canton of Schwyz, and eventually flows into the Limmat in the centre of the city of Zürich. It has a length of , including the Sihlsee reservoir, through which the river flows. Water is abstracted from the river at the Sihlsee, leading to decreased downstream water flows and a consequent negative impact on water quality. - Aegidius (or Giles or Glig) Tschudi (5 February 150528 February 1572) was an eminent member of the Tschudi family, of Glarus, Switzerland.

They are the largest ethnic group in Ethiopia and the wider Horn of Africa. According to the 2007 census, they represent approximately 34.5% of Ethiopia's population, while others estimate they make up about 40% of the population. With the total Ethiopian population thought to be over 102 million, the number of Oromo people exceeds 35 million in Ethiopia alone. Historically, Afaan Oromo-speaking people used their own Gadaa system of governance. Oromos also had a number of independent kingdoms, which they shared with the Sidama people. Among these were the Gibe region kingdoms of Gera, Gomma, Garo, Gumma, Jimma, Leeqa-Nekemte and Limmu-Ennarea. The earliest known documented and detailed history of the Oromo people was by the Ethiopian monk Abba Bahrey who wrote Zenahu le Galla in 1593, though the synonymous term Gallas was mentioned in maps or elsewhere much earlier. After the 16th century, they are mentioned more often, such as in the records left by Abba Pawlos, Joao Bermudes, Jerorimo Lobo, Galawdewos, Sarsa Dengel and others. These records suggest that the Oromo were pastoral people in their history, who stayed together. Their animal herds began to expand rapidly and they needed more grazing lands. They began migrating, not together, but after separating. They lacked kings, and had elected leaders called luba based on a gada system of government instead. By the late 16th century, two major Oromo confederations emerged: Afre and Sadaqa, which respectively refer to four and three in their language, with Afre emerging from four older clans, and Sadaqa out of three. These Oromo confederations were originally based on southern parts of Ethiopia, but started moving north in the 16th century in what is termed as the \\"Great Oromo Migration\\". According to Richard Pankhurst, an Ethiopia historian, this migration is linked to the first incursions into inland Horn of Africa by Imam Ahmad ibn Ibrahim. According to historian Marianne Bechhaus-Gerst, the migration was one of the consequences of fierce wars of attrition between Christian and Muslim armies in the Horn of Africa region in the 15th and 16th century which killed a lot of people and depopulated the regions near the Galla lands, but also probably a result of droughts in their traditional homelands. Further, they acquired horses and their gada system helped coordinate well equipped Oromo warriors who enabled fellow Oromos to advance and settle into newer regions starting in the 1520s. This expansion continued through the 17th century. Both peaceful integration and violent competition between Oromos and other neighboring ethnicities such as the Amhara, Sidama, Afar and the Somali affected politics within the Oromo community. Between 1500 and 1800, there were waves of wars and struggle between highland Christians, coastal Muslim and polytheist population in the Horn of Africa. This caused major redistribution of populations. The northern, eastern and western movement of the Oromos from the south around 1535 mirrored the large-scale expansion by Somalis inland. The 1500-1800 period also saw relocation of the Amhara people, and helped influence contemporary ethnic politics in Ethiopia. According to oral and literary evidence, Borana Oromo clan and Garre Somali clan mutually victimized each other in seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, particularly near their eastern borders. There were also periods of relative peace. According to Gunther Schlee, the Garre Somali clan replaced the Borana Oromo clan as the dominant ethnic group in this region. The Borana violence against their neighbors, states Schlee, was unusual and unlike their behavior inside their community where violence was considered deviant.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: What type of government did they have?","completion":"The Oromo people had a type of government called the Gadaa system.

PUBLISHED:. 08:56 EST, 10 July 2013. |. UPDATED:. 09:08 EST, 10 July 2013. A newspaper column lampooning Southern Baptists, calling the group 'the crazy old paranoid uncle of evangelical Christians,' is causing quite a stir in a Kentucky city and put a pastor's job in jeopardy. The column was written by Angela Thomas, the wife of Bill Thomas, an assistant pastor at the First Baptist Church in Madisonville. Her column was done in response to the Southern Baptist Convention's opposition to a new Boy Scouts of America policy that welcomes gay members. The First Baptist Church in Madisonville, Kentucky has been caught up in uncertainty over the future of Assistant Pastor Bill Thomas after his wife wrote a column lampooning their church. 'Sexuality doesn't come up and isn't relative to typical scouting activities but now, thanks to Southern Baptists, the parents of little innocent scouts everywhere are having to have The Talk,' she wrote June 19 in The Madisonville Messenger. She writes a weekly humor column for the community paper, which publishes daily. In the weeks since, the status of Bill Thomas' job with the church has become unclear. The First Baptist pastor said he had accepted Thomas' resignation, but Thomas' wrote in a letter obtained by the newspaper he had not quit. Thomas has worked at the church for 10 years and was also its musical director. 'The crazy old paranoid uncle of evangelical Christians': Angela Thomas used her newspaper column to poke fun at Southern Baptists. Bill and Angela Thomas declined to be interviewed by The Associated Press on Tuesday. But he previously told the newspaper he agreed with what his wife wrote. The column said Southern Baptists have become 'raging Shiite Baptists' after drifting 'to the right' for the past four decades. 'Santa and the Easter bunny are simply the devil in disguise and cable television and the Internet are his playground. The Boy Scouts are his evil minions,' she wrote. Madisonville is a city of about 19,000 in the western part of the state, about 115 miles southwest of Louisville. First Baptist Church Pastor Joe Leonard said the opinion piece was not the cause of Bill Thomas' departure. 'That's what people have made it out to be,' Leonard said. 'That column precipitated some conversation with (Thomas), but that is not the reason he resigned. And because of confidentiality I can't divulge the conversation and what went on.' The Southern Baptist Church is strongly opposed to the Boy Scouts of America new policy to welcome openly gay members. Leonard said he had accepted Thomas' resignation and Thomas was not fired. Thomas wrote in a letter he had not resigned and had no intention of stepping down. The Rev. Russell Moore, head of the public policy arm of the Southern Baptist Convention, said he was surprised the 'shockingly sarcastic tone' of the column came from the spouse of a church employee. It's not clear whether Angela Thomas also attended First Baptist. 'I didn't find the column to be the sort of lighthearted poking that one would typically find in satire,' Moore said. 'I found it instead to be more of a screed from someone who's very hostile to where most Baptists stand.' Moore said the column also mischaracterized the convention's stance on the Boy Scout policy. The Southern Baptist Convention's action last month 'was a very balanced resolution that didn't denounce the Boy Scouts,' Moore said. 'We expressed disappointment, but didn't speak in harsh terms and also did not direct churches as to how they should respond.' The Southern Baptist Convention believes in marriage between a man and a woman and condemns homosexuality as a sin. The headquarters of the nation's largest protestant denomination - Southern Baptists - in Nashville, Tenn. Many churches around the country, including some Baptist, have protested the Boy Scouts' policy by cutting ties with their local chapters. First Baptist member Larry Wilson said Bill Thomas was accused of 'intolerable insubordination' by a staff committee and was told to submit a letter of resignation. 'To me, it sounds more like a termination or a forced resignation than a resignation,' said Wilson, who is also a Hopkins County magistrate. Wilson said he believed Bill Thomas ran afoul of some church leadership before the column was published by supporting an openly gay church member. Wilson said Thomas was told to prevent the member from joining the choir, but Thomas declined to do so. The church offered Thomas a severance package – contingent on him not making public statements about the details of his departure, Wilson said. According to church policy, staff terminations must be approved by the congregation, and church leaders wanted to avoid that step, Wilson said. Wilson said he enjoyed reading Angela Thomas' column. 'There were points in it that I thought were hilarious, it was funny, thought provoking,' he said. 'Maybe we are Shiite Baptists.'

Please answer the following question: Information: - A U.S. state is a constituent political entity of the United States of America. There are 50 states, which are bound together in a union with each other. Each state holds administrative jurisdiction over a defined geographic territory, and shares its sovereignty with the United States federal government. Due to the shared sovereignty between each state and the federal government, Americans are citizens of both the federal republic and of the state in which they reside. State citizenship and residency are flexible, and no government approval is required to move between states, except for persons covered by certain types of court orders (e.g., paroled convicts and children of divorced spouses who are sharing custody). - South Dakota is a state located in the Midwestern region of the United States. It is named after the Lakota and Dakota Sioux Native American tribes, who compose a significant portion of the population and historically dominated the entire territory. South Dakota is the 17th most expansive, but the 5th least populous and the 5th least densely populated of the 50 United States. Once the southern portion of the Dakota Territory, South Dakota became a state on November 2, 1889, simultaneously with North Dakota. Pierre is the state capital and Sioux Falls, with a population of about 171,000, is South Dakota's largest city. - Americans are citizens of the United States of America. The country is home to people of many different national origins. As a result, Americans do not equate their nationality with ethnicity, but with citizenship and allegiance. Although citizens make up the majority of Americans, non-citizen residents, dual citizens, and expatriates may also claim an American identity. - The Sioux are groups of Native American tribes and First Nations peoples in North America. The term can refer to any ethnic group within the Great Sioux Nation or to any of the nation's many language dialects. The Sioux comprise three major divisions based on language divisions: the Dakota, Lakota, and Nakota. - The Territory of Dakota was an organized incorporated territory of the United States that existed from March 2, 1861, until November 2, 1889, when the final extent of the reduced territory was split and admitted to the Union as the states of North and South Dakota. - The South Dakota Department of Transportation is a state government organization in charge of maintaining public roadways of the U.S. state of South Dakota . South Dakota has 82,447 miles of highways , roads and streets ; 5,905 bridges . The SD DOT is responsible for 7,830 miles of the roadway system .

Background: Comet is the name of two fictional comic book characters owned by DC Comics whose adventures have been published by that same company. The first character was a sapient horse with magical powers who was once a centaur in ancient Greece. The second character is a shapeshifter with three forms (male, female, and winged centaur). Both characters are connected to the Superman family of titles. Context: A very different Comet was introduced in Supergirl #14 (October 1997). This version was originally introduced as a hero with flight and cold-generation powers. Comet's appearance was unclear, as when using his powers he was surrounded by an aura of cold that made him resemble an actual comet. Comet looked like a man with three fingers, horse-like legs, long white hair, and a star mark on his forehead. There was a lot of speculation about who Comet was, but it was revealed that Comet was Andrea Martinez, a gay stand-up comic, who like her friend Linda Danvers (who could turn into Supergirl), could shape-shift between her human and super-powered forms (however, Comet's change also involved changing gender, from the female Andrea to the male Comet). Soon, it was learned that Comet's male form was originally Andrew Jones, a (male) jockey, who had been trampled by horses and \\"rebuilt\\" by an organization called \\"The Stable\\" as a superhuman with equine DNA. He rebelled against the organization and began operating as a superhero. On one of his first missions he attempted to save a despairing Andrea Martinez (who had just come out to her parents, and been rejected) from an avalanche, but they both died. As with Matrix and Linda Danvers (who had merged into Supergirl, the Angel of Fire), this caused them to combine into one being: the Earth Angel of Love. Comet originally was in love with Supergirl, and since he was the Angel of Love, made her have feelings for him too, but she rejected him when she learned he was also a woman. This opened the door for the third Angel, Blithe, the Angel of Light, to use her powers to exploit Comet's heartbreak, and turn them against Supergirl. She enabled Comet to fully embrace their angel powers, transforming him/herself into a winged centaur. Blithe deceived Comet into joining forces with the Carnivore (a powerful demonic creature who despised the Earth Angels, and sought their power). The Carnivore lost control, however, when Andrea abandoned her anger, learning that her mother had died, and had left a video apology for her actions. The three Earth Angels worked together to stop the Carnivore. Comet began a relationship with Blithe, since she loved both their forms (revealing that Blithe is bisexual). Question: Who is Comet Post-Crisis? Answer:","completion":"Post-Crisis, Comet is a character introduced in Supergirl #14 (October 1997). Originally known as Andrea Martinez, a gay stand-up comic, Comet has the ability to shape-shift between her human form and a male super-powered form with flight and cold-generation powers. Andrea Martinez's male form, Comet, was originally Andrew Jones, a jockey who had been \\"rebuilt\\" with equine DNA by an organization called \\"The Stable.\\" The two individuals merged into one being, the Earth Angel of Love, during a tragic event when they both died and later became connected to the Superman family of titles. Comet initially falls in love with Supergirl, but after facing rejection due to his dual identity, he starts a relationship with Blithe, the Angel of Light, who is revealed to be bisexual."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Dame Helen Lydia Mirren, (nee Mironoff; born 26 July 1945) is an English actor. Mirren began her acting career with the Royal Shakespeare Company in 1967, and is one of the few performers who have achieved the Triple Crown of Acting. She won the Academy Award for Best Actress in 2007 for her performance as Queen Elizabeth II in The Queen and received the Olivier Award for Best Actress and Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play for the same role in The Audience. Mirren's other Academy Award nominations include The Madness of King George (1994), Gosford Park (2001) and The Last Station (2009). Mirren's first film of the 2000s was Joel Hershman's Greenfingers (2000), a comedy based on the true story about the award-winning prisoners of HMP Leyhill, a minimum-security prison. Mirren portrayed a devoted plantswoman in the film, who coaches a team of prison gardeners, led by Clive Owen, to victory at a prestigious flower show. The project garnered largely lukewarm reviews from critics, who felt that it added \\"nothing new to this already saturated genre\\" of British feel-good films. The same year, she began work on the mystery film The Pledge, actor Sean Penn's second directorial effort, in which she played a child psychologist. A critical success, the ensemble film tanked at the box office. Also the year, she filmed the American-Icelandic satirical drama No Such Thing opposite Sarah Polley. Directed by Hal Hartley, Mirren portrayed a soulless television producer in the film, who strives for sensationalistic stories. It was largely panned by critics. Her biggest critical and commercial success, released in 2001, became Robert Altman's all-star ensemble mystery film Gosford Park. An homage to writer Agatha Christie's whodunit style, the story follows a party of wealthy Britons and an American, and their servants, who gather for a shooting weekend at an English country house, resulting in an unexpected murder. Widely acclaimed by critics, it received multiple awards and nominations, including a second Academy Award nomination and first Screen Actors Guild Award win for Mirren's portrayal of the sternly devoted head servant Mrs. Wilson. Mirren's last film that year was Fred Schepisi's dramedy film Last Orders opposite Michael Caine and Bob Hoskins. In 2003, Mirren starred in Nigel Cole's comedy Calendar Girls, inspired by the true story of a group of Yorkshire women who produced a nude calendar to raise money for Leukaemia Research under the auspices of the Women's Institutes. Mirren was initially resistant to join the project, at first dismissing it as another middling British picture, but rethought her decision upon learning of the casting of co-star Julie Walters. The film garnered generally positive reactions by film critics, and grossed 96,000,000 worldwide. In addition, the picture earned Satellite, Golden Globe, and European Film Award nominations for Mirren. Her other film that year was the Showtime television film The Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone opposite Olivier Martinez, and Anne Bancroft, based on the 1950 novel of the same title by Tennessee Williams.

The second question, \\"Should I do a plastic surgery or not?\\" asks the person for advice on whether or not the inquirer should undertake plastic surgery. This question is seeking guidance from the responder about the questioner's own decision and seeks to understand the pros and cons from an external perspective. While both questions revolve around the topic of plastic surgery, they differ in their focus and the type of response they elicit. The first question asks for a personal preference, while the second one seeks advice on a personal decision."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Please answer this question: where does carrie bradshaw live in sex and the city?","completion":"Carrie Bradshaw, the iconic and fashionable protagonist played by Sarah Jessica Parker in the television series \\"Sex and the City,\\" lives in the bustling metropolis of New York City. Specifically, her apartment is located on the island of Manhattan, where much of the show's action takes place. The character's apartment is fictitiously placed at 245 East 73rd Street, between Park Avenue and Lexington Avenue, in the posh Upper East Side neighborhood. However, the actual exterior shots of Carrie's iconic brownstone residence were filmed at 64 Perry Street in the West Village. The West Village, which is part of the larger Greenwich Village area, is known for its charming streets, quaint shops, and historic brownstone buildings. Carrie's love for New York City is a central theme in the show, and her apartment exemplifies that. Her apartment is a reflection of her personality, with a walk-in closet full of designer clothes and a distinctive mix of vintage and modern furniture. One of the most memorable features in her apartment is the turquoise and white kitchen, which contrasts with the colorful collection of items scattered around her home. Over the course of six seasons and two movies, audiences were able to delve deeper into Carrie's life and surroundings. Her friendships with the three other main characters—Charlotte York (Kristin Davis), Miranda Hobbes (Cynthia Nixon), and Samantha Jones (Kim Cattrall)—often revolve around their different perspectives and experiences in various parts of the city. Throughout the series, the four friends would frequent upscale restaurants, attend glamorous parties, and explore the diverse cultural offerings that New York City has to offer. The setting of Sex and the City, particularly Carrie's residence in Manhattan, has become a symbol of New York City's energy, fashion, and glitz, making it an instantly recognizable and celebrated location. The show and its characters have played a significant role in shaping popular culture's perception of New York City in the late 1990s and early 2000s, and Carrie Bradshaw's apartment remains an iconic destination for fans visiting the city."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

See options at the end Bill wanted his wife to think he was a nicer person, so he bought her the flowers instead of the chocolates, since the a). chocolates would make his wife miserable. b). flowers would make his wife miserable.","completion":"To determine how the sentence should end, we need to analyze the information given. The sentence states that Bill bought the flowers to be seen as a nicer person and to make his wife think he was nicer. This suggests that the chosen option should have a positive outcome for his wife rather than a negative one. Between the two options: a). chocolates would make his wife miserable. b). flowers would make his wife miserable. Option a) implies that the chocolates would have had a negative effect on his wife's mood. Since Bill chose to buy flowers instead, this option aligns with his intention of appearing as a nicer person. Option b) indicates that flowers would make his wife miserable. However, this contradicts the information given that Bill bought the flowers to be seen as a nicer person.

First question: \\"How did the word 'word' become a word?\\" Second question: \\"What is another word for the word 'word'?\\" Are these two questions asking the same thing?","completion":"First question: \\"How did the word 'word' become a word?\\" The word \\"word\\" has become a word through a long process of linguistic evolution that began with the use of oral communication among ancient human societies. As languages developed over time, people found ways to unite sounds, symbols, meanings, and rules and began to form structures that allowed them to express their thoughts and ideas with others. The word \\"word\\" originates from the Old English word \\"weorþ,\\" which later became \\"weorð\\" and \\"werd.\\" Old English “weorþ” or “word” was related to Germanic and Old Norse word roots, such as the Old High German \\"wurt\\" and Old Norse \\"orð.\\" All these words were derived from the Proto-Germanic root \\"*wurdą,\\" which itself was derived from the Proto-Indo-European (PIE) root \\"*werdho.\\" In PIE, \\"*werdho\\" meant \\"a word\\" or \\"speech,\\" and from this root, many words in various other languages and language families were derived. For example, the Latin word “verbum” and the Greek word “eirein” are cognates of the English word \\"word.\\" With the rise of alphabets and written language, words also started to be denoted by visual symbols. In this way, the word “word” itself became a descriptor for any unit of linguistic meaning used in spoken or written communication. Second question: \\"What is another word for the word 'word'?\\" Various synonyms for the word \\"word\\" can be found within the English language. Some of them include: 1. Term: referring to a word or phrase used to describe a thing or to express a concept, particularly in a specific field or discipline. 2. Expression: a word or phrase used to convey a specific meaning or idea. 3. Utterance: a spoken word, phrase, or statement. 4. Locution: a particular form of expression or a phrase. 5. Linguistic unit: a more technical term referring to the smallest element of language that can function independently, such as a word or a morpheme. While these synonyms convey similar meanings as \\"word,\\" they also include additional nuances that may distinguish them from the base term \\"word.\\" Regarding your question of whether these two inquiries are asking the same thing, the answer is no. While both are about the word 'word,' the first question is focused on the etymology and historical evolution of the word. It looks into how the word \\"word\\" itself came into existence. In contrast, the second question is seeking alternative terms or synonyms for the word \\"word\\" within the English language."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Here is an article: By Gary Stoller, USA TODAY Most airlines have eliminated meals, free pillows and magazines. They've reduced snacks to a miniature bag of pretzels. But there's one frill many refuse to skimp on in their cost-cutting drive to be profitable: wine. The world's airlines annually buy about 4.3 million gallons of wine, and some spend at least 15 million on wine each year, the airlines and wine experts estimate. Some airlines pour wine that retails for 50 to 220 a bottle. And some employ consultants or sommeliers and require flight attendants to take courses to improve their wine knowledge. \\"Service cutbacks and the recession have not affected airlines' wine-buying policies,\\" says Lori Lynne Brundick, president of Intervine, an airline wine supplier in Napa, Calif. \\"They're buying quality wines and increasing the diversity of their wine lists.\\" Why hold onto an apparent extravagance in an age of low-cost, no-amenity flying? The airlines say the wines they serve uphold their reputations and instill brand loyalty in their highest-paying customers: first- and business-class passengers. Premium passengers are served the better-quality wines for free. Coach passengers, however, usually receive lesser-quality wine and pay five or six times what the airline paid for it. USA TODAY gathered the wine lists of 33 airlines with U.S. flights and asked wine expert Dan Berger to evaluate them. Berger is a syndicated wine columnist who judges wine competitions and has a website, www.vintageexperiences.com. \\"I'm impressed with what many airlines are offering,\\" says Berger, who evaluated all wines, champagnes and ports for October-through-December flights. \\"Their wine lists show creativity and forethought.\\" Berger says he's \\"astounded\\" by the wine lists of Qantas and Air New Zealand on flights to and from the USA. He ranks Qantas No. 1 and Air New Zealand No. 2 of the 33 airlines' wine lists. \\"I can't even begin to tell you how exciting it would be to get some of this stuff off the wine cart in coach on a Qantas flight,\\" he says. Top-quality wines – provided free to coach passengers on Qantas – include 2008 Brokenwood Cricket Pitch Cabernet Merlot Shiraz and 2008 St Hallett Poacher's Blend Semillon Sauvignon Blanc, Berger says. Qantas' wine lists for premium-class passengers narrowly gave it the nod over Air New Zealand for first place. Among choices in premium class, Qantas offers \\"an outstanding wine that consumers never see\\" – 2005 Leeuwin Estate Art Series Chardonnay – and \\"an underrated, gorgeous wine,\\" 2004 Penfolds Bin 389 Cabernet Shiraz. Berger calls Air New Zealand's list \\"the best I've ever seen in coach.\\" Wines on the list include two \\"phenomenal\\" selections: 2008 Lake Chalice Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc and 2008 Spy Valley Sauvignon Blanc. Berger says he \\"lost it\\" when he saw that Japan Air Lines' list for first-class passengers included 1997 Champagne Salon. Only 60,000 bottles of the French champagne were made. \\"How can they afford that?\\" he asks. \\"The lowest retail price you'll find is 220 a bottle.\\" Of U.S. airlines, Berger ranks American No. 1 and United No. 2. They score high because of their wine lists for premium-class passengers. Most U.S. airlines sell \\"below-average\\" wines to coach passengers on domestic flights, but those served by American (AMR) and JetBlue are above average, he says. JetBlue (JBLU) offers only two wines – 2007 Hope Estate Verdelho and Shiraz – but gets high scores for quality wine that fliers are \\"unlikely to find in the air,\\" Berger says. Impressive wine lists are meaningless, he says, if an airline buys a limited amount of a wine or rarely has it on a flight. An airline may have 20 or 30 wines on its systemwide wine list but on a single flight offer only four or five to premium-class passengers. Berger says it's a shame that coach passengers cannot drink many of the fine wines served to premium-class fliers. Next month, Japanese airline All Nippon Airways will begin selling coach passengers wines served in business class on international flights. \\"We see many customers doing wine-tastings on board as a way to pass the time, \\"says Jennifer Janzen, a spokeswoman for the German airline Lufthansa, Lufthansa employs master of wine Markus Del Monego to make its selections. Serving excellent wines \\"is extremely important to Lufthansa – something we've built our reputation on,\\" Janzen says. Frequent flier Eric Thompson, who's been on about 100 flights this year, says the quality of wine offered to premium-class passengers by foreign airlines is \\"generally a notch above\\" those served by U.S. airlines. Wine and spirits have long been important to airlines, which have offered alcoholic beverages to fliers since the 1930s, according to the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum. But the quality hasn't always been good. \\"About 25 years ago, it was fair to say that airlines in general were seen by suppliers as a dumping ground for excess stocks and poor vintages,\\" says Andrew Sparrow, a former British Airways wine buyer. Today, Sparrow says, \\"Most full-service airlines take their wine selection very seriously and have a well-thought-out selection process that often involves outside consultants.\\" Jancis Robinson has been British Airways' wine consultant since 1995. She says she's wary of selecting \\"particularly subtle or tannic wines,\\" because passengers' palates \\"dry up a bit in the air,\\" and wines are served a little cooler in-flight than on the ground. Flying is stressful and affects \\"sensory perception,\\" which makes wine seem bitter in-flight, says master of wine Tim Hanni, who consulted for Finnair in the 1990s. Robinson says, \\"Airlines tend to fall into two groups: those that really care about the quality of wine they offer and go to great lengths to maximize it, and those that just shrug their shoulders and offer something liquid and alcoholic.\\" Singapore Airlines is in the former group. It spends more than 16 million a year on wine, gives its flight attendants sommelier training and maintains a wine cellar in Singapore, says spokesman James Boyd. The airline also has a pressurized chamber that can replicate the pressurization, temperature and humidity inside an aircraft flying at cruising altitude. In March, American Airlines hired Ken Chase, a classically trained winemaker and viticulturist, to select wines for passengers. American says it has since introduced on many long flights larger, tulip-shaped glasses that allow premium-class passengers \\"to more easily swirl the wine and enjoy its aromas.\\" Rival United Airlines' (UAUA) wine consultant is Doug Frost, one of only three people in the world with the titles master sommelier and master of wine, says United spokeswoman Robin Urbanski. The airline plans to serve more than 1.1 million bottles of wine and champagne in its premium-class cabins next year. Wine poses logistical problems for airlines. \\"They often don't have a clear picture of what they'll be seeing in passenger traffic six months out,\\" says Rick Lundstrom, editor-in-chief of PAX International, a trade magazine that covers travel catering. \\"They don't want to be sitting on inventory, particularly if it's a particular vintage.\\" Passengers originating in some cities drink more wine than others. For example, there are more wine drinkers in San Francisco than in Dallas, say wine expert Berger. With such difficult logistics, passengers should appreciate the incredible wines that some airlines serve, Berger says. He's ecstatic when he spots 2001 Château Lynch-Bages on the first-class wine list for Cathay Pacific's flights to and from the USA. \\"A Bordeaux like this is like finding gold,\\" he says.

No Title: An under appreciated gem Review: For a young easterner living in Wichita, Kansas in the fall of 1976, this album was like a breath of fresh air. After several months of progressive (and not so progressive) country music I needed some rock 'n roll. Twilley's influences are very apparent on this disc, from rockabilly (\\"TV\\"), to The Beatles circa 1965 (\\"You Were So Warm\\") and 1966 (\\"Sincerely\\"). The \\"hit\\" single, \\"I'm On Fire\\" stills rings classic after 24 years. Twilley's talent was putting all of his influences into his music and blending them so well that they are not readily discernable. A great record and a solid artist who went away too quickly.PS: I bought this record to get some new rock 'n roll music, ended up buying three albums, all new, had never heard a note, bought by cover only.

The reviewer presents a generally negative perspective on the table's quality after having had high expectations due to its appearance. The following points contribute to this unflattering depiction: 1. The reviewer states that the table is \\"garbage,\\" clearly implying strong dissatisfaction with the product. 2. Despite looking beautiful, it is described as \\"light and chintzy,\\" which suggests that the table is not sturdy or well-built, and it may not be able to withstand the test of time. 3. The table is considered \\"uneven,\\" necessitating sanding the legs in order to level it, which could be a significant inconvenience for the customer. 4.

Painting a bedroom is a task that not only needs time and effort but also requires attention to detail and the right tools for the job. When it comes to selecting between various paint application methods, the roller brush stands out as an excellent choice for numerous reasons which include efficiency, coverage, and versatility. Efficiency is a crucial factor when embarking on a home improvement project like painting a bedroom. The roller brush, in comparison to other painting tools such as traditional paint brushes or spray guns, offers an efficient way to paint large surfaces evenly and quickly. This is accomplished by the roller's structure, which comprises a cylindrical core wrapped with a layer of absorbent material that can hold a generous amount of paint, allowing for a smoother and faster application. Another important factor that influenced their decision to use a roller brush is the superior coverage it provides. Roller brushes have a knack for getting paint deep into small crevices and textured surfaces, which ensures that the paint job is even and thorough. The uniform paint distribution achieved by the roller brush makes it an ideal choice for homeowners who want to give their rooms a professional-looking finish. Also, the thickness of the paint layer applied by a roller brush can be easily controlled, enabling the application of multiple coats for a more durable, seamless, and polished finish. Versatility is a key advantage of using a roller brush, largely due to its compatibility with various paint types and surface materials. The roller brush can be used with water-based acrylic paints, oil-based paints, and even specialized finishes such as textured paints. This versatility allows the homeowners to select their preferred type of paint without worrying about its compatibility with their painting tool. Moreover, the roller brush is effective on different surface materials such as drywall, wood, and plaster, making it a practical choice for almost any painting project. In addition to the factors mentioned above, their decision to use a roller brush could be influenced by aspects such as affordability and ease of use. Roller brushes, as compared to other paint applicators like specialized paint sprayers, are generally more cost-effective and easier to use for DIY projects. Furthermore, they can be easily cleaned and reused for future projects, which makes them an environmentally friendly and sustainable choice. In conclusion, they chose to paint the bedroom with a roller brush because of the many benefits it offers, such as efficiency, coverage, versatility, affordability, and ease of use. By opting for this efficient and versatile painting tool, they can achieve a professional-looking finish with better control over the thickness and evenness of the paint layers, ultimately giving their bedroom the fresh and vibrant look it deserves."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Process: - You place aluminum cans and other products into recycling bins - Your town or a private company collect and transport the aluminum to a recycling facility - The aluminum is sorted and cleaned at the central recycling facility - The aluminum is melted down to remove coatings and inks - The melted aluminum is formed into large formations called ingots - The ingots are transported to another facility and rolled out to make them easier to manipulate - The ingots can now be turned into new aluminum products. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more encouragement is given to people who recycle happens, how will it affect people will be motivated. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis in this context suggests that if more encouragement is given to individuals who recycle, particularly those who recycle aluminum cans and products, there would be an increase in the number of people who are motivated to recycle. This increased motivation to recycle can have both direct and indirect effects on the aluminum recycling process. Direct effects on the process: 1. Increased recycling volume: With more people motivated to recycle, the volume of aluminum cans and products being placed into recycling bins would likely increase. This could lead to a higher supply of raw materials for the recycling industry, potentially increasing the efficiency and scale of operations at recycling facilities. 2. Improved sorting and cleaning: As more people become aware of the recycling process, they might become more mindful about separating and cleaning the aluminum products they put into recycling bins. This could result in a higher quality of sorted and cleaned aluminum at the central recycling facilities, leading to a more efficient and smoother recycling process. 3. Demand for recycled products: As an increased awareness of the environmental benefits of recycling spreads, consumers might be more likely to choose products made from recycled aluminum. This could create a higher demand for recycled aluminum products, which would ultimately incentivize the recycling industry to invest in improving and expanding the recycling process. Indirect effects on the process: 1. Technological advancements: As the recycling industry expands and more aluminum products are being recycled, there could be an increased interest by companies and organizations in improving the existing technology and processes. This could lead to advancements and innovations that would make the process more effective and efficient, ultimately benefiting the environment. 2. Environmental benefits: As more people recycle aluminum, the environmental impact of aluminum extraction and production would be reduced. Recycling aluminum uses only 5% of the energy needed to produce new aluminum from raw materials, and it also reduces CO2 emissions. This could lead to a more sustainable future with less impact on natural resources and the environment. 3. Policy changes: As the recycling culture becomes more prominent, there may be pressure on local and national governments to enact policies that support recycling initiatives and allocate resources accordingly. This may lead to more public support for recycling facilities, better infrastructure for recycling aluminum products, and a more streamlined recycling process. In conclusion, the perturbation hypothesis in this context suggests that increased encouragement for recycling would have both direct and indirect effects on the aluminum recycling process. These effects range from the amount of aluminum being recycled to advancements in technology, environmental benefits, and policy changes supporting recycling initiatives. Overall, these effects would contribute to a more efficient and sustainable aluminum recycling process."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Article:","completion":"Title: Mastering the Art of Perfectly Cooked Chicken: Preheating and Monitoring Internal Temperature Introduction: Chicken is a staple protein for many individuals and families across the globe. Preparing a delicious, perfectly cooked chicken can sometimes be a daunting task as it involves striking the right balance between flavor, juiciness, and food safety. In this article, we will provide step-by-step guidance on how to achieve perfect results when cooking chicken by preheating and monitoring the internal temperature. Step 1: Preheat Your Cooking Surface The first step to ensuring that your chicken is cooked to perfection is to preheat your cooking surface, whether it be an oven, stovetop or grill. This allows the chicken to cook evenly and reduces the risk of undercooked portions. Oven: Preheat your oven to the desired temperature (typically between 350-425°F or 175-220°C) and allow it to fully heat up before placing the chicken inside. Stovetop: Heat a pan with oil or butter over medium heat until it's hot, but not smoking. Grill: Preheat your grill to medium-high heat to ensure an even cooking temperature across the surface. Step 2: Add the Chicken Once your cooking surface is adequately preheated, it's time to add your chicken. Place it carefully onto the hot surface, making sure to avoid overcrowding as this can cause uneven cooking. Step 3: Monitor the Internal Temperature A critical aspect of cooking chicken perfectly is ensuring that the internal temperature reaches a safe level. This will vary depending on the cut of chicken you're using, but the target temperature is generally 160°F (71°C) for most cuts like breast or thigh. To monitor the internal temperature, insert a meat thermometer into the thickest part of the chicken without touching bone. Make sure to check the temperature several times to ensure an accurate reading. Step 4: Remove the Skin (Optional) For those who prefer a leaner, less fatty option, you may choose to remove the skin before serving. To do this, simply pull the skin away from the meat using a pair of kitchen tongs or your fingers; it should come off quite easily if the chicken is cooked. Step 5: Serve the Chicken Immediately For optimal taste and quality, serve the chicken immediately after cooking. This will ensure that your chicken remains juicy and full of flavor. Conclusion: By following these simple steps, you can master the art of perfectly cooked chicken using preheating and internal temperature monitoring techniques. With practice, you will be able to consistently prepare delicious, perfectly cooked, and safe chicken dishes for yourself and your loved ones to enjoy."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

The 48-year-old father of two was named the news agency's Geek of the Month in May 2012 for his \\"tireless dedication and contagious passion\\" to technological innovation. \\"At AP, not a frame goes by in the world of video that escapes the passionate scrutiny of video architect Jim Gaines,\\" the award said. Gaines was in the train's quiet car, headed home to Plainsboro, New Jersey, after meetings Tuesday at the news agency's Washington, D.C., office. His wife, Jacqueline, confirmed his death. \\"Jim was more precious to us than we can adequately express,\\" his family said in a statement. Gaines joined the AP in 1998 and was a key factor in nearly all of the news agency's video initiatives, including the successful rollout of high-definition video and the AP's Video Hub — a service that provides live video to hundreds of clients around the world. In 2006, Gaines' team won the Chairman's Prize in 2006 for development of the agency's Online Video Network. Gaines \\"leaves behind a legacy of professionalism and critical accomplishment, kindness and humor,\\" AP President and CEO Gary Pruitt told employees in an email. \\"He will be missed.\\" He is also survived by a 16-year-old son, Oliver, and an 11-year-old daughter, Anushka. ___ JUSTIN ZEMSER Justin Zemser, a popular student leader and athlete, was on a break from the U.S. Naval Academy and heading home to Rockaway Beach, New York, where playing high school football helped him and his teammates through the devastation of Superstorm Sandy. Navy Secretary Ray Mabus called Zemser a \\"crucial member\\" of the institution. The 20-year-old's family released a statement mourning \\"a loving son, nephew and cousin who was very community-minded.\\" They said the tragedy \\"has shocked us all in the worst way.\\" Zemser was in his second year. He served as vice president of the Jewish Midshipmen Club and played wide receiver on the academy's sprint football team. At Channel View School for Research, Zemser was valedictorian, student government president and captain of the football team. Sandy shuttered the school building for two months, but he and his teammates salvaged their season, returning to the field for a final game in Staten Island two weeks after the storm. Zemser mentored younger students, and he and a classmate even took it upon themselves to analyze Channel View's SAT data and give presentations on how to prepare students better, then-Principal Pat Tubridy recalled. \\"He was so committed, and yet so easygoing,\\" she said. Outside school, Zemser interned for New York City Councilman Eric Ulrich and former Councilman James Sanders. Ulrich called him \\"truly a bright, talented and patriotic young man.\\" Zemser also volunteered with a church program, a soup kitchen and a nursing home and mentored children with autism, U.S. Sen. Charles Schumer said. Schumer and U.S. Rep. Gregory Meeks nominated Zemser to the Naval Academy, and Meeks was struck by his \\"high character, intellectual curiosity, and maturity beyond his years.\\" ||||| Photos View photos zoom PHILADELPHIA—A Canadian man has been identified as one of the seven people killed Tuesday when an Amtrak train derailed in Philadelphia. Abid Gilani was a senior vice-president for Wells Fargo in New York City and had been with the company for about a year, according to his profile page on LinkedIn. A company spokeswoman says Gilani was a married father of two who split his time between Washington and New York. Gilani's wife, Diane, told reporters in Rockville, Maryland that her husband was a “dear person . . . a kind family man.” “We have suffered a tremendous loss today. He'll be sorely missed . . . he was really a wonderful person.” Gilani said she and her husband are both from Canada and had moved to the United States “decades ago” but still have family ties in Ontario. “It is with great sadness that Wells Fargo confirms that Abid Gilani, a valued member of our Commercial Real Estate division, has passed away,” the company said in a statement. “Our hearts go out to all those impacted by this tragedy.” The New York Daily News has reported that Gilani was 55 and was returning to New York from Virginia where he and his mother, who lives in Toronto, had attended the funeral of her brother. Before joining Wells Fargo, Gilani had been with Marriott International for eight years. According to his LinkedIn profile, Gilani attended Laurentian University in Sudbury, Ont., and the University of Saskatchewan before working as a mine planning engineer in Saskatoon and then with ScotiaBank and RBC Dominion Securities. Prior to joining Wells Fargo in New York, Gilani spent about eight years with the Mariott International hotel chain. Federal investigators said Wednesday that the Amtrak train was hurtling at about 170 kilometres an hour before it ran off the rails along a sharp curve where the speed limit drops to just 80 km/h. A spokesman for the National Transportation Safety Board said the engineer had applied the emergency brakes moments before the crash but slowed the train to only 164 km/h by the time the locomotive's black box stopped recording data. The engineer, whose name was not released, refused to give a statement to law enforcement and left a police precinct with a lawyer, police said. Sumwalt said federal accident investigators want to talk to him but will give him a day or two to recover from the shock of the accident. Mayor Michael Nutter said there was “no way in the world” the engineer should have been going that fast into the curve. “Clearly he was reckless and irresponsible in his actions,” Nutter told CNN. “I don’t know what was going on with him, I don’t know what was going on in the cab, but there’s really no excuse that could be offered.” More than 200 people aboard the Washington-to-New York train were injured in the wreck, which happened in a decayed industrial neighbourhood not far from the Delaware River just before 9:30 p.m. Tuesday. Passengers crawled out the windows of the torn and toppled rail cars in the darkness and emerged dazed and bloody, many of them with broken bones and burns. It was the nation’s deadliest train accident in nearly seven years. Amtrak suspended all service until further notice along the Philadelphia-to-New York stretch of the nation’s busiest rail corridor as investigators examined the wreckage and the tracks and gathered evidence. The shutdown snarled the commute and forced thousands of people to find other ways to reach their destinations. The dead included an Associated Press employee, a midshipman at the U.S. Naval Academy, a Wells Fargo executive and a CEO of an educational startup. At least 10 people remained hospitalized in critical condition. Nutter said some people were unaccounted for but cautioned that some passengers listed on the Amtrak manifest might not have boarded the train, while others might not have checked in with authorities. “We will not cease our efforts until we go through every vehicle,” the mayor said. He said rescuers expanded the search area and were using dogs to look for victims in case someone was thrown from the wreckage. The NTSB finding about the train’s speed corroborated an AP analysis done earlier in the day of surveillance video from a spot along the tracks. The AP concluded from the footage that the train was speeding at approximately 107 mph (172.2 km/h) moments before it entered the curve. Despite pressure from Congress and safety regulators, Amtrak had not installed along that section of track Positive Train Control, a technology that uses GPS, wireless radio and computers to prevent trains from going over the speed limit. Most of Amtrak’s Northeast Corridor is equipped with Positive Train Control. “Based on what we know right now, we feel that had such a system been installed in this section of track, this accident would not have occurred,” Sumwalt said. The notoriously tight curve is not far from the site of one of the deadliest train wrecks in U.S. history: the 1943 derailment of the Congressional Limited, bound from Washington to New York. Seventy-nine people were killed. Amtrak inspected the stretch of track on Tuesday, just hours before the accident, and found no defects, the Federal Railroad Administration said. Besides the data recorder, the train had a video camera in its front end that could yield clues to what happened, Sumwalt said. As for the engineer, Sumwalt said: “This person has gone through a very traumatic event, and we want to give him an opportunity to convalesce for a day or so before we interview him. But that is certainly a high priority for us, to interview the train crew.” The crash took place about 10 minutes after the train pulled out of Philadelphia’s 30th Street Station with 238 passengers and five crew members listed aboard. The locomotive and all seven passenger cars hurtled off the track as the train made a left turn, Sumwalt said. Jillian Jorgensen was seated in the second passenger car and said the train was going “fast enough for me to be worried” when it began to lurch to the right. Then the lights went out, and Jorgensen was thrown from her seat. She said she “flew across the train” and landed under some seats that had apparently broken loose from the floor. Jorgensen, a reporter for The New York Observer who lives in Jersey City, New Jersey, said she wriggled free as fellow passengers screamed. She saw one man lying still, his face covered in blood, and a woman with a broken leg. She climbed out an emergency exit window, and a firefighter helped her down a ladder to safety. “It was terrifying and awful, and as it was happening it just did not feel like the kind of thing you could walk away from, so I feel very lucky,” Jorgensen said in an email. “The scene in the car I was in was total disarray, and people were clearly in a great deal of pain.” Among the dead were award-winning AP video software architect Jim Gaines, a father of two; Justin Zemser, a Naval Academy midshipman from New York City; Abid Gilani, a senior vice-president in Wells Fargo’s commercial real estate division in New York; and Rachel Jacobs, who was commuting home to New York from her new job as CEO of the Philadelphia educational software startup ApprenNet. Several victims were rolled away on stretchers. Others wobbled as they walked away or were put on buses. “It’s incredible that so many people walked away from that scene last night,” the mayor said. “I saw people on this street behind us walking off of that train. I don’t know how that happened, but for the grace of God.” The area where the wreck happened is known as Frankford Junction, situated in a neighbourhood of warehouses, industrial buildings and homes. Amtrak carries 11.6 million passengers a year along its busy Northeast Corridor, which runs between Washington and Boston. ||||| CLOSE Investigators say the Amtrak train that derailed in Philadelphia late Tuesday night was going more than 100 miles per hour, more than twice the speed limit.

The Athenian general Themistocles (Sullivan Stapleton) led his own army against them at the shores. The Greeks brutally and effortlessly take down the invading Persians one by one, paving the way for Themistocles to take aim at Darius, who is watching the massacre of his men from his ship offshore. Themistocles raises a bow and arrow, ready to commit the act that would make him known as a legend. He releases the bow just in time for Darius's son, Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro) to watch. He runs to his father's side but is too late to save him as the arrow pierces him. Xerxes holds his father in his arms and locks eyes with Themistocles. The latter walks away, with Gorgo stating that he knew in his heart that he made a mistake not to kill Xerxes when he had the chance.Darius is returned to his kingdom to lie in his deathbed. He and Xerxes are joined by Artemisia (Eva Green), Darius's commanding naval officer, said to be as vicious as she is beautiful. She holds Darius's hand. In his dying moments, he tells Xerxes that it is best to leave the Greeks alone, for only the gods can defeat them. Artemisia pulls the arrow out of his chest to end his suffering. For a week, Xerxes sits and mourns the death of his father. On the eighth day, Artemisia holds Xerxes and tells him that his father's last words were not a warning, but a challenge.

How to make edible sugar crystals Tie cotton or wool string around a popsicle stick or a pencil. Using scissors, cut the string to 3/4 length of the jar you will use. Heat a small amount of water to boiling. Pick your answer from: (a). Some ornaments will need the water in order to burn and other ornaments will need water to enhance. Place the glass jar in the boiling water. (b). Stir in as much sugar as possible. Usually the ratio is 3 cups of sugar for every cup of water, but it could vary. (c). Add red dye to the water and stir till the liquid is to a boil. Cut the cotton or wool string to approximately 1/4 inch (0.63 cm) in length. (d). Add the cotton or wool and stir it in. Heat the water 2/3 of the way to boiling and then reduce the heat.","completion":"(b). Stir in as much sugar as possible. Usually the ratio is 3 cups of sugar for every cup of water, but it could vary. Step-by-step process with justifications: 1. Stir in as much sugar as possible into the boiling water. This step is important because it creates a supersaturated sugar solution, which is necessary for the formation of sugar crystals. 2. Keep adding sugar and stirring until no more sugar dissolves in the water. This ensures that the solution is supersaturated and ideal for crystal formation. 3. Allow the solution to cool slightly. Cooling the solution allows it to become more stable and less likely to form crystals prematurely. 4. If desired, add a few drops of food coloring to color the sugar crystals. This is an optional step for decoration purposes only. 5. Suspend the cotton/wool string tied to the popsicle stick or pencil into the supersaturated sugar solution. Make sure the string does not touch the bottom or sides of the jar. This step allows the sugar crystals to begin forming on the string. 6. Cover the jar with a cloth or paper towel to prevent dust and debris from getting into the solution. This helps maintain the cleanliness of the experiment. 7. Place the jar in a cool, undisturbed location and wait for the sugar crystals to form. This process may take several days to a week. 8. Once the desired size of sugar crystals has formed, remove the cotton/wool string from the jar and let it dry on a piece of wax paper. This allows the sugar crystals to harden. 9. Once completely dried, the sugar crystals are ready to be eaten or used for decoration purposes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Vivacious Lady Context: Lobby card for the film Vivacious Lady is a story of love at first sight between a young botany professor named Peter Morgan Jr. (Stewart) and a nightclub singer named Francey (Rogers). The film also has comedic elements, including repeatedly frustrated attempts by the newlywed couple to find a moment alone with each other. The story begins when Peter is sent to Manhattan to retrieve his playboy cousin Keith (Ellison) and immediately falls in love with Francey. After a whirlwind one-day courtship, Peter and Francey get married, and they and Keith return to the Morgan family's home, where Peter teaches at the university run by his father Peter Morgan Sr. (Coburn). Mr. Morgan is known for being a proud, overbearing man, so Peter is afraid to tell him about the marriage. When they arrive, Mr. Morgan and Peter's high-society fiancÃ©e Helen (Mercer) initially take Francey for another of Keith's girlfriends. While Peter decides how to approach his father with the news, Francey stays at a women-only hotel, and Peter and Keith introduce her as a new botany student. Peter mentions Francey to his father twice, but on both occasions, Mr. Morgan interrupts and ignores his son, and when Peter becomes insistent, his apparently ailing mother (Bondi) has a flare-up of her heart condition, making any further conversation impossible. For his third attempt, Peter decides to announce the marriage to his parents at the university's student-faculty prom. Keith brings Francey to the prom as his own guest, and Francey, still posing as a student, develops a friendly rapport with Mrs. Morgan, but gets into a nasty brawl with Helen in which Francey accidentally punches Peter's father. Peter says nothing at the prom, but blurts the news to his father just as Mr. Morgan is about to give an important speech, resulting in another argument and another flare-up of Mrs. Morgan's heart condition. This prevents Mrs. Morgan from learning who Francey is, but she accidentally finds out from Francey herself during a conversation in Francey's...

Please answer the following question: What is the name of the person who Mattheson claims was trimmed into other fashions by \\"the lofty schooling of opera\\"? Answer the above question based on the context below: Handel joined the Hamburg opera house when it was experiencing a period of considerable artistic success. This blossoming followed the arrival of Reinhard Keiser, who had become musical director at the Gänsemarkt in about 1697, and in 1703 succeeded Johann Kusser as the theatre's manager. Born in 1674, Keiser had studied under Johann Schelle and probably Johann Kuhnau at the Thomasschule zu Leipzig. In 1694 he was employed as a court composer at Brunswick, where in three years he composed seven operas, at least one of which (Mahumeth) was performed in Hamburg. According to Handel's biographer Donald Burrows, Keiser was a good judge of popular taste, with a flair for writing Italian-style arias. Between 1697 and 1703, prior to Handel's arrival, about a dozen more Keiser operas had been staged at the Gänsemarkt. Despite his on-stage successes, Keiser was an unreliable general manager, with expensive private tastes and little financial acumen, often at odds with his creditors.It is possible that Keiser, who had connections in the Halle area, had heard of Handel and was directly instrumental in securing the latter's post in the Gänsemarkt orchestra; certainly he was a considerable influence on the younger man in the three years that Handel spent in Hamburg. Another important Gänsemarkt colleague was the house composer and singer Johann Mattheson, who noted Handel's rapid progress in the orchestra from back-desk violinist to harpsichord soloist, a role in which, said Mattheson, \\"he showed himself a man—a thing which no one had before suspected, save I alone\\". Mattheson was less complimentary on Handel's early efforts at composition: \\"He composed very long, long arias, and really interminable cantatas\\", before, it seems, \\"the lofty schooling of opera ... trimmed him into other fashions\\". A:","completion":"The name of the person who Mattheson claims was trimmed into other fashions by \\"the lofty schooling of opera\\" is George Frideric Handel. In the given context, Mattheson comments on Handel's early composition efforts, stating that he composed very long, long arias, and really interminable cantatas, before the influence of opera and the experience at the Gänsemarkt shaped his compositional skills. Handel, who started as a back-desk violinist in the orchestra and then progressed to the role of harpsichord soloist, was greatly influenced by Reinhard Keiser and worked alongside composer and singer Johann Mattheson at the Gänsemarkt opera house."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This article: Another letter to The New York Times blamed the shark infestation on the maneuvers of German U-boats near America's East Coast.

Joh.Seb.Bach\\", In this late version, Bach scored the work for four vocal parts (soprano (S), alto (A), tenor (T), and bass (B)), and a Baroque instrumental ensemble consisting of strings, brass and continuo. The brass parts, a choir of cornetto (Ct) and three trombones (Tb) playing colla parte with the voices at times, may have been added in the 1720s. They may also possibly represent the original scoring, in the style of the 17th-century polychoral tradition.The scoring of the cantata Christ lag in Todes Banden has been described as \\"archaic\\" and its style \\"medieval\\": The string section consists of two violin parts (Vl) and two viola parts (VA); this indicates an older practice as for instance found in 17th-century church cantatas by Bach's ancestors (see Altbachisches Archiv), and in Jesus Christus ist um unsrer Missetat willen verwundet, a Passion setting from the early 18th century (or older) which Bach had performed a few years after composing the cantata Christ lag in Todes Banden. In the first half of the 18th century the standard for a string section soon evolved to two violin parts, one viola part and continuo. The cornett used in the cantata was an instrument that belonged to an earlier age: by the second quarter of the 18th century it had almost entirely disappeared from Bach's compositions. The brass instruments were only used for the 1 April 1725 version of the work. The other performances (24 April 1707, 8 April 1708, and 9 April 1724) were performed without brass instruments (i.e., Cornetto and three Trombones). The first version (1707 and 1708) concluded with the words of...

What are the most important words in the following sentence: An airplane is at an airport pulled up to the terminal.","completion":"To determine the most important words in the sentence, we need to find the words that carry the main meaning; we can exclude functional words (like articles, prepositions, conjunctions, etc.) and focus on the core content words including the subject, object, verb, and any modifying words that provide essential contextual details. Here is a step-by-step process: 1. Read the sentence: \\"An airplane is at an airport pulled up to the terminal.\\" 2. Identify the subject of the sentence: \\"airplane\\". This is the primary focus of the sentence, it's what the sentence is about. 3. Identify the verb in the sentence: \\"is\\". This is the action or state of being in the sentence. 4. Identify the object or targets of the verb: \\"at an airport\\", \\"pulled up\\", and \\"to the terminal\\". These all relate to the state or position of the subject (the airplane). 5. Extracting the core meaning: Pulling from this, we can see that the most important words, the ones carrying the most significance in regards to the overall message of the sentence, are \\"airplane\\", \\"is\\", \\"airport\\", \\"pulled up\\", and \\"terminal\\". These words provide the key details: what we're talking about (airplane), what state it's in or what it's doing (is), and where this is happening or what it's doing it to (airport, pulled up, terminal).

Nick is trying to make Steven want to learn more about mathematics because Choices: -Nick is bad at math.. -Steven is bad at math..","completion":"Nick is trying to make Steven want to learn more about mathematics because he knows the importance of having a strong foundation in the subject. Step 1: Address the problem First, Nick considers the reason behind his intention to motivate Steven. He realizes that it's not due to his own shortcomings in mathematics, but rather because Steven is struggling with the subject. This lets Nick focus on helping Steven improve his math skills. Step 2: Assess Steven's current understanding Nick tries to identify Steven's current level of understanding in mathematics. By figuring out the area where Steven is having difficulty, he can provide targeted assistance and resources. Step 3: Find appropriate resources Next, Nick looks for educational support tailored to Steven's needs. This might include books, videos, online tutorials, or even enlisting the help of a tutor. Providing a variety of resources allows Steven to approach mathematical concepts from different angles, which can help deepen his understanding. Step 4: Cultivate interest Nick believes that sparking Steven's interest in mathematics is critical to his long-term success. To do this, Nick introduces Steven to real-life applications of math, and shows him how mathematics can be found in unexpected places, like sports and popular culture. By doing this, Nick hopes to make math more relatable and engaging for Steven. Step 5: Encourage persistence Nick reminds Steven that learning mathematics, like any new skill, requires persistence and dedication. With practice and consistent effort, Steven can gradually improve his understanding and gain confidence in his abilities. Nick encourages Steven to view challenges as opportunities for growth, rather than sources of frustration. Step 6: Monitor progress and adjust as needed As Steven begins to engage with the resources and explore his newfound interest in mathematics, Nick keeps a close eye on his progress. If Steven encounters new difficulties or plateaus in his learning, Nick can adjust the support he provides, tailoring it to Steven's evolving needs. In summary, Nick's efforts to help Steven learn more about mathematics involve a multi-faceted approach that includes assessing Steven's current abilities, providing targeted resources, cultivating interest, encouraging persistence, and continuously monitoring progress.

Both sentences discuss Sirius carrying National Public Radio (NPR) but with notable exclusions of popular shows \\"All Things Considered\\" and \\"Morning Edition.\\" Let's break down each sentence to explain their similarities and differences. 1. Sirius recently began carrying National Public Radio, a deal pooh-poohed by XM because it doesn't include popular shows like \\"All Things Considered\\" and \\"Morning Edition.\\" In this sentence, it is stated that Sirius has recently started carrying NPR. The phrase \\"a deal pooh-poohed by XM\\" means that XM, presumably another broadcasting service or competitor, has disparaged or dismissed this agreement. The reason for XM's dismissal is then explained, as it does not include popular shows like \\"All Things Considered\\" and \\"Morning Edition.\\" 2. Sirius carries National Public Radio, although it doesn't include popular shows such as \\"All Things Considered\\" and \\"Morning Edition.\\" This sentence also indicates that Sirius carries NPR but not the popular shows \\"All Things Considered\\" and \\"Morning Edition.\\" The word \\"although\\" is used to express contrast. The main differences between the two sentences lie in their structure and the inclusion of additional context in the first sentence. The first sentence shares more information about XM's reaction to the deal and emphasizes that Sirius has only recently begun carrying NPR. The second sentence is more concise and presents a straightforward statement about the nature of Sirius carrying NPR.

This movie could had been an interesting character study and could had given some insight on its subject but real problem with this movie is that it doesn't have any of this in it. It doesn't give any insight-, or solutions to the problem. It's just the portrayal of 'old' male sex addict and the problems this is creating for his every day normal life and family.

Answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: Who was playing with Shane's painball gun? Tim and Susan Gates are eager to move into their new house with their teenage son Shane and their younger son Taylor, as well as their college-bound daughter Kayla, despite the house's dark history of drowned children and foreclosure. As they settle into the house, strange things frequently occur, like the garbage cans being taken out for collection without explanation. While Kayla and her boyfriend Derek are sorting out items for a garage sale, the garage door inexplicably opens and closes. The next day, the ladder from the crawlspace descends into view, and the house's previous owner Aldon Webber climbs down. He washes up and helps himself to some food, and he retrieves a stuffed unicorn that Kayla had thrown out. Webber's intrusions into the Gates' lives grow more elaborate and sinister as the film progresses. He watches them closely through the air vents, and he even creeps into Kayla's room one night to film her sleeping. The Gates' elderly neighbor warns Kayla and Shane that they need to get out of the house. She has witnessed Webber moving around when the family is gone during the day. After her warning, Webber sneaks into the neighbor's house and attacks her. He stuffs her vacuum cleaner's hose extension into her mouth and then reverses the air flow, emptying the vacuum's contents down her throat. Webber's next victim is Taylor's babysitter, who was not watching as the boy played with Shane's paintball gun. At the garage sale, Webber reveals himself to Kayla and Shane, but poses as a customer. When Webber does not leave after the sale is over, Shane approaches him aggressively. Webber punches Shane in the face and walks off the property. Answer:","completion":"Taylor, the younger son of Tim and Susan Gates, was playing with Shane's paintball gun while the babysitter was not watching."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What should I eat after I get my blood tests done in the morning? Do those questions have the same meaning? Select from the following. -- no; -- yes;","completion":"Yes, those questions have the same meaning. Both are asking about what food choices are best after having blood tests done in the morning. After getting blood tests done in the early morning, it's important to refuel your body with a nutritious and well-balanced meal. This is especially important if you have been fasting before the blood tests. Here are some recommendations for what you should eat after your blood tests: 1. Stay hydrated: Make sure to drink plenty of water to help your body recover and replenish any fluids that may have been lost during the blood draw. 2. Opt for protein-rich foods: Protein is essential for repairing and rebuilding muscles and tissues that might be affected during the blood draw process. Good protein sources include eggs, lean meats (such as turkey or chicken), fish, dairy products, and plant-based proteins (such as beans and lentils). 3. Choose complex carbohydrates: Complex carbs provide energy and help maintain blood sugar levels. They also promote satiety and keep you feeling full for longer. Examples of complex carbohydrates include whole grain bread, brown rice, quinoa, and whole-wheat pasta. 4. Incorporate healthy fats: Healthy fats, such as those found in avocados, nuts, seeds, and olive oil, provide essential fatty acids that support cell function and enhance nutrient absorption. 5. Add plenty of fruits and vegetables: Fruits and vegetables are high in vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants that help boost your immune system and overall health. Aim for a variety of colors and types to ensure you get a wide range of nutrients. 6. Limit processed and sugary foods: It's best to avoid processed and sugary foods since they can cause a spike in blood sugar levels and do not provide substantial nutritional value. A few examples of meals that you could eat after your morning blood tests include: - Scrambled eggs with whole-grain toast, avocado, and a side of mixed berries. - Greek yogurt with granola, nuts, and fresh fruit. - A whole-grain bagel with smoked salmon, cream cheese, and fresh tomato slices. - A hearty vegetable and protein-packed salad, drizzled with olive oil and accompanied by a serving of quinoa or brown rice. Remember that everyone's nutritional needs and preferences vary, so it's crucial to tailor your meal choices to your specific health needs and dietary restrictions. If you're unsure about the best choices for your situation, consult with a healthcare professional or a registered dietitian for personalized advice."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the following passage \\"As at most other universities, Notre Dame's students run a number of news media outlets. The nine student-run outlets include three newspapers, both a radio and television station, and several magazines and journals. Begun as a one-page journal in September 1876, the Scholastic magazine is issued twice monthly and claims to be the oldest continuous collegiate publication in the United States. The other magazine, The Juggler, is released twice a year and focuses on student literature and artwork. The Dome yearbook is published annually. The newspapers have varying publication interests, with The Observer published daily and mainly reporting university and other news, and staffed by students from both Notre Dame and Saint Mary's College. Unlike Scholastic and The Dome, The Observer is an independent publication and does not have a faculty advisor or any editorial oversight from the University. In 1987, when some students believed that The Observer began to show a conservative bias, a liberal newspaper, Common Sense was published. Likewise, in 2003, when other students believed that the paper showed a liberal bias, the conservative paper Irish Rover went into production. Neither paper is published as often as The Observer; however, all three are distributed to all students.

A frequent visitor to the Ontario Society of Artists' (OSA) exhibitions, MacCallum was admitted to the Arts and Letters Club in January 1912. There, he met artists such as John William Beatty, Arthur Heming, MacDonald and Harris. MacCallum eventually persuaded Thomson to leave Rous and Mann and start a painting career. In October 1913, MacCallum introduced Thomson to A. Y. Jackson, later a founder of the Group of Seven. MacCallum recognized Thomson's and Jackson's talents and offered to cover their expenses for one year if they committed themselves to painting full time. MacCallum and Jackson both encouraged Thomson to \\"take up painting seriously, [but] he showed no enthusiasm. The chances of earning a livelihood by it did not appear to him promising. He was sensitive and independent, and feared he might become an object of patronage.\\" MacCallum wrote that when he first saw Thomson's sketches, he recognized their \\"truthfulness, their feeling and their sympathy with the grim fascinating northland ... they made me feel that the North had gripped Thomson as it had gripped me since I was eleven when I first sailed and paddled through its silent places.\\" He described Thomson's paintings as \\"dark, muddy in colour, tight and not wanting in technical defects\\".

Pseudonyms include stage names and user names (both called \\"screen names\\"), ring names, pen names, nicknames, aliases, superhero identities and code names, gamer identifications, and regnal names of emperors, popes, and other monarchs. Historically, they have often taken the form of anagrams, Graecisms, and Latinisations, although there are many other methods of choosing a pseudonym. - A regnal name, or reign name, is a name used by some monarchs and popes during their reigns, and used subsequently to refer to them. The term is simply the adjective \\"regnal\\", of or relating to a reign, monarch, or kingdom, modifying \\"name\\". Since ancient times, monarchs have frequently, but not always, chosen to use a different name from their original name when they accede to the monarchy. The regnal name is usually followed by a regnal number (ordinal), usually written as a Roman numeral (VI rather than 6), to provide a unique identification for that monarch among other monarchs of that realm. In some cases, the monarch has more than one regnal name, but the regnal number is based on only one of those names, for example Charles X Gustav of Sweden, George Tupou V of Tonga. If a monarch reigns in more than one realm, he or she may carry different ordinals in each one, as they are each assigned chronologically, and some realms may have had different numbers of rulers of the same regnal name previously.

Much to the annoyance of Colonel Robinson, von Papen survives and the Russians that his agent provocateur was trying to frame have solid alibis, forcing him to turn to another scheme to inflame Turkey's traditional rivalry with Russia. Meanwhile, American machinery salesman Joe Barton boards the Baghdad-Istanbul Express train at Aleppo and is attracted to another passenger, Ana Remzi. She is worried about being searched by customs agents once they reach the Turkish border; she asks Joe to hold on to an envelope containing some securities, all that remains of her inheritance.

Detective Mike Hoolihan is investigating the murder of Jennifer Rockwell, an astrophysicist at an observatory in New Orleans. She had presented a talk on black holes in the evening, but was found dead in the morning by the manager of the observatory. She had been shot in the face, but there was no weapon. There is a sock and a jar of moisturizing cream found at the scene. The manager claims that he was out all night with an associate. The sock is traced to Jennifer's boyfriend, who claims he left hurriedly to work on a new theory. Jennifer's home is full of tchotchkes and other old nick-nacks. Mike passes out when she picks up a Florida snow globe, and imagines unique blue marbles similar to one that is on a string around her neck. When she comes to, she talks about the marble, and how she doesn't remember where it came from. She was an orphan, and has always had it. Her co-investigator and supervisor suggest that this looks like \\"The .38 Caliber Killer\\", who killed young women, but hadn't struck in many years. The murderer always exchanged nick nacks with his victims. While doing a more detailed search of the area, Mike finds a gun in a case, and a red scarf she had been having dreams about. The gun, a .38 revolver, is traced to the observatory manager, who admits he found it, and tried to dispose of it so he wouldn't be a suspect.

U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross announced late Monday the next effort to count every resident in the country will include a question about citizenship status. The U.S. Census Bureau conducts the survey every 10 years, with the next set for 2020. The deadline for finalizing the questions is Saturday. In a memo late Monday, Ross said he chose to include the query at the urging of the Department of Justice, which said it needed the citizenship data to better enforce a law protecting minority voting rights. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders defended the addition of the question, rejecting the notion that it might result in less federal aid to immigrant communities in the U.S. if immigrants are undercounted.

Answer the following question: Information: - Carbon (from \\"coal\\") is a chemical element with symbol C and atomic number 6. It is nonmetallic and tetravalentmaking four electrons available to form covalent chemical bonds. Three isotopes occur naturally, C and C being stable, while C is a radioactive isotope, decaying with a half-life of about 5,730 years. Carbon is one of the few elements known since antiquity. - The Eocene Epoch, lasting from , is a major division of the geologic timescale and the second epoch of the Paleogene Period in the Cenozoic Era. The Eocene spans the time from the end of the Paleocene Epoch to the beginning of the Oligocene Epoch. The start of the Eocene is marked by a brief period in which the concentration of the carbon isotope C in the atmosphere was exceptionally low in comparison with the more common isotope C. The end is set at a major extinction event called the \\"Grande Coupure\\" (the \\"Great Break\\" in continuity) or the EoceneOligocene extinction event, which may be related to the impact of one or more large bolides in Siberia and in what is now Chesapeake Bay. As with other geologic periods, the strata that define the start and end of the epoch are well identified, though their exact dates are slightly uncertain. - The Phanerozoic Eon (British English Phanærozoic) is the current geologic eon in the geologic time scale, and the one during which abundant animal and plant life has existed. It covers million years to the present, and began with the Cambrian Period when diverse hard-shelled animals first appeared. Its name was derived from the Ancient Greek words (phanerós) and (z), meaning \\"visible life\\", since it was once believed that life began in the Cambrian, the first period of this eon. The time before the Phanerozoic, called the \\"Precambrian\\" supereon, is now divided into the Hadean, Archaean and Proterozoic eons. - The Cretaceous is a geologic period and system that spans 79 million years from the end of the Jurassic Period million years ago (Mya) to the beginning of the Paleogene Period Mya. It is the last period of the Mesozoic Era. The Cretaceous Period is usually abbreviated K, for its German translation \\"Kreide\\" (chalk). - Isotopes are variants of a particular chemical element which differ in neutron number. All isotopes of a given element have the same number of protons in each atom. The term isotope is formed from the Greek roots isos ( \\"equal\\") and topos ( \\"place\\"), meaning \\"the same place\\"; thus, the meaning behind the name is that different isotopes of a single element occupy the same position on the periodic table. - The Miocene is the first geological epoch of the Neogene Period and extends from about (Ma). The Miocene was named by Sir Charles Lyell. Its name comes from the Greek words (', less) and (', new) and means \\"less recent\\" because it has 18% fewer modern sea invertebrates than the Pliocene. The Miocene follows the Oligocene Epoch and is followed by the Pliocene Epoch. - An extinction event (also known as a mass extinction or biotic crisis) is a widespread and rapid decrease in the biodiversity on Earth. Such an event is identified by a sharp change in the diversity and abundance of multicellular organisms. It occurs when the rate of extinction increases with respect to the rate of speciation. Because the majority of diversity and biomass on Earth is microbial, and thus difficult to measure, recorded extinction events affect the easily observed, biologically complex component of the biosphere rather than the total diversity and abundance of life. - Sir Charles Lyell, 1st Baronet, (14 November 1797 22 February 1875) was a British lawyer and the foremost geologist of his day. He is best known as the author of \\"Principles of Geology\\", which popularized James Hutton's concepts of uniformitarianismthe idea that the Earth was shaped by the same processes still in operation today. \\"Principles of Geology\\" also challenged theories popularized by Georges Cuvier, which were the most accepted and circulated ideas about geology in England at the time. - A bolide (French via Latin from the Greek \\"bolís\\", \\"missile\\") is an extremely bright meteor, especially one that explodes in the atmosphere. In astronomy, it refers to a fireball about as bright as the full moon, and it is generally considered a synonym of a fireball. In geology, a bolide is a very large impactor. - The Paleocene or Palaeocene, the \\"old recent\\", is a geologic epoch that lasted from about . It is the first epoch of the Paleogene Period in the modern Cenozoic Era. As with many geologic periods, the strata that define the epoch's beginning and end are well identified, but the exact ages remain uncertain. - The Paleogene (or ; also spelled Palaeogene or Palæogene; informally Lower Tertiary) is a geologic period and system that spans 43 million years from the end of the Cretaceous Period million years ago (Mya) to the beginning of the Neogene Period Mya. It is the beginning of the Cenozoic Era of the present Phanerozoic Eon. The Paleogene is most notable for being the time during which mammals diversified from relatively small, simple forms into a large group of diverse animals in the wake of the CretaceousPaleogene extinction event that ended the preceding Cretaceous Period. - The Pliocene (also Pleiocene) Epoch is the epoch in the geologic timescale that extends from 5.333 million to 2.58 million years BP. It is the second and youngest epoch of the Neogene Period in the Cenozoic Era. The Pliocene follows the Miocene Epoch and is followed by the Pleistocene Epoch. Prior to the 2009 revision of the geologic time scale, which placed the four most recent major glaciations entirely within the Pleistocene, the Pliocene also included the Gelasian stage, which lasted from 2.588 to 1.806 million years ago, and is now included in the Pleistocene. - An era is a span of time marked by character, events, changes on earth, etc. When used in science, for example geology, an \\"era\\" denotes a clearly defined period of time of arbitrary but well-defined length, such as for example the Mesozoic Era frozen m 252 Ma66 Ma, delimited by a start event and an end event. When used in social history, eras may for example denote a period of some monarch's reign. In colloquial language, eras denote longer spans of time, before and after which the practices or fashions change to a significant degree. When era is extended to a calendar system, it is known as a calendar era. In Sanskrit or Indian culture eras are known as yugas. - The transition between the end of the Eocene and the beginning of the Oligocene is marked by large-scale extinction and floral and faunal turnover (although minor in comparison to the largest mass extinctions). Most of the affected organisms were marine or aquatic in nature. They included the last of the ancient cetaceans, the Archaeoceti. - Animals are multicellular, eukaryotic organisms of the kingdom Animalia (also called Metazoa). The animal kingdom emerged as a basal clade within Apoikozoa as a sister of the choanoflagellates. Sponges are the most basal clade of animals. Animals are motile, meaning they can move spontaneously and independently at some point in their lives. Their body plan eventually becomes fixed as they develop, although some undergo a process of metamorphosis later in their lives. All animals are heterotrophs: they must ingest other organisms or their products for sustenance. - Invertebrates are animals that neither possess nor develop a vertebral column (commonly known as a \\"backbone\\" or \\"spine\\"), derived from the notochord. This includes all animals apart from the subphylum Vertebrata. Familiar examples of invertebrates include insects; crabs, lobsters and their kin; snails, clams, octopuses and their kin; starfish, sea-urchins and their kin; and worms. - The Oligocene / losin / ( symbol OG ) is a geologic epoch of the Paleogene Period and extends from about 33.9 million to 23 million years before the present ( 33.9 ± 0.1 to 23.03 ± 0.05 Ma ) . As with other older geologic periods , the rock beds that define the epoch are well identified but the exact dates of the start and end of the epoch are slightly uncertain . The name Oligocene comes from the Greek ( oligos , few ) and ( kainos , new ) , and refers to the sparsity of extant forms of molluscs . The Oligocene is preceded by the Eocene Epoch and is followed by the Miocene Epoch . The Oligocene is the third and final epoch of the Paleogene Period . The Oligocene is often considered an important time of transition , a link between the archaic world of the tropical Eocene and the more modern ecosystems of the Miocene . Major changes during the Oligocene included a global expansion of grasslands , and a regression of tropical broad leaf forests to the equatorial belt . The start of the Oligocene is marked by a notable extinction event called the Grande Coupure ; it featured the replacement of European fauna with Asian fauna , except for the endemic rodent and marsupial families . By contrast , the Oligocene -- Miocene boundary is not set at an easily identified worldwide event but rather at regional boundaries between the warmer late Oligocene and the relatively cooler Miocene . - Tertiary is the former term for the geologic period from 66 million to 2.58 million years ago, a time span that lies between the superseded Secondary period and the Quaternary. The Tertiary is no longer recognized as a formal unit by the International Commission on Stratigraphy, but the word is still widely used. The traditional span of the Tertiary has been divided between the Paleogene and Neogene Periods and extends to the first stage of the Pleistocene Epoch, the Gelasian age. The period began with the demise of the non-avian dinosaurs in the CretaceousPaleogene extinction event, at the start of the Cenozoic Era, and extended to the beginning of the Quaternary glaciation at the end of the Pliocene Epoch. - The Cenozoic Era (also Cænozoic, Caenozoic or Cainozoic ; meaning \\"new life\\", from Greek \\"kainos\\" \\"new\\", and \\"zoe\\" \\"life\\") is the current and most recent of the three Phanerozoic geological eras, following the Mesozoic Era and covering the period from 66 million years ago to present day. - The Neogene is a geologic period and system that spans 20.45 million years from the end of the Paleogene Period million years ago (Mya) to the beginning of the present Quaternary Period Mya. The Neogene is sub-divided into two epochs, the earlier Miocene and the later Pliocene. Some geologists assert that the Neogene cannot be clearly delineated from the modern geological period, the Quaternary.

Others are not. It depends, in part, on how we use them. Based on the paragraph, does the response \\"Happiness\\" correctly answer the question \\"What are natural resources needed for?\\"?","completion":"Based on the paragraph provided, the response \\"Happiness\\" does not directly answer the question \\"What are natural resources needed for?\\" However, it can be inferred that the availability and usage of natural resources ultimately contribute to human happiness. The paragraph mainly focuses on the practical applications of natural resources and their role in everyday life, such as vehicles, homes, food, clothing, and recreation. These applications enhance the quality of life, which in turn can have an impact on overall happiness. Furthermore, natural resources can be classified into renewable and non-renewable resources depending upon how we use them. Their responsible consumption and conservations are essential to ensure sustainable living, which can also promote happiness in the long run. Some additional ways we use natural resources include: 1. Medicine: Many pharmaceutical drugs and traditional medicines are derived from plants, animals, and minerals. For example, the bark of the willow tree contains salicylic acid, which is used to make aspirin, and penicillin is derived from the Penicillium fungi. 2. Tools and equipment: Throughout history, humans have used minerals, metals, and wood to create various tools and equipment for hunting, agriculture, and domestic use. For example, copper and bronze have been used to make weapons, farm implements, and cooking utensils. 3. Energy production: Natural resources, such as coal, oil, natural gas, uranium, and flowing water, are used to generate electricity and provide domestic and industrial energy. Solar and wind power are considered renewable energy sources that harness sunlight and wind to create electricity. 4. Art and aesthetics: Natural resources, such as stones, crystals, and wood, are used in creating artistic and decorative items like sculptures, paintings, jewelry, and furniture. They provide aesthetic value and enhance our surroundings. 5. Cultural uses: Many indigenous and local communities rely on natural resources for traditional practices, rituals, and cultural identity. For example, in Native American cultures, feathers, shells, and stones are used in ceremonies and spiritual practices. In summary, though the response \\"Happiness\\" does not directly answer the question, the various uses of natural resources mentioned in the paragraph contribute to human happiness and wellbeing by fulfilling basic needs, providing comfort, and enhancing overall quality of life. Exploring additional ways humans use natural resources further emphasizes their significance in our lives, affecting our happiness either directly or indirectly."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

How is \\"Right after he revoked your weekend pass.\\" said in Czech?","completion":"In Czech, the phrase \\"Right after he revoked your weekend pass.\\" can be translated as \\"Hned poté, co ti zrušil víkendový volno.\\" Here's a detailed breakdown of the translation: 1. \\"Right after\\" - This phrase can be translated as \\"hned poté\\" or \\"ihned poté\\" in Czech. Both phrases are used to indicate something happening immediately after an event. Examples: - Hned poté jsem začal uklízet (Right after that, I started cleaning). - Ihned poté přišla zpráva (The message came right after). 2. \\"he revoked\\" - The verb \\"to revoke\\" means \\"zrušit\\" or \\"odebrat\\" in Czech. In this context, \\"zrušil\\" (he revoked) is the past tense and masculine form of the verb \\"zrušit.\\" Examples: - Ředitel zrušil schůzku (The director canceled the meeting). - Ministr zrušil opatření (The minister revoked the measure). 3. \\"your weekend pass\\" - The phrase \\"weekend pass\\" refers to the permission to have free time or to leave a site or institution during a weekend. In Czech, it can be translated as \\"víkendový volno\\" or \\"víkendová průkazka.\\" The Czech word \\"tvoje\\" (your) is used to show possession. Examples: - Máš víkendový volno? (Do you have a weekend pass?) - Tvoje víkendová průkazka byla schválena (Your weekend pass has been approved). So, putting it all together, the sentence \\"Right after he revoked your weekend pass\\" can be translated as \\"Hned poté, co ti zrušil víkendový volno\\" or \\"Hned poté, co ti zrušil víkendová průkazka.\\" These translations convey the same meaning as the original phrase in the context of someone having their weekend pass revoked by someone else."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Known for their strong Catholic faith, the Croats hold immense respect and reverence for the papacy and its representatives. The installation of a new Pope has generated waves of optimism, unity, and renewed faith among the Croatian people who believe that their perspectives and issues will be better understood and addressed with the Pope's leadership. The Catholic Church has played a significant role in the preservation of the Croatian culture and identity since the early days of the Kingdom of Croatia. Croatia has experienced both the ups and downs throughout its history, with periods of autonomy and foreign rule. However, the bond between the Croatian people and their religion has remained inseparable, providing solace and support during even the darkest of times. Now, with the election of a new Pope, the Croats firmly believe that their voice and concerns will be acknowledged on a global platform. The newly elected Pope has captured the hearts of the Croatian people with his evident simplicity, humbleness, and commitment to social justice. What resonates the most with the Croats is his immense empathy towards marginalized communities and focus on peace-building efforts. Through his papacy, the new Pope envisions a world where the oppressed can break free from the shackles of suffering and attain equality. Furthermore, he has emphasized the significance of interfaith dialogues and embracing cultural differences to promote harmony and coexistence. The global Croatian community views the new Pope as a beacon of hope, not just for their nation, but for the world at large. His dedication to social inclusion and progress echoes the desires of a united Croatia, working towards a future of prosperity and equality. The Croats believe they have found not only a religious leader in the new Pope but also a friend who appreciates and values their heritage and contributions. With the new Pope in the seat of the papacy, excitement and anticipation are palpable amongst the Croats, who hope that their long-standing concerns, such as the economic and social reconstruction, will be addressed with greater urgency and commitment. They are optimistic about stronger ties between their nation and the Vatican, paving the way for positive change and enduring collaboration. In conclusion, the Croatian people believe that, with the new Pope, they have found a friend and ally who will act as a catalyst for change, understanding, and unity. His unwavering dedication to social justice and advocacy for the marginalized has resonated deeply with the hearts of the Croats, and they eagerly await his papacy with great anticipation and fervor.

This sentence highlights two crucial points. Firstly, it acknowledges that maintaining sustainable food reserves is a major challenge. This issue is not just confined to a specific region but is a matter of global concern, as the productivity and sustainability of our food systems are being undermined by a variety of factors, including climate change, biodiversity loss, and population growth. Indeed, without significant investment and policy intervention, the world could face increasing food insecurity and other related problems, such as malnutrition and social unrest. Efforts are needed to build more resilient and sustainable food systems that can withstand shocks, deliver affordable and healthy diets for all, and help preserve our planet's biodiversity and natural resources. Secondly, the sentence also hails the European Union (EU) as one of the greatest present-day success stories. Since its formation, the EU has contributed substantially to promoting peace, stability, and prosperity in the region, which comprises 27 member countries. The EU has been instrumental in preventing conflicts and facilitating cooperation among member states, primarily through economic interdependency. It has fostered prosperity by creating a single market, eliminating trade barriers, and adopting a common currency – the euro, which is used by 19 member countries. Furthermore, it has also promoted social stability and inclusion by upholding democratic values and human rights, implementing social policies, and providing significant funding for regional development and cohesion. In a world marred by conflict and disparity, the EU represents an inspiring model of regional collaboration and unity.

The serum is highly scientific, and based on reviews around the world, it really appears to work. I have been using it for a week now and my angry line down the middle of my forehead is already seeming less angry. I will post a review once I have been using it for a month or so. If you want to purchase the serum, it is available from the BIOeffect Australia website or if you are looking for updates or reviews on the product then you can either like their Facebook page or follow them on Twitter. So, who is now busting to try the serum? Well, to celebrate the launch, the wonderful people behind BIOeffect Australia, Melanie and Kym, have agreed to sponsor a giveaway of some amazing BIOeffect products. First prize will be one full sized bottle of the amazing BIOeffect serum. This bottle alone is worth 180.00!! In addition there will be two runners up prizes of a 3ml travel sized bottle of the serum. These are worth 40.00 each! Entering the competition is simple. All you need to do is have a read of my article, The science behind the BIOeffect EGF Serum explained, and make a comment on that article about what excites you the most about the serum. Are you like me and are blown away by the science? Is it the fact that independent clinical trials are proving that the serum works? Or is there something else that has grabbed you? Please tell me.
