You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please briefly summarize this news article: Will iPhones edge out BlackBerrys in Washington? Rep. Connie Mack hearts his iPhone. He just wishes his staff would show the love, too. When the Florida Republican began urging his aides to dump their government-issued BlackBerrys for government-issued iPhones, they mostly ignored him. Only Mack's chief of staff heeded Apple's siren call, making him and his boss two of just 86 iPhone users at work in the House of Representatives. Other aides still cling to the familiar, part of a sea of 9,140 BlackBerry stalwarts in the House. This disparity also holds true based on retail sales or a stroll along most any downtown block at lunchtime -- evidence that Washington's attachment to the sturdy, e-mail-focused BlackBerry has been unshakable. No matter that the flashier, more Web-friendly iPhone has reshaped the smartphone landscape, letting users trade contact information by simply bumping phones or find the nearest Chinese restaurant by taking a picture of a street. Although no one keeps a tally of government-issued BlackBerrys, they number in the tens of thousands, as evidenced by hordes of federal employees tapping away at them on the Metro. Even outside the Beltway, BlackBerrys still far outnumber iPhones. But the Steve Jobs creation, with its thousands of downloadable applications, overwhelmingly dominates the country's mobile Web usage. Which is why Mack and others are waging a get-with-it campaign to square the federal government with how the rest of the country consumes mobile data and ignores spouses and children at dinner. \\"There are people in my office who are bucking change,\\" acknowledged Mack, whose wife, Rep. Mary Bono Mack (R-Calif.), is also an iPhone enthusiast. \\"I think I can be persuasive. I'll let them decide on their own -- or I will force them. We're slow about adopting a lot of things in this town. But I can feel the change coming.\\" Evolving from an e-mail-obsessed BlackBerry town to a whiz-bang app town would represent a significant shift in how the government does business. A program that turns a phone into a document scanner would let government officials manage their work lives on the go. Instead of e-mailing back and forth with several colleagues, a group could conduct a four-way instant message chat in real time. The shift from centralized to decentralized, from action to interaction would flow to the thousands of companies across the region that do business with the federal government. \\"The iPhone introduced a new paradigm, the apps paradigm, and that paradigm is everything that matters now,\\" said tech guru Tim O'Reilly, who has been introducing apps developers to the people who run federal agencies. \\"But a lot of people in D.C. really love their BlackBerrys, and they have a strong relationship with them.\\" \\"Love\\" may be too shallow a word to describe this region's fixation with the BlackBerry, an addictive e-mail powerhouse that so far lacks the technological innards for the rich, data-heavy apps that have become so popular on other smartphones. (No, not just games in which people throw sheep at each other via their Facebook apps.) Washington is the country's eighth-largest metro region but the fourth-biggest user of BlackBerrys according to Localytics, which tracks mobile app usage. Best Buy sells more BlackBerrys in the Washington region than it does elsewhere, said Scott Anderson, the retailer's senior director of mobile merchants. Introduced in 1999, the BlackBerry was the first mobile device that could send secure e-mail outside the office, and law firms (there are a few around here, always hunting for more billable hours) quickly adopted the technology. The government joined in, making the BlackBerry an essential tool for communication. Summary:","completion":"In Washington, the traditional preference for BlackBerry devices among government officials is being challenged by the growing popularity of iPhones. Florida Republican Rep. Connie Mack is urging his aides to switch to iPhones, but the uptake has so far been slow, with only Mack's chief of staff making the change. Out of the 9,140 BlackBerry users in the House of Representatives, only 86 have adopted iPhones. Despite BlackBerry devices dominating the Washington landscape, iPhones account for a larger volume of mobile web usage in the country, due to their downloadable applications. Shifting from a focus on email to a more app-centric approach could signify a change in the way government conducts business, but the strong relationship between Washington and BlackBerry may be hard to break."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie plot title: Sherlock Holmes Movie plot: The film begins during the German air raids in London in 1940. An elderly Dr. John Watson tells his nurse the tale of an unrecorded case he shared with his friend Sherlock Holmes. In 1882, Holmes and Watson investigate the shipwreck of a royal treasury ship which was destroyed by a monstrous giant octopus on the coast of Newhaven. They do not believe the first-hand accounts of the sole survivor of the attack, but nonetheless investigate. Inspector Lestrade states that he has recently had contact with Holmes's estranged brother Thorpe, a former partner of Lestrade's who was paralyzed during a bank robbery seven years prior. In Whitechapel, a young man is killed by a dinosaur. Watson is skeptical until he and Holmes discover the creature on their morning constitution. Finding escape, several more clues lead Holmes to deduce that the monsters are artificial, built by a criminal genius to acquire resources. On the case, the dinosaur steals a water pump operating a fountain and rolls of copper wire, presumably so Spring-Heeled Jack can create another monster. The octopus that destroyed the ship earlier is linked to the dinosaur because they are both similarly \\"exceptionally improbable\\". Lestrade accompanies Holmes and Watson during their investigation. On one of their leads, Lestrade ends up missing. Holmes's reasoning leads himself and Watson to an old castle in Helmsmouth he and his brother visited as children. They come across another monster, a masked mechanical man: Spring-Heeled Jack. Spring-Heeled Jack is revealed to be Holmes' brother, Thorpe, who also assumed the identity of a patient of Watson's. Inesidora Ivory, his accomplice, is with him. Thorpe explains that he built a mechanical suit to cure his paralysis, and he deduced that the crippling bullet ricocheted off a doorframe, fired by Lestrade. He plans to destroy London, assassinate Queen Victoria and force Lestrade to claim responsibility. Ivory is revealed to be one of Thorpe's creations and his lover, and she carries that will detonate when she... The answer is:","completion":"No answer"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

These films are designed to make the audience laugh through amusement and most often work by exaggerating characteristics for humorous effect. Films in this style traditionally have a happy ending (black comedy being an exception). One of the oldest genres in film, some of the very first silent movies were comedies, as slapstick comedy often relies on visual depictions, without requiring sound. When sound films became more prevalent during the 1920s, comedy films took another swing, as laughter could result from burlesque situations but also dialogue. - The Rank Organisation was a British entertainment conglomerate founded by industrialist J. Arthur Rank in April 1937. It quickly became the largest and most vertically integrated film company in Britain, owning production, distribution and exhibition facilities. It also diversified into the manufacture of radios, TVs and photocopiers (as one of the owners of Rank Xerox). The company name lasted until February 1996 when the name and some of the remaining assets were absorbed into the newly structured the Rank Group Plc and in the years that followed asset stripping and streamlining of the business has left it a shadow of its former self, with all their remaining operating interests now in gambling. - Sir Derek Jules Gaspard Ulric Niven van den Bogaerde, known as Dirk Bogarde (28 March 1921 8 May 1999), was an English actor and writer. Initially a matinée idol in films such as \\"Doctor in the House\\" (1954) for the Rank Organisation, he later acted in art-house films. In a second career, he wrote seven best-selling volumes of memoirs, six novels and a volume of collected journalism, mainly from articles in \\"The Daily Telegraph\\". - The Daily Telegraph, commonly referred to simply as The Telegraph, is a national British daily broadsheet newspaper published in London by Telegraph Media Group and distributed across the United Kingdom and internationally. It was founded by Arthur B. Sleigh in 1855 as \\"The Daily Telegraph and Courier\\". - A film, also called a movie, motion picture, theatrical film or photoplay, is a series of still images which, when shown on a screen, creates the illusion of moving images due to the phi phenomenon. This optical illusion causes the audience to perceive continuous motion between separate objects viewed rapidly in succession. The process of filmmaking is both an art and an industry. A film is created by photographing actual scenes with a motion picture camera; by photographing drawings or miniature models using traditional animation techniques; by means of CGI and computer animation; or by a combination of some or all of these techniques and other visual effects. - Sir Alec Guinness (2 April 1914 5 August 2000) was an English actor. After an early career on the stage, he was featured in several of the Ealing Comedies, including \\"The Ladykillers\\" and \\"Kind Hearts and Coronets\\" in which he played eight different characters.

Texas Rural Legal Aid - known for its fearless and sometimes controversial advocacy of the poorest of the poor - last week took over four other corporations serving the legal needs of the indigent in Southwest Texas, including the one in Bexar County. The new 68-county legal aid organization has yet to be named and stretches from El Paso to Corpus Christi, Harlingen to Austin. The leader for the super-sized law firm has big plans. \\"I'm more interested in looking at what we as advocates can do to address the serious problems of poverty than the number of cases we close,\\" said David Hall, the TRLA executive director. In the Rio Grande Valley, Hall's attorneys set up separate groups to assist small-business owners and residents with low-interest loans and legal representation. They also operate a legal arm that assists migrant workers from Texas to Kentucky. Now, Hall said, he wants to make services to the poor more efficient by working with law students who will handle less complicated legal matters, allowing licensed attorneys to take more \\"high impact\\" cases to court. \\"What we need to do is handle cases as efficiently as we can, leveraging the amount of time of the lawyer that goes in there and maximizing the number of people that they can help at one time,\\" Hall said. His plan is to place the 110 attorneys on staff in teams working on specialized legal issues. He wants to expand the law clinic it already has with St. Mary's University Law School to involve students at the University of Texas Law School. The law students at St. Mary's interview potential clients, assist them with filling out legal documents and answer the telephones for the legal hotline, freeing up TRLA lawyers to handle the complicated cases, Hall said. By the end of September, Hall said all the attorneys working with the poor in the 68county area will be placed on the same computer network so they can pass cases to the best available attorneys. Last year, board members on the former Legal Aid of Central Texas and Bexar County Legal Aid resisted the merger, saying that the mergers were done illegally and without the input of board members. They also argued that Hall's litigious style hampered their ability to garner funds from Congress. TRLA generated controversy in 1996, when its attorneys challenged the rights of 800 military personnel to vote in Val Verde County elections by absentee ballot after a former Ku Klux Klan member won a county commissioner post.

Letters of introduction from Paris proved effective; on 27 April 1764, four days after their arrival, the children were playing before King George III and his 19-year-old German queen, Charlotte Sophia. A second royal engagement was fixed for 19 May, at which Wolfgang was asked by the king to play pieces by Handel, Johann Christian Bach and Carl Friedrich Abel. He was allowed to accompany the queen as she sang an aria, and he later improvised on the bass part of a Handel aria from which, according to Leopold, he produced \\"the most beautiful melody in such a manner that everyone was astonished\\".Many of the nobility and gentry were leaving town for the summer, but Leopold reckoned that most would return for the king's birthday celebrations on 4 June, and accordingly organised a concert for the 5th. This was deemed a success, and Leopold hastened to arrange for Wolfgang to appear at a benefit concert for a maternity hospital on 29 June, at Ranelagh Pleasure Gardens. Leopold apparently saw this effort to support charitable works as \\"a way to earn the love of this very special nation\\". Wolfgang was advertised as \\"the celebrated and astonishing Master Mozart, a Child of Seven Years of Age...\\" (he was in fact eight), \\"justly esteemed the most extraordinary Prodigy, and most amazing Genius, that has appeared in any Age\\". On 8 July there was a private performance at the Grosvenor Square home of the Earl of Thanet, from which Leopold returned with an inflammation of the throat and other worrying symptoms. \\"Prepare your heart to hear one of the saddest events\\", he wrote to Hagenauer in anticipation of his own imminent demise. He was ill for several weeks, and for the sake of his health the family moved from their Cecil Court lodgings to a house in the countryside, at 180 Ebury Street, then considered part of the village of Chelsea. contains an answer for the question: What was the first name of King George III's 19-year-old queen?, what is it ?","completion":"The first name of King George III's 19-year-old queen is Charlotte Sophia."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

To fill this gap in the literature, mandolin orchestras have traditionally played many arrangements of music written for regular orchestras or other ensembles. Some players have sought out contemporary composers to solicit new works. Traditional mandolin orchestras remain especially popular in Japan and Germany, but also exist throughout the United States, Europe and the rest of the world. They perform works composed for mandolin family instruments, or re-orchestrations of traditional pieces. The structure of a contemporary traditional mandolin orchestra consists of: first and second mandolins, mandolas (either octave mandolas, tuned an octave below the mandolin, or tenor mandolas, tuned like the viola), mandocellos (tuned like the cello), and bass instruments (conventional string bass or, rarely, mandobasses).

The vast growth of information on the Internet as well as number of visitors to websites add some key challenges to recommender systems. These are: producing accurate recommendation, handling many recommendations efficiently and coping with the vast growth of number of participants in the system. Therefore, new recommender system technologies are needed that can quickly produce high quality recommendations even for huge data sets. To address these issues we have explored several collaborative filtering techniques such as the item based approach, which identify relationship between items and indirectly compute recommendations for users based on these relationships. The user based approach was also studied, it identifies relationships between users of similar tastes and computes recommendations based on these relationships. In this paper, we introduce the topic of recommender system. It provides ways to evaluate efficiency, scalability and accuracy of recommender system. The paper also analyzes different algorithms of user based and item based techniques for recommendation generation.

Select from: -- no -- yes Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","completion":"Yes, questions 1 and 2 are asking the same thing. Both are inquiring about possible solutions to the ongoing conflict in the Kashmir region. As for the solution to the Kashmir conflict, there is no simple answer to this question. However, a detailed analysis of the historical and political context of the issue, as well as multiple suggested approaches, may provide a broader understanding. 1. Historical Background: The conflict over Kashmir traces back to the partition of British India in 1947, which led to the creation of two independent nations, India and Pakistan. According to the partition plan, the princely states were given the choice to join either India or Pakistan. Hari Singh, the ruler of the princely state of Jammu and Kashmir, was indecisive and wanted to maintain independence due to the region's diverse religious and ethnic composition. In October 1947, Pakistan allegedly supported tribal raiders who tried to annex Kashmir, forcing Hari Singh to ask India for help. In return, he agreed to accede to India, resulting in the first Indo-Pakistan war of 1947-48. The war ended with a UN-brokered ceasefire that divided the region along the Line of Control (LOC). The conflicting claims by India and Pakistan over Kashmir have since led to multiple wars, skirmishes, and diplomatic stand-offs. 2. Possible Approaches to a Solution: a) Dialogue: The foremost step in resolving the conflict is initiating consistent, meaningful, and result-oriented dialogues between India and Pakistan. These dialogues must cover all aspects of the conflict, including autonomy, cross-border terrorism, and the demilitarization of the region. Besides, dialogues between the central government and the local stakeholders in Jammu and Kashmir are essential in understanding the aspirations of the people and addressing their grievances. b) Confidence Building Measures (CBMs): CBMs are required to create an environment conducive to peace and to build trust between the conflicting parties. They may include: improved trade relations, easing of travel restrictions across the LOC, regular meetings between the border security forces, and cultural exchange programs to deepen understanding between the peoples of the two nations. c) UN and International Diplomacy: The United Nations can play an essential role in facilitating negotiations and diplomatic efforts between India and Pakistan. It could also help in implementing the agreed-upon resolutions through international monitoring and assistance. d) Plebiscite: The United Nations resolution 47, adopted in 1948, calls for a free and impartial plebiscite in the region to allow the inhabitants of Jammu and Kashmir the right to decide their own future. However, this solution is complex, given the demographic changes since 1948, the influence of extremist ideologies, and the reluctance from both India and Pakistan to conduct a plebiscite. e) Trilateral Dialogue: Involving China, which administers Aksai Chin and Shaksgam Valley in the region, in the dialogues could provide an additional perspective and possibly lead to a more comprehensive solution to the conflict. f) Bilateral Agreements: Bilateral agreements, such as the Simla Agreement (1972) and the Lahore Declaration (1999), that reaffirm commitment to peaceful resolutions of disputes and adherence to agreed-upon principles can serve as avenues for continued negotiations. It is crucial to understand that the resolution of the Kashmir conflict requires a sincere, dedicated, and sustained effort from all parties involved. The process needs to respect the aspirations of the people of Jammu and Kashmir, ensuring their fundamental rights to life, liberty, and equitable development. Moreover, long-term peace can only be achieved when the solutions derive from open and inclusive dialogues, involving the willing cooperation of India, Pakistan, and the people of Kashmir."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. How would someone go about accomplishing this goal? pan","completion":"To accomplish the goal of mastering the art of pan, one must assume that \\"pan\\" refers to \\"panning\\" in photography, cooking with a pan, or the musical instrument called the steelpan (also known as the steel drum). Here, I will provide detailed steps for all three interpretations. 1. Panning in Photography: Panning is a photography technique used to capture moving subjects while emphasizing motion. To master this technique, follow these steps: a. Choose the right equipment: Use a camera with manual settings or a smartphone camera with a \\"manual\\" or \\"pro\\" mode. A DSLR or mirrorless camera is ideal. b. Select the appropriate settings: Set a slower shutter speed (between 1/30 and 1/125 of a second) to capture motion blur in the background. Adjust ISO and aperture settings accordingly to maintain proper exposure. c. Choose a suitable location: Find a location where your subject, such as a car, cyclist, or runner, will be moving parallel to your position. d. Frame your shot: Set your focus on the subject and use a wide focal length to capture the scene and allow for potential errors in panning movement. e. Track the subject: Follow the subject with your camera, maintaining a smooth and steady motion while pre-focusing on the subject to ensure sharpness. f. Take the shot: As the subject enters the frame, press the shutter while still tracking the subject, and continue the motion for a split second after the shot. g. Practice and refine your technique: Mastering panning requires time and patience, so keep practicing and making adjustments to your settings and technique. 2. Cooking with a Pan: Mastering the art of cooking with a pan involves understanding different techniques and types of pans. Follow these steps: a. Purchase the right pans: Invest in a variety of high-quality pans, such as a non-stick skillet, cast iron skillet, and a stainless-steel sauté pan. b. Learn about heat management: Understand the differences between low, medium, and high heat and when to use each setting for specific dishes. c. Master essential cooking techniques: Learn various cooking methods, such as sautéing, pan-frying, deglazing, simmering, and braising. d. Build your culinary skills: Develop knife skills, learn to make sauces, and study various cuisines to expand your knowledge and repertoire. e. Practice, practice, practice: The more you cook with a pan, the better you will become. Experiment with new recipes and techniques to continue honing your skills. 3. Playing the Steelpan (Steel Drum): To master the steelpan, an instrument typically associated with Caribbean music, follow these steps: a. Choose the right steelpan: There are several types of steelpans, such as tenor, double tenor, double second, and bass. Consider your musical goals and preferences while selecting the appropriate one. b. Find a teacher or instructional resources: Look for a steelpan instructor, online courses, or instructional books and videos to learn the basics and proper technique. c. Understand the layout: Familiarize yourself with the pan's layout, which is designed with notes placed according to their musical relationship. d. Learn the proper playing technique: Hold rubber-tipped mallets and strike the surface of the steelpan at precise angles using a controlled wrist motion. e. Practice scales and songs: Start with basic scales to get familiar with the instrument's layout, then progress to simple songs and finally more advanced pieces. f. Join a steelpan ensemble or band: Playing with others will help develop your skills and provide valuable performance experience. g. Dedicate time to practice: Like any musical instrument, mastering the steelpan requires consistent practice and patience.

Let's analyze the sentences one by one. Sentence 1 provides information about the national shrine of the country that it began during the Old Kingdom. However, the parentheses at the end of the sentence seem to have been cut off, which might leave out some key information. The statement does not provide any details about the height or structure of the national shrine. Sentence 2 provides information that the national shrine of the country is three stories tall.

Local people can get these bikes at special docking stations .There are about 315 docking stations across the city. About 12,450 keys have already been handed out to the local people, but only 6,000 keys can be used now. Let's see the cost you need to pay. One key costs PS3, and the cost of using the bike is PS1 for an hour. The cost per hour increases as the hours increase, so it will cost PS50 if you rent the bike for 24 hours.

Article: Eating too much fatty food, exercising too little and smoking can raise your future risk of heart disease. But there is another factor that can cause your heart problems more immediately: the air you breathe. Previous studies have linked high exposure to environmental pollution to an increased risk of heart problem, but two analyses now show that poor air quality can lead to heart attack or stroke within as little as a few hours after exposure. In one review of the research, scientists found that people exposed to high levels of pollutants were up to 5% more likely to suffer a heart attack within days of exposure than those with lower exposure. A separate study of stroke patients showed that even air that the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) considers to be of \\"moderate\\" quality and relatively safe for our health can raise the risk of stroke as much as 34% within 12 to 14 hours of exposure. The authors of both studies stress that these risks are relatively small for healthy people and certainly modest compared with other risk factors such as smoking and high blood pressure. However, it is important to be aware of these dangers because everyone is exposed to air pollution regardless of lifestyle choices.

In an attempt to reduce open street prostitution and to improve security for sex workers, Switzerland's largest city, Zurich, is opening \\"sex drive-ins\\" Monday. The nine garage-style structures, located in Sihlquai, a former industrial zone in the city, are equipped with alarm buttons and guarded by security personnel to ensure the safety of the prostitutes. Customers are not allowed to leave the area with the sex workers. Read more: Brazil drops 'happy being a prostitute' ad campaign. \\"Prostitution has escalated in the city,\\" said Michael Herzig, from the Zurich social services department. \\"It was done out in the open on the street and men harassed passers-by. \\"It was noisy and dirty because men took the prostitutes to a side street and left used condoms on the streets. The drive-ins are more discreet and safer.\\" Herzig leads the project, which has cost 2.4 million Swiss francs (2.6 million) to set up. \\"The project is extremely controversial. Prostitution is about morals and religion. But we leave these things aside and see it as a business. The humanitarian aspect is more important for us,\\" said Herzig. Around 30 to 40 women are expected to work at the site each night. Sex workers have to pay 5 Swiss francs per night to make use of the so-called \\"sex boxes,\\" but customers don't have to pay an entrance fee. Read more: Ahead of Brazil World Cup, free English classes planned for prostitutes. The drive-ins are open daily from 7 p.m. to 5 a.m. and can only be accessed by car. Drivers have to follow a clearly marked route to get to the area, where customers and sex workers can discuss the services offered and agree on a price. The client can then drive into the allocated box, where the service is provided. There are also showers, toilets, a kitchen and washing machines for the women to use, as well as an advice center where they can seek help from social workers. A gynecologist comes in once a week to offer health checkups for the women. The city's social services department is running the whole operation and also offers crash courses in German and self-defense courses for the women on site. \\"All of this will enhance the sex workers' living and working conditions,\\" Herzig said. Prostitution and consumption of paid sex are legal in Switzerland. Prostitutes are considered self-employed and are liable for taxation. \\"We are trying to promote the independence and self-determination of the sex workers,\\" he said. \\"It's not a unique concept. We went to Utrecht in the Netherlands and Cologne and Essen in Germany, where similar projects exist, to speak to organizers. In Utrecht it's been successfully implemented since 1986.\\" As well as backing from the authorities, the project in Zurich has a democratic mandate: A referendum was held in March 2012, with 52% of voters in favor.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Here is a news article: Coldplay headlined the Super Bowl 50 halftime show, but it was Beyoncé who came to play. When the NFL first announced that Coldplay would be playing the halftime show, a couple simple assumptions emerged: 1) They'd have to pay lip service to past Super Bowls (which they did, via a montage of past performers set to \\"Fix You\\"), and 2) Beyoncé would be joining, since Coldplay and Beyoncé had only recently released their collaboration song, \\"Hymn For the Weekend.\\" It was also kind of expected that Beyoncé might outshine them. To be fair, Coldplay gave it their eager best. Lead singer Chris Martin started the proceedings on the field, surrounded by fans, and then performed songs like \\"Viva La Vida\\" and \\"Adventure of a Lifetime\\" with a giant grin on his face and a hyperactive spring in his step. The band's Technicolor trappings paired with Martin's enthusiasm made for one of the most earnest halftime performances in recent memory. The whole thing felt as if it was unfolding underneath one of those rainbow kindergarten parachutes. Then 2014 Super Bowl headliner Bruno Mars slid out to perform songwriter Mark Ronson's \\"Uptown Funk\\" with a slick line of dancers. It looked great; unfortunately, the audio was so mangled that viewers at home could barely hear anything above the screaming crowds. Still, both Martin and Mars seemed to be having a hell of a time. And then the drum line parted, and there was Beyoncé. It's not surprising that Beyoncé slayed; in 2013, she gave one of the best Super Bowl performances in the game's history. But there was far more behind Beyoncé's performance of her brand new single \\"Formation\\" than her shutting down the dance floor — which she did, even in a dance-off with Mars that included a gracefully swerved stumble. The day before the Super Bowl, Beyoncé debuted the song by dropping one of her best and boldest videos yet. As Vox's Alex Abad-Santos wrote, \\"Formation\\" is \\"riskier, filthier, angrier, and pulpier\\" than is typical for Beyoncé. It's also proudly steeped in black American culture, celebrates black femininity, and is overtly political, with Beyoncé sinking a New Orleans cop car as a little boy in a hoodie dances in front of riot cops. And her Super Bowl performance followed right in the video's footsteps. Beyoncé emerged, flanked by black women backup dancers with Afros and Black Panther-adjacent uniforms, and clad in a jacket that echoed another iconic black performer: Michael Jackson, circa 1993. So there was, as there always is, a little more than met the eye during Beyoncé's performance. And by the time Bruno Mars challenged Bey to a dance-off, she'd stolen the show once and for all. To top it all off, the second the broadcast cut away from all the shiny happy people singing Coldplay's finale to go to commercial, the first ad was for Beyoncé, announcing a new Formation world tour. She's since announced a new fund to help the children of Flint, Michigan, during the city's current water crisis. Beyoncé performing \\"Formation\\" at the Super Bowl is a huge, purposeful statement. Putting black America center stage smack dab in the middle of Coldplay's set was a significant move right from the start, but it is especially poignant in the context of the song's defiant social commentary, the constant criticism against black Panthers quarterback Cam Newton for so-called excessive arrogance, and a 1.5 million donation from Tidal — Jay Z's ever-halting streaming service — to nonprofit social justice organizations like Black Lives Matter on February 5, the day Trayvon Martin would have turned 21. In short, Beyoncé dominated the show the minute she stepped onto the field, from her knowing smirks during meticulously choreographed dances to the moment when she joined Coldplay and Mars onstage to make sure everyone knew she could smoke them while sharing the screen. More crucially, she transformed one of the biggest events in sports, corporate synergy, and entertainment into a distinctly political act. But if you need more succinct proof of just how thoroughly Beyoncé's attitude and charisma overtook Martin's earnest bopping, here's a picture of Martin trying to squeeze between Bey and Mars; she's crushing the show too hard to even notice: Beyoncé, Chris Martin and Bruno Mars wrapping up the Super Bowl Halftime show #SB50. pic.twitter.com/0JL3Z2MiYJ — Music News & Facts (@musicnews_facts) February 8, 2016 Take heart, Chris Martin: You did what you could.

Her idea of swag in this song is keeping a bottle of hot sauce in her purse. That’s seriously, gloriously specific. WORTHAM Wesley, it’s the blackest of black. It’s not Pharrell’s new black (no shade!) — it’s your grandmother’s black. Her idea of swag is keeping hot sauce in her bag while she’s decked out in Givenchy. That’s baller, and that’s why the world slash Internet is going nuts. It’s a dab in a video form, playing on a loop; it’s phenomenally delicious. CARAMANICA “Earned all this money but they never take the country out me”: What’s fascinating about this song and video is how Beyoncé renders her politics both literally and colloquially. Her radicalism is both overt and implicit — she knows that creatively drawn statements of black identity and pride are as powerful as any direct social-political statement. I think you’re right, Wesley, in that she’s making clear her claims to her old identity even in this new space. But it’s also important to remember that she was doing similar things all over “Beyoncé,” the album she surprise released at the end of 2013. “Formation” feels like a refinement and amplification of that album — it’s sinewy and thrusting, but also angular and tough. Between the song and the video, there’s the club, the church, the wig shop, line dancing, donks on parade, black cowboys and, yes, some footage of New Orleans borrowed from a mini-documentary called “That B.E.A.T.” (which the filmmakers seem alternately frustrated by and pleased with). Beyoncé is both old South and new South — her musical and aesthetic approaches posit them as existing on a continuum. ||||| These crawls are part of an effort to archive pages as they are created and archive the pages that they refer to.

(Scott Halleran/Getty Images) There were freakouts over Red Lobster and hot sauce, Blue Ivy and #BlackLivesMatter. In the hours after Beyoncé released her surprise music video “Formation” on Saturday, social media was awash in praise, once again, for Queen B. Except from two upset documentary filmmakers, who claimed their footage was used in the video without permission. “New Beyonce video used hella clips from the doc I produced and directed,” Los Angeles-based filmmaker Chris Black wrote on Twitter. “…but why?!?!” [Watch 2016 Super Bowl ads] Black linked to a documentary called “That B.E.A.T.” which he created with director Abteen Bagheri. (NSFW warning, but you can watch it here.) Bagheri responded on Twitter, too: “I’m not mad. It’s the sad reality of the music business. Doesn’t affect my friends’ and my work, but not cool.” The accusations were amplified by timing: “Formation” debuted on the eve of Super Bowl 50, where Beyoncé will perform her second halftime show, three years after her highly praised act in the 2013 Super Bowl in New Orleans. The song, which she is likely to play Sunday, features New Orleans as its backdrop and inspiration. That’s where the clips from “That B.E.A.T.,” a documentary about NOLA’s dance culture, come in. A representative for Beyoncé told Entertainment Weekly that those clips were purchased fairly. “The documentary footage was used with permission and licensed from the owner of the footage,” the representative said. “They were given proper compensation. The footage was provided to us by the filmmaker’s production company. The filmmaker is listed in the credits for additional photography direction. We are thankful that they granted us permission.” Those credits aren’t listed beneath YouTube’s version of “Formation,” which has already been viewed more than 6 million times. Nor are they easy to find on Tidal, the Jay Z-owned steaming service where “Formation” debuted. To find them, head to VideoStatic, where Bagheri’s name is listed next to”additional photography direction.” In a surprise release a day before her Super Bowl performance, Beyoncé dropped the song \\"Formation\\" and its music video. Here's a guide to the video, the lyrics and things you might have missed. (Nicki DeMarco/The Washington Post) Black told the Fader, a music news site, that he received a request for permission in January. It came from director Lily Keber, who also has footage featured in the video. Black didn’t give Keber permission because he didn’t own the footage. He told Keber “That B.E.A.T.” was commissioned by Nokia in partnership with Sundance. That was the last he heard from Team Beyoncé, he said. A spokesperson for Nokia said the company’s music services business was sold to Microsoft in 2014. The Washington Post has reached out to Microsoft to ask whether it licensed the footage. If that’s the case, it appears that Microsoft, not the filmmakers, were paid for the clips. “All we want is respect and credit,” Black said. “They don’t know what we sacrificed to make [the film]. They just came along and took it without crediting us.” “Anyone who works in the industry knows that putting out a work is a miracle,”Bagheri said in an email to the Post. “There needs to be a unity amongst directors. We need to preserve the sanctity of the craft and champion individual voices. Our work isn’t just b-roll for someone else. It just shouldn’t be considered, whether or not it’s legal. It’s a bad precedent to set.” Why Melina gotta use clips from our doc?!? Was the budget not big enough to spend a week in New Orleans and actually build with the people. — chris black (@TheBlack) February 6, 2016 Later in the day, “Formation” director Melina Matsoukas responded: Must give much love to the beautiful NOLA footage shot and directed by @abteen and @lkeber to make #FORMATION whole. — melina matsoukas (@melinamatsoukas) February 7, 2016 Bagheri tweeted to Matsoukas thanking her for the recognition, and Black said they aren’t planning to pursue legal action. They may not have received money or prominent attribution, but it’s hard to imagine how being associated with Beyoncé wouldn’t benefit their careers. Still, maybe they could ask her team to send over some of the new “Formation” merchandise that is already on sale.

Here's What People Are Saying YouTube Beyoncé is one of a kind — the kind of star who can drop a surprise music video and see much of the Internet and social media instantly explode. \\"Formation,\\" released Saturday, has already racked up more than 7 million views on YouTube. It's full of implicit and explicit commentary on subjects like being black in America, Hurricane Katrina and Black Lives Matter. And the Internet responded swiftly. The video is a \\"powerful proclamation of being a proud, powerful black woman,\\" writes Margaret E. Jacobsen on Romper. Jacobsen connects the imagery of the video to #BlackGirlMagic, a hashtag used to celebrate African-American women on Twitter. The song is \\"an anthem for black women,\\" writes Jacobsen. \\"And the response has been amazing. Following the video's release, we're talking about the blood that runs through our veins and the hoods we grew up in. We're holding all of those in our black communities who came before us up high. We're wearing every little thing that's contributed to our blackness proudly. We're letting our black girl magic shine.\\" At The Root, Danielle C. Belton says the video is \\"black\\" — \\"cornbread and collard greens black. 'Hot sauce in my bag' black. Southern black. Dirty South black. Your grandma telling you to go cut down a switch black,\\" she writes. \\"Did you know Beyoncé was black?\\" The video focuses on New Orleans, in particular, opening and closing with Beyoncé atop a New Orleans police car, with a background reminiscent of Hurricane Katrina. The reference to the hurricane of a decade ago still resonates, says Regina N. Bradley on Red Clay Scholar. \\"Katrina is not just a historical event,\\" she writes. \\"It is a springboard for re-rendering southern trauma and its association with blackness. Trauma is the spring board of southern blackness. But its foundation is resilience and creativity.\\" The video also mixes in footage of New Orleans taken from the 2013 documentary That B.E.A.T. (which filmmakers initially said was used without permission). \\"She wants us to know — more than ever — that she's still grounded, she's paying attention and still a little hood,\\" writes Jenna Wortham in The New York Times. \\"I think she wants us to know that even though she's headlining a mainstream event like the Super Bowl, she has opinions and isn't afraid to share them, nor is she afraid to do it on a national and global scale.\\" The video is political. A boy dances in front of a line of police officers in riot gear. He raises his hands — but so does the line of cops. Graffiti on the wall reads \\"Stop shooting us,\\" echoing the principal demand from Black Lives Matter activists for reform in policing and criminal justice. As The Daily Beast noted, Beyoncé and husband Jay-Z have paid to bail out protesters in Baltimore and Ferguson. And Tidal, a music service that Jay-Z started and Beyoncé partly owns, announced a 1.5 million donation to the Black Lives Matter movement and other social justice groups. Beyoncé was always political, because she had to be, says The Root's Belton. \\"What if I told you that to be black in a public space, with all eyes on you and choosing carefully how to handle that spotlight is a form of politics, a negotiation between the self and the world that all black people must make?\\" The video ends with the police car sinking into the water, Beyoncé lying on top. That ending is a \\"celebration of the margins,\\" writes Zandria F. Robinson on New South Negress. \\"Black bodies in motion, women's voices centered, black queer voices centered — is what ultimately vanquishes the state, represented by a NOPD car. Beyoncé as the conjured every-southern-black-woman, slays atop the car and uses the weight of her body to finish it off, sacrificing herself in the process.\\" Zandria F. Robinson reads from her piece on New South Negress 3:31 The timing of the song's release, just before her performance at the Super Bowl, is also \\"not insignificant,\\" writes The New York Times' Wortham. \\"She's electing to parade her substantial wealth and ability to outearn most men in the music industry (including her husband, Jay Z) during the Super Bowl — the flagship event of male virility and violence in this country.\\" ||||| Photo: TIMOTHY A. CLARY/AFP/Getty Images I’m sure I’m not the only one for whom a question infinitely more pressing than “Broncos or Panthers?” was “Will she play it or won’t she?” As everyone and your football-loving grandfather now knows, yesterday afternoon Beyoncé stopped the world and dropped the gloriously provocative, instantly iconic video for her new single, “Formation,” the most explicitly political work she’s released to date. The visuals are timely and stirring: A dancing, hoodie-clad black boy commands a line of riot-geared police officers to put their hands up; Beyoncé double-flips the bird in an image that makes me want Alejandro Jodorowsky to direct a remake of Gone With the Wind; and in the powerful final scene, Bey, proud daughter of the American South (“My daddy Alabama, my ma Louisiana”), sinks atop a cop car into Katrina’s murky waters. I was afraid she wouldn’t play this song. That she’d take a more conservative route in the face of an organization that has banned or fined women of color for stepping out of line. I prepared myself for the disappointing possibility that she might just show up to do a cameo for that truly inexplicable Coldplay duet, do a few “Single Ladies” moves, and go collect her check. But now I must ask for forgiveness for doubting the Queen even for a second, because not only did she play “Formation,” she fearlessly led a squad of women dressed as Black Panthers across the field at the goddamned Super Bowl, all while dressed like the democratically elected ruler of Rhythm Nation. New plan: If Trump gets elected, I’m not moving to Canada — I’m moving to Beyoncé’s utopia. This motley hodgepodge of a Pepsi-sponsored Super Bowl Halftime Show had a theme, senior-prom-style, and that theme was “Past, Present, and Future.” Those three words do literally nothing to explain what Coldplay, Bruno Mars, and Beyoncé were doing on a stage together, save for throwing some gentle shade at Coldplay’s tired old Sgt. Pepper–does–Mardi Gras aesthetic. But I’ll go easy on the Fab Adequate Four, who took the stage first. The internet’s inevitable deluge of Coldplay-snark felt excessive; their performance was spirited and benignly feel-good, even if I am not exactly seeking out a copy of Chris Martin’s isolated vocal track. But the exuberant and anthemic quality of “Viva La Vida” worked in a context like this, and their disco-tinged recent single “Adventure of a Lifetime” suitably sustained the energy. Chris Martin seemed happy to be there and also seemed to be getting a great cardiovascular workout, complete with many squats. Were the children watching at home more scandalized by Janet Jackson’s boob or M.I.A.’s middle finger than they were by almost seeing Chris Martin’s butt crack? Only time will tell. Then the preternaturally suave Bruno Mars came out in an expertly tailored Missy Elliott garbage bag and did a kind of B-Boy remix of “Uptown Funk.” Was this supposed to represent “the Past”? Or was this “the Present,” and considered an homage to the “this sick beat” part in Taylor Swift’s “Shake It Off” video? (I kid!) This was the precise moment I stopped asking questions about the performance’s theme, and also the precise moment I went back on my words that I would never tire of hearing “Uptown Funk.” Beyoncé’s performance of “Formation” was a welcome gust of now-ness and relevance in a show so often bogged down with Greatest Hits montages and (see above) played-to-death radio smashes we never needed to hear again. Has anyone ever used the Super Bowl Halftime Show as a showcase for a song they released yesterday? The whole thing was a display of Beyoncé’s unimpeachable confidence in her own cultural influence and artistic vision, and the contrast of Coldplay and Bruno Mars emphasized just how radical that vision really is. Would the show have been more entertaining and thematically coherent if Beyoncé had been given the whole 15 minutes? Of course. But something about the contrast between the performers and her casual domination of that shared stage actually asserted her singularity in the pop landscape more dramatically than she might have on her own. There it was, plain to see for 100 million people: Chris Martin is left shark. Bruno Mars is right shark. Beyoncé is the nucleus. After “Formation,” the performance inexplicably turned into an “In Memorium” montage set to the soaring strains of one of Coldplay’s best songs, “Fix You.” Sure, why not. Coldplay’s music has a kind of one-size-fits-all grandeur about it, so this audiovisual pairing made as much sense as any. “Fix You” on the jukebox at 3 a.m.? If you insist. “Fix You” at your bar mitzvah? Not mad. But Coldplay’s aural vagueness only served to put the precision of Beyoncé’s message into harsher relief. Sure, in the midst of the nation’s continued racial tensions, Coldplay’s fuzzy message that everything will be okay if we just (hold your cards high, audience) “BELIEVE IN LOVE” might have struck some as tone-deaf and silly. But Beyoncé, on the other hand, didn’t need to say it. Her song, her staging, her slaying delivered a harder-won message loud and clear. As the crowd roared, we still did not get our answer to that other pressing question: “Yeah but why’s she here again?” And then we did: An ad for her just-announced Formation World Tour ran in one of the televisual year’s most sought-after commercial slots. You could almost see the ripple of lightbulbs going off across the globe: Beyoncé, that Black Bill Gates in the Making, basically just got paid to run an ad at the Super Bowl. It felt, elegantly, like an echo of that last line of “Formation”: “Always stay gracious, best revenge is your paper.” ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"Beyoncé dominated the Super Bowl 50 halftime show with an explosive performance of her new single, \\"Formation.\\" The song, released only a day before the event, has been widely praised as a celebration of black American culture and identity.

Article:The rules say that blocking the cash is only possible if 25% of the parliament's 751 MEPs, from at least three political groups, request it. Critics call the Alliance for Peace and Freedom (APF) a \\"neo-Nazi\\" movement. German MEP Manfred Weber, head of the main centre-right group, is one of those who wants the funding stopped. The European Parliament's records from January show €400,000 granted to the APF and €197,625 to an APF foundation, called Europa Terra Nostra. The APF was launched in 2015. Its deputy chairman is Nick Griffin, formerly an MEP who led the British National Party (BNP). An Italian veteran of the far-right, Roberto Fiore, chairs the alliance. He was convicted in absentia in 1985 for links to NAR, a fascist group blamed over the 1980 Bologna train station bombing, which killed 85 people. He now leads a party called Forza Nuova (New Force). Another deputy to Mr Fiore is Artemis Matthaiopoulos from Greece's Golden Dawn, an anti-immigrant party which sports Nazi-style symbols. Party members have been accused of serious crimes including murder, and some went on trial last year. The APF also embraces the German National Democratic Party (NPD), whose leader Udo Voigt is an MEP. Germany's Constitutional Court is considering whether to ban the NPD. Nationalist surge challenges Europe A source at the parliament told the BBC that grants to European parties were usually transferred at the end of March, and \\"should money have been paid unduly, it will need to be reimbursed\\". If enough MEPs object, a parliamentary committee will assess whether the APF acts in accordance with EU principles, namely \\"liberty, democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and the rule of law\\". As head of the powerful European People's Party (EPP) group Manfred Weber should be able to get the required 25% of MEPs united against the grant, the source said. Last month Mr Weber wrote to other parliamentary group leaders and Parliament President Martin Schulz, saying there should be no such EU support for \\"some of the most radical and militant right-wing extremist parties\\". Similar complaints against the APF were made by MEPs Marita Ulvskog (Sweden) and Daniele Viotti (Italy). In its programme the APF says it stands for \\"promoting our common Christian values\\" and giving a voice to citizens who are \\"alienated from the democratic process\\" in the EU. The APF has forged links with officials close to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and has condemned Nato, alleging that Western politicians are fomenting \\"Russophobia\\". The far-right grouping expressed solidarity with Serbian nationalists commemorating the 1999 Nato bombing of Serbia. \\"The memories of the many innocent victims of Nato missiles and of the Islamist death squads of Albanians and Arab Jihadis in Kosovo are still raw,\\" it said on Facebook. Mr Griffin, who was expelled by the BNP in 2014, argues that Western leaders are fulfilling a \\"neo-con/Zionist\\" agenda, which helps Israel.

He'd take the liberty to hide my backpack, borrow my books without consent, doodle scandalous stuff on my notebooks with a pen and yada yada. So one day, I was showing this cool trick I learned on an anatomy program on the TV to a couple of classmates who used to sit around me. The thing was that you can't flex your ring finger upwards if you put your middle finger under the palm (try that) We were all kids, and soon everyone in the class started staring at us weirdos looking laughing at out hands. The bully noticed it too, and came near to inquire about this hand stuff. I described the trick and he was impressed. And then, I saw our teacher walking up the corridor, just a couple paces behind the class door. So, I asked him (the bully) if he wanted to see another trick and to that he nodded a big yes. Cool, What I did was, that I grabbed his right arm by the thumb and put it on my throat right above the larynx. Then I quickly shifted my grip to his wrist. He without batting an eye, asked what I was doing, but then I started beating the desk with my other hand and made squeaking noises while pushing his hand against my throat harder with every turning head. And voilà! Every one in the class (including the teacher) thought he was smothering me. After a few ifs and buts between him and the teacher, he was summoned at the principal’s chambers, from where, later he was sent home, where presumably judging from the look on his face for the next few days, he was beat to crap by his folks.

Scott Walker’s anti-public employee union proposals, are walking back reports in the Wall Street Journal that they plan to return to the state. “We are now looking at returning to the state capitol and requiring the senators to take a vote and have them declare who they’re with — the workers or the governor,” Minority Leader Mark Miller told the Journal. A return to Wisconsin at this juncture would appear to give the green light for Walker’s legislation to pass — that is, a win for Walker’s efforts to pass legislation when numerous polls show the state disapproving of Walker, and saying he should compromise. However, at this juncture it is unclear just what is going on. In response, Miller spokesman Mike Browne released this statement, saying only that they were continuing to negotiate towards an outcome that does not strip the bargaining rights of state workers: “It is true that negotiations were dealt a setback since last Thursday when Governor Walker responded to a sincere Democratic compromise offer with a press conference. However, Senate Democrats have continued to reach out to the Governor and Republicans through the weekend. Democrats remain hopeful that Governor Walker and legislative Republicans will, in the near future, listen to the overwhelming majority of Wisconsinites who believe they should come to the negotiating table in good faith to reach an agreement that resolves our fiscal issues without taking away worker rights and without hurting programs that help provide health insurance for working families and prescription drugs for seniors.” In addition, state Sen. Chris Larson released this statement: Sen. Miller’s comments are taken out of context in the Wall Street Journal article just released. Dems will return when collective bargaining is off the table. That could be soon based on the growing public opposition to the bill and the recall efforts against Republicans. Unfortunately, the WSJ fished for the quote they wanted, skipping this key step in logic: we won’t come back until worker’s rights are preserved. State Sen. Jon Erpenbach also told WisPolitics that Democrats are not planning to return. State Sen. Bob Jauch, who has been one of the lead negotiators, also said of Miller’s comments: “I think he’s speaking the truth that at some point - and I don’t know when soon is - at some point we have to say we’ve done all we can.” ||||| CHICAGO — More than two weeks after Wisconsin lawmakers split over a bill that would vastly curtail collective bargaining for public workers, even negotiations over the negotiations have become matters of division, fury and dueling public critiques. Scott Fitzgerald, the Republican leader in Wisconsin’s Senate, described the progress of talks with 14 Senate Democrats who left the state last month to block a vote on the bill as “negotiating with Jell-O.” And in a letter about the talks to his Democratic counterpart, Mr. Fitzgerald questioned his colleague’s “grasp of reality.” Chris Larson, one of the Senate Democrats, accused Mr. Fitzgerald and Gov. Scott Walker, the Republican who proposed the measure, of misleading the public, trying to shift blame to the Democrats, and “throwing people who were negotiating in earnest under the bus.” And it was only Monday. While those on both sides of Wisconsin’s partisan split over collective bargaining rights say they have in recent days engaged in private discussions over the matter, little progress toward compromise has emerged. If anything, the Republicans and Democrats in Wisconsin appeared further apart than ever over a matter that has eclipsed all other work in the state Capitol and become the most visible in a series of such battles in statehouses around the country. Photo That said, at least two Democrats said that an end to the standoff in Wisconsin may be drawing near, even if it means returning to the state and allowing a vote to take place on an unchanged and, in their view, unacceptable measure to cut collective bargaining rights — a measure that is expected to pass in the Republican-dominated State Senate once a quorum is met. “You reach a point where you say, ‘If our goal was to enlighten the public, we’ve done it,’ ” Bob Jauch, one of the missing Democrats who took part in negotiations as recently as Sunday, said on Monday evening. “There’s a time — and the time seems to be drawing near — where our usefulness is wearing thin.” Timothy Cullen, another of the Senate Democrats, said, “This is a movement that’s bigger than us, so it’s time to go home and debate and make the case on other issues.” Photo Other Senate Democrats said on Monday that they were still determined that the collective bargaining cuts in Mr. Walker’s plan be rewritten. A spokesman for Mark Miller, the Senate Democratic leader, said that no final decision had been made about how soon to return to Wisconsin. “They meet every day,” the spokesman, Mike Browne, said, “and they discuss how to get back.” Most of Indiana’s House Democrats remained at a motel in Illinois on Monday, having also left their state last month to prevent a quorum on legislation related to collective bargaining rights and education. Continue reading the main story Video In Ohio, the Republican-dominated House is expected later this week to give final approval to legislation to cut collective bargaining rights for public sector workers by banning strikes and placing the power of breaking labor impasses in the hands of local officials. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Advertisement Continue reading the main story But in Wisconsin, where November’s election brought one of the most significant flips from Democrats to Republicans, a week of negotiations clearly had fallen apart by Monday, and blame was being spread everywhere. The opposing sides traded pointed letters, which they shared with the news media. They traded conflicting versions of who had tried to talk to whom about what. By midday on Monday, Mr. Walker, who has been governor since January, described an early-morning request from Mr. Miller, the leader of the Senate Democrats, for a resumption of discussions somewhere near the Wisconsin-Illinois border as “ridiculous.” At a news conference where he was flanked by Senator Fitzgerald and Jeff Fitzgerald, the Republican speaker of the State Assembly (and the brother of Senator Fitzgerald), Governor Walker described to reporters his view of negotiations in recent days. After talks last Wednesday with several Democrats at a McDonald’s in Kenosha, not far from the Illinois border, Mr. Walker’s aides had been buoyed by the possibility of a substantive deal, Mr. Walker said, only to have Mr. Miller “firmly standing in the way.” The Republicans said that the Democrats were divided over the negotiations, and that leadership was murky at best. The Democrats, meanwhile, said Governor Walker had shown little real interest in shifting from his position that curtailing collective bargaining was needed to solve the state’s budget woes. Mr. Walker’s proposal would make changes to most public sector unions, limiting collective bargaining only to matters of wages and limiting raises to the Consumer Price Index. The Democrats left the state on Feb. 17, the day that a Senate vote was expected on Mr. Walker’s measure. ||||| Playing a game of political chicken, Democratic senators who fled Wisconsin to stymie restrictions on public-employee unions said Sunday they planned to come back from exile soon, betting that even though their return will allow the bill to pass, the curbs are so unpopular they'll taint the state's Republican governor and legislators. The Republicans rejected the idea that the legislation would hurt the GOP. \\"If you think this is a bad bill for Republicans, why didn't you stand up in the chamber and debate us about it three weeks ago?\\" said Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald. \\"People think it's absolutely ridiculous that these 14 senators have not been in Wisconsin for three weeks.\\" Getty Images Protests continued Sunday at the state capitol in Madison. The Wisconsin standoff, which drew thousands of demonstrators to occupy the capitol in Madison for days at a time, has come to highlight efforts in other states to address budget problems in part by limiting the powers and benefits accorded public-sector unions. Sen. Mark Miller said he and his fellow Democrats intend to let the full Senate vote on Gov. Scott Walker's \\"budget-repair\\" bill, which includes the proposed limits on public unions' collective-bargaining rights. The bill, which had been blocked because the missing Democrats were needed for the Senate to have enough members present to vote on it, is expected to pass the Republican-controlled chamber. He said he thinks recent polls showing voter discontent with Mr. Walker over limits on bargaining rights have been \\"disastrous\\" for the governor and Republicans and give Democrats more leverage to seek changes in a broader two-year budget bill Mr. Walker proposed Tuesday. In a letter sent Monday, Mr. Miller asked Messrs. Walker and Fitzgerald for an in-person meeting somewhere near the Wisconsin-Illinois border. Before Sunday's developments, Mr. Walker said he wouldn't be swayed by the polls. \\"If I governed by polls I'd still be in the state Assembly,\\" Mr. Walker said on Friday. \\"I won reelection twice as county executive in an area of the state that went two-thirds for President Obama by identifying a problem, telling people how I was going to deal with it, and then moving forward with the solution.\\" Chris Schrimpf, a spokesman for the governor, said Sunday that Mr. Walker \\"looks forward to the Senate Democrats returning as soon as possible.\\" Mr. Fitzgerald, the majority leader, said Sunday that the \\"budget repair\\" bill can't be amended at this point. But it's possible that over the next few weeks adjustments could be made to Mr. Walker's broader budget plan, he said. \\"This bill will pass. The collective-bargaining piece has to pass. If it doesn't the governor's budget doesn't work,\\" he said.

Video courtesy of NewsCore. Mr. Miller declined to say how soon the Democratic senators, who left for Illinois on Feb. 17, would return. He said the group needed to address several issues first—including the resolution Senate Republicans passed last week that holds the Democrats in contempt and orders police to detain them when they return to Wisconsin. Amid the public demonstrations and Democratic walk-out, the two sides have been negotiating. Mr. Fitzgerald said the governor is negotiating through two staff members with two Democrats, Sen. Bob Jauch and Sen. Tim Cullen. And last week, Mr. Fitzgerald met ago with Mr. Jauch and another Democrat in Kenosha. Mr. Jauch said some people have suggested the lawmakers remain in Illinois for months while recall efforts of Republican senators proceed. He said that would be difficult for one senator who is seven months pregnant. \\"I think we have to realize that there's only so much we can do as a group to make a stand,\\" Mr. Jauch said. \\"It's really up to the public to be engaged in carrying the torch on this issue.\\" Brad Lutes, president of a local teachers union in Sun Prairie, Wis., said having Democrats return without getting bargaining curbs removed from the bill \\"would hurt,\\" but added, \\"I think they've done an awful lot being out as long as they have. It's really given the people of Wisconsin an opportunity to see both sides of an issue.\\" Protesters were allowed back inside the Captiol Friday, but with some strict rules. Video courtesy of Fox Television Stations. Mr. Walker's bill would prohibit bargaining over health care and pensions for about 170,000 public employees in the state and would allow public employees to opt out of paying dues or belonging to a union. The bill also would end the automatic collection of dues by the state, and require that every public-employee union get recertified to represent workers through an annual election. Mr. Miller said the Democrats also want to fight Mr. Walker's recently announced two-year budget plan, which cuts spending by 4.2 billion, or 6.7%, including 1.25 billion less in state aid to schools and local governments. As the standoff in Wisconsin has dragged on, several polls showed majorities of Wisconsin voters disapproving of Mr. Walker's plan as it affects public employees. At the same time, the governor maintains strong support among Republicans. He also has significant backing from voters for his plan to have union members pay more out of their salaries toward their pensions and health care. A poll released Friday by Rasmussen Reports, based on a phone survey conducted March 2 of 800 likely Wisconsin voters, found 52% of them opposed weakening collective-bargaining rights, while 39% were in favor. When asked whether state workers should take a 10% pay cut—roughly the equivalent of the governor's plan—44% supported the move and 38% were opposed. A poll by the Wisconsin Policy Research Institute, which calls itself the state's \\"free-market think tank,\\" showed that more voters, particularly independents, disapproved of the governor than in a similar survey by the institute in November. Republican voters' support remained basically unchanged from the fall. The poll was based on phone interviews of 603 Wisconsin residents and conducted Feb. 27-March 1. Both polls had a margin of error of 4 percentage points. WSJ/NBC News Poll Poll Shows Budget-Cuts Dilemma The results of both polls were echoed in a recent poll by The Wall Street Journal / NBC News, which found that 62% of Americans oppose efforts to strip unionized government workers of their rights to collectively bargain, even as they want public employees to contribute more money to their retirement and health-care benefits. The poll was based on nationwide telephone interviews of 1,000 adults, conducted from Feb. 24-28, by the polling organizations of Peter D. Hart and Bill McInturff. Mark Jefferson, head of the Wisconsin GOP, said polls reflected the big campaign unions have launched in the state. \\"The millions of dollars in national union money for advertising have been effective at getting the union message out,\\" he said. He said even after Mr. Walker's plan is passed, the state's public workers will still have more collective-bargaining rights than most federal workers, who can bargain over working conditions but not pay and benefits. Several big public-sector unions in Wisconsin have already said they would agree to fiscal concessions in Mr. Walker's bill, including contributing 5.8% out of their pay to pensions and 12.6% of healthcare premiums out of their wages, up from 6% on average today. But they object to ending bargaining rights and other changes.

Context: The frenetic lifestyle that many people live today is very harmful. Rushing here and there, being constantly on call, balancing multiple layers of responsibility may give you a sense of accomplishment – even make you feel important, but it takes a huge toll on every aspect of life. When you constantly push yourself to take on more and more challenges, it is easy to lose sight of why you wanted to be successful in the first place. For many, the reason was to be able to spend less time working and enjoy life more. A frenetic, high-pressure lifestyle creates exactly the opposite. There is a very dark side to constantly pushing yourself to produce more and more. Unfortunately, it creeps up on you and becomes a serious case of self-negligence. When you are busy and driven every minute of every day and well into the evening, it is easy to neglect important things in life that keep you healthy, happy, and create quality of life. A continual stream of urgent tasks that must be completed will overshadow the not-so-urgent, but important activities that make life worth living. It is not just physical well-being that is neglected – mental and emotional well-being also suffer when there is no time for self-care. When your daily schedule is crammed to overflowing one of the first areas of neglect is your diet. Eating regular, nutritious meals become a thing of the past. You are not only too busy to sleep or even take a deep breath now and then, there is no time to prepare decent meals Convenience foods, frozen dinners, take out and fast foods become the norm.

The left side of the equation is represented by the algebraic expression \\"-5 + 0.\\" 2. The right side of the equation is represented by the variable \\"p.\\" Our goal is to determine the value of p that satisfies the equation. Let's break down the left side of the equation: -5 is a negative integer that is located five units to the left of 0 on the number line. 0 is an integer and represents no value or the starting point on the number line. When we add 0 to any number, the value remains unchanged. In other words, the identity property of addition states that any number added to zero will result in that same number. Mathematically, this is represented as: n + 0 = n, where n represents any number. Now, let's apply this property to the given equation: -5 + 0 = p Since -5 is our value for n, we add zero to -5: -5 + 0 = -5 So, the equation becomes: -5 = p This result indicates that p is equal to -5, which means the solution for the given equation -5 + 0 = p is p = -5."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Summarize the following: A tent is the most common source of shelter used when camping. If you haven’t set up your tent before, set it up in your yard once or twice before you arrive at your campsite to get some practice. Tents come in many different sizes. If you’re camping alone, you could get a small, single-person tent. If you’re camping with someone else, get a tent that accommodates both of you. If you plan on going hiking or climbing during your camping trip, you’ll want a backpack. The size of the pack you decide to bring depends on how far you’ll be hiking. Longer, more intense hikes will require a larger and sturdier backpack, while easier day hikes will only require a small day pack. Backpacks are either frameless, or have an internal or external frame. Internal frame packs tend to be more expensive and sit flush against your back. External frame packs are more affordable and tend to provide more ventilation. However, they are bulkier than internal frame packs. Smaller day packs that don’t hold much are usually frameless. A sturdy rope has lots of uses when camping. You can use it as a clothesline, or cut it into various lengths in order to hang pots or bind your sleeping pad to your backpack. You'll want to store and coil your rope correctly when you pack it to avoid tangling. A tarp can provide additional protection for the bottom of your tent, or it can be stretched over your tent to keep it extra-dry. The size of the tarp you get depends on the size of your tent. The larger your tent, the larger the tarp you bring along. A battery-powered flashlight or headlamp is important for helping you find your way around your campsite after dark. Headlamps can be useful to complete tasks around your campsite, as your hands will be free. Be sure to pack extra batteries. You might also want to bring a battery-powered lantern. Collapsible camping chairs are perfect for sitting around the fire or just lounging around the campsite. The best camping chairs are lightweight and sold in specialty backpacking stores. If you’re camping with a group, advise each person in your party to bring a foldable camping chair of their own. Summary:","completion":"When camping, a tent is a crucial shelter, with sizes varying based on the number of campers. Practice setting up the tent beforehand. Backpacks are necessary for hiking, with size and type determined by hike length and intensity. Ropes serve multiple purposes, but proper storage is essential. Tarps add extra protection for tents, sized according to the tent. Flashlights or headlamps are vital for nighttime navigation, along with extra batteries. Collapsible camping chairs provide seating, each camper bringing their own lightweight chair."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

A young lady I met in the hospital cafeteria where I worked as a pharmacy intern (she was an X-ray tech) I asked out on a date. Would you like to follow me home? she asked. I said SURE! She got in her car, hit the freeway, went over the top of the hill..and was gone. I went 75 mph desperately trying to keep her tail lights in my line of sight while swerving in and out of traffic.

If Janet Guthrie wasn’t the first woman to drive in the Indy 500, she would have been. Over the years as she got older, collecting speeding tickets got old so she became a more responsible driver. I’m glad, because I had to help pay for those tickets over the last 30+ years we’ve been married. Glad I caught up to her that one night on the freeway. EDIT, AND BACKSTORY: She ate lunch with her X-ray tech coworkers. She left the table first and I approached the others and asked what was her name, the girl that just left. They told me, and about a half hour later called the radiology department from the pharmacy phone and asked for her. She said all the girls in the department were huddled around the phone and giggling while we talked. It’s the handsome blonde intern in the pharmacy, they told each other. Oh, you mean THAT one?!

Given the question: The U.S. State Department has asked American embassies and consulates around the world to identify certain groups that should get extra scrutiny when they apply for visas. A series of directives also instructs U.S. diplomatic posts overseas to review the social media accounts of visa applicants who are suspected of terrorist ties or of having been in Islamic State group-controlled areas. The diplomatic cables sent by Secretary of State Rex Tillerson directed embassies to convene security and intelligence working groups to determine criteria for \\"population sets\\" that would warrant increased scrutiny before traveling to the U.S. Even if the applicant otherwise qualifies for a visa, those identified as meeting the criteria would require additional scrutiny, leading to a possible visa denial. It is the first evidence of a plan for the \\"extreme vetting\\" of foreigners entering the United States that President Donald Trump promised during his campaign. The four cables sent between March 10 and March 17 do not define which groups would be considered among the \\"population sets\\" requiring more scrutiny. But in the first glimpse into what \\"extreme vetting\\" may look like under the Trump administration, one of Tillerson's memos would have added to the interview process questions about an applicant's workplaces, employers, addresses and travel history going back 15 years, as well as all email addresses and social media handles used in the last five years. The questions were withdrawn in a following memo, pending approval of the list by another federal agency. The directives, first reported by Reuters, quickly drew criticism from rights groups and others who've accused Trump of discriminating against Muslims through his now-suspended ban on travelers from six predominantly Muslim countries — Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. \\"These measures could provide license for discrimination based on national origin and religion,'' human rights group Amnesty International wrote in a letter to Tillerson on Thursday. \\"They...

The guidelines could be used to discriminate based on religion and/or national origin. Human rights groups are protesting the proposed guidelines for extreme vetting because they believe that these guidelines could be used to discriminate based on religion and/or national origin. The U.S. State Department's directives to identify certain groups for extra scrutiny when applying for visas and to review social media accounts of visa applicants suspected of terrorist ties or having been in Islamic State group-controlled areas have raised concerns among rights groups and critics. These critics, including Amnesty International, argue that the measures can potentially be used as a tool for discrimination based on national origin and religion. They also contend that these guidelines are discriminatory against Muslims, given that President Trump's travel ban, which has been suspended, targeted travelers from six predominantly Muslim countries - Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen. While the extreme vetting process proposed by the Trump administration includes questions about an applicant's workplaces, employers, addresses, and travel history going back 15 years and all email addresses and social media handles used in the last five years, these guidelines have not been cited as the main reasons behind the protests from human rights groups.

I was 16 when one morning, my father told me I could drive him into a remote village called Mijas, about 18 miles away, on the condition that I take the car in to be serviced(,) at a nearby garage. Having just learned to drive and hardly ever having the opportunity to use the car, I readily accepted. I drove Dad into Mijas and promised to pick him up at 4 p.m., then drove to a nearby garage and dropped off the car. Because I had a few hours to spare, I decided to catch a couple of movies at a theatre near the garage. However, I became so interested in the films that I didn't pay attention to the time. When the last movie had finished, I looked down at my watch. It was six o'clock. I was two hours late! I knew Dad would be angry if he found out I'd been watching movies. He'd never let me drive again. I decided to tell him that the car needed some repairs and that they had taken longer than had been expected. I drove up to the place where we had planned to meet and saw Dad waiting patiently on the corner. I apologized for being late and told him that I'd come as quickly as I could, but the car had needed some major repairs. I'll never forget the look he gave me. \\"I'm disappointed that you feel you have to lie to me, Jason.\\" \\"What do you mean? I'm telling the truth.\\" Dad looked at me again. \\"When you did not show up, I called the garage to ask if there were any problems, and they told me that you had not yet picked up the car. So you see, I know there were no problems with the car.\\" A feeling of guilt ran through me as I weakly confessed to my trip to the movie theatre and the real reason for my being late. Dad listened intently as a sadness passed through him. \\"I'm angry, not with you but with myself.

In the story, the father's reaction to his son's explanation was not anger directed at the son, but rather towards himself. He felt that he had failed as a father because he had raised a son who felt the need to lie to him. The father's disappointment in himself and his parenting shows his understanding that it's important to foster a trusting and open relationship with his child. Hearing his son's confession filled him with sadness, as he realized the weight of his responsibility in shaping his son's values and behavior. When the father expressed his feelings to his son, it showed the depth of their relationship and the importance of honesty and trust between them. By sharing his disappointment and choosing to walk home, the father allowed his son to observe the consequences of his actions and the impact lies can have on relationships.

More than 70 million military personnel, including 60 million Europeans, were mobilised in one of the largest wars in history. Over nine million combatants and seven million civilians died as a result of the war (including the victims of a number of genocides), a casualty rate exacerbated by the belligerents' technological and industrial sophistication, and the tactical stalemate caused by gruelling trench warfare. It was one of the deadliest conflicts in history, and paved the way for major political changes, including revolutions in many of the nations involved. - The United States Army Air Forces (USAAF or AAF) was the military aviation service of the United States of America during and immediately after World War II, successor to the United States Army Air Corps and the direct predecessor of the United States Air Force. The AAF were a component of the United States Army, which in 1942 was divided functionally by executive order into three autonomous forces: the Army Ground Forces, the Services of Supply (which in 1943 became the Army Service Forces), and the Army Air Forces. Each of these forces had a commanding general who reported directly to the Army Chief of Staff. - Aviation is the practical aspect or art of aeronautics, being the design, development, production, operation and use of aircraft, especially heavier than air aircraft.

On his way home he saw two balloons, balloon A and balloon B. Balloon A was flat, but balloon B was inflated. He was wondering how balloons go up so effortlessly. and a hint : Many people enjoy riding in hot air balloons. Some use them for romantic picnics and marriage proposals. Others race in competitions. Being above the earth gives a whole new perspective on the world around us. As the beginning of a hot air balloon ride, the balloon is flat because the pressure inside the balloon equals the pressure outside. When the air inside the balloon is heated, the speed of movement of those air molecules increases and the pressure goes up. After a while the balloon is completely expanded and the flight is ready to take off. Please answer this question : Which balloon is less likely to take off, balloon A or balloon B? A:","completion":"Balloon A is less likely to take off because it is flat. This indicates that the air pressure inside the balloon is equal to the pressure outside the balloon. In order for a hot air balloon to take off, the air inside needs to be heated, causing the air molecules to move faster, increasing the pressure inside the balloon. This makes the balloon expand and become buoyant, eventually lifting it into the air. Since balloon A is flat, it has not yet been heated and expanded, while balloon B is already inflated and likely closer to being ready for takeoff."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: It was the end of the school term and my son Tom had less than three months left before he would finish his six years at high school. During this time he had developed a love for basketball. Sadly, because of my work over the last twelve months, I had only been able to attend a few of his games; however, I was determined to get to his last game for the school term. Tom's team came out in the first 10 minutes with a burst of goals that saw them leading by just over 20 points at the end of the first half. The second half changed as the other team quickly played themselves back into the game. Tom's team started to miss an increasing number of shots. It was at that point that the coach called his first time out. The noise of the spectators became quiet as the coach spoke to them. He had the team standing in a half circle, but he squatted down, looking up at them and fiving some very calm and clear instructions on what they needed to do in the last couple of minutes. As he stood up to allow the team to return to the court, I saw him give some further words of encouragement to all of them. You could see that he knew that the team was fighting to save the game and that he needed to lift them up. By squatting down he placed himself in a position where he was talking up to them, rather than down or at them, and as the players went back onto the court his words of encouragement served to lift their energy and spirits. Well, Tom's team went on to win the final by 5 points. As I drove away I thought about what can happen to us all in our everyday life. One of my favourite quotes is about the half filled glass of water --- \\"Is it half full or is it half empty?\\" Like the coach, the answer to this quote all depends on how you look at things. Question: Why did the writer come to see his son play basketball? Options: A: Because his son would graduate from high school. B: Because he felt sorry for never watching his son play.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. If \\"One biker wearing a black helmet riding on a dirt hill.\\", does it logically follow that \\"A biker wearing an orange helmet rides in the grass.\\"?","completion":"The statement \\"One biker wearing a black helmet riding on a dirt hill\\" does not logically imply \\"A biker wearing an orange helmet rides in the grass.\\" It is important to analyze both statements individually and then establish their logical relationship if any: Statement 1: One biker wearing a black helmet riding on a dirt hill. This statement describes a specific scene. There is a single biker who is wearing a black helmet and is currently riding on a dirt hill. The information provided includes details about the biker's helmet color (black) as well as his/her location and activity (riding on a dirt hill). Statement 2: A biker wearing an orange helmet rides in the grass. This statement also describes a specific scene. In this case, there is a biker wearing an orange helmet and is riding in the grass. Similar to the first statement, this provides information about the biker's helmet color (orange), location, and activity (riding in the grass). Now, to determine if there is a logical relationship between these two statements, we should consider if Statement 2 is a direct or indirect consequence of Statement 1, or if they are mutually exclusive or independent. Direct Consequence: Statement 2 would be a direct consequence of Statement 1 if the information in Statement 1 leads us to conclude that Statement 2 must also be true. In this case, there is no clear cause-and-effect relationship between the two statements, and Statement 2 is not a direct consequence of Statement 1. Indirect Consequence: Statement 2 would be an indirect consequence of Statement 1 if a combination of additional information (including background knowledge) and Statement 1 leads us to conclude that Statement 2 is true. In this case, the two statements describe two distinct scenes, both involving bikers wearing different helmet colors and riding in different locations. There is no information in the first statement that suggests that it would lead to the second statement or vice versa. Mutually Exclusive: The two statements would be mutually exclusive if the truth of one statement would imply the falsity of the other. However, the two statements describe different bikers, as indicated by the different helmet colors, so the truth of one statement doesn't necessarily mean that the other is false. Therefore, the statements are not mutually exclusive. Independent: Finally, the two statements can be considered independent if the truth or falsity of one statement has no effect on the other statement's validity. In this case, both statements involve bikers who are wearing different helmet colors and riding in different places. Each statement describes its scene without any specific relationship between the two. Therefore, they can be viewed as independent statements. In conclusion, the statement \\"One biker wearing a black helmet riding on a dirt hill\\" does not logically imply \\"A biker wearing an orange helmet rides in the grass.\\" The two statements appear to be independent, describing different individuals wearing different helmet colors, participating in separate activities in different locations. There is no direct or indirect constraint between them, and they are not mutually exclusive."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Now, regarding the difference between bhajans and kirtans: Bhajans and kirtans are similar but not the same. They are both religious musical performances from the Indian subcontinent, primarily used in Hindu worship practices. However, they vary in their structure and manner of performance. 1. Bhajans are devotional songs that usually convey a spiritual message or theme. They are sung traditionally in a group setting or individually. The emphasis in bhajans is on the lyrics and the emotions they evoke. Bhajans often include a chorus and verses, and may come from a large variety of sources, like poems, ancient scriptures, or the works of saint-poets. 2. Kirtans, on the other hand, follow a call-and-response format. A lead singer or group will sing a part of the song, and the congregation or audience will respond by repeating that line or verse. Kirtans are usually more lively, and often involve the use of musical instruments and dancing. They are an interactive way of connecting with the divine through song and music.

Today's Swiss Mennonite Conference can be traced to the Swiss Brethren. - In the Christian gospels, the ministry of Jesus begins with his baptism in the countryside of Roman Judea and Transjordan, near the river Jordan, and ends in Jerusalem, following the Last Supper with his disciples. The Gospel of Luke states that Jesus was \\"about 30 years of age\\" at the start of his ministry. A chronology of Jesus typically has the date of the start of his ministry estimated at around AD 2729 and the end in the range AD 3036. Jesus' \\"Early Galilean ministry\\" begins when after his Baptism, he goes back to Galilee from his time in the Judean desert. In this early period he preaches around Galilee and recruits his first disciples who begin to travel with him and eventually form the core of the early Church as it is believed that the Apostles dispersed from Jerusalem to found the Apostolic Sees. The \\"Major Galilean ministry\\" which begins in Matthew 8 includes the commissioning of the Twelve Apostles, and covers most of the ministry of Jesus in Galilee. The \\"Final Galilean ministry\\" begins after the death of John the Baptist as Jesus prepares to go to Jerusalem. - The Mennonites are Christian groups belonging to the church communities of Anabaptist denominations named after Menno Simons (14961561) of Friesland (which today is a province of the Netherlands). Through his writings, Simons articulated and formalized the teachings of earlier Swiss founders. The early teachings of the Mennonites were founded on the belief in both the mission and ministry of Jesus, which the original Anabaptist followers held to with great conviction despite persecution by the various Roman Catholic and Protestant states. Rather than fight, the majority of these followers survived by fleeing to neighboring states where ruling families were tolerant of their radical belief in believer's baptism.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. BRIDGEPORT, Conn. --A missing Connecticut man texted his son the day he vanished that he was worried about being set up for murder, according to a criminal complaint obtained by 48 Hours' Crimesider charging the son with a federal gun offense. Fifty-six-year-old Jeffrey Navin and his wife, 55-year-old Jeanette Navin of Easton haven't been seen since Aug. 4, and the mystery of their disappearance has garnered national headlines. Their car was found in a commuter lot off the Merritt Parkway in Westport Aug. 9 by state troopers, according to Connecticut State Police, reportedly with a smashed window. Police said they learned that the couple owed more than 2 million, much of it tied to a home in Guilford. But relatives have denied that the debt was related to their disappearance. Searches of landfills in the area have turned up no trace of human remains. Their son Kyle Navin, 27, appeared in federal court in Bridgeport Monday afternoon on a charge of possession of a firearm by an individual who is an unlawful user of or addicted to any controlled substance. Kyle Navin was questioned by investigators following his parents' disappearance, and state police spent hours searching his Bridgeport home, reported CBS affiliate WFSB. Police have called him a \\"person of interest\\" in the case, according to the station. He has not been charged in connection to the disappearance. A federal affidavit in support of the gun charge reveals new details about the last known activities of Jeanette and Jeffrey Navin and Kyle Navin's statements to investigators, some of which allegedly don't match evidence collected by investigators. It also details items uncovered during the search of Kyle Navin's home -- allegedly including two firearms, numerous rounds of ammunition, prescription bottles for Xanax and Oxycodone, hypodermic needles and glassine bags with apparent heroin residue -- and outlines cell phone records. According to the complaint, released by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Connecticut, Kyle and Jeffrey Navin exchanged text messages between 11:40 a.m. and 1:14 p.m. on the day Jeffrey and his wife disappeared. Jeffrey Navin allegedly texted his son, \\"I'm not going home till I know mom is okay\\" and \\"Did you hurt mom?\\" to which the younger Navin replied, \\"No absolutely not. Why would you think\\" Jeffrey Navin allegedly texted back, \\"I go home and get framed for murder\\" and \\"I'm going to the police first.\\" Later, according to the complaint, the elder Navin texted his son, \\"UR setting me up.\\" The exchange stands in contrast to the younger Navin's statement to investigators that he only discussed work with his father the day he disappeared, the complaint alleges. Kyle Navin worked for the family business, J & J Refuse, a Westport-based trash removal and recycling collection service. The company's website listed Jeffrey Navin as the president and Kyle Navin as its operations manager. The couple was reported missing Aug. 7 by Jeffrey Navin's brother William, who co-owns the refuse company, according to the complaint. William Navin told Easton Police Jeffrey Navin hadn't shown up for work, which was unusual, he said, because he never missed work without making arrangements to have his refuse pickup route covered. According to the complaint, Kyle Navin was interviewed by law enforcement three times -- on Aug. 9 and Aug. 11 at the Easton Police Department and Aug. 13 at the Connecticut State Police barracks in Bridgeport. He allegedly told investigators on Aug. 9 that he last spoke with his father \\"sometime around noon\\" Aug. 4 when his father called to ask about a new customer. He said his parents often went away on short trips, but acknowledged it was unusual for his father to miss work. On Aug. 11, Kyle Navin allegedly told investigators that he met his mother on the morning of Aug. 4, at the park and ride near Exit 42 on the Merritt Parkway, and that his mother got into his garbage truck and they collected refuse along his usual route. He said his back started hurting between 9 a.m. and 9:30 a.m., so he called his father and arranged to meet him at a nursery, where his mother got into his father's truck around 10:30 a.m, according to the complaint. Kyle Navin said he drove back to his home in Bridgeport and remained there until around 12:30, when he drove to his parents' home in Easton to pick up a paycheck his father had left taped to the door before returning to Bridgeport. He allegedly said he spent the next three days at his home because of his back injury. Interviewed again at the state police barracks on Aug. 13, Kyle Navin repeated the story, but this time also told investigators that he returned to his home around 9:20 a.m. Aug. 4 with his mother. He allegedly said he needed to pick up paperwork delineating his refuse route for his mother, because he had asked her to complete his route for the day. Kyle Navin \\"denied discussing any issue related to his mother or her safety\\" on the phone with his father that day, according to the complaint. Jeanette Navin's cellphone last registered at a cell tower near her son's home at 9:20 a.m. Aug. 4, according to the complaint -- her husband's last call was placed the same day around 1:23 p.m. and accessed the same cell tower. At both times, Kyle Navin's phone also pinged off the same cell tower, the complaint says. Investigators also outline an interview with Kyle Navin's girlfriend, who allegedly told them Kyle asked her to follow him in her car to his parents' house in Easton as Kyle drove his father's truck. The woman said Kyle parked his father's car at the Easton house and the two returned to Bridgeport together in her car. The movement of the two vehicles was captured on security cameras, according to the complaint. In searching Kyle Navin's home based on the cell records and surveillance footage, the complaint says investigators uncovered a Home Depot receipt issued Aug. 5 indicating Kyle Navin purchased \\"germicidal bleach, hair/grease drain opener, 'Goo Gone' stain remover and contractor cleanup bags.\\" In a search of his cellphone, investigators uncovered texts between Kyle Navin and his girlfriend about doing drugs, the complaint alleges. When investigators asked the woman about guns uncovered in the home, she allegedly told investigators Kyle \\"really likes his gun\\" and carries it often. Investigators interviewed an unidentified person who appeared to be contacting Kyle Navin in order to buy Oxycodone, according to the complaint -- Kyle allegedly told the person Aug. 5 \\"he was dealing with a lot of family issues and that it looked like his parents were missing,\\" though he told police he first learned of the disappearance from his uncle Aug. 6. Reached by phone Tuesday, Kyle Navin's lawyer Eugene Riccio had no comment on the allegations outlined in the complaint. He said his client is in federal custody and a detention hearing will be set for later in the week. The federal gun charge carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Connecticut. Kyle Navin hasn't yet entered a plea, Riccio said. ||||| Kyle Navin, the son of the Easton couple who have been missing since Aug. 4, is being held on federal gun charges after his arrest Tuesday, and startling new details found in the arrest affidavit further deepen the mystery surrounding his parents' disappearance. Navin was detained after appearing in U.S. District Court in Bridgeport. He was charged with possession of a firearm by an individual who is an unlawful user of, or addicted to, a controlled substance. In an Aug. 4 text-message conversation, detailed in a 15-page FBI arrest warrant, Navin's father, Jeffrey, asked his son if he hurt his mother, Jeanette Navin. This is part of the conversation between Kyle Navin, 27, and his father that investigators found on Kyle's phone: 12:39 p.m., Jeffrey: I'm not going home till I know mom is okay. 12:42 p.m., Jeffrey: Did you hurt mom? 12:43 p.m., Kyle: No absolutely not. Why would you think 12:44 p.m., Jeffrey: I go home and get framed for murder 12:45 p.m., Kyle: Oh stop 12:48 p.m., Jeffrey: I'm going to the police first 12:50 p.m., Kyle: Ok and reason being? 12:57 p.m., Jeffrey: U R setting me up 12:58 p.m., Kyle: Dad really what are you talking about? Kyle Navin has not been charged in his parents' disappearance. Navin's lawyer declined comment after the court appearance. The affidavit says the text conversation between Kyle and Jeffrey Navin led investigators to search Kyle Navin's Bridgeport home. It then details the findings of drugs, weapons and ammunition at the home. In addition, police discovered a receipt from Home Depot that was issued on Aug. 5 at 8:36 p.m. The receipt showed that Kyle Navin purchased germicidal bleach, hair and grease drain opener, Goo Gone stain remover and contractor cleanup bags.

Riccio, the lawyer for Kyle Navin, the son of the missing Easton couple, was seen leaving court Tuesday after defending Navin on gun charges. See more videos Written by FBI Special Agent Michael Zuk, the affidavit also states that \\"the cell phone activity and text messages between (Kyle) Navin and Jeffrey (Navin) on August 4, 2015 do not accord with (Kyle) Navin's statements to law enforcement.\\" Investigators have examined the cellphone records of all three Navins. They determined that the last time Jeanette's phone was used was at 9:20 a.m. on Aug. 4 near Park Avenue in Bridgeport. The last time Jeffrey's cellphone was turned on was 1:23 p.m. on the same day from the same area in Bridgeport, records show. On Aug. 4, the affidavit states, security cameras in Easton captured a video of someone driving Jeffrey's garbage truck on Center Road. The camera caught Kyle Navin's girlfriend's vehicle following closely behind the truck. Approximately 29 minutes later the same video camera showed the girlfriend driving the opposite way on Center Road away from the Navins' house. Jeffrey's garbage truck was found at the house when police went there on Aug. 7, the document indicates. When state police interviewed the girlfriend she initially \\"lied,\\" until confronted with the video, the affidavit said. She then admitted to following Kyle Navin back to his parents' house and giving him a ride home to Bridgeport. The affidavit said the girlfriend \\"could offer no reason as to why or how Jeffrey's truck came to be in Bridgeport or why Kyle Navin needed to drive it back to Easton.\\" Jeffrey Navin is the president of J&J Refuse in Westport. Jeanette Navin works for the Weston school system. Kyle Navin works for the refuse company. Jeffrey's truck was found near Exit 42 off the Merritt Parkway in Westport by a state police trooper on routine patrol on Aug. 9. The passenger's side window was smashed and police found a \\"physiological fluid\\" on the floor mat, police sources have said. On Aug. 9, according to the affidavit, Kyle Navin told investigators he last saw his parents on Aug. 4 at work. Two days later, the document says, Kyle Navin again spoke with investigators. \\"This time\\" he told investigators he met his mother at a parking lot near Exit 42, the document states. He said his mother got into his garbage truck and \\"that he and his mother went to collect garbage along his usual route.\\" He told investigators he dropped his mother off at a nursery near the exit where they met his father. Jeanette Navin got into Jeffrey Navin's truck at that point, Kyle Navin told investigators. Kyle Navin told investigators he went to his Bridgeport home before driving to his parent's home in Easton to pick up his paycheck, which his father taped to the door. He went back home and remained there for the majority of the next three days, he said. On Aug. 13, the affidavit indicates, Kyle Navin told police he met both his parents at the parking lot on the morning of Aug. 4. He told investigators he could not finish his garbage route because of back pain. He said that because his mother did not know his route, he drove her to his Bridgeport home to get paperwork that showed the route. They drove back to Westport, where Jeneatte got out of his truck and into Jeffrey's, he told investigators. He told investigators that the only other contact he had that day with his parents was \\"telephonic contact with his father that related solely to work.\\" Sources said that Kyle Navin has refused to take a polygraph test when questioned by state police detectives. Investigators searched Navin's Bridgeport home on Aug. 13. They seized two firearms and rounds of ammunition from Navin's bedroom, the arrest affidavit unsealed Tuesday indicates. A second search, on Aug. 19, uncovered brand-stamped glassine baggies with heroin residue, hypodermic needles, empty prescription bottles for oxycodone and prescription bottles containing other controlled substances, the affidavit indicates. A court-authorized search of Navin's cellphone revealed text messages that discuss his use of heroin, oxycodone and Xanax, the complaint alleges. The charge carries a maximum term of 10 years in prison. The affidavit states that an unidentified person told investigators they talked to Kyle Navin on Aug. 5 about buying oxycodone from him and that Kyle Navin told the buyer that \\"it looked like his parents were missing.\\" That affidavit notes that conversation took place one day before \\"(Kyle) Navin allegedly first learned from his uncle that Jeffrey had not shown up for work on August 6, 2015.\\" A family member reported the Navins missing on Aug. 7 after Jeffrey Navin failed to pick up the garbage on his route for two days. In a search of the couple's Easton home police discovered a to-do list on the refrigerator, including such tasks as unplugging the dehumidifier and turning off all the lights. Police noted it seemed to be a list of things to do before taking a trip, the affidavit said. Neither of the Navins' phones has been used since Aug. 4, and their bank accounts have been untouched, law enforcement records indicate. ||||| Write a summary.","completion":"A man named Jeffrey Navin and his wife Jeanette disappeared in Connecticut a while ago.

It is revealed that that meteorite is actually Black Adam, returning to Earth after a long exile. The film then cuts to young Billy Batson living in a rundown slum, with very little food and rats for pets. He gets out of bed wearing a t-shirt with the Superman crest. He goes to the kitchen to find food, but discovers he only has potato chips, which he ends up feeding to the rats.

Tommy A:","completion":"Title: Battle of the Underdogs Plot: In a small, rural town where the high school is the heart of the community, athletics reign supreme. Krista Jones and Tommy Parker have always been on opposite ends of the social hierarchy but were bound by their passion for martial arts. Krista, a shy academic overachiever, has embraced martial arts since her childhood as a way to cope with her personal troubles and insecurities. She trains diligently under the guidance of her mentor, Master Chen, an elderly man with a mysterious past. Thanks to his teachings, Krista has developed exceptional martial arts skills that remain unbeknownst to the people around her. Tommy, on the other hand, is the school's golden boy – a popular student athlete with a penchant for bullying those beneath him in social standing. One day, he discovers the underground world of illegal street fighting and decides to use his martial arts talents to establish himself as the undisputed champion. When Krista catches wind of Tommy's plans, she feels compelled to stop him. Tommy, seeing her as nothing more than an easy target, challenges Krista to a public fight to assert his dominance. Driven by her sense of justice, Krista discreetly enlists Master Chen's help to prepare for the showdown while maintaining the illusion of her ordinary life. As the fight night approaches, Krista's and Tommy's personal lives begin to crumble under external pressures. With time running out, they are both forced to confront their personal demons and reconsider the choices they have made. The climactic showdown between Krista and Tommy is a high-octane battle emphasizing skill, discipline, and determination. Against all odds, Krista delivers a stunning performance and ultimately defeats Tommy. In the aftermath, Tommy realizes the error in his ways and embraces personal growth inspired by Krista's resilience and humility.

Next question: what is a cross between a lion and tiger called?","completion":"A cross between a lion and a tiger is called a liger. Ligers are hybrid offspring resulting from the mating of a male lion (Panthera leo) and a female tiger (Panthera tigris). This fascinating interbreeding between two species of large cats creates a unique creature that exhibits characteristics of both parent species. Ligers are currently the largest known felines in the world, having a combination of the genetic traits of both lions and tigers. These hybrid animals typically surpass the size of their parent species, with males weighing around 900-1,200 pounds and females ranging between 700-900 pounds. In terms of length, some adult male ligers can reach up to 11-12 feet. Ligers have a mixed appearance, possessing physical features of both lions and tigers. Their fur usually resembles that of a lion, varying from a tawny to sandy yellow color, with faint spots and stripes that come from their tiger parentage. The stripes are generally not as bold as those seen in tigers and might fade as the liger matures. Male ligers often have a mane, although it is typically shorter and less dense than a lion's mane, and some may even have a beard on their chin similar to that of their lion forebears. Additionally, like tigers, ligers are fond of swimming, which is not common among lions. In terms of behavior, ligers appear to display traits from both parent species. They can be social animals, like lions, and can also exhibit the more solitary nature of tigers. Their vocalizations are a mix of the lion's roar and the tiger's chuff or growl. It is important to note that ligers are not found in the wild, as the territories of lions and tigers do not overlap in their natural habitats. Ligers exist only due to human intervention and breeding in captivity. The hybrid counterpart of a liger, called a tigon, results from the mating of a male tiger and a female lion. Tigons, however, don't generally grow as large as ligers and exhibit a combination of physical and behavioral traits from their parent species. The subject of breeding ligers and other hybrid animals is controversial, as taking part in it may involve significant ethical and conservation concerns. Some critics argue that it can contribute to health problems in the offspring, including genetic defects, reduced lifespan, and infertility. Additionally, conservationists emphasize that resources should be focused on preserving natural habitats and protecting endangered species rather than creating and maintaining hybrids. Although ligers draw curiosity and fascination among many individuals, it is crucial to consider the challenges and implications that such hybrid breeding may have on the animals' wellbeing and overall conservation efforts."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

If \\"Closeup of dog in profile with mouth open.\\", can we conclude \\"This photo is of a dinosaur.\\"?","completion":"Based on the provided description, \\"Closeup of dog in profile with mouth open,\\" it is highly unlikely, in fact almost impossible, to conclude that \\"This photo is of a dinosaur.\\" Here's why: 1. Animal Recognition: Dogs and dinosaurs, despite both being animals, are fundamentally different. A dog is a mammal, commonly domesticated and kept as a pet with a variety of breeds and appearances. Dinosaurs, on the other hand, are a group of reptiles that existed millions of years ago with phenotypes vastly different from modern dogs. The distinction between the physical characteristics of dogs and dinosaurs is stark, making it hard to mistake one for the other based on visual evidence. 2. Time Frame: Another important factor is the time frame of each species. Dinosaurs went extinct approximately 65 million years ago. On the other hand, dogs have been man's best friend for thousands of years and are alive presently. Therefore, the likelihood of having a picture of a living, breathing dinosaur is non-existent based on what we know. 3. Evolution: In connection to the time frame, due to evolution processes, modern dogs evolved from wolves through selective breeding by humans, whereas dinosaurs have no direct descendants alive today in the form we know them but evolved into birds. 4. Description Given: The description given explicitly states that the photo is a \\"Closeup of a dog in profile with mouth open.\\" There is no mention of a dinosaur. It is crucial to stick to the facts presented without making unfounded assumptions. 5. Photography and Fossils: Dinosaurs thrived in an era before humans and more so before the invention of photography. Hence, the only visuals we have of dinosaurs are either archaeological remains, which typically include bones and fossils, or artistic renditions based on scientific research. These would look much different than a closeup shot of a dog with its mouth open. In conclusion, the description provided does not lend itself to the conclusion that \\"This photo is of a dinosaur.\\" Rather, it clearly indicates an image of a dog, which is an entirely different species with a distinct set of physical and biological characteristics. So, without additional context or evidence, it would not be reasonable to deduce that a photo depicting a dog is actually that of a dinosaur. Asserting such would require overlooking a vast amount of evidence to the contrary."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Write some highlights for the following article: Acupuncture does not improve chronic knee pain in middle-aged people, experts said today. Their new study found real acupuncture using needles and lasers was no more helpful than sham acupuncture. It specifically looked at the effects of acupuncture on chronic knee pain in people aged 50 or over. Rana Hinman, lead author from the University of Melbourne, said the team of researchers were surprised at their results. She said: 'It is surprising that our study showed acupuncture was not effective compared to sham acupuncture, because many people with chronic knee pain report that treatment with acupuncture is beneficial for their symptoms.' Scientists in Australia found acupuncture does not improve chronic knee pain in middle-aged people. File photo. Previous studies has found acupuncture is effective, although the benefits compared to mock acupuncture have been generally small and of questionable benefit, she said. Her team found many people over the age of 50 are plagued with chronic knee pain, and many turn to alternative treatments, including acupuncture. Acupuncturists often use a combination of traditional Chinese and Western techniques with needles and low-intensity lasers. But the effectiveness of laser acupuncture has been questioned, the researchers said. To test whether needle or laser acupuncture is more effective than no acupuncture, the scientists divided 282 patients over the age of 50 with chronic knee pain and morning stiffness into four groups. The knee pain targeted in the study is common with osteoarthritis - the result of normal joint wear and tear over the years. One group received no acupuncture at all. Another received needle acupuncture, another laser acupuncture, while the last group received sham laser acupuncture. Patients received eight to 12 treatments over three months. Each treatment session lasted about 20 minutes. The laser and sham laser treatments looked the same to both patients and acupuncturists, but the laser was not turned on for the sham group. The patients rated their average knee pain and physical function on questionnaires at the beginning of the study, after three months of treatment and again at one year. There were 'modest improvements' in pain at three months in the needle and laser acupuncture groups compared to the no-treatment group, but not compared to the sham group. Researchers looked at the effects of laser acupuncture, pictured, and needle treatment on 282 patients. File picture. And there were no differences between any of the groups on measures of knee pain and function after one year. This suggests that there were no 'real' or 'direct' effects of needle or laser acupuncture, Dr Hinman said. The improvements patients felt were likely due to the placebo effect. 'Acupuncture tends to be more effective for people who believe in the benefits of acupuncture,' she said. 'In our study, people did not know that were signing up for an acupuncture study, so our participants were less likely to be 'believers' in acupuncture, which probably explains why acupuncture was ineffective in our study.' The new results are very similar to those of a review of individual patient data in 2012, said Andrew Vickers. Dr Vickers, who led the previous review, is an attending research methodologist at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City and was not involved in the new study. The new review may have found a benefit from real acupuncture compared to sham acupuncture if the study included more people, he said. 'About three million Americans try acupuncture per year, and chronic pain is the most common indication,' he said. People with chronic pain should see a pain specialist, as there are many options for treatment, including acupuncture, he said. 'As the authors suggest, the findings of this study are applicable to patients with moderate to severe persistent knee pain, and acupuncture may be effective in some people with neuropathic (nerve related) pain,' said Dr. Abhishek Abhishek, an arthritis researcher and associate professor at the University of Nottingham. The UK's National Institute for Clinical Excellence and Health does not recommend acupuncture for treating knee osteoarthritis, but does recommend it for persistent low back pain as it can be effective in that scenario, Dr Abhishek, who was not part of the new study, said. As alternatives to acupuncture, Dr Hinman said physical therapy, knee braces and exercise can all help alleviate chronic knee pain. The new study was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association. Highlights:","completion":"1.

Question: U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday blasted former FBI director James Comey as an \\"untruthful slime ball,\\" and said it was his \\"great honor\\" to fire him. Trump's barrage of insults comes as Comey engages in a publicity campaign for his book, \\"A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies, and Leadership,\\" which is set to be released next week. The memoir promises a deep look at Comey's fraught relationship with the U.S. president who fired him, and whom Comey has accused of interfering in the independence of the FBI. On Twitter, Trump said Comey should be prosecuted. Trump's comments are in line with an online campaign, organized by his supporters, to discredit Comey. The Republican National Committee on Thursday launched a new website, Lyin'Comey.com, which features quotes from prominent Democrats who have criticized the former FBI director in the past. The GOP plans to fact-check Comey's book and use the website for \\"rapid response\\" to highlight any \\"misstatements\\" or \\"contradictions,\\" Fox News reports. Comey's book blasts Trump as unethical and \\"untethered to truth'' and calls his leadership of the country \\"ego driven and about personal loyalty.'' The book also contains several personal jabs at Trump, including references to what Comey says are the \\"bright white half-moons\\" under Trump's eyes, which he surmises were the result of Trump using tanning goggles. Comey also casts Trump as a Mafia boss-like figure who sought to blur the line between law enforcement and politics, and tried to pressure him regarding his investigation into Russian election interference, according to multiple early reviews of the book. Trump fired Comey in May 2017, setting off a storm of charges from Democrats that the president sought to hinder an investigation into whether his campaign colluded with Russians. The firing led to the appointment of Robert Mueller as special counsel overseeing the Russia investigation. Mueller's probe has expanded to include whether Trump obstructed justice by firing Comey, an idea the president denies. Trump...

It began at Wymondham on 8 July 1549 with a group of rebels destroying fences that had been put up by wealthy landowners. One of their targets was yeoman farmer Robert Kett who, instead of resisting the rebels, agreed to their demands and offered to lead them. Kett and his forces, joined by recruits from Norwich and the surrounding countryside and numbering some 16,000, set up camp on Mousehold Heath to the north-east of the city on 12 July. The rebels stormed Norwich on 29 July and took the city. But on 1 August the rebels were defeated by an army led by the Marquess of Northampton who had been sent by the government to suppress the uprising. Kett's rebellion ended on 27 August when the rebels were defeated by an army under the leadership of the Earl of Warwick at the Battle of Dussindale. Kett was captured, held in the Tower of London, tried for treason, and hanged from the walls of Norwich Castle on 7 December 1549.

More details at this \\"user's guide\\" from Search Engine Land, or see the video in the gallery for a demo. Early reaction: Better, but not a world-changer: The best part, writes Stephen Shankland at CNET, is that \\"I could continuously refine my search results as I went. Instead of having to search, check the results, tweak the search, check again, and so on, I could fiddle with the search terms as I went. ... It is for me an improvement, though not a revolution, in search.\\" It's about volume, not speed: \\"Google just found a way to jack up the number of search results you see by doing nothing more than type in a word or two like you always do,\\" writes Erick Schonfeld at TechCrunch. \\"Most people can scan results visually and can absorb a lot more information if it is streamed to them in this fashion rather than having to manually click through to see more results. If people get used to this, it will put pressure on Bing and other search engines to quickly follow suit.\\" Article:","completion":"Title: Google Instant: A Step Towards Enhanced Search Experience Google has raised the bar in the search engine domain with the unveiling of its latest innovation, Google Instant, a sophisticated search feature that refines searches by predicting users' query intentions in real-time. The update aims to optimize the user experience by streamlining the search process and allowing users to refine their search queries on the fly. For a complete demonstration and insights, refer to the \\"user's guide\\" provided by Search Engine Land, or check out the video demo in the gallery. The general consensus is that the new feature offers a better search experience, although it may not necessarily redefine the search engine landscape. According to Stephen Shankland at CNET, Google Instant's most significant contribution is its ability to \\"continuously refine my search results as I went. Instead of having to search, check the results, tweak the search, check again, and so on, I could fiddle with the search terms as I went.\\" Though not revolutionary, this innovation notably improves user experience and efficiency in searching for information. Another key aspect of Google Instant is its focus on increasing the volume of search results users can view without compromising search speed. As Erick Schonfeld from TechCrunch points out, \\"Google just found a way to jack up the number of search results you see by doing nothing more than type in a word or two like you always do.\\" This feature enables users to inspect a wider range of search results as information is streamed visually, instead of having to click through each entry. With users potentially adapting to this style of search, rival search engines like Bing might need to follow suit in order to stay competitive. In conclusion, while Google Instant may not be a groundbreaking revolution in the world of search engines, it certainly sets a new standard for user experience and efficiency. With its ability to refine search results in real-time and increase the volume of viewable information, Google Instant is poised to shift user expectations and potentially influence the future development of search engines worldwide."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize this article: Now that you've learned about the issues and committed yourself to tackling them, it's time to make yourself heard. Start by stating your beliefs about animal rights in influential public forums. For example, sign on to petitions, write letters to decision-makers, and send editorials to newspapers. If there is a hearing about a particular issue, such as the development of wetlands, sign up to give testimony. Animal rights groups need monetary backing to support their good work. Pick an organization that is running campaigns that you believe in and that are garnering measurable results. Most organizations make it easy to donate by having secure, online tools for making one-time or monthly contributions. If you choose a registered nonprofit, your donations are tax-deductible. Join and/or volunteer with a group that's dedicated to animal rights. Membership usually involves paying dues, attending meetings, being on their contact list, and participating in sponsored events and campaigns. Check locally to see if there are organizations that are active in your area. If you'd like to get involved with a major player in the cause, here is a helpful online list of the biggest animal rights groups internationally with links to each: https://speakingofresearch.com/extremism-undone/animal-rights-activists-organizations/. If there's a specific issue, such as factory farming or cosmetics testing, that speaks to you, get involved. There are plenty of ways, large and small, to lend a hand. Some informal ways to get involved include signing a petition, sharing information on social media, or attending a demonstration. Some more formal ways of participating include attending organizing meetings related to the campaign, volunteering your time to a related event or effort, or taking on a leadership role. The best activism takes advantage of the knowledge and experience that you already have. Ask yourself how you can use your education, career, and/or hobbies to help the cause of animal rights. For instance, if you are an artist, do a show or exhibition that engages the public in the cause. If you're a businessperson, set up a seminar to inform people in the industry about why investing in cruelty-free companies is good business.","completion":"The article primarily focuses on how individuals can become engaged in the fight for animal rights and contribute to making a difference in this cause. After understanding the various issues surrounding animal rights and deciding to involve oneself actively, it is crucial to vocalize these beliefs in places where they can wield influence. This can be attained by signing petitions, writing to influential decision-makers, submitting editorials to newspapers, or testifying at relevant hearings. Supporting animal rights organizations financially is another significant way to make an impact. Individuals are encouraged to select groups that align with their ideologies. They should focus on campaigns with proven results. Donations to registered nonprofits also serve as tax deductions, incentivizing this process. These organizations typically provide an easy online tool for making single or monthly contributions that cater to individuals' convenience and preference. Involvement in animal rights groups takes many forms outside monetary contribution. Possibilities include joining as a member, which means paying membership fees, partaking in meetings, registering on their contact list, or participating in their events and campaigns. Volunteering personal time to these groups is another meaningful way to support. It is advisable to explore the local scene for active animal rights organizations or international groups if one desires a broader scope of involvement. The article also provides resources such as an online list of major animal rights groups worldwide, which can be quite helpful for individuals who wish to participate on a global platform. Participating in specific issues such as factory farming or cosmetics testing could also be a personal choice. Engagement varies from informal measures like signing petitions, sharing information on social media, or attending rallies to more formal ways such as attending campaign meetings, volunteering at related events, or even assuming leadership roles. Finally, the article encourages individuals to use their unique skills and knowledge gained through their education, career, or hobbies towards the cause. For example, artists could host shows to raise awareness, while business individuals could conduct seminars to inform about the advantages of investing in cruelty-free companies.

The paragraph clearly states that the album was released in 2010, making it evident that it was not released before 2000. Instead, the album is the third one released by the British band Working for a Nuclear Free City, and it's important to note that it is their second album to be released in the U.S. \\"Jojo Burger Tempest\\" is a double album, consisting of one disc containing 17 individual songs and another disc that features a single 33-minute suite. Given that the album was released in 2010, it indicates that it is part of the band's more recent discography rather than being a release that came before the turn of the millennium. Additionally, the album's release date in 2010 would have placed it within the context of a different musical landscape and industry environment compared to if it were released before 2000. This could potentially influence the band's songwriting, production, and overall creative direction for this particular album.

However, all possible instances based on your options could be explained as follows: 1. Intense Pleasure: The couple could have had an intense pleasure after copulating for so long. Biologically speaking, orgasm is often the peak of sexual intercourse and is experienced as a period of intense pleasure, marked by physiological and psychological release. 2. Period of Rest: Given the phrase \\"seemingly non-stop\\", it would be quite reasonable to suggest that the couple would eventually need a period of rest. Continuous physical activity would undoubtedly require rest eventually, for recovery and replenishment. 3. Babies: One possible outcome of frequent copulation can be conception, which eventually leads to babies. However, pregnancy wouldn't be an immediate result of continuous copulation; it requires a certain combination of factors and appropriate timing in a woman's menstrual cycle. 4. Conversation: After such intense, long-lasting physical intimacy, there could be an emotional deepening of the relationship. This might result in a meaningful conversation, where deeper feelings, future plans, or other significant topics are discussed. 5. Skin Irritation: Continuous copulation could lead to physical discomfort or even skin irritation due to the friction involved. It's highly advisable to prioritize comfort and well-being during such activities.

Premise: \\"The red sun gleamed from the silver edge of the black blade.\\" Based on this premise, is the hypothesis \\"The blade could not be seen in the dark. \\" true?","completion":"Based on the given premise, \\"The red sun gleamed from the silver edge of the black blade,\\" it is not possible to definitively confirm or refute the hypothesis \\"The blade could not be seen in the dark.\\" To fully assess the hypothesis, we need to consider various factors associated with the blade's color, material, and its reflective properties. We can glean some information from the premise, but it is insufficient to reach a conclusion. 1. Blade color: The premise states that the blade has a black coloring. Black objects are known to absorb most light and reflect very little. This fact might lead us to initially think that the blade would be difficult to see in low-light or dark conditions. 2. Blade edge: However, the blade's edge is described as silver. Silver is known for its high reflectivity, meaning that it can efficiently reflect light. This characteristic might suggest that the blade's edge could be visible in dark conditions if a light source is present. 3. Environmental factors: The premise also mentions that the red sun gleamed, which indicates that there was a light source strong enough to cause the silver edge to reflect light at that specific moment. However, in dark conditions, the light sources usually are much weaker than the sun, so the blade's visibility could be different under such circumstances. In conclusion, while we can infer that the black blade may be less visible in low-light or dark conditions due to its color, the silver edge has the potential to make it more visible when light is reflected off it. However, given the limited information provided in the premise, we cannot definitively say whether the hypothesis \\"The blade could not be seen in the dark\\" is true or false. Further details about the specific environmental conditions, surrounding light sources, and the blade's material would be necessary to better evaluate the hypothesis."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He weighed in at almost thirteen pounds, came ready-fitted with a shock of fat black hair and a couple of razor teeth. Jimbob's folks loved him like most folks love their little ones, maybe more. They'd been trying so hard for a child, suffered more mid-term miscarriages than the ewes they shuttled off to market most Thursdays. They dressed him in a one-year babygro and took him home to their hill farm. They fought to get up nights and give him his milk. His teeth made breast-feeding impossible. They sat hours gazing down in his cot. They dressed him fine and took him to their church and gave their thanks. Showed him off like the proud parents they were. Others cooed and smiled. But they never asked to hold. They gave thanks the Blakeys were happy, and that the monkey-baby had not been born to them. Jimbob's folks never gave a second thought that their boy might be different. The first Spring he walked, he stomped the moors in his welly-boots helping herd the pregnant ewes down in-by. He copied his father, kicking and cuffing at the stragglers, when the flock was returned to the hills in May. As Jimbob grew, his hair became thicker, his arms longer. His head shrunk down on his shoulders. At check-ups, nurses fixed smiles and pronounced him healthy. Doctors said, 'he'll make you a strapping lad.' His mother smiled, her heart swelled. When he was three, she sent him to nursery. She wanted him to mix with other kids. To taste life off the hard hills. She said, 'it'll do him the world of good.' Jimbob hated leaving the farm. He clung to his mother. She drove away, blinking tears. On the third day, she took a phone call. 'It's Jimbob,' they said.

Choose your answer from: a. unacceptable. b. acceptable.","completion":"b. acceptable. The sentence \\"Gilgamesh never flies dragons\\" is both syntactically and semantically acceptable. Let's break down the sentence to understand its structure and meaning better: 1. Syntactically, the sentence follows the general English sentence construction of Subject-Verb-Object (SVO), which is common for English sentences. - \\"Gilgamesh\\" is the subject of the sentence, referring to an individual or a character, which could be from mythology, literature, or any other source. - \\"never\\" is an adverb of frequency, indicating that the action (in this case, flying dragons) does not happen at any point in time. - \\"flies\\" is the verb, expressing the action of riding or flying creatures in the air, specifically dragons in this context. - \\"dragons\\" is the object of the sentence, representing creatures that are typically associated with flying and fantasy or mythology. 2. Semantically, the sentence is also acceptable. It conveys the meaning that the character Gilgamesh does not partake in the activity of flying dragons. It makes sense within the context of a story or description where dragons are creatures capable of being flown and where Gilgamesh is an individual present in that world. Based on these factors, the sentence \\"Gilgamesh never flies dragons\\" is syntactically and semantically acceptable, so the correct answer is (b) acceptable."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Are Roger Hodgson and Max Green both from England? A:","completion":"Yes, Roger Hodgson and Max Green are both from England. Let's dive deeper into their backgrounds. Roger Hodgson is an English musician, singer, and songwriter, best known as the co-founder and former lead vocalist of the progressive rock band Supertramp. He was born on March 21, 1950, in Portsmouth, Hampshire, England. His full name is Charles Roger Pomfret Hodgson. He attended Stowe School, a prestigious boarding school in Buckinghamshire, where he first began to play music with friends in informal bands. In 1969, Hodgson co-founded Supertramp and remained with the group until 1983. During his time with Supertramp, they released several successful albums, such as \\"Crime of the Century\\" (1974), \\"Even in the Quietest Moments\\" (1977), and \\"Breakfast in America\\" (1979), which is their most successful album to date. After leaving the band, Hodgson embarked on a solo career and released several albums, such as \\"In the Eye of the Storm\\" (1984), \\"Hai Hai\\" (1987), \\"Rites of Passage\\" (1997), and \\"Open the Door\\" (2000). He continues to perform as a solo artist and occasionally plays his Supertramp hits for fans. Max Green, whose full name is Maxwell Scott Green, is an English-American musician primarily known as the former bass guitarist of the American post-hardcore band Escape the Fate. Max Green was born on December 15, 1984, in Cheshire, England, and later moved to the United States. He was one of the original members of Escape the Fate, which formed in 2004, and was with the group until 2012, with a brief departure in 2010. He was involved in the initial success of the band, including their debut full-length album \\"Dying Is Your Latest Fashion\\" (2006) and subsequent releases \\"This War Is Ours\\" (2008) and \\"Escape the Fate\\" (2010). After leaving the band, Green had brief stints playing with several other musical projects, including The Natural Born Killers, Violent New Breed, and Falling in Reverse. Max Green stepped away from the music scene in 2015 due to personal reasons and has kept a relatively low profile since then. In conclusion, both Roger Hodgson and Max Green are musicians from England who have contributed significantly to their respective genres of music. While Hodgson has had a longer career and is associated more closely with the progressive rock movement, Green played a prominent role in the post-hardcore scene during his time with Escape the Fate."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The reason is… April 2, 2014 was the day my 53 year old wife found out that she had metastasized lung cancer. A large tumor had formed on the bottom of one lung, they found 4 tumors in her brain, another large one in her stomach and several more throughout her intestinal track. She rarely complained about physical problems and I knew something was wrong when she said she needed to go to the hospital ER. She died exactly 30 days later. I spent virtually every minute of that time with her. I went with her to radiation appointments. I stayed in the hospital with her because it seemed like every week I would have to take her in for something that required a 3 or 4 day stay. And the final trip to the ER was May 1st. An MRI showed that one of the tumors in her intestines had torn a hole in her bowel. The ER surgeon told us straight up that she was beyond any medical care that could help her and to use the next 24 hours to say goodbye to family and friends. And almost exactly 24 hours later, she was gone. I was devastated. 30.5 years of Happily Ever After turned into god fucking damn it all to hell! And when April 2 rolls around every year, I begin living those last 30 days of her life over again. I thought that after the third time in 2017 that I was about ready to let it go. I started really living again instead of just existing. But when April 2 came this year, I found that I was back in my memories. It was easier to deal with this time because of the way I had changed over the last year. I hung around with more friends and they helped distract me and one actually helped me turn May 2 into a celebration. And I love her for that. That's my story. Question: When did his wife died?

However, given the situation, I can offer a few suggestions on how Michael can make a new pencil case that will not scratch or dent easily. One of these methods might be the correct answer you are looking for. 1. Choose a more durable material: Michael could consider using a stronger and more scratch-resistant material for the new pencil case. Some possible materials include metal (like aluminum or stainless steel), plastic, or even a dense hardwood like oak or maple. 2. Apply a protective coating: Michael could apply a protective coating or finish to the new pencil case. For example, he could use varnish, polyurethane, or epoxy as a surface treatment to increase its scratch and dent resistance. These coatings can be applied to wooden pencil cases and can improve their durability significantly. 3. Incorporate cushioning or padding: Michael could design the new pencil case to include an internal padding layer (such as foam or rubber) that helps protect the content from impacts or scratches. This may not fully prevent dents on the exterior of the pencil case, but it may help protect the contents inside. 4. Reinforce the structure: Michael could incorporate additional reinforcements into the design of the new pencil case. For example, he could use thicker walls, stronger materials, or even incorporate internal bracing. Ultimately, the correct answer to the question would depend on which specific solution Michael chooses, but these suggestions might help guide him toward a new pencil case that is more resistant to scratches and dents."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Deciding to go on a diet is easy, but sticking to a diet is not easy! So, when facing that challenge, it is important to know how to reach your weight-loss goal. Of course, you have to decide you want to lose weight and be committed to doing so; then, you must stick to your guns and stay motivated or the goal will never be realized. There is no magic bullet, but there are two important tips that can help you reach your weight-loss goal. #1 – Take It a Week at a Time You must break your ultimate goal into smaller chunks and have bench marks that will indicate you are moving in the right direction. According to the Mayo Clinic, “Over the long term, it’s best to aim for losing 1 to 2 pounds (0.5 to 1 kilogram) a week.” When you have a realistic weekly weight-loss target, you will be more confident in your efforts and you will know exactly what you are going to measure at the end of each week. Your long-term goal may be 40 pounds, but take it “one week at a time” (1 to 2 pounds/week = 20 to 30 weeks) In addition to choosing a healthy diet that fits your lifestyle and current health conditions, plus a solid commitment to stay with it, don’t forget to get plenty of rest and exercise. . BUT . . . the primary target should be the number of pounds you plan to lose each week. That target should be clear – and realistic. If it is, you should be able to stick to your weight loss program and enjoy success week after week, after week. AND, feel good in the process. If you are not hitting your target, be willing to look closely at what you are doing, or not doing – and figure out why you are not reaching your weekly target. Maybe the target you set was not sensible or reasonable; or, maybe you are putting too much pressure on yourself. Honest introspection is a good way to see what you are really capable of doing and then, you can develop or choose a plan that is suitable for your unique lifestyle. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.

Here is a premise: Supposing a parcel arrived addressed to Mr. Lawrence Cavendish, and afterwards it disappeared, should you remark its absence? Here is a hypothesis: Should you mention that a letter disappeared after arriving to the address? Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","completion":"Step 1: Analyze the Premise In the given premise, a parcel has arrived addressed to Mr. Lawrence Cavendish, and then it disappeared. The question is whether you should remark its absence. Step 2: Analyze the Hypothesis The hypothesis asks if you should mention that a letter disappeared after arriving at the address. Step 3: Identify the Similarities and Differences Similarities: Both the premise and the hypothesis involve something disappearing after arriving at its intended destination, and both ask whether or not you should acknowledge the disappearance. Differences: The premise involves a parcel, while the hypothesis involves a letter. However, this difference can be considered trivial as both are items that have arrived at an address before disappearing. Step 4: Determine the Relationship between the Premise and Hypothesis Given that the key difference between the premise and hypothesis is the item that has disappeared (parcel vs. letter), and that the main intent of the hypothesis likely refers to items in general, we can safely assume that the hypothesis is a more generalized statement of the premise. Step 5: Assess the Validity of the Conclusion It is possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis. If you would remark upon the absence of the parcel in the premise, it is likely that you would also mention the disappearance of a letter in the hypothesis. Therefore, if the premise is true, the hypothesis is also likely to be true."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

After its completion, Captain Raymond Demeré relinquished command on August 14, 1757 to his brother, Captain Paul Demeré. Hostilities erupted between the British and the neighboring Overhill Cherokees, and a siege of Fort Loudoun ended with its surrender on August 7, 1760.

First, gather your materials. You will need: - A yogurt container (clean and empty) - A nail (the diameter of the nail will determine the size of the hole) - A torch or a source of heat (to heat up the nail) - Pliers (to safely grab onto and manipulate the heated nail) Option: Heat up a nail with a torch, grab it with pliers, and push it through the bottom of the yogurt container. 2. Set up a safe and well-ventilated workspace. Find a suitable area outside or indoors with good ventilation and away from flammable materials. You can lay down aluminum foil or a fire-resistant mat to protect the surface you'll be working on. 3. Use the torch to heat up the nail. If using a gas torch, light it up and adjust the flame to a suitable size, then hold the nail in the flame for a few seconds until it gets hot. Be careful not to touch the nail with your bare hands, as it will be extremely hot and can cause burns. You can also use other heat sources, like a gas stove, but a torch will allow more precise heating. 4. Once the nail is hot, use the pliers to safely grab the heated end of the nail. Ensure that you have a firm grip on the nail using the pliers, but avoid putting too much pressure, as this may cause the heated nail to bend or break. 5. Carefully position the heated nail over the desired location for the hole on the bottom of the yogurt container. Keep the yogurt container on a stable surface to avoid slipping or sudden movements. 6. Gently push the heated nail through the plastic bottom of the yogurt container. Because the nail is hot, it will easily melt a hole into the plastic. Make sure you maintain control of the nail with the pliers, and try not to apply excessive force as this could damage the plastic or result in an uneven hole. 7. Repeat steps 3-6 for as many holes as you need in the bottom of your yogurt container. Space the holes evenly to allow for proper drainage when you start using the container for seed starting. 8. Once you have completed making the drainage holes, allow the nail to cool down before cleaning and storing it. 9. Thoroughly clean your workspace and remove any plastic residues. 10. Now your yogurt container is ready to be used as a seed starter! Fill it with a suitable seed starting mix or potting soil, plant your seeds, and watch them grow. Note: Using a scissors instead of pliers to hold the heated nail is not advised because the high temperatures can damage your scissors and the melted plastic might stick to them.

In the first sentence, \\"The game resulted in the National League defeating the American League 6 -- 5,\\" the emphasis is on the result of the game, followed by the specific outcome in terms of which team won and the final score. The use of double hyphens (--) indicates the separation between the winning and losing scores. The second sentence, \\"The game resulted in the National League defeating the American League with 6 -- 5,\\" also focuses on the result of the game, specifying the winning team and the final score. The use of the word \\"with\\" adds a slightly more casual tone to the sentence, but this does not affect the overall meaning. Again, the double hyphens (--) are used to separate the winning and losing scores. It is important to note that using double hyphens (--) as a separator between scores might not be the most conventional way to represent the final score.

It may help to nurse each twin individually in the early days of breastfeeding, when you and your babies are learning about latching on and positioning. This way you'll be able to spend a little more time and have extra hands to work with one baby at a time. Nursing your babies individually can also help you learn about each baby's nursing habits. This can help you when you begin to simultaneously breastfeed them. Consider setting a nursing schedule for your twins so you can get them on a feeding schedule. If your babies are very small, work with a doctor or lactation consultant to make a schedule that will give your babies enough milk. For example, you may set an alarm to go off every hour and a half so you know that it's time to feed your twins. A schedule can be helpful if you're so tired that you can't remember how long it's been since their last feeding. If you'd like to follow your babies' hunger cues and feed them whenever their hungry, just keep track of when you feed them and how long they nursed. Create a space where you have all the things you'll need while breastfeeding. You should have easy access to anything you'd need during the feeding so you won't have to interrupt the feeding. Ensure that you're comfortable since you'll be spending a lot of time breastfeeding. Consider having these in your breastfeeding area: Nursing pillow and support pillows Water bottles Healthy snacks (such as granola bars, fruit, protein bars) Things to read Access to entertainment (such as a tablet, television, or laptop) Music to listen to Diapering supplies (if you need to quickly change one of the babies) Choose a nursing bra that you can easily unsnap or unclip with one hand in order to breastfeed. If you choose not to wear a nursing bra, consider wearing a comfortable top that gives you access to your breasts so you don't have to take off your entire top to breastfeed. For extra support, look for a nursing bra that contains an underwire. If you'll be simultaneously breastfeeding, ensure that you can easily access both breasts while wearing the bra. If you're concerned that your babies aren't latching on correctly, are difficult to position, or aren't getting enough milk, contact a lactation consultant. The lactation consultant can watch you breastfeed and identify any problems. They'll help you so that your babies are able to easily nurse on their own. Look for a board certified lactation consultant. Find out if your hospital or birth center offers lactation consultants to work with you. You may be able to drop in to a weekly nursing session or have someone come to your home. You can also talk to other mothers of twins. Discuss breastfeeding challenges and tricks to make it work for you.","completion":"Nurse twins individually in the early days to learn their habits, create a schedule, establish a comfortable breastfeeding space, choose suitable attire, and consult a lactation expert for assistance."},{"prompt":"I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: Jean-Michael Lourdis was a promising young pianist. But when the young man played, it seemed to him, as if his hands were iron.

Jean-Michael had one of those days when everything went wrong. That night as he played, he felt as if it were the worst concert of his young life. The next day, in the newspapers, some of the comments were so unkind. The young musician was painful. That day, as he sat in his hotel room in total despair , there came a knocking at his door. He had a visitor.The famous Finnish composer Jean Sibelius had come by to congratulate the young pianist on his performance. Jean-Michael asked how he thought of that and began to quote some of the newspaper critics. \\" Hands of iron. No imagination. Little skill. No joy. Don't you hear what they say?\\" he asked.

Review: Although I fell in love with the adorable animal prints on the fabric of this bouncer, I would not recommend it to anyone because of the position of the seat. It is at such a steep angle that our son slides to the bottom of it even when strapped in. He can't stand to be in it. His feet have nothing to rest on and even I would find this uncomfortable. Our baby (now 11 weeks) has always been average in size for his age so we know its not him. Also we have put him in several other bouncers that our friends' own and he loves them all. All of them have gentle angles where the baby is slightly elevated. The only way he will stay in it is if we put 3 or 4 blankets down in the seat so he is more propped up and doesn't slip.

Article: Jeremy Kerr, a researcher at the University of Ottawa in Canada, and his colleagues analyzed more than 400,000 observations of bumblebee species collected in North America and Europe from 1975 to 2010. When the researchers recorded the locations of these bee populations, they found that many of the 67 species analyzed were moving northward from their southern limits while the northern edges of the bees' ranges are staying in place. What it results in is obvious. Bees have been paid more attention to in recent years, with populations of honeybees and bumblebees obviously declining in some parts of Europe. Previously, attention on the decline of bee populations has focused on causes including habitat loss, pesticide use and the spread of bee parasites . But the work by Kerr's team found something different. \\"For every species, there is one or two species declining and others that are not moving at all,\\" says Kerr. This shift has also been observed in other species, such as butterflies. But due to a new cause -- the rise of temperatures instead of total pesticide use, a change in land use or parasites, bumblebees -- unlike butterflies -- have failed to extend the northern boundaries of their ranges into the territory that is now habitable for them, so bumblebee species across Europe and North America are declining rapidly, the latest study led by Kerr's team finds. \\"Our data suggest that the new factor plays a leading, or perhaps the leading, role in this trend,\\" says Kerr. \\"This study shows that a fourth factor is also beginning to affect it. It is likely that the combined stresses from all of these pressures will have destructive impacts on bumblebees in the not-too-distant future,\\" says Dave Goulson, a bee researcher at the University of Sussex, Brighton, UK. Exactly what can be done to help bumblebees is not clear. Kerr's team suggests that relocating colonies might be an answer but Goulson says that because the insects are mobile they are capable of moving northwards if there is suitable habitat available. Question: Which statement may Goulson agree with?

Researchers at Princeton proved the point in an experiment involving an algorithm known as GloVe, which has learned about 840 billion words from the internet, notes Wired. For their study, the researchers adapted a word-pairing test used to gauge bias in humans to do the same for the GloVe system. The upshot? Every single human bias they tested showed up, they report in the journal Science. \\"It was astonishing to see all the results that were embedded in these models,\\" one researcher tells Live Science. They found examples of ageism, sexism, racism, and more—everything from associating men more closely with math and science and women with arts to seeing European-American names as more pleasant than African-American ones. \\"We have learned something about how we are passing on prejudices that we didn't even know we were doing,\\" says another researcher. Just as Twitter users taught Microsoft's chatbot Tay to unleash neo-Nazi rants on social media last year, so, too, does this oft-used algorithm learn from our own behaviors, regardless of whether they are good or bad.

Question: Information: - André \\"Doctor Dré\\" Brown (born December 5, 1963) is an American radio personality and former MTV VJ. He was born in Westbury, New York. - Westbury incorporated in 1932 as a village in Nassau County, New York in the United States. The population was 15,146 at the 2010 census. The Incorporated Village of Westbury is in the Town of North Hempstead. It is located about 18 miles(40 km) east of Manhattan. - The year 1963 in radio involved some significant events , including the addition of FM - compatible radios in cars made by major American automobile companies , and the birth of future radio personality Doctor Dré - MTV (originally an initialism of Music Television) is an American cable and satellite television channel owned by Viacom Media Networks (a division of Viacom) and headquartered in New York City. Launched on August 1, 1981, the channel originally aired music videos as guided by television personalities known as \\"video jockeys\\" (VJs). In its early years, MTV's main target demographic was young adults, but today it is primarily towards teenagers, high school students and college students. MTV has toned down its music video programming significantly in recent years, and its programming now consists mainly of original reality, comedy and drama programming and some off-network syndicated programs and films, with limited music video programming in off-peak time periods. It has received criticism towards this change of focus, both by certain segments of its audience and musicians. MTV's influence on its audience, including issues involving censorship and social activism, has also been a subject of debate for several years. - A radio personality (American English) or radio presenter (British English) is a person who has an on-air position in radio broadcasting. A radio personality that hosts a radio show is also known as a radio host, and in India and Pakistan as a radio jockey. Radio personalities who introduced and played individual selections of recorded music were originally known as disc jockeys before the term evolved to describe a person who mixes a continuous flow of recorded music in real time. Broadcast radio personalities may include Talk radio hosts, AM/FM radio show hosts, and Satellite radio program hosts. Notable radio personalities include pop music radio hosts Martin Block, Alan Freed, Dick Clark, Wolfman Jack, and Casey Kasem, shock jock's such as Don Imus and Howard Stern, as well as sports talk hosts such as Mike Francesa and political talk hosts such as Rush Limbaugh. What is the relationship between '1963 in radio' and 'radio broadcasting'? Answer:","completion":"The relationship between '1963 in radio' and 'radio broadcasting' lies in the fact that 1963 was a significant year for the radio broadcasting industry, which experienced notable events and developments that influenced its growth and evolution. In 1963, radio broadcasting saw the introduction of FM-compatible radios in cars manufactured by major American automobile companies, effectively expanding the reach and accessibility of FM radio broadcasting. This development marked an important milestone as it allowed an increasing number of listeners to tune in to FM stations in their vehicles, thus broadening the audience for radio stations and advertisers. Additionally, 1963 is significant in the context of radio broadcasting as it witnessed the birth of future radio personality André \\"Doctor Dré\\" Brown on December 5th. Brown, who went on to become an influential radio personality and MTV VJ (video jockey), is a prime example of the impact radio personalities have on the format and success of radio broadcasting. Radio personalities are essential to radio broadcasting because they create an identity for the stations they represent and engage listeners through their on-air presence, conversation, and music selection. Furthermore, radio broadcasting in 1963 was operating in a dynamic and evolving landscape, with advancements in technology and shifts in the marketplace and consumer preferences influencing the direction of the industry. The potential for further growth and diversification created opportunities for new talent, such as Doctor Dré, to emerge and take on influential roles in the industry. In conclusion, the connection between '1963 in radio' and 'radio broadcasting' can be seen through the notable events and advancements that occurred during this year, which contributed to both the growth of radio broadcasting as an industry and the careers of radio personalities like Doctor Dré. These developments would shape radio broadcasting in the years to come, creating a lasting impact on the industry."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Martha and the Vandellas (known from 1967 to 1972 as Martha Reeves and the Vandellas) were an American all-female vocal group formed in 1957. The group achieved fame in the 1960s with Motown. Selected Members of the group were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1995. Formed in 1957 by friends Annette Beard, Rosalind Ashford and Gloria Williams, the group eventually included Martha Reeves, who moved up in ranks as lead vocalist of the group after Williams' departure in 1962. Teenagers Rosalind Ashford and Annette Beard first became acquainted after a local music manager hired them to be members of a girl group he named The Del-Phis. Ashford & Beard, along with then-lead vocalist Gloria Williams, performed at local clubs, private events, church benefits, YMCA events and school functions. They were also being coached by Maxine Powell at Detroit's Ferris Center. One of the group's first professional engagements was singing background for singer Mike Hanks. The group originally had up to six members, shortened to four. After another member left the group, she was replaced by Alabama-born vocalist Martha Reeves, who had been a member of a rival group, the Fascinations and had also been a member of another group, the Sabre-Ettes. In 1960, the group signed their first recording contract with Checker Records, releasing the Reeves-led \\"I'll Let You Know\\". The record flopped. The group then recorded for Checkmate Records, a subsidiary of Chess Records, recording their first take of \\"There He Is (At My Door)\\". That record, featuring Williams on lead vocals, also flopped. Briefly separated, Reeves returned to a solo career performing under the name Martha LaVaille, in hopes of getting a contract with emerging Detroit label Motown. After Motown staffer Mickey Stevenson noticed Reeves singing at a prominent Detroit club, he offered her his business card for an audition. Reeves showed up at Motown on a wrong date (Motown auditions were held at Thursdays, while Reeves showed up to Motown's Hitsville USA studios on a Tuesday). Stevenson, initially upset, told Reeves to look out for clients and other matters. Soon Reeves became Stevenson's secretary and later was responsible for helping acts audition for the label. By 1961, the group, now known as The Vels, were recording background vocals for Motown acts. Prior to her success as lead singer of The Elgins, Sandra Edwards (then going by her surname Maulett) recorded the song \\"Camel Walk\\", in 1962, which featured the Vels in background vocals. That year, the quartet began applying background vocals for emerging Motown star Marvin Gaye, singing on Gaye's first hit single, \\"Stubborn Kind of Fellow\\" After Mary Wells failed to make a scheduled recording session feigning a short illness, the Vels recorded what was initially a demo recording of \\"I'll Have to Let Him Go\\". Motown was so impressed by the group's vocals - and Martha's lead vocals in the song - that the label CEO Berry Gordy offered to give the group a contract. Figuring that being in show business was too rigorous, Williams opted out of the group. With Williams out, the remaining trio of Ashford, Beard and Reeves renamed themselves The Vandellas, after Detroit's Van Dyke Street and Reeves' favorite singer, Della Reese.

Input: Article: The addictive pull of Internet shopping is dragging thousands of victims into a rise of debt, including thousands of women who have run up huge credit card bills they cannot repay. The appeal of 24-hour access and the explosion in goods and services on offer has seen a 10 percent increase in credit card debts in the UK this year. Much of it has accounted for online spending. The latest report on Internet usage shows the number of adults logging on at home has risen from 10 million in October last year to 15.5m this month. The report by Continental Research, which has monitored Internet access in the UK for the past six years, found that while online shopping used to be experimental it is now becoming habitual, especially for women. Colin Shaddick, who heads the company, said, \\"Women are logging on in record numbers ---online shopping has certainly played a big role in this.\\" The study found that average annual spending online is PS700 a year for each Internet shopper. The draw of the Internet is especially strong for collectors. Business lecturer Stephen Hall, who has been buying and selling books since he was a child, now has a collection worth PS40,000. He is passionate about the opportunities offered by shopping online. \\"You can find a book in minutes that you could spend months hunting down at auctions or second-hand bookshops,\\" he said. \\"It can easily become addictive, and all the collectors I know use the Internet. I suspect you do waste money because you are less likely to send back a book to Little Rock, Arkansas, than take it back to the high-street shop.\\" Like Stephen Hall, most of us can shop online sensibly---but for some it provides an easy, anonymous and accessible way to feed their habit. It also provides secrecy---a central part of any addiction. Dr Samantha Haslett, a psychologist and expert in addiction at the Promos counseling centre, said, \\"It's compulsive in the same way as alcohol and gambling, and addicts find themselves completely unable to stop themselves, despite debt mounting and relationships breaking up. It's the thrill and the buzz of purchasing that ignores all the negative consequences.\\" People laugh at shopping addictions, but it's the same as food overeating:bulimicsdon't eat nice stuff, or things that are good for them. Shopping addicts are the same: they'll buy things they don't need or want or like. What they're buying is of no importance compared to the thrill they get spending money and acquiring something new. I've counseled people who have bought piles of bed linen and curtains and just left them piled up in the corner of the room. I have seen people's marriages ruined. There's something more damaging about Internet shopping too because it takes place in the home, so the trick and secrecy is that much closer to the partner who is being tricked. Tennis star Serena Williams this year admitted to kicking an Internet shopping addiction that saw her spending up to six hours a day online in an attempt to avoid being seen out in public. \\"Every day I was in my room and I was online,\\" Williams said. \\"I wasn't able to stop and I bought, bought, bought. I was just out of control.\\" Confidence is also growing in online security. Danny Meadows-Klue, chairman of Interactive Advertising Bureau, the Internet commercial watchdog, said, \\"Online card fraud is a drop in the ocean compared to total credit card fraud, but it is increasing. We want to increase consumer confidence by encouraging shoppers to take simple steps to protect themselves.\\" But there are still barriers to online shopping, declares James Goudie, a consumer psychologist at North Umbria University. \\"For certain items some people prefer to shop personally, for example to try on an item of clothing and feel the quality. Payment of delivery charges is also _ .\\" Question: It can be learned from the passage that _ .

PUBLISHED:. 12:31 EST, 31 October 2013. |. UPDATED:. 12:31 EST, 31 October 2013. Hallmark has provoked outrage and ridicule from its customers after changing the words of a traditional Christmal carol on a festive ornament. The gaudy, red sweater ornament has dropped the word 'gay' for the word 'fun' in the lyric from the 19th-century carol Deck The Halls. The original line - 'Don we now our gay apparel' - has been altered by the Kansas-City based company for its new line of holiday merchandise. It now reads: 'Don we now our FUN apparel.' Break from tradition: Hallmark released this sweater ornament as part of its holiday line, changing the words of carol Deck The Halls to: 'Don we now our FUN apparel!' The ornament of the holiday sweater, decorated with bells, bow and priced at 12.95, is described as: 'When it comes to Christmas sweaters, gaudy can be good! Hang up this flashy sweater to make your tree's outfit complete. 'With its catchy phrase, Don we now our FUN apparel! everyone will be in on the joke.' Deck the Halls is a traditional Christmas carol with the tune dating back to 16th century Wales when it was called Nos Galan. The English lyrics were composed by the Scottish musician Thomas Oliphant in the late 19th century (although the 'fa la la' comes from the original Welsh). Carols were originally intended to be dances and not songs - and initially frowned upon by the church. Deck The Halls first appeared in the Pennsylvania School Journal in 1877 and was described as a 'Welsh air'. It has remained popular during the holidays ever since. In 1999, country music group SHeDAISY released a version of the song for Disney film Mickey's Once Upon a Christmas. Deck The Halls is also the title of a 2006 comedy starring Danny DeVito, Matthew Broderick and Kristin Davis. However the break with the traditional carol sparked anger among Hallmark customers who took to the company's Facebook page to complain. Val Buoni posted on Thursday: 'Hallmark has just made my boycott list for the idiotic change of lyrics in Deck the Halls. I will NEVER purchase anything from Hallmark again. 'Furthermore your ridiculous attempt at political correctness assumes that homosexuals dress differently. So you've alienated Christians as well as homosexuals.....good job Hallmark.' Paul J Kettle Jr added: 'I. am disturbed to hear that you have removed the long-standing word \\"gay\\" from your ornament. Had you not taken the politically-motivated. stance, nobody would have noticed or complained. 'Now, you have brought. this to the fore you are attracting attention, mostly negative. I have. used Hallmark exclusively for cards over many years, but I am thinking. now of migrating to another brand.' Customer Thomas F Reynolds blasted the company: 'We just cut up our gold crown card we have had forever. Keep rewriting Christmas carols and you will end up filing for bankruptcy. Disgraceful!' In a statement today, the company said:. 'Hallmark created this year's Holiday Sweater ornament in the spirit of. fun. When the lyrics to \\"Deck the Halls\\" were translated from Gaelic and. published in English back in the 1800s, the word \\"gay\\" meant festive or. merry. Hallmark customers were quick to post their outrage on the company's Facebook page on Thursday. Another Hallmark customer with a gold crown rewards card slammed the retailer for their decision to change a Christmas carol. Today it has multiple meanings, which we thought could leave our intent open to misinterpretation. The trend of wearing festively decorated Christmas sweaters to parties is all about fun, and this ornament is intended to play into that, so the planning team decided to say what we meant: \\"fun.\\" 'That's the spirit we intended and the spirit in which we hope ornament buyers will take it.'

In week 5, the Bears recorded the highest margin of victory of the season, defeating the Jacksonville Jaguars 41-3. In the first quarter, the Bears scored first on a Robbie Gould 32-yard field goal, though Jacksonville would respond in the next quarter on Josh Scobee's 31-yard kick. In the second half, the Bears broke the deadlock by kicking another field goal and cornerback Charles Tillman returning a Blaine Gabbert interception 36 yards for a touchdown, breaking former Bears safety Mike Brown's franchise record for the most pick-sixes in a career. Tillman also tied Donnell Woolford for the most interceptions by a cornerback in team history. In the fourth quarter, the Bears scored on Jay Cutler's 10-yard touchdown pass to Alshon Jeffery. Chicago would then extend their lead on Cutler's 24-yard pass to Brandon Marshall to increase the lead to 27-3. Bears linebacker Lance Briggs would then intercept Gabbert and score on a 36-yard return. Briggs and Tillman would become the first pair in league history to return interceptions for touchdowns in consecutive games, and the Bears became the first team in NFL history to return five interceptions for touchdowns in the first five games of a season. The Bears would close out the game with backup running back Armando Allen scoring on a 46-yard touchdown run. The victory improved the team's record to 4-1. The victory is the most lopsided win for the Bears since their 1985 44-0 victory over the Cowboys, and the 38 points scored in the second half are the most since the team scoring 49 second half points in the 1941 win over the Philadelphia Eagles.

Information: - A civil war, also known as an intrastate war in polemology, is a war between organized groups within the same state or country, or, less commonly, between two countries created from a formerly united state. The aim of one side may be to take control of the country or a region, to achieve independence for a region or to change government policies. The term is a calque of the Latin \\"bellum civile\\" which was used to refer to the various civil wars of the Roman Republic in the 1st century BC. - Marines, also known as a marine corps or naval infantry, are an infantry force that specializes in the support of naval and army operations at sea and on land, as well as the execution of their own operations. In the majority of countries, the marine force is part of the navy, but it can also be under the army like the \\"Troupes de marine\\" (French Marines) and \\"Givati Brigade\\" (Israeli Marines), or form an independent armed service branch like the United States Marine Corps. - The Confederate States, officially the Confederate States of America (CSA or C.S.), commonly referred to as the Confederacy, was an unrecognized breakaway country of 11 secessionist slave states existing from 1861 to 1865. It was originally formed by seven slave states South Carolina, Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, and Texas in the Lower South region of the United States whose regional economy was mostly dependent upon agriculture, particularly cotton, and a plantation system that relied upon the labor of African-American slaves. - A general officer is an officer of high rank in the army, and in some nations' air forces or marines. - Nathaniel Prentice (or Prentiss) Banks (January 30, 1816 September 1, 1894) was an American politician from Massachusetts and a Union general during the Civil War. - The Battle of Cedar Mountain, also known as Slaughter's Mountain or Cedar Run, took place on August 9, 1862, in Culpeper County, Virginia, as part of the American Civil War. Union forces under Maj. Gen. Nathaniel P. Banks attacked Confederate forces under Maj. Gen. Thomas J. \\"Stonewall\\" Jackson near Cedar Mountain as the Confederates marched on Culpeper Court House to forestall a Union advance into central Virginia. After nearly being driven from the field in the early part of the battle, a Confederate counterattack broke the Union lines resulting in a Confederate victory. The battle was the first combat of the Northern Virginia Campaign. - The American Civil War was a civil war in the United States fought from 1861 to 1865. The Union faced secessionists in eleven Southern states grouped together as the Confederate States of America. The Union won the war, which remains the bloodiest in U.S. history. - The Northern Virginia Campaign, also known as the Second Bull Run Campaign or Second Manassas Campaign, was a series of battles fought in Virginia during August and September 1862 in the Eastern Theater of the American Civil War. Confederate General Robert E. Lee followed up his successes of the Seven Days Battles in the Peninsula Campaign by moving north toward Washington, D.C., and defeating Maj. Gen. John Pope and his Army of Virginia. - The American Revolutionary War (17751783), also referred to as the American War of Independence and the Revolutionary War in the United States, was an armed conflict between Great Britain and thirteen of its North American colonies that after onset of the war declared independence as the United States of America. - The Continental Army was formed by the Second Continental Congress after the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War by the colonies that became the United States of America. Established by a resolution of the Congress on June 14, 1775, it was created to coordinate the military efforts of the Thirteen Colonies in their revolt against the rule of Great Britain. The Continental Army was supplemented by local militias and troops that remained under control of the individual states or were otherwise independent. General George Washington was the commander-in-chief of the army throughout the war. - Secession (derived from the Latin term \\"secessio\\") is the withdrawal of a group from a larger entity, especially a political entity (a country), but also any organization, union or military alliance. Threats of secession can also be a strategy for achieving more limited goals. - Charles Sidney Winder ( October 18 , 1829 -- August 9 , 1862 ) , was a career United States Army officer and a Confederate general officer in the American Civil War . He was killed in action during the Battle of Cedar Mountain . - The United States Army (USA) is the largest branch of the United States Armed Forces and performs land-based military operations. It is one of the seven uniformed services of the United States and is designated as the Army of the United States in the United States Constitution, Article 2, Section 2, Clause 1 and United States Code, Title 10, Subtitle B, Chapter 301, Section 3001. As the largest and senior branch of the U.S. military, the modern U.S. Army has its roots in the Continental Army, which was formed (14 June 1775) to fight the American Revolutionary War (17751783)before the U.S. was established as a country. After the Revolutionary War, the Congress of the Confederation created the United States Army on 3 June 1784, to replace the disbanded Continental Army. The United States Army considers itself descended from the Continental Army, and dates its institutional inception from the origin of that armed force in 1775. - The United States of America has seven federal uniformed services that commission officers as defined by Title 10, and subsequently structured and organized by Title 10, Title 14, Title 32 and Title 42 of the United States Code. - The Congress of the Confederation, or the Confederation Congress, formally referred to as the United States in Congress Assembled, was the governing body of the United States of America that existed from March 1, 1781, to March 4, 1789. It comprised delegates appointed by the legislatures or assemblies of the several states. It was preceded by the Second Continental Congress (17751781) and governed under the newly adopted \\"Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union\\", which were proposed 17761777, adopted by the Continental Congress in July 1778 and finally agreed to by a unanimous vote of all thirteen states by 1781, held up by a long dispute over the cession of western territories beyond the Appalachian Mountains to the central government led by Maryland and a coalition of smaller states without western claims. The newly reorganized Congress at the time continued to refer itself as the Continental Congress throughout its eight-year history, although modern historians separate it from the earlier bodies, which operated under slightly different rules and procedures until the later part of American Revolutionary War. The membership of the Second Continental Congress automatically carried over to the Congress of the Confederation when the latter was created by the ratification of the Articles of Confederation. It had the same secretary as the Second Continental Congress, namely Charles Thomson. The Congress of the Confederation was succeeded by the Congress of the United States as provided for in the Constitution of the United States, proposed September 17, 1787, in Philadelphia and ratified by the states through 1787 to 1788 and even into 1789 and 1790. - Virginia (, officially the Commonwealth of Virginia) is a state located in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States, as well as in the historic Southeast. Virginia is nicknamed the \\"Old Dominion\\" due to its status as the first colonial possession established in mainland British America, and \\"Mother of Presidents\\" because eight U.S. presidents were born there, more than any other state. The geography and climate of the Commonwealth are shaped by the Blue Ridge Mountains and the Chesapeake Bay, which provide habitat for much of its flora and fauna. The capital of the Commonwealth is Richmond; Virginia Beach is the most populous city, and Fairfax County is the most populous political subdivision. The Commonwealth's estimated population is over 8.3 million, which is slightly less than New York City. - The Code of Laws of the United States of America (variously abbreviated to Code of Laws of the United States, United States Code, U.S. Code, or U.S.C.) is the official compilation and codification of the general and permanent federal statutes of the United States. It contains 52 titles, and a further three titles have been proposed. The main edition is published every six years by the Office of the Law Revision Counsel of the House of Representatives, and cumulative supplements are published annually. The official version of those laws not codified in the United States Code can be found in United States Statutes at Large.

Q:Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the last name of the person who was arrested for disobedience by the duke in Weimar? As far as we know, the earliest cantatas of Johann Sebastian Bach were performed in Mühlhausen from 1706 to 1708. He was employed as an organist there, but he occasionally composed cantatas, mostly for special occasions. The cantatas were based mainly on biblical texts and hymns, such as Aus der Tiefen rufe ich, Herr, zu dir, BWV 131 (a psalm setting), and the Easter chorale cantata Christ lag in Todes Banden, BWV 4. Bach was next appointed organist and chamber musician in Weimar on 25 June 1708 at the court of the co-reigning dukes in Saxe-Weimar, Wilhelm Ernst and his nephew Ernst August. He initially concentrated on the organ, composing major works for the instrument, including the Orgelbüchlein, the Toccata and Fugue in D minor, BWV 565, and the Prelude and Fugue in E major, BWV 566. He was promoted to Konzertmeister on 2 March 1714, an honour that entailed performing a church cantata monthly in the Schlosskirche. The first cantatas he composed in the new position were Himmelskönig, sei willkommen, BWV 182, for Palm Sunday, Weinen, Klagen, Sorgen, Zagen, BWV 12 for Jubilate Sunday, and Erschallet, ihr Lieder, BWV 172, for Pentecost. Mostly inspired by texts by the court poet, Salomo Franck, they contain recitatives and arias. When Johann Samuel Drese, the Kapellmeister (director of music), died in 1716, Bach hoped in vain to become his successor. Bach looked for a better position and found it as Kapellmeister at the court of Leopold, Prince of Anhalt-Köthen. However, the duke in Weimar did not dismiss him and arrested him for disobedience. He was released on 2 December 1717.In Köthen, Bach found an employer who was an enthusiastic musician himself. The court was Calvinist, therefore Bach's work from this period was mostly secular, including the orchestral suites, the cello suites, the sonatas and partitas for solo violin, and the Brandenburg Concertos. He composed secular cantatas for the court for occasions such as New Year's Day and the prince's birthday, including Die Zeit, die Tag und Jahre macht, BWV... A:","completion":"The last name of the person who was arrested for disobedience by the duke in Weimar is Bach.

WASHINGTON — U.S. President Barack Obama has shortened the sentences of 214 inmates of U.S. federal prisons, in what the White House called the largest batch of commutations on a single day in more than a century. The early release is part of Obama's effort to correct what he views as unreasonably long mandatory minimum sentences. The president's push to lessen the burden on nonviolent drug offenders reflects his long-stated view that the nation should remedy the consequences of decades of onerous sentencing rules, which have put tens of thousands of Americans behind bars for far too long. Among those affected by Wednesday's presidential order were 67 individuals serving life sentences - almost all for nonviolent drug crimes, although a few also were charged with firearms violations related to their drug activities. To date, Obama has granted 562 commutations, more than the previous nine presidents combined, and more clemency actions that by any other president in nearly a century. White House counsel Neil Eggleston said in the White House blog that Obama examines each clemency application on its specific merits to identify the appropriate relief, including whether the prisoner would be helped by additional drug treatment, educational programs or counseling. Presidents tend to use their powers to commute sentences or issue pardons more frequently near the end of their terms of office. Administration officials said the rapid pace will continue before Obama's leaves the White House in January 2017. \\"We are not done yet,\\" Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates said. \\"We expect that many more men and women will be given a second chance through the clemency initiative.\\" Obama has long called for phasing out strict sentences for drug offenses, arguing they lead to excessive punishment and incarceration rates unseen in other developed countries. With presidential support, the Justice Department in recent years has directed prosecutors to rein in the use of harsh mandatory minimums. Eggleston once again called on... What is probably true about Sally Yates? Pick the correct answer from the following options: - She agrees with Obama - not enough information - She disagrees with Obama - She does not want to work for Obama A:","completion":"Based on the text provided, it's likely that Sally Yates agrees with Obama. In the information given, she is quoted saying, \\"We are not done yet,\\" and \\"We expect that many more men and women will be given a second chance through the clemency initiative.\\" This suggests that she is supportive of the measures Obama has taken to shorten the sentences of certain inmates and bring about changes to the sentencing rules of nonviolent drug offenses. This aligns with the policy initiatives and sentencing changes President Obama has enacted. Furthermore, as Deputy Attorney General, Yates would be a key figure in enforcing the legal strategies and initiatives pursued by the administration. The fact that she is actively involved in the administration's efforts to secure more commutations suggests that she is on the same page as Obama in terms of criminal justice reform and related policy matters. While it's wise to note that her exact personal views or sentiments about President Obama are not explicitly expressed in the text, her role, her quoted statement about the progressive work being conducted, and her anticipation of more individuals being given a second chance through the clemency initiative, imply a shared ideology with Obama in this context. Therefore, based on the details shared in the text, the best answer to pick would be that Sally Yates likely agrees with Obama."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

At the Battle of Kay, or Paltzig, the Russian Count Saltykov with 47,000 Russians defeated 26,000 Prussians commanded by General Carl Heinrich von Wedel. Though the Hanoverians defeated an army of 60,000 French at Minden, Austrian general Daun forced the surrender of an entire Prussian corps of 13,000 in the Battle of Maxen. Frederick himself lost half his army in the Battle of Kunersdorf , the worst defeat in his military career and one that drove him to the brink of abdication and thoughts of suicide. The disaster resulted partly from his misjudgment of the Russians, who had already demonstrated their strength at Zorndorf and at Gross-Jägersdorf , and partly from good cooperation between the Russian and Austrian forces.

Definition: In this task, you are given a passage which has a question and the context. You have to generate an answer to the question based on the information present in the context. Input: Context: In advanced cancer, including glioblastoma, the TGFβ pathway acts as an oncogenic factor. Some tumors exhibit aberrantly high TGFβ activity, and the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are not well understood. We have observed that TGFβ can induce TGFβ2, generating an autocrine loop leading to aberrantly high levels of TGFβ2. We identified cAMP-responsive element-binding protein 1 (CREB1) as the critical mediator of the induction of TGFβ2 by TGFβ. CREB1 binds to the TGFB2 gene promoter in cooperation with SMAD3 and is required for TGFβ to activate transcription. Moreover, the PI3K-AKT and RSK pathways regulate the TGFβ2 autocrine loop through CREB1. The levels of CREB1 and active phosphorylated CREB1 correlate with TGFβ2 in glioblastoma. In addition, using patient-derived in vivo models of glioblastoma, we found that CREB1 levels determine the expression of TGFβ2. Our results show that CREB1 can be considered a biomarker to stratify patients for anti-TGFβ treatments and a therapeutic target in glioblastoma.Question: Does active CREB1 promote a malignant TGFβ2 autocrine loop in glioblastoma?

Early in chapter 5 we introduced, along with Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, two other men who became operational coordinators for al Qaeda: Khallad and Nashiri. As we explained, both were involved during 1998 and 1999 in preparing to attack a ship off the coast of Yemen with a boatload of explosives. They had originally targeted a commercial vessel, specifically an oil tanker, but Bin Laden urged them to look for a U.S.warship instead. In January 2000, their team had attempted to attack a warship in the port of Aden, but the attempt failed when the suicide boat sank. More than nine months later, on October 12,2000, al Qaeda operatives in a small boat laden with explosives attacked a U.S. Navy destroyer, the USS Cole. The blast ripped a hole in the side of the Cole, killing 17 members of the ship's crew and wounding at least 40. The plot, we now know, was a full-fledged al Qaeda operation, supervised directly by Bin Laden. He chose the target and location of the attack, selected the suicide operatives, and provided the money needed to purchase explosives and equipment. Nashiri was the field commander and managed the operation in Yemen. Khallad helped in Yemen until he was arrested in a case of mistaken identity and freed with Bin Laden's help, as we also mentioned earlier. Local al Qaeda coordinators included Jamal al Badawi and Fahd al Quso, who was supposed to film the attack from a nearby apartment. The two suicide operatives chosen were Hassan al Khamri and Ibrahim al Thawar, also known as Nibras.

In September 2000, Bin Laden reportedly told Nashiri that he wanted to replace Khamri and Nibras.

Options: - forest - rainforest - san francisco - state park - university Explain why a human would choose \\"san francisco\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","completion":"A human might choose \\"San Francisco\\" as the answer to where a tree hugger is likely to reside for several reasons. Although the term \\"tree hugger\\" often refers to an environmental enthusiast or someone who shows a deep concern for preserving nature, it can also refer to a person who is highly involved in environmental movements, which are often associated with specific urban locations. San Francisco has been well known for its history of progressive social activism and embrace of counterculture movements. Additionally, the city and the surrounding Bay Area have a strong environmental conservation culture, supported by political policies, events, and organizations that advocate for green initiatives and sustainable living. Furthermore, San Francisco offers easy access to world-class nature reserves such as Redwood National Park and Muir Woods, which allows environmentally conscious residents to enjoy and engage with nature directly. While forests, rainforests, state parks, and universities might also attract environmentally minded individuals who care for the preservation of nature, these locations do not necessarily provide the same type of social and cultural context that San Francisco does. Hence, a person focusing on broader environmental and social aspects related to \\"tree-huggers\\" might choose San Francisco as the most likely place for them to reside."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Richard Melville Hall (born September 11, 1965), better known by his stage name Moby, is an American musician, DJ, record producer, singer, songwriter, photographer and animal rights activist. He is well known for his electronic music, veganism and support of animal rights. Moby has sold over 20 million records worldwide. AllMusic considers him \\"one of the most important dance music figures of the early 1990s, helping bring the music to a mainstream audience both in the UK and in America\\". In January 2010, Moby announced that he was to begin working on his next record. He said \\"the mood for this record will be more acoustic and less electronic than before\\". Around this time Moby started a heavy metal band with his friend Phil Costello, Diamondsnake, getting back to his roots. Diamondsnake released two albums on Facebook. On February 15, 2011, Moby announced the release of his new album, Destroyed. It was released on May 16, 2011. A photography book with the same name was also released around the time of the album. \\"Musically\\", he said, \\"it's very melodic and atmospheric and electronic, and if i had to sum it up i would describe it as: 'broken down melodic electronic music for empty cities at 2 a.m'.\\" The album cover, which was released with the new information, was taken in LaGuardia Airport. It is a picture of a sign that reads 'destroyed', part of the longer phrase \\"All unclaimed baggage will be destroyed.\\" The album consists of 15 tracks, one of them previously featured on the compilation A Night in NYC, titled \\"Rockets\\". Along with the album's announcement came the release of the EP Be the One, which contains 3 of the tracks from Destroyed The EP was released free for those who signed up for Moby's mailing list. For the next single, Moby put a poll on his website for fans to choose which single should be released next, and it came to be \\"Lie Down in Darkness\\". On August 30, Moby posted another request for the third official single, this time asking fans to say which should be next, without a poll. After this, he announced the following day through his Twitter that the next singles are \\"After\\" and \\"The Right Thing\\". On April 30, 2012, Moby released Destroyed Remixed, a limited edition 2CD collection of remixes of songs from the 2011 studio album, Destroyed. The release included three new exclusive remixes by David Lynch, Holy Ghost!, and System Divine, and also featured a brand new 30 minute ambient track by Moby called 'All Sides Gone'. Compiled and mixed by Moby, Destroyed Remixed was described as 'an eclectic mix of some the most exciting and interesting artists and DJ's in contemporary music'. Between February and August 2013, Moby performed both acoustic and DJ sets at the Wanderlust Festival, which hosted events in Hawaii, Vermont, California and Colorado in the United States, and also in Canada and Chile internationally. He added a single Asia performance date at the 1 World Music Festival in Singapore. Moby also performed two 75-minute DJ sets at the Coachella festival in April which featured a unique visual collaboration with NASA, with various images from space projected onto screens during the performance. Moby followed-up with another DJ set at the Movement Detroit festival in May. For Record Store Day 2013, Moby released a 7-inch record called The Lonely Night which featured former Screaming Trees vocalist Mark Lanegan. An accompanying video was created by Colin Rich, of which Moby stated: \\"I'm really excited to have an experimental music video from this great video artist, and I feel like the slow, rich, and languorous desert visuals fit the song perfectly.\\" The track was subsequently released as a download with remixes by Photek, Gregor Tresher, Freescha and Moby himself. In July, Moby announced that he would be releasing a new studio album entitled Innocents. The album had been written and recorded in the previous 18 months and was due for release in October. The album was recorded in Moby's apartment and features a number of guest vocalists, in keeping with earlier releases such as Play, 18 and Wait For Me. As with Destroyed, the photographs comprising the album's artwork were all shot by Moby. The first official single from the album is titled A Case for Shame while the previously released track The Lonely Night will also appear on Innocents. The album was produced by Grammy-winner Mark 'Spike' Stent. It was later revealed in August that The Perfect Life, which features Wayne Coyne, would be the next single, after a casting call for a music video was announced, calling \\"for obese Speedo-sporting bikers, nude rollerskating ghosts, and an S&M gimp proficient in rhythmic gymnastics\\" Moby performed a DJ set in Las Vegas on September 1, before flying to Australia to DJ at an intimate show in Sydney, on the 19th. Moby will then DJ at the 10th annual Decibel Festival in Seattle. He then returned to Los Angeles to perform three shows at the Fonda Theatre on October 3-5 to promote the album, which would be his only \\"full live shows\\" for 2013 and 2014. Moby stated that the reason for doing little to no touring for this album was that \\"when I go on tour I sit around a lot (cars, airports, hotels, etc), and when I sit around I can't spend my time making music. And pretty much all I want to do in life is stay home and make music. So, thus: a 3 date world tour.\\" He conceded that he might return to world touring in the future. Starting in around 2001, Moby launched a series of co-owned business ventures, with the two most prominent being the \\"Little Idiot Collective\\"--a New York City, U.S. bricks-and-mortar clothing store, comics store, and animation studio that sold the work of an \\"illustrators collective\\"--and a small restaurant and tea shop called Teany. Teany was cofounded in 2002 with his ex-girlfriend Kelly Tisdale. In a November 2006 interview, at which time he had removed himself from any previous business projects. In November 2015 Moby opened the Vegan bistro Little Pine in the Silver Lake neighborhood of Los Angeles, California. The restaurant serves organic, vegan, Mediterranean-inspired dishes and has a retail section with art and books, curated by Moby himself. Moby's vision was to create a space that includes various aspects of society that he cares about. All of the restaurant's profits are donated to animal welfare organizations. On August 23rd 2016 Moby announced the inaugural Circle V Festival along with the official video for 'Don't Leave Me' by Moby & The Void Pacific Choir. The event took place at LA's Fonda Theatre and featured Blaqk Audio & Cold Cave on the bill amongst others in the evening and talks and vegan food stalls in the afternoon. Moby described Circle V as \\"the coming together of my life's work, animal rights and music. I couldn't be more excited about this event and am so proud to be head-lining.\\" The second Circle V event took place on November 18th this time at The Regent Theatre in Los Angeles. Moby headlined the event for the second year with artists Waka Flocka Flame, Dreamcar and Raury featuring on the bill.

Arsène Wenger and Arsenal team in clear-the-air talks after drubbing Arsenal's players and management held clear-the-air talks at the club's Colney training complex on Sunday to digest the team's thrashing at Chelsea and focus on reviving the club's ailing title challenge against Swansea City in midweek. The capitulation in Arsène Wenger's 1,000th game in charge left Arsenal seven points adrift of their London rivals before Tuesday's visit of Swansea, and the manager is concerned at the manner in which his team have surrendered so meekly against the elite teams. The Frenchman has seen his team ship six goals at Manchester City and Chelsea, and five at Liverpool, all in Saturday lunchtime kick-offs, to leave their attempts to secure a first title since 2004 apparently forlorn before City's visit to the Emirates Stadium on Saturday. Wenger had revealed after Saturday's humiliation that he and his squad had \\"to think deeply about [the loss] because it is not the first time\\" they had disintegrated in such a manner, with the manager accepting responsibility for the embarrassment. His players reported back for a light warm-down session on Sundayand, while team meetings are not unusual after games, the issues thrown up by the crippling disappointment across the capital were discussed as a group with key games to come. \\"I don't think our chances are over,\\" said the club captain, Thomas Vermaelen. \\"There are still a few games to play and, in England, you can do anything. I've learned that. You can easily come back even from behind. The teams are all so strong that anyone can beat anyone, so we must continue to believe in it and move on.\\" Vermaelen is expected to start against the Welsh club with Laurent Koscielny suffering from a calf complaint that forced him off at half-time on Saturday, though Arsenal may have both Kieran Gibbs and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain available for the match despite the full-back's farcical sending off in the midfielder's stead. Gibbs was dismissed by the referee, Andre Marriner, for deliberate handball after it was deemed he had denied Chelsea a clear goalscoring opportunity, despite the fact it was Oxlade-Chamberlain who had touched Eden Hazard's 15th-minute shot round the post. That case of mistaken identity will be rectified on Monday, though Arsenal also intend to appeal against the midfielder's prospective one-match ban given Hazard's shot appeared to be flying wide and was therefore not a scoring chance. Marriner, who had ignored Oxlade-Chamberlain's admission of guilt on the pitch, apologised to Wenger and Gibbs once he had been made aware of his error and will discover on Monday whether he is to officiate in the top flight next weekend. The visitors were already 2-0 down at the time and went on to concede another four goals to register the joint-heaviest defeat of Wenger's tenure in his landmark match. \\"It leaves it in a very bad situation,\\" said Wenger. \\"But we want to respond. When you don't turn up in a game of that stature, nobody takes it easy. We have to win the next game and focus on that, to give a strong response. It is going to be tough now, very, very tough, but we have to respond quickly because we are in a situation where, after such a disappointment, the next games become vital. \\"We felt we prepared properly with the intensity we did but we did not turn up for our game of the season, so it is puzzling. We were never even in it. After 20 minutes it was game over and it became a long afternoon, a long, dramatic, dreadful afternoon. We were shocked and knocked down. The team is healthy and willing but still the way it happened … we have to think deeply about it because it's not the first time. You could blame and blame but it does not help. What is important now is weshow we have the capacity to respond.\\" Wenger, who has cancelled his pre-match media duties on Monday, has an FA Cup semi-final against Wigan Athletic to come and is still expected to sign a new contract at Arsenal at the end of the season, with his current deal running down to its conclusion. Yet there is a recognition within his squad that some steel must be mustered before Saturday's game against City, with a response against Swansea vital to rebuild confidence. \\"I don't know why but it looks like we don't fancy early kick-offs away,\\" said Per Mertesacker. \\"It looks like we are going to have to apply to the Football Association to not play at 12.45 away. That would help us a lot. But we must put this behind us now show our character and bounce back against Swansea. It's a good opportunity to react quickly after this result.\\" What is a short summary of the above article?","completion":"Arsenal's players and management held clear-the-air talks following their defeat to Chelsea and focused on reviving the club's title challenge against Swansea City in midweek.

In the past,concern about a man-made warming of the earth has concentrated on the Arctic because the Antarctic is much colder and has a much thicker ice sheet.But the weather experts are now paying more attention to West Antarctic.which may be affected by only a few degrees of warming,in other words,by a warming on the scale that will possibly take place in the next fifty years from the burning of fuels. Satellite pictures show that large areas of Antarctic ice are already disappearing.The evidence available suggests that a warming has taken place.This fits the theory that carbon dioxide warms the earth. However, most of the fuel is burnt in the northern hemisphere,where temperatures seem to be falling.Scientists conclude,therefore ,that up to now natural influences on the weather have gone beyond those caused by man.The question is:Which natural cause has most effect on the weather? One possibility is the variable behavior of the sun.Astronomers at one research station have studied the hot spots and 'cold' spots (that is, the ly less hot spots)on the sun.As the sun rotates ,every 27.5 days,it presents hotter or colder faces to the earth,and different aspects to different parts of the earth.This seems to have a considerable effect on the distribution of the earth atmospheric pressure,and consequently on wind...

Hint: Carbon dioxide is the most significant long-lived greenhouse gas in Earth's atmosphere.

The paragraph hints that carbon dioxide is the most significant long-lived greenhouse gas in Earth's atmosphere, and its concentration has rapidly increased due to human activities such as the use of fossil fuels and deforestation.

You will probably have to hire a car and you will also lose the value of the contents and accessories in the car. Now comes the solution. An RAC Trackstar system, hidden in one of 47 possible secret locations in your car, is the key of our system. If your car is stolen, radio signals are sent at twenty-second intervals from the car to the RAC Trackstar National Control Center via a satellite network. Then a computer gives the vehicle's exact location, speed and direction. The RAC Trackstar National Control Center, which operates 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, will immediately inform the police in the area where the car is located. Because the police receive information every twenty seconds, they will always know the vehicle's location. Once the thief has been arrested, your car will be returned to you. RAC Trackstar is unique in being able to provide the National Control Center with details of the exact location of your car, its speed and direction. And speed is the key to successful recovery of a stolen vehicle. RAC Trackstar Control will immediately tell the police if you report your car stolen and under the 24-hour Guardian Option. _ will also tell you if your car has been stolen. RAC Trackstar's constant updates mean the police are kept informed of the car's location. All these greatly improve your chances of seeing your car again.

Select from the following. *no. *yes.","completion":"Okay kiddo, let's talk about derivatives! Derivatives tell us how things change. Imagine you're riding your bike, and the speed you're going at every moment is the derivative of your path. Now, let's look at the first question. We have a formula, which is like a recipe, for finding the rate of change (derivative) of e^(2x). We can think of e as a special number, about 2.7-ish, and 2x means we double x every time. So, the derivative of e^(2x) shows how fast it's changing. To find it, we use another formula: the derivative of e^(ax) equals a * e^(ax). So for our problem, derivative of e^(2x) = 2 * e^(2x). Now the second question asks us to prove another formula. It's like showing that every time you add 2 Lego blocks together, you get 4 dots on top. We are asked to prove that the derivative of e^(f(x)) is equal to f'(x) * e^(f(x)). Here, f(x) is any function (like x^2 or 3x), and f'(x) is the derivative of that function. It turns out these two questions are different.

If jet fuels can cause cancer by producing mutations in DNA, then what can cause cancer by producing mutations in DNA? Answer choices: - A drug. - Pesticides - cigarettes - A computer - Toxicity - jet fuel - copper - PDAs A:","completion":"To determine which items from the given list can cause cancer by producing mutations in DNA, we need to evaluate each option based on their potential to cause cellular damage and interact with genetic material. 1. A drug: Some drugs, particularly chemotherapy drugs, can cause DNA damage and potentially lead to cancer. However, most drugs are designed to treat specific conditions and minimize harmful side effects, so only specific drugs could cause cancer by producing mutations in DNA. 2. Pesticides: Some pesticides contain carcinogenic chemicals that can cause DNA mutations when humans are exposed to them directly or indirectly through the food chain. Therefore, pesticides can cause cancer by producing mutations in DNA. 3. Cigarettes: Cigarette smoke contains a multitude of carcinogenic chemicals that can cause DNA damage and lead to cancer. As a result, cigarettes can cause cancer by producing mutations in DNA. 4. A computer: Computers do not emit any substances or radiation known to directly cause DNA mutations, so a computer cannot cause cancer by producing mutations in DNA. 5. Toxicity: Toxic substances, generally, can cause a wide range of cellular damage, including damaging DNA. If the toxic substance is a carcinogen, it can cause cancer by producing mutations in DNA. 6. Jet fuel: The initial statement mentioned that jet fuels can cause cancer by producing mutations in DNA. 7. Copper: In general, copper exposure at normal levels is not considered a carcinogen. However, excessive copper exposure may lead to oxidative stress, which could harm cells and DNA, possibly leading to cancer. But, compared to other options, copper is less likely to cause cancer by producing mutations in DNA. 8. PDAs (Personal Digital Assistants): Similar to computers, PDAs do not emit any substances or radiation known to directly cause DNA mutations, so they cannot cause cancer by producing mutations in DNA.

Answer choices: - It reproduces quickly - hospitalization - decreases - It dies and never comes out - It stays active - It remains dormant - They may not survive. - It helps them survive The answer is:","completion":"It remains dormant. Herpes is a virus that can infect a person and stay dormant in their nerve cells for extended periods without displaying any symptoms. The herpes simplex virus (HSV) has two varieties, HSV-1 (which typically causes oral herpes) and HSV-2 (which usually results in genital herpes). Once the herpes virus enters the body, it travels to the nerve cells and remains in a latent or dormant state. It can reactivate at any time, often triggered by factors such as stress, illness, or immune suppression. When reactivation occurs, the virus travels back down the nerve cells to the skin surface, leading to an outbreak of herpes symptoms. During the dormant phase, the virus remains in the person's body but does not actively replicate or cause symptoms.

Step 1: Understand the information provided by the teacher. The teacher mentioned that \\"cycles of freezing and thawing water cause ice wedging\\" and \\"the fact is that ice seldom freezes or thaws at a uniform rate.\\" It means that ice wedging occurs due to the changes in the state of water, and this process doesn't have a constant rate. Step 2: Analyze the options available. We need to find the option that best represents the fact that ice wedging occurs due to temperature changes and doesn't have a uniform rate. Option 1 mentions \\"In the winter,\\" which only indicates the season and doesn't describe the rate of ice wedging. Option 2, \\"erosion,\\" and option 3, \\"mechanical,\\" are terms related to weathering and the breakdown of rocks but are not specific to the rate of ice wedging. Option 4, \\"Physical weathering,\\" is a broader term for the processes that cause the breakdown of rocks, and ice wedging is one example, but it doesn't describe the rate of ice wedging. Option 5, \\"Dilution,\\" and option 6, \\"friction,\\" are also unrelated to the rate of ice wedging as they describe other processes and forces. Option 7, \\"it fluctuates,\\" suggests that the rate of ice wedging is not constant and depends on the changing conditions, fulfilling both requirements provided in the hints given by the teacher. Option 8, \\"kinetic,\\" refers to the energy of motion and is unrelated to the rate of ice wedging.

Solve this instance: yffffyyyfyiiiy Student:","completion":"Yes, I understand the problem. The task is to find the longest palindrome within the given string. The longest palindrome may be a part of the string rather than the whole string.

However, \\"yffffyyyfy\\" is the largest substring that is a palindrome in the given string, so this should be our returned result. To solve this problem systematically, we could use a programming strategy known as dynamic programming. We essentially set up a 2D array where the cell at the intersection of row i and column j indicates whether the substring from i to j is a palindrome. We start by setting all single character substrings to be palindromes and then gradually examine larger and larger substrings, updating our table as we go. Once we have our table, we simply need to find the longest substring that we marked as a palindrome. But in general, without using any program, the idea is to search through the string from both forward and backward to see whether the characters match or not. If they do, continue the search until no match or the end of substring is reached.

To answer the question, we must delve deeper into the history of the Olympics and the changes in eligibility rules concerning professional athletes. The modern Olympic Games, established in 1896, were originally intended to showcase the talents of amateur athletes, as they were concerned with the principles of fair play, sportsmanship, and recreation. However, over time, as professional athletes became more prominent and the distinction between amateurs and professionals started to blur, these restrictions began to pose challenges for many Olympic sports. As a result, eligibility rules have evolved over the years to accommodate these changes. One of the key moments in this evolution occurred in 1971 when the International Olympic Committee (IOC) amended the definition of amateurism, allowing professional athletes to participate in certain sports, like tennis, provided they did not receive monetary compensation. This decision marked the beginning of a shift in the rules regarding professional participation. The most significant change came in 1986, when the IOC decided to adopt a sports-specific approach, meaning that the international federation governing each sport could determine its criteria for eligibility. Consequently, this allowed professional athletes to participate in the Summer Olympics, provided they met the specific eligibility requirements set forth by their respective sport's governing body. For example, in basketball, the International Basketball Federation (FIBA) began allowing professional athletes to compete in the Summer Olympics starting in 1992—this gave rise to the famous USA \\"Dream Team.\\" In summary, the sentence provided does not directly address the question of when professional players were allowed to play in the Summer Olympics. The timeline for allowing professionals to participate varies based on the specific sport and the decisions made by the respective international sports governing bodies. However, the major turning point when the IOC began to accept professionals in general occurred in 1986."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: Information: - Titanium is a chemical element with symbol Ti and atomic number 22. It is a lustrous transition metal with a silver color, low density, and high strength. Titanium is resistant to corrosion in sea water, aqua regia, and chlorine. - Nitrogen is a chemical element with symbol N and atomic number 7. It was first discovered and isolated by Scottish physician Daniel Rutherford in 1772. Although Carl Wilhelm Scheele and Henry Cavendish had independently done so at about the same time, Rutherford is generally accorded the credit because his work was published first. The name \\"nitrogen\\" was suggested by Jean-Antoine-Claude Chaptal in 1790, when it was found that nitrogen was present in nitric acid and nitrates; this name derives from the Greek roots \\"nitre\\" and - \\"to form\\". Antoine Lavoisier suggested instead the name \\"azote\\", from the Greek \\"no life\\", as it is an asphyxiant gas; his name is instead used in many languages, such as French, Russian, and Turkish, and appears in the English names of some nitrogen compounds such as hydrazine, azides and azo compounds. - Lead, from the Old English \\"léad\\", is a chemical element with atomic number 82 and symbol Pb (after the Latin, \\"plumbum\\"). It has the second highest atomic number of all practically stable elements. As such, lead is located at the end of some decay chains of heavier elements, which in part accounts for its relative abundance: its stability exceeds those of other similarly-numbered elements. Lead is a soft, malleable, and heavy metal. Freshly cut lead has a bluish-white color that soon tarnishes to a dull grayish color when exposed to air; as a liquid, it has a shiny chrome-silver luster. Lead's density of 11.34 g/cm exceeds those of most common materials. - Helium is a chemical element with symbol He and atomic number 2. It is a colorless, odorless, tasteless, non-toxic, inert, monatomic gas, the first in the noble gas group in the periodic table. Its boiling point is the lowest among all the elements. - Hydrazine is an inorganic compound with the chemical formula (also written ). A simple pnictogen hydride, it is a colorless flammable liquid with an ammonia-like odor. Hydrazine is highly toxic and dangerously unstable unless handled in solution. , approximately 120,000 tons of hydrazine hydrate (corresponding to a 64% solution of hydrazine in water by weight) were manufactured worldwide per year. Hydrazine is mainly used as a foaming agent in preparing polymer foams, but significant applications also include its uses as a precursor to polymerization catalysts and pharmaceuticals. Additionally, hydrazine is used in various rocket fuels and to prepare the gas precursors used in air bags. Hydrazine is used within both nuclear and conventional electrical power plant steam cycles as an oxygen scavenger to control concentrations of dissolved oxygen in an effort to reduce corrosion. Anhydrous hydrazine is corrosive towards glass, in a manner similar to hydrofluoric acid. - Turkey, officially the Republic of Turkey (Turkish: ), is a transcontinental country in Eurasia, mainly in Anatolia in Western Asia, with a smaller portion on the Balkan peninsula in Southeast Europe. Turkey is a democratic, secular, unitary, parliamentary republic with a diverse cultural heritage. Turkey is bordered by eight countries: Greece to the west; Bulgaria to the northwest; Georgia to the northeast; Armenia, the Azerbaijani exclave of Nakhchivan and Iran to the east; and Iraq and Syria to the south. The Aegean Sea is to the west, the Black Sea to the north, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. The Bosphorus, the Sea of Marmara, and the Dardanelles, which together form the Turkish Straits, divide Thrace and Anatolia; they also separate Europe and Asia. Turkey's location has given it geopolitical and strategic importance throughout history. - Potassium is a chemical element with symbol K (derived from Neo-Latin, \\"kalium\\") and atomic number 19. It was first isolated from potash, the ashes of plants, from which its name derives. In the periodic table, potassium is one of the alkali metals. All of the alkali metals have a single valence electron in the outer electron shell, which is easily removed to create an ion with a positive charge a cation, which combines with anions to form salts. Potassium in nature occurs only in ionic salts. Elemental potassium is a soft silvery-white alkali metal that oxidizes rapidly in air and reacts vigorously with water, generating sufficient heat to ignite hydrogen emitted in the reaction and burning with a lilac-colored flame. It is found dissolved in sea water (which is 0.04% potassium by weight), and is part of many minerals. - The chalcogens are the chemical elements in group 16 of the periodic table. This group is also known as the oxygen family. It consists of the elements oxygen (O), sulfur (S), selenium (Se), tellurium (Te), and the radioactive element polonium (Po). The chemically uncharacterized synthetic element livermorium (Lv) is predicted to be a chalcogen as well. Often, oxygen is treated separately from the other chalcogens, sometimes even excluded from the scope of the term \\"chalcogen\\" altogether, due to its very different chemical behavior from sulfur, selenium, tellurium, and polonium. The word \\"chalcogen\\" is derived from a combination of the Greek word \\"khalks\\" () principally meaning copper (the term was also used for bronze/brass, any metal in the poetic sense, ore or coin), and the Latinised Greek word \\"gens\\", meaning \\"born\\" or \\"produced\\". - Color (American English) or colour (Commonwealth English) is the characteristic of human visual perception described through color \\"categories\\", with names such as red, yellow, purple, or bronze. This perception of color derives from the stimulation of cone cells in the human eye by electromagnetic radiation in the spectrum of light. Color categories and physical specifications of color are associated with objects through the wavelength of the light that is reflected from them. This reflection is governed by the object's physical properties such as light absorption, emission spectra, etc. Human trichromacy is the basis for all modern color spaces that assign colors numerical coordinates and associate corresponding distances between colors. - Boron is a chemical element with symbol B and atomic number 5. Produced entirely by cosmic ray spallation and supernovae and not by stellar nucleosynthesis, it is a low-abundance element in the Solar system and in the Earth's crust. Boron is concentrated on Earth by the water-solubility of its more common naturally occurring compounds, the borate minerals. These are mined industrially as evaporites, such as borax and kernite. The largest known boron deposits are in Turkey, the largest producer of boron minerals. - Silicon is a chemical element with symbol Si and atomic number 14. A hard and brittle crystalline solid with a blue-gray metallic luster, it is a tetravalent metalloid. It is a member of group 14 in the periodic table, along with carbon above it and germanium, tin, lead, and flerovium below. It is rather unreactive, though less so than germanium, and has great chemical affinity for oxygen; as such, it was first prepared and characterized in pure form only in 1823 by Jöns Jakob Berzelius. - Chromium trioxide is an inorganic compound with the formula CrO. It is the acidic anhydride of chromic acid, and is sometimes marketed under the same name. This compound is a dark-purple solid under anhydrous conditions, bright orange when wet and which dissolves in water concomitant with hydrolysis. Millions of kilograms are produced annually, mainly for electroplating. Chromium trioxide is a powerful oxidiser and a suspected carcinogen. - Pollucite is a zeolite mineral with the formula (Cs,Na)AlSiO·2HO with iron, calcium, rubidium and potassium as common substituting elements. It is important as a significant ore of caesium and sometimes rubidium. It forms a solid solution series with analcime. It crystallizes in the isometric - hexoctahedral crystal system as colorless, white, gray, or rarely pink and blue masses. Well formed crystals are rare. It has a Mohs hardness of 6.5 and a specific gravity of 2.9. It has a brittle fracture and no cleavage. - The term chromic acid is usually used for a mixture made by adding concentrated sulfuric acid to a dichromate, which may contain a variety of compounds, including solid chromium trioxide. This kind of chromic acid may be used as a cleaning mixture for glass. Chromic acid may also refer to the molecular species, HCrO of which the trioxide is the anhydride. Chromic acid features chromium in an oxidation state of +6 (or VI). It is a strong and corrosive oxidising agent. - Sulfuric acid (alternative spelling sulphuric acid) is a highly corrosive strong mineral acid with the molecular formula HSO and molecular weight 98.079 g/mol. It is a pungent-ethereal, colorless to slightly yellow viscous liquid that is soluble in water at all concentrations. Sometimes, it is dyed dark brown during production to alert people to its hazards. The historical name of this acid is oil of vitriol. - Caesium or cesium is a chemical element with symbol Cs and atomic number 55. It is a soft, silvery-gold (or, according to some, silver/colorless) alkali metal with a melting point of 28.5 °C (83.3 °F), which makes it one of only five elemental metals that are liquid at or near room temperature. Caesium is an alkali metal and has physical and chemical properties similar to those of rubidium and potassium. The metal is extremely reactive and pyrophoric, reacting with water even at 116 °C (177 °F). It is the least electronegative element. It has only one stable isotope, caesium-133. Caesium is mined mostly from pollucite, while the radioisotopes, especially caesium-137, a fission product, are extracted from waste produced by nuclear reactors. - Rust is an iron oxide, usually red oxide formed by the redox reaction of iron and oxygen in the presence of water or air moisture. Several forms of rust are distinguishable both visually and by spectroscopy, and form under different circumstances. Rust consists of hydrated iron(III) oxides FeO·\\"n\\"HO and iron(III) oxide-hydroxide (FeO(OH), Fe(OH)). - Tin is a chemical element with the symbol Sn (for ) and atomic number 50, is a post-transition metal in group 14 of the periodic table. It is obtained chiefly from the mineral cassiterite, which contains tin dioxide, SnO. Tin shows a chemical similarity to both of its neighbors in group 14, germanium and lead, and has two main oxidation states, +2 and the slightly more stable +4. Tin is the 49th most abundant element and has, with 10 stable isotopes, the largest number of stable isotopes in the periodic table, thanks to its magic number of protons. It has two main allotropes: at room temperature, the stable allotrope is -tin, a silvery-white, malleable metal, but at low temperatures it transforms into the less dense grey -tin, which has the diamond cubic structure. Metallic tin is not easily oxidized in air. - Caesium chromate , the caesium salt of chromic acid , is used to produce caesium vapour by reaction with silicon , boron , or titanium , which is used to in the final stages of creating vacuum tubes ; the caesium vapour reacts with the remaining gases , including nitrogen and oxygen . - Gold is a chemical element with the symbol Au (from ) and the atomic number 79. In its purest form, it is a bright, slightly reddish yellow, dense, soft, malleable, and ductile metal. Chemically, gold is a transition metal and a group 11 element. It is one of the least reactive chemical elements and is solid under standard conditions. Gold often occurs in free elemental (native) form, as nuggets or grains, in rocks, in veins, and in alluvial deposits. It occurs in a solid solution series with the native element silver (as electrum) and also naturally alloyed with copper and palladium. Less commonly, it occurs in minerals as gold compounds, often with tellurium (gold tellurides). - Silver is the metallic element with the atomic number 47. Its symbol is Ag, from the Latin \\"\\", derived from the Greek \\"\\" (literally \\"shiny\\" or \\"white\\"), and ultimately from a Proto-Indo-European language root reconstructed as *\\"her-\\", \\"grey\\" or \\"shining\\". A soft, white, lustrous transition metal, it exhibits the highest electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity, and reflectivity of any metal. The metal is found in the Earth's crust in the pure, free elemental form (\\"native silver\\"), as an alloy with gold and other metals, and in minerals such as argentite and chlorargyrite. Most silver is produced as a byproduct of copper, gold, lead, and zinc refining. Silver is more abundant than gold, but it is much less abundant as a native metal. Its purity is typically measured on a per mille basis; a 94%-pure alloy is described as \\"0.940 fine\\". - Chlorine is a chemical element with symbol Cl and atomic number 17. The second-lightest of the halogens, it appears between fluorine and bromine in the periodic table and its properties are mostly intermediate between them. Chlorine is a yellow-green gas at room temperature. It is an extremely reactive element and a strong oxidising agent: among the elements, it has the highest electron affinity and the third-highest electronegativity, behind only oxygen and fluorine. - Gas is one of the four fundamental states of matter (the others being solid, liquid, and plasma). A pure gas may be made up of individual atoms (e.g. a noble gas like neon), elemental molecules made from one type of atom (e.g. oxygen), or compound molecules made from a variety of atoms (e.g. carbon dioxide). A gas mixture would contain a variety of pure gases much like the air. What distinguishes a gas from liquids and solids is the vast separation of the individual gas particles. This separation usually makes a colorless gas invisible to the human observer. The interaction of gas particles in the presence of electric and gravitational fields are considered negligible as indicated by the constant velocity vectors in the image. One type of commonly known gas is steam. - Aqua regia (\\"royal water\\" or \\"king's water\\") is a mixture of nitric acid and hydrochloric acid, optimally in a molar ratio of 1:3. Aqua regia is a yellow-orange fuming liquid. Aqua regia was so named by alchemists because it can dissolve the noble metals gold and platinum. However, aqua regia does not dissolve or corrode silver, titanium, iridium, ruthenium, rhenium, tantalum, niobium, hafnium, osmium, or rhodium. - Oxygen is a chemical element with symbol O and atomic number 8. It is a member of the chalcogen group on the periodic table and is a highly reactive nonmetal and oxidizing agent that readily forms oxides with most elements as well as other compounds. By mass, oxygen is the third-most abundant element in the universe, after hydrogen and helium. At standard temperature and pressure, two atoms of the element bind to form dioxygen, a colorless and odorless diatomic gas with the formula . This is an important part of the atmosphere and diatomic oxygen gas constitutes 20.8% of the Earth's atmosphere. Additionally, as oxides the element makes up almost half of the Earth's crust. - Rubidium is a chemical element with symbol Rb and atomic number 37. Rubidium is a soft, silvery-white metallic element of the alkali metal group, with an atomic mass of 85.4678. Elemental rubidium is highly reactive, with properties similar to those of other alkali metals, including rapid oxidation in air. On Earth, natural rubidium comprises two isotopes: 72% is the stable isotope, Rb; 28% is the slightly radioactive Rb, with a half-life of 49 billion yearsmore than three times longer than the estimated age of the universe. - Germanium is a chemical element with symbol Ge and atomic number 32. It is a lustrous, hard, grayish-white metalloid in the carbon group, chemically similar to its group neighbors tin and silicon. Pure germanium is a semiconductor with an appearance similar to elemental silicon. Like silicon, germanium naturally reacts and forms complexes with oxygen in nature. Unlike silicon, it is too reactive to be found naturally on Earth in the free (elemental) state. - Borax, also known as sodium borate, sodium tetraborate, or disodium tetraborate, is an important boron compound, a mineral, and a salt of boric acid. Powdered borax is white, consisting of soft colorless crystals that dissolve easily in water. - Kernite, also known as rasorite is a hydrated sodium borate hydroxide mineral with formula . It is a colorless to white mineral crystallizing in the monoclinic crystal system typically occurring as prismatic to acicular crystals or granular masses. It is relatively soft with Mohs hardness of 2.5 to 3 and light with a specific gravity of 1.91. It exhibits perfect cleavage and a brittle fracture.

Article:","completion":"Title: Legal Battle Leads to Release of Secret Tapes, Implicating Gerry Adams in Jean McConville's Murder Recently, new information has come to light about one of the most infamous murders during the Troubles in Northern Ireland. Secret tapes, which were supposed to be released only after the deaths of all concerned parties, have been passed to the police in Northern Ireland after a long and controversial legal battle. The tapes are believed to be a crucial factor behind the arrest of Gerry Adams in Antrim and highlight many previously unknown details about the case. The tapes specifically link Adams, a Sinn Féin leader, to the notorious murder of Jean McConville, a mother of ten who had been brutally abducted, executed, and secretly buried in 1972. At least two ex-IRA operatives have provided damning evidence on these recordings, further implicating Adams in the heinous crime. They claim they served alongside Adams and were present when he ordered McConville's killing. Despite these serious allegations, Adams has consistently and vehemently denied any involvement in her murder. The release of the secret tapes has raised many questions about the validity of their contents and the possible impact they may have on the already contentious atmosphere in Northern Ireland. The community, which has struggled to overcome the deep-rooted hostilities between the Catholic and Protestant groups, remains divided in its search for justice and truth. Gerry Adams, a prominent figure in Northern Ireland's politics, has been at the forefront of the peace process since the late 20th century. As leader of Sinn Féin, his role in the public eye has been one of advancing for peace and reconciliation for decades. However, the release of the secret tapes threatens to undermine these efforts, casting doubt on his commitment to justice and truth. The tapes not only highlight Adams' alleged role in Jean McConville's murder but also reveal the menacing nature of the operation. Investigators believe the IRA targeted McConville for allegedly passing information to the British authorities, an offense punishable by death. Her abduction, execution, and secret burial were carried out with chilling efficiency, leaving her family to suffer in the dark for decades. The devastating implications of these revelations have reignited the painful memories of the Troubles in Northern Ireland. The legal battle to release the tapes has been a contentious issue for years, with authorities arguing that the information could be vital in bringing those responsible for these crimes to justice. Critics, on the other hand, argue that the tapes could jeopardize the fragile peace process and exacerbate tensions between communities. Regardless of the arguments, the truth remains that a mother of ten faced an unimaginably brutal fate at the hands of her abductors. Through the release of the secret tapes, her family may finally have the opportunity to get answers and justice for the tragic loss that they have endured for decades. The weight of the allegations against Gerry Adams is now significantly greater than before. The secret tapes present potentially damning evidence that, if proven true, could change the course of history in Northern Ireland. The question remains whether these recordings will lead to justice and closure for the McConville family, or if they will ultimately fuel further divisions and violence. The community, and indeed the entire world, will be watching closely to see what unfolds in the wake of these chilling revelations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Input: Question: How many years did the war where Lyon served with the 2nd Battalion last? Passage 1:Lyon was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant into the 4th (Extra Reserve) Battalion, the North Staffordshire Regiment in February 1900, but two months later, in April of the same year, transferred to the 2nd Battalion of the regiment. The 2nd Battalion was a regular battalion and was at the time on active service in South Africa during the Second Boer War, where Lyon joined the battalion and served with it throughout the war being Mentioned in Despatches in 1901. He was promoted to lieutenant on 19 January 1901, while in South Africa. After peace was declared in May 1902, Lyon left Cape Town on board the SS Bavarian and arrived in the United Kingdom the following month. He remained with the 2nd Battalion when it was posted to India in 1903 where he became adjutant and was promoted to captain. Passage 2:Burn made his debut in County Cricket for Durham in the 1985 Minor Counties Championship against Cumberland. From 1985 to 1991, he represented the county in 40 Championship matches, the last of which came against Cambridgeshire. Burn also represented Durham in the MCCA Knockout Trophy, making his debut in that competition against Hertfordshire in 1986. From 1986 to 1991, he played 6 Trophy matches for the county, the last of which came against Cumberland. It was for Durham that Burn made his debut in List A cricket against Derbyshire in the 1985 NatWest Trophy. From 1985 to 1991, he represented the county in 6 List A matches, the last of which came against Glamorgan in the 1991 NatWest Trophy. Following Durham's elevation to first-class status at the end of the 1991 season, Burn played no further matches for the county. Passage 3:Persoonia terminalis was first reported by Lawrie Johnson of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Sydney, in the 1981 edition of Flora of New South Wales. He viewed it as a distinctive subspecies of Persoonia nutans, a broadly defined species that included many forms since classified as distinct. Queensland botanists Trevor Donald Stanley and Estelle M. Ross classed P.terminalis as part of Persoonia oxycoccoides in their 1983 work Flora of South-eastern Queensland. They considered it more likely a species in its own right, as they believed the description of the Queensland populations did not match the P. oxycoccoides from central New South Wales. Upon re-examining Persoonia nutans and Persoonia oxycoccoides, Johnson and Peter Weston concluded that there were in fact several distinct species, and that Persoonia terminalis was described as such in 1991. The type specimen was collected south of the Torrington pub on the Emmaville–Torrington road by Weston and ecologist Peter Richards, and is now housed in the National Herbarium of New South Wales, which is part of the Royal Botanic Gardens and Domain Trust Sydney and Office of Environment and Heritage. The Herbarium houses over 1.2million other specimens. The generic name Persoonia is derived from the name of South African botanist Christiaan Hendrik Persoon. The specific name terminalis refers to the inflorescences (clusters of flowers) that are in this species at the ends of the branchlets. Its common name is the Torrington geebung.

Plot title: Parasakthi Movie plot: Chandrasekaran, Gnanasekaran and Gunasekaran are three Indian immigrant brothers from Madurai, Tamil Nadu living in Rangoon, Burma with Chandrasekaran's wife Saraswati. Their younger sister Kalyani was raised in their home town by their father Manickampillai. In 1942, during World War II, the three brothers and Saraswati plan to visit Madurai to attend the impending wedding of Kalyani to a writer named Thangappan. Due to war conditions and bombardment of Burmese ports by Japan, the shipping company offers only one ticket and Gunasekaran, the youngest brother, takes it and leaves for Tamil Nadu. The ship fails to reach on time due to the dangers of the war, and Kalyani's marriage takes place without any of her brothers present. Kalyani becomes pregnant. But on the day she delivers her child, Thangappan dies in an accident and Manickampillai dies of shock, leaving Kalyani and her child destitute. Her house gets auctioned off, and she makes her living by selling food on the streets. Gunasekaran, after being stranded at sea for several months, finally arrives in Tamil Nadu at Madras. However, while watching a dance performance, he is robbed of all his belongings after being intoxicated. Impoverished, he becomes enraged at the status of the once glorious Tamil Nadu, and fakes insanity by indulging in numerous tricks to make a living. Gunasekaran finally comes across his destitute sister at Madurai, having learned of their father's death and her poverty. He continues to play insane and does not reveal his true identity to her due to his poverty, but hovers around her. Kalyani is irritated by the stranger's behaviour, unaware that he is her brother. Kalyani is nearly molested by a vagabond named Venu, but is saved by Gunasekaran.

What do you think about the KVPY 2016 paper?","completion":"These two questions are not the same, as they address different aspects about the KVPY (Kishore Vaigyanik Protsahan Yojana) exam. Let me break down each question and explain their differences. 1. First Question: \\"What is the expected cutoff for KVPY SA 2016 -17?\\" This question is asking about the minimum marks required to qualify for KVPY SA (Stream SA) in the year 2016-17 examination. The query wants to know the specific cutoff score that a student had to achieve in order to be considered for further rounds or be eligible for the KVPY fellowship. To answer this question, I would perform the following steps: - Research and gather information on KVPY SA 2016-17 cutoff marks from official sources or reliable websites. - Report the accurate cutoff score or provide a range if there isn't an exact score available. 2. Second Question: \\"What do you think about the KVPY 2016 paper?\\" This question is more open-ended and seeks an opinion or analysis of the KVPY 2016 examination paper itself. It could cover various aspects, such as the difficulty level, the type of questions, and how well-prepared the students have to be for the examination. To answer this question, I would perform the following steps: - Review the KVPY 2016 question paper in order to assess its difficulty and types of questions involved. - Analyze and compare the paper to previous years' papers to identify trends, changes, or patterns. - Form an opinion on the paper based on the analysis and provide insights into the level of preparation required by the students to succeed in the exam. In summary, the first question is specific and focused on the cutoff score, while the second question is broader in nature, seeking an opinion and analysis of the exam paper."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer:","completion":"José María Montes was an Argentine prelate of the Roman Catholic Church, who was born on March 22, 1920, in Almirante Brown, Argentina, and passed away on September 2, 2011. The key details about José María Montes extracted from the given bio are as follows: 1. Montes's key achievements revolve around various roles and appointments in the Roman Catholic Church, particularly in Argentina. His service to the Church was distinguished by his various appointments and the years associated with each. 2. Montes was ordained as a priest on December 20, 1958, affiliating with the Archdiocese of La Plata, a notable milestone in his career as a clergyman. 3. On June 15, 1978, José María Montes was appointed as an Auxiliary Archbishop of the Archdiocese of La Plata, which is another significant appointment in his ecclesiastical career, demonstrating his growing prominence within the Church. 4. Additionally, Montes also held the title of Titular Bishop of Lamdia. He was ordained as a bishop on August 15, 1978, strengthening his stature within the Catholic hierarchy. 5. Following these appointments, Montes was assigned to the Diocese of Chascomús on January 19, 1983. This appointment signaled a further expansion of his responsibilities within the Church. 6. Montes's tenure in the Diocese of Chascomús came to an end upon his retirement on July 3, 1996, marking the conclusion of his notable career as a clergyman and Church official. 7. However, Montes was not without controversy. A grandmother affiliated with the activist group called \\"the Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo\\" accused him of concealment in a 1977 incident. She claimed that Montes knew the whereabouts of her missing granddaughter, but Montes denied having any recollection of the alleged event during his court appearance. In conclusion, the key details about José María Montes are primarily related to his service in the Roman Catholic Church, spanning from his ordination as a priest until his retirement. Throughout his career, Montes held multiple appointments, including Auxiliary Archbishop of the Archdiocese of La Plata and Bishop of the Diocese of Chascomús, which testifies to his prominent role within the Church.

Ted's dreams of roughing it on the savannah are squashed when Jean leads him into a house that looks like it belongs in Pasadena, California. Although Jean forbids her children to explore, Ted and Susan sneak out to a nearby watering hole to meet with a Masai tribal boy named Morogo. Morogo shows the siblings the wildlife of Kenya and they show him how to play video games. One day, Jean comes home to discover Morogo in her home. Ted and Susan plead with their parents to let Morogo be their guide and the parents reluctantly give in. One day, Ted kicks a soccer ball over a barrier and it lands against a sleeping rhino. Morogo sneaks up on the animal, retrieves the ball, and places a small stone on the rhino's side. He then gives Ted another stone, daring him to do the same. The rhino awakens as Ted nears, causing him to flee. A laughing Morogo tells him that a person must approach a rhino downwind or it will smell him.

The bright Sunday morning sun illuminated the stained glass windows, diffusing multi-colored hues across the congregation. Attendance is up today, thought Greg. As the organist was nearing the end of the Prelude, he stepped up to the podium. \\"Please take your hymnals and turn to page 23, and let's stand and sing 'Holy, Holy, Holy.'\\" Holy, holy, holy! Lord God Almighty! Early in the morning, our song shall rise to Thee... As Greg sang and conducted the 4/4 pattern, which he could do in his sleep, his mind began to wander. Shouldn't he feel guilty about what he was thinking last night while kissing Cynthia on the couch? His actions had been within the bounds of acceptable behavior. He had nothing to be ashamed of in that regard. But what about his thoughts? It wasn't what he did with Cynthia--it was what he wanted to do. He didn't want to dishonor her or his commitment to God. But his feelings had been only natural. God created humans and gave them sexual desire. Wasn't it okay to want to have sex, as long as you didn't actually do it? Then he remembered the passage from Matthew 5:28. But I say to you, that whosoever shall look on a woman to lust after her, hath already committed adultery with her in his heart. At the end of the hymn, Greg stepped back and Dr. Huff went to the podium and said a prayer. Then there were announcements, two more hymns, and a chorus. After the offering, it was time for the choir to sing their anthem. When Greg motioned to the choir to stand, Cynthia smiled at him from the Alto section. She was so incredibly beautiful. Standing there in her choir robe, she looked like a redheaded angel. If they could just get married, Greg could stop feeling guilty about his desire for her. Who thought that God created humans? - Attendant - not enough information - Greg. - Dr. Huff.","completion":"Step 1: Identify Greg's concerns and potential outcomes. Concerns: a) Greg feels guilty about his thoughts while kissing Cynthia. b) He's worried about dishonoring Cynthia or his commitment to God. Potential Outcomes: 1) Greg continues to suppress his feelings and feels guilty. 2) Greg talks to Cynthia about his feelings and they maintain their boundaries. 3) Greg and Cynthia decide to get married, which may alleviate his guilt. Step 2: Consider the factors in Greg's decision-making process. Factors: a) The Bible verse - Matthew 5:28 b) His feelings for Cynthia c) Their commitment to God Step 3: Analyze each potential outcome. Outcome 1: Pros: Greg can maintain his commitment to God and won't dishonor Cynthia. Cons: He will continue to feel guilty and may potentially harm his relationship with Cynthia. Outcome 2: Pros: Greg has an open conversation with Cynthia about his feelings; they can support each other, maintain their boundaries, and honor their commitments to God. Cons: They may face challenges in suppressing their desires, which may strain their relationship. Outcome 3: Pros: Greg and Cynthia can express their love for each other without guilt and honor both their commitment to God and each other. Cons: They may be rushing into marriage, and the sudden decision could lead to unexpected challenges or judgement from others. Step 4: Make a decision based on outcomes and factors. In this situation, it's essential for Greg to consider his commitment to God and his relationship with Cynthia. The best course of action would be for Greg to have an honest conversation with Cynthia about their emotions and to reaffirm their boundaries. By doing so, they can support each other while maintaining their commitments. Marriage may be a possible solution later on, but it's important for them to evaluate their readiness for that step without rushing into it. This way, Greg and Cynthia get to know each other better and understand the expectations they have about their relationship."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

While this fact is related to asteroid impacts, it doesn't directly address the idea of an impact saving or harming humanity. Thus, this reason is not as relevant to the statement as (A). (C) - This reason states that some asteroid impact craters on Earth have filled with water and become lakes.

Article: For years and years people have been saying that the rail ways are dead. \\"We can do without railways\\", people say as if motorcars and planes have made the railways unnecessary. We all keep hearing that trains are slow, that they lose money, and that they're dying. But this is far from the truth. In these days of expensive oil, the railways have become highly competitive with motorcars and planes. If you want to carry people or goods from place to place, they are cheaper than planes. And they have much in common with planes. A plane goes in a straight line and so does a railway. What is more, it takes you from the heart of a city into the heart of another. It doesn't leave you as a plane does, miles and miles from the city center. It doesn't hold you up as a car does, in endless traffic jams. And a single train can carry goods which no plane or motorcar could ever do. Far from being dead, the railways are very much alive. Modern railway lines give you a smooth, untroubled journey. Where else can you eat well, sleep in comfort, feel safe and enjoy the scene while you are traveling at speed at the same time? And we are only at the beginning,for we have just entered the age of _ . Trains are traveling at 150 miles an hour and more.

Rachel was very honest.. ii. Mary was very honest..","completion":"Rachel could act as though they cared about something they did not whereas Mary could not, primarily because of their contrasting personality traits and their differing levels of emotional intelligence. To begin with, we need to address the given statements: i. Rachel was very honest. This statement appears to be contradictory to the initial claim as Rachel is able to act insincerely regarding her care for something. This could indicate that Rachel's honesty is selective, meaning she has the ability to portray an honest appearance in certain situations while still being able to act differently from her true feelings. For her, honesty is not an intrinsic value but instead, a situational tool used to achieve specific goals. ii. Mary was very honest. Contrary to Rachel, Mary has an inherent attribute of honesty, which means she cannot feign concern over a topic she does not genuinely care about. Her honesty prevents her from pretending to be interested in something, even if it would be beneficial for her to do so. Furthermore, there are additional factors that contribute to these differences between Rachel and Mary. It is important to examine aspects such as emotional intelligence, self-awareness, their differing values, and social skills. Emotional intelligence refers to an individual's capacity to recognize, interpret, manage, and utilize emotions in oneself and others. With a higher emotional intelligence, Rachel can easier identify her own emotions and the emotions of those around her, enabling her to act in a way that may not be entirely sincere but will benefit her in various interpersonal situations. Rachel has the ability to manipulate the expressions of emotions in order to achieve desired outcomes. On the other hand, Mary, who may possess a lower emotional intelligence, struggles to fake emotions that she does not genuinely experience. Her innate honesty shapes her interactions with others and prevents her from being able to artificially engage in a manner that does not align with her true feelings. Moving on, self-awareness is another factor that could influence this difference between the two. Rachel's self-awareness may allow her to be conscious of her actions' impact on others, giving her the ability to act in certain ways, such as feigning interest or concern, when she deems it socially appropriate or advantageous. Meanwhile, Mary may lack this level of self-awareness, which makes her behaviour more transparent and genuine. Lastly, social skills play an essential role in this situation. Rachel may have developed advanced social skills that enable her to interact with others according to the expectations of her environment. This could involve code-switching, where she adjusts her behaviour to align with the social context in which she finds herself. Mary, conversely, might have underdeveloped social skills that result in her interacting with others solely based on her authentic internal emotional responses. In summary, Rachel's ability to act as though they cared about something they did not whereas Mary could not is attributable to their divergent personalities, emotional intelligence levels, varying degrees of self-awareness, and social skill development. Because of these factors, Rachel can effectively adapt her behaviour to the expectations and demands of her environment, even when it requires her to behave contrary to her actual feelings. In contrast, Mary's innate honesty, coupled with her potentially lower emotional intelligence and self-awareness, make her incapable of acting insincerely when she does not truly care about something."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The blast observed on Dec. 27 came from a neutron star: a collapsed dead star with a sun-like mass squeezed into a sphere, just 15 miles across, in the constellation Sagittarius (the Archer). Based on that paragraph can we conclude that this sentence is true? The December burst came from a neutron star in the constellation Sagittarius.","completion":"Yes, based on the information provided in the paragraph, it is accurate to conclude that the sentence \\"The December burst came from a neutron star in the constellation Sagittarius\\" is true. Let us break down the information provided in the paragraph to further support and understand this conclusion. 1. \\"The blast observed on Dec. 27\\": This statement refers to a specific event that occurred on December 27. The wording indicates that the topic of discussion is an unusual and noteworthy event relating to a celestial occurrence. The term \\"blast\\" can be assumed to be related to a sudden burst of energy or radiation. 2. \\"came from a neutron star\\": Neutron stars are the compact remnants of massive stars after a supernova explosion. They are made up mostly of neutrons, which are subatomic particles found in the nucleus of an atom. Neutron stars are incredibly dense, with masses comparable to that of the sun, but they have tiny diameters, often just around 10-20 miles. The paragraph specifically describes the neutron star to have a \\"sun-like mass squeezed into a sphere, just 15 miles across.\\" This provides a clear association between the observed blast and the neutron star as its source. 3. \\"in the constellation Sagittarius (the Archer)\\": The constellation Sagittarius is an easily recognizable pattern of stars in the night sky, visible primarily in the Southern Hemisphere. It is often depicted as an archer holding a bow and arrow, hence the nickname \\"the Archer.\\" The paragraph directly attributes the location of the neutron star to the constellation Sagittarius. Therefore, the context establishes a clear spatial relationship between the neutron star, the blast, and the constellation Sagittarius. Considering these points, the sentence \\"The December burst came from a neutron star in the constellation Sagittarius\\" is essentially a summarized statement accurately derived from the information provided in the paragraph. This sentence effectively captures the key aspects of the event, both in terms of the celestial object responsible for the blast (the neutron star) and its spatial reference point (the constellation Sagittarius)."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Which of the following solutions is better for the following goal: How to simmer habanero pepper in chili.","completion":"To decide which solution is better for simmering habanero pepper in chili, let's consider two possible solutions and analyze their pros and cons. Solution 1: Simmering whole habanero pepper in chili Step 1: Wash the habanero pepper to remove any dirt or debris. Step 2: Pierce the pepper a few times with a fork or knife to release its heat and flavor. Step 3: Add the whole habanero pepper to the chili during the simmering process. Step 4: Simmer the chili with the habanero pepper for the desired time, allowing the flavors to mingle. Step 5: Remove the whole habanero pepper before serving the chili. Pros: - Easier to control the spiciness by removing the pepper at any time - No need to chop or handle the pepper directly, minimizing the risk of burning skin or eyes Cons: - The heat may not distribute evenly throughout the chili - Some people may prefer a more pronounced habanero flavor Solution 2: Dicing and adding habanero pepper to the chili Step 1: Wash the habanero pepper to remove any dirt or debris. Step 2: Carefully chop the habanero pepper, removing the seeds and membranes if desired to reduce heat. Step 3: Wear gloves while handling the diced habanero to avoid burning skin or eyes. Step 4: Add the diced habanero pepper to the chili during the simmering process. Step 5: Simmer the chili with the habanero pepper for the desired time, allowing the flavors to mingle. Pros: - Better distribution of heat and flavor throughout the chili - Allows for a more pronounced habanero flavor Cons: - Chopping the pepper increases the risk of burning skin or eyes - More difficult to control the spiciness as it infuses throughout the chili Overall, I would recommend Solution 2 (dicing and adding habanero pepper to the chili) if you want a more pronounced habanero flavor with better heat distribution. However, if you want easier control of the spiciness and prefer not to handle the pepper directly, then Solution 1 (simmering whole habanero pepper) might be a better choice."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

If \\"A black and white dog jumping into a pool.\\", does this mean that \\"The pet is taking a nap\\"?","completion":"To determine whether \\"A black and white dog jumping into a pool\\" means \\"The pet is taking a nap,\\" we need to compare the two phrases and analyze the provided information. Step 1: Analyze the first phrase The first phrase states, \\"A black and white dog jumping into a pool.\\" Here we have information about the dog's color (black and white) and its action (jumping into a pool). Step 2: Analyze the second phrase The second phrase asserts that \\"The pet is taking a nap.\\" In this phrase, the action related to the pet is that it is \\"taking a nap.\\" Step 3: Compare the two phrases Now we need to compare the dog in the first phrase with the pet in the second phrase. Although we have no explicit information regarding the pet's species in the second phrase, we can assume that they might reference the same animal since pet is a general term that could include dogs. Step 4: Compare the actions Next, we need to see if the actions in both phrases align. The dog in the first phrase is \\"jumping into a pool,\\" while the pet in the second phrase is \\"taking a nap.\\" These are two distinct actions, and a dog cannot be jumping and napping at the same time.

Summarize this article: Denis Cuspert had been designated a global terrorist by the US State Department and had threatened President Barack Obama. Officials said Cuspert, who encouraged Muslims to work for IS, was killed in an 16 October air strike near Raqqa. He used the stage name \\"Deso Dogg\\" before converting to Islam in 2010. \\"Cuspert is emblematic of the type of foreign recruit IS seeks for its ranks - individuals who have engaged in criminal activity in their home countries who then travel to Iraq and Syria to commit far worse crimes,\\" the State Department wrote of Cuspert in February. A spokesman for Germany's Interior Ministry would not confirm or deny his death. In April 2014 he was reported to have been killed in Syria but that claim was later retracted. Cuspert, whose rap career ended before he starting working for IS, would use social media to attract youth and Westerners, especially Germans, to the group.

Cuspert had been designated as a global terrorist by the US State Department due to his threats against President Barack Obama and his active role in recruiting foreign individuals to join the Islamic State. He mainly targeted young people and Westerners, especially Germans, via social media. Cuspert converted to Islam in 2010 and abandoned his rap career to focus on promoting extremist activities. According to the State Department, he represents the type of foreign recruit that the Islamic State seeks: individuals with criminal backgrounds in their home countries who travel to Iraq and Syria to commit even more severe crimes. In Germany, Cuspert gained popularity for singing nasheeds, or Islamic devotional music, in the German language. There has been some confusion surrounding his death, as he was previously reported to have been killed in Syria in April 2014, but that claim was later retracted. Meanwhile, a spokesman for Germany's Interior Ministry has not confirmed or denied Cuspert's death in the recent airstrike. Before his radicalization, Cuspert enjoyed a successful music career, even touring with renowned American rapper DMX in 2006, as reported by the New York Times."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

While I will admit that I have really enjoyed some of his films, I can also honestly say that I can't stand some of them. My opinion, by the way, is not just some knee-jerk reaction--I have seen most of Fellini's films and have also seen many films by the world's most famous directors. With this in mind, I feel that the most overrated and annoying directors can be both Godard and Fellini. They both have delighted in the bizarre and often unwatchable and yet have received gobs of accolades from reviewers and the \\"intelligensia\\", while the average person would never sit through some of their films. Heck, even a person who loves international cinema would generally be left out in the cold when seeing some of these films. So, since only a small clique actually watches their films and they are already predisposed to seeing the directors as geniuses, it's not surprising that their films are so often praised--it's like a cult! If you don't believe me, think about many of Godard's films such as FIRST NAME CARMEN or ALPHAVILLE,...or what about FELLINI SATYRICON or JULIET OF THE SPIRITS? These films abound with boredom, weirdness and incomprehensibility. Now I am NOT saying a film can't be weird (after all I love HAPPINESS OF THE KATAKURIS and SHAOLIN SOCCER), but it must be watchable! Now on to this movie. Somehow, Fellini has managed to make a story about a sexually compulsive man completely boring and unsexy. This is no small task--it took a lot of work to make this so unwatchable. Instead of cheap sexual thrills, the sex acts are choreographed in a silly and annoying way while the character of Casanova is buried under so much makeup and prosthetics that Donald Sutherland looks like a ghoul. I know some of this must have been Fellini's intention, but many viewers will be left completely bored by this sterile performance--especially since Sutherland's lines are all poorly dubbed into Italian and so he neither looks nor sounds like himself! Unfortunately, when the movie is not wrapped up in these boring sexual escapades, there really isn't anything else to watch. An interesting note about the first sexual conquest shown in this dull movie is that the actress looks amazingly like a younger version of Fellini's wife, Giulietta Masina. Considering that in addition to this, that in previous decades Fellini had Masina play characters such as a prostitute and a horribly abused woman, it seems like he may have truly hated his wife and was having this acted out on screen. I read a bit about them and their tempestuous relationship and it seems to bear this out as well. This is about the only aspect of this turgid film that I found at all interesting. Don't say I didn't warn you! What is the sentiment of this review? Options: --negative; --positive;","completion":"The sentiment of this review is negative. The reviewer expresses their dissatisfaction with the movie, describing it as \\"boring\\", \\"unwatchable\\", \\"unsexy\\", and \\"sterile\\".

The reviewer does not find much to appreciate in the movie and warns others of its various shortcomings."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

What is the subject line for this email? DICTATION DRAFT FROM GREG PORTER I just spoke with Georgetta Baker, lawyer for SoCalGas, and Rick Miles, FERC's ADR group. We discussed the possibility of mediation based upon both parties representing in pleadings filed in Docket No. RP01-620 (TW Complaint) that both companies were interested in alternate dispute resolution (ADR). After discussing the various types of ADR, we agreed to begin with mediation. Rick Miles will be the mediator. The mediation process that was discussed was an evolutionary one whereby parties would meet in a neutral location to discuss resolution (i.e., settlement) of its claims. Both parties indicated a willingness to settle. Rick Miles will act as a facilitator. Mr. Miles' function will be one of moderating discussions and not evaluative. As the mediation process continues without resolution, Mr. Miles' role will evolve. Later on, if the parties desire, Mr. Miles offered to bring in a FERC staffer that is a subject matter expert to offer his or her views of each party's case. Also, if the parties desire, the subject matter expert would indicate how he or she would recommend the Commission rule on the merits. Initial dates of November 7-8 or November 13-14 were offered as potential dates for the first meeting. A neutral location needs to be agreed upon.

In a slower process, radioactive decay of atoms in the core of the Earth releases heat. This thermal energy drives plate tectonics and may lift mountains, via orogenesis. This slow lifting represents a kind of gravitational potential energy storage of the thermal energy, which may be later released to active kinetic energy in landslides, after a triggering event. Earthquakes also release stored elastic potential energy in rocks, a store that has been produced ultimately from the same radioactive heat sources. Thus, according to present understanding, familiar events such as landslides and earthquakes release energy that has been stored as potential energy in the Earth's gravitational field or elastic strain (mechanical potential energy) in rocks. Prior to this, they represent release of energy that has been stored in heavy atoms since the collapse of long-destroyed supernova stars created these atoms. Is there an answer to this question (If it cannot be answered, say \\"unanswerable\\"): What hinders plate tectonics and may lift mountains via orogenesis?","completion":"The question can be rephrased to better understand what factors affect plate tectonics and orogenesis: What factors hinder or influence plate tectonics and the formation of mountains through orogenesis? Various factors affect plate tectonics and orogenesis. Some of these include: 1. Temperature differences: The Earth's core releases heat through radioactive decay, driving thermal convection in the mantle. This convection, in turn, influences the movement of tectonic plates. If temperatures in the mantle were uniform, the driving force behind plate tectonics would be diminished. 2. Plate thickness and buoyancy: Plates that are thicker and more buoyant may resist subduction (when one tectonic plate moves under another) and may hinder the processes that lead to orogenesis. Conversely, thinner and denser plates are more likely to be subducted, contributing to the formation of mountains. 3. Plate boundaries and interactions: The type of boundary where two plates meet influences the types of geological processes that can occur. For example, at convergent boundaries, where two plates collide, orogenesis is likely to occur. In contrast, divergent boundaries, where two plates move apart, generally do not lead to the formation of mountains. 4. Geological history and preexisting structures: The previous geological history of a region may affect the current state of plate tectonics and orogenesis. For example, preexisting faults or weak zones in the Earth's crust may promote the formation of mountains or the motion of tectonic plates. 5. Rates of erosion and sedimentation: Erosion can remove material from the Earth's surface, reducing the mass of overlying rock and potentially influencing tectonic processes. Conversely, the accumulation of sediment may increase the mass on the Earth's crust and contribute to orogenesis. These factors, among others, influence plate tectonics and the formation of mountains through orogenesis."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Explanation: To start a fire, we need things that can burn easily, like flammable debris and papers. Lighter fluid is a special liquid that helps things catch fire faster. So, when we add lighter fluid to the mix and touch it with an open flame (like a match or a lighter), it will start a fire. The other option is wrong because: [-] use a collection of flammable debris and papers, add some washer fluid, then touch with an open flame. Washer fluid is a liquid used for cleaning things, like your car's windshield. It doesn't help to start a fire like lighter fluid does. If we add washer fluid to the mix, it might make it harder for the fire to start or not start at all."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Yet Eklavya (Amitabh Bachchan), their royal guard, lives in a time warp. He lives only to protect the fort, the dynasty, and the king. For nine generations Eklavya's family has protected Devigarh, a centuries-old citadel in Rajasthan. His marksmanship is the stuff of legends. His unflinching loyalty inspires ballads. Eklavya has spent his entire life serving the royals and closely guarding their secrets but now he's getting old and increasingly blind.

His mentally challenged twin sister, Princess Nandini (Raima Sen), and his childhood love, Rajjo (Vidya Balan), are delighted to see him. But the joy of reunion is short-lived.

Step 2: Review the given choices We have been given four choices - RNA, DNA, S-layers, and peptidoglycan. We need to identify which one is not present in archaeal cell walls. Step 3: Analyzing each choice - RNA and DNA: These are nucleic acids and are found inside the cell, not in the cell wall. So, these options are not relevant to the cell wall composition. - S-layers: S-layers are proteinaceous surface layers commonly found in archaeal cell walls, so this option is not the correct answer. - Peptidoglycan: Peptidoglycan is a major component of bacterial cell walls, not archaeal ones. Archaeal cell walls have various other components like pseudopeptidoglycan, but they lack peptidoglycan.

Q:I can use this background: Any unused energy in food, whether it comes from carbohydrates, proteins, or lipids, is stored in the body as fat. An extra 3,500 Calories of energy results in the storage of almost half a kilogram (1 pound) of stored body fat. People who consistently consume more food energy then they need may become obese. Obesity occurs when the body mass index is 30.0 kg/m 2 or greater. Body mass index (BMI) is an estimate of the fat content of the body. It is calculated by dividing a person’s weight (in kilograms) by the square of the person’s height (in meters). Obesity increases the risk of health problems such as type 2 diabetes and hypertension.

Leap village was inhabited by vegetarians and vegans.Their food consumption was moderate. Answer this question please: Which village had fewer people with increased risk of type 2 diabetes? A:","completion":"Based on the background information provided, the Leap village had fewer people with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. Here's the step-by-step reasoning: 1. Obesity increases the risk of health problems such as type 2 diabetes and hypertension. 2. Obesity occurs when the body mass index is 30.0 kg/m^2 or greater. 3. People who consistently consume more food energy than they need may become obese. 4. The inhabitants of Boar village overeat, and their diet is heavy in animal products, which contain more fats and calories. This could lead to a higher calorie intake and, as a result, increased body fat and a higher likelihood of obesity. 5. The inhabitants of Leap village have a more moderate food consumption, and their diet consists of plant-based foods. Plant-based diets are generally lower in fats and calories, which could lead to a lower calorie intake and a lesser likelihood of obesity. 6. Based on points 4 and 5, it can be inferred that a larger proportion of the population in Boar village is obese and, therefore, at an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. 7.

If you’re not working with sterile tools, you may introduce bacteria into your skin, making the outbreak you’re trying to treat even worse! To sterilize the comedo extractor, simply soak it in rubbing alcohol for one minute. Keep the rubbing alcohol on hand while using the extractor to continue cleaning it as you go. Make sure to wash your hands thoroughly or wear vinyl gloves while working on your skin. Your hands carry many germs that you don’t want to transfer to your skin. The extractor will have a loop on one end of it. Position the loop around the whitehead or blackhead you are trying to extract. If you’re having trouble seeing what you’re doing, try using a magnifying mirror. These can be purchased inexpensively at pharmacies, department stores, or online. At the very least, make sure you’re working in a well-lit environment. Once the comedo is within the extractor’s loop, you want to apply enough pressure to force the whitehead or blackhead up out of the skin. Press against the base of the comedo from all sides, working all of the material completely out of your skin. Comedones can reach deep down into the skin, so don’t assume you’ve extracted the whole thing as soon as a little bit of material comes out. Keep pressing from different angles until nothing more emerges from your skin. When you’re satisfied that you have the whole comedo, simply swipe the extractor loop over it to remove it from your skin. Either wash the extractor off in the sink or wipe the material away on a paper towel. You should sterilize the extractor for every new comedo, even if you’re treating them all in one sitting. Soak the instrument in rubbing alcohol for a minute, then repeat the process with your next whitehead or blackhead. Continue until you’ve removed all the blemishes on your skin. When you extract a comedo, you leave an open “wound” of sorts in your skin that, while not very noticeable, will take a little while to heal. Apply a small amount of astringent to the treated areas to protect them from bacteria or debris that might cause another outbreak. Moisture your skin after applying your astringent to keep it from drying out. Do not apply makeup to your skin until you’ve treated it with an astringent.

Eddie Redmayne's captivating performance will be compared to Daniel Day Lewis's in \\"My Left Foot,\\" but it is important to note how much life, joy and humor he brings to the role with little more than a cocked eyebrow, a few facial muscles and his eyes... 2. A strongly acted, handsomely crafted film that nonetheless feels bland and unsatisfying. 3. Redmayne and Jones are beautifully compatible as Hawking and his then-wife Jane as they navigate the ebb and flow of 25 years of their relationship. 4. This is sheer poppycock, of course, but it makes for fine drama, and that's all Cupid and Oscar care about. 5. The Theory Of Everything surpasses the standard biopic to become an unexpected and moving love story between Stephen and Jane Hawking. The acting is superb in this winning film. 6. On one side is Mr. Redmayne's remarkable presence. On the other is Ms. Jones, whose lovely freshness and calm intelligence complement everything her co-star does. 7. Stephen Hawking, a genius challenged by a progressive neurological disease, is a role that demands miracles of an actor. And Eddie Redmayne, in a landmark performance, delivers them. 8. The Theory Of Everything is a modest film, a simple film, but an honest and impressively-restrained one, and it should serve to launch Redmayne into rarefied air as an actor, deservedly so. 9. Marsh takes a complicated persona and reveals a range of dimensions. The result is an engaging biopic that is often quite moving. 10. It's disappointing to see Hawking's life slotted into the conventions of the biopic genre, from a meet-cute at a Cambridge party to a centerstage ovation for our genius hero. What was the overall consensus about the movie?","completion":"The overall consensus about the movie is mostly positive, with praises for the strong acting performances, especially Eddie Redmayne's portrayal of Stephen Hawking. The movie is also appreciated for its engaging and moving story, as well as its focus on the love story between Stephen and Jane Hawking.

Is the sentiment of the following sentence positive or negative? that rare drama that offers a thoughtful and rewarding glimpse into the sort of heartache everyone has felt , or will feel someday","completion":"To determine the sentiment of the sentence, I'm going to examine its content carefully. The sentence is: \\"that rare drama that offers a thoughtful and rewarding glimpse into the sort of heartache everyone has felt, or will feel someday.\\" Here are the key phrases and their inherent sentiments: 1. \\"rare drama\\" - Neutral, as this is a description, and doesn't carry sentiment itself. 2. \\"offers a thoughtful and rewarding glimpse\\" - Positive, as 'thoughtful' and 'rewarding' are positive adjectives. 3. \\"heartache everyone has felt, or will feel someday\\" - Negative, as 'heartache' is a negative term indicating pain or sadness. The sentence is a juxtaposition of both positive and negative sentiments - the positive being the \\"thoughtful and rewarding glimpse\\" offered by the drama, and the negative being the \\"heartache\\" that everyone feels. However, the overall sentiment seems to leans toward the positive. While 'heartache' tends to carry a negative connotation, in the context of this sentence, it is viewed as a universal human experience that the drama thoughtfully represents in a rewarding manner. Therefore, the presence of 'thoughtful' and 'rewarding' suggests a more positive sentiment despite the inclusion of 'heartache'. So, the sentiment of the sentence can be interpreted as a positive one because it appreciates the thoughtfulness and rewarding nature of the drama, highlighting its ability to respect and express a universally felt emotion."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Athens dominates the Attica region and is one of the world's oldest cities, with its recorded history spanning over 3,400 years, and its earliest human presence starting somewhere between the 11th and 7th millennia BC. Classical Athens was a powerful city-state that emerged in conjunction with the seagoing development of the port of Piraeus, which had been a distinct city prior to its 5th century BC incorporation with Athens. A centre for the arts, learning and philosophy, home of Plato's Academy and Aristotle's Lyceum, it is widely referred to as the cradle of Western civilization and the birthplace of democracy, largely because of its cultural and political impact on the European continent, and in particular the Romans. In modern times, Athens is a large cosmopolitan metropolis and central to economic, financial, industrial, maritime, political and cultural life in Greece. In 2015, Athens was ranked the world's 29th richest city by purchasing power and the 67th most expensive in a UBS study. - Chamber pop (or \\"ork-pop\\") is a subgenre of indie pop or indie rock which grew in the mid 1990s as a reaction against the fuzz distortion and \\"lo-fi aesthetic\\" prominent in alternative music. Inspired partly by the era's lounge music revivalism, chamber pop is typified by the use of strings, horns, and piano, and a dissociation from contemporary genres of the time, like grunge or electronica. The Beach Boys' Brian Wilson heavily influenced much of the genre, as did composer Burt Bacharach. Specific works which helped define chamber pop include the Beach Boys' albums \\"Pet Sounds\\" (1966) and \\"Smile\\" (196667), as well as the majority of Louis Phillipe's productions for él Records (198489). - Twee pop is a subgenre of indie pop that maintained a reasonable amount of success and notoriety distinctive from the overall indie pop current. - Athens (formally known as Athens-Clarke County) is a consolidated citycounty in the U.S. state of Georgia, in the northeastern part of the state, comprising the former city of Athens proper (the county seat) and Clarke County. The University of Georgia, the state's flagship public research university, is located in this college town, and contributed to its initial growth. In 1991, after a vote the preceding year, the original city abandoned its charter to form a unified government with Clarke County, referred to jointly as Athens-Clarke County. As of the 2010 census, the consolidated city-county (including all of Athens-Clarke County except Winterville and a portion of Bogart) had a total population of 115,452; all of Clarke County had a population of 116,714. Athens is the sixth-largest city in Georgia, and the principal city of the Athens-Clarke County, Georgia Metropolitan Statistical Area, which had a population of 192,541 as of the 2010 census. Athens-Clarke County has the smallest geographical area of a county in Georgia. - Albums of recorded music were developed in the early 20th century, first as books of individual 78rpm records, then from 1948 as vinyl LP records played at rpm. Vinyl LPs are still issued, though in the 21st century album sales have mostly focused on compact disc (CD) and MP3 formats. The audio cassette was a format used from the late 1970s through to the 1990s alongside vinyl. - I Am Not A Freemdoom is the second album by Masters of the Hemisphere, released in 2000 on Kindercore Records. It is a concept album containing a comic book, for which the songs provide the soundtrack. - Masters of the Hemisphere is the first full album by the Athens , Georgia based indie pop band of the same name . Though it lacks the elaborateness of their followup , the heavily concept - based I Am Not A Freemdoom , it still maintains the essential element of the band 's indie pop songcraft , drawing comparisons to R.E.M. , among others . - Indie pop is a subgenre and subculture of alternative/indie rock that originated in the United Kingdom in the late 1970s. The style is inspired by punk's DIY ethic and related ideologies, and it generated a thriving fanzine, label, and club and gig circuit. Indie pop differs from indie rock to the extent that it is more melodic, less abrasive, and relatively angst-free. Its substyles include chamber pop and twee pop. - Kindercore Records is an independent record label based in Athens, Georgia, which was founded in 1996 by Ryan Lewis and Daniel Geller to document the emerging music scene in Athens, Georgia. - Indie rock is a genre of alternative rock that originated in the United States and the United Kingdom in the 1980s. Indie rock encapsulates indie pop and lo-fi, among others. Originally used to describe record labels, the term became associated with the music they produced and was initially used interchangeably with alternative rock. As grunge and punk revival bands in the US, and then Britpop bands in the UK, broke into the mainstream in the 1990s, it came to be used to identify those acts that retained an outsider and underground perspective. In the 2000s, as a result of changes in the music industry and the growing importance of the Internet, some indie rock acts began to enjoy commercial success, leading to questions about its meaningfulness as a term. - A concept album is an album unified by a larger purpose or meaning to the album collectively than to its tracks individually. This may be achieved through a single central narrative or theme, or through a sense of artistic cohesiveness. The scope and definition of a \\"concept album\\" varies, and there is no consensus over what exactly the term constitutes. - Masters of the Hemisphere are an American indie pop group, founded by Bren Mead and Sean Rawls. The two moved to Athens, Georgia, to attend college in 1996. There they met Ryan Lewis, co-founder of Kindercore Records, who played drums at the first Masters of the Hemisphere show. Jeff Griggs (also of The Mendoza Line) soon replaced Lewis. In 1997 Kindercore released their debut seven-inch ep, \\"Going on a Trek to Iceland\\". The group then recorded their first full length album, the eponymous \\"Masters of the Hemisphere\\", which was released on Kindercore Records in 1998. The band soon expanded to a four-piece, adding multi-instrumentalist Adrian Finch. Several singles and compilation appearances followed, including a release on the Happy Happy Birthday To Me Records singles club, before the band released their second full length, the concept album \\"I Am Not a Freemdoom\\", also on Kindercore. The record garnered mixed reviews, which in part was likely due to the album's rather complicated concept, regarding an island of reservoir-dwelling creatures being enslaved by an evil dog. The \\"Permanent Stranger\\" EP followed in 2002, on the dcBaltimore2012 label. The band split up after their next album, 2002's well received \\"Protest a Dark Anniversary\\". A recording of their then-final show at Athens, Georgia's 40 Watt Club was later released as \\"The Last Show Ever\\". 'masters of the hemisphere ' is related to which object entity through the relation of 'record label'?

The statement seems to describe a form of media, likely a movie, book, or game, that strikes an appropriate balance of suspense and excitement for a target audience of older kids, making it a largely favorable assessment. The phrasing also takes into consideration the suitability of the content for the school-age crowd, which suggests a mindful approach and sensitivity towards various age groups. To break down the sentiment in more detail, let's evaluate each part of the sentence: 1. \\"suspenseful enough for older kids\\" - The word \\"suspenseful\\" here signifies that the content being discussed delivers a certain level of excitement and intrigue, which can foster engagement and curiosity. \\"Older kids\\" indicates a particular age group that would likely appreciate this level of suspense. This segment of the sentence carries a positive sentiment as it implies that the content is both captivating and age-appropriate for children. 2. \\"but not too scary\\" - The phrase \\"not too scary\\" adds an aspect of caution to the sentiment. It acknowledges that the content may have moments that could be considered frightening to some extent, but it is manageable and not excessive. This conveys a certain level of reassurance for those who might be concerned about younger or more sensitive audience members being frightened by the content. 3. \\"for the school-age crowd\\" - The mention of the \\"school-age crowd\\" broadens the scope of the content's potential audience.

Article: Since your bedroom and bed are likely the most frequented areas for masturbation, it is important to control this environment – especially in regards to sleep and what you choose to do in your bedroom. Do not spend time in bed doing other activities such as reading, watching TV, or using the computer. Stay in a standing or sitting position the remainder of the time (during the day). The urge to urinate can be mistaken by the body as the urge for sex/masturbation. Go to the bathroom before you go to sleep at night and immediately when you wake up in the morning. Even if you feel the slightest urge to urinate, relieve yourself as soon as possible. This way, you will fall asleep quickly after lying down in bed and not spend time in bed trying to fall asleep. Drink a glass of milk before bed if necessary to help induce sleep. Go to bed early and wake up early if you can. Avoid staying up too late in the night; this can lead to boredom and increase the likelihood of masturbation. If you have trouble sleeping at night and use masturbation as means for relaxation, try deep-breathing instead. Simply breathe deeply and slowly in through your nose and out through your mouth until you fall asleep. This may help to reduce your urge at the time because you are less likely to become aroused by rubbing up on something. Besides, most masturbation occurs either in a supine (lying on your back) or prone (lying on your belly) position. When you wake up in the morning at the set time, get out of bed as soon as possible and avoid lying in bed awake. Such is a time when masturbation is likely to occur.

A judge has called the Crown Prosecution Service 'crackers' for pursuing a £7.49 criminal damage claim against a retired Army captain. Timothy Hallam, 55, who is said to have sawn the top off a wooden fence post in a long-running dispute with neighbours Alan and Carol Smith in Thurgoland, near Barnsley, is due face trial next month. But district judge John Foster said the decision to prosecute Mr Hallam was 'the height of nonsense' and questioned whether the CPS was in touch with what mattered to the public in a time of austerity. District Judge John Foster, left, has described as 'the height of nonsense' a court case over a £7.49 fence post row between Alan and Carol Smith, pictured right, and their neighbour, retired Army captain Timothy Hallam. Sitting at Barnsley Magistrates Court, the judge said: 'I cannot believe - even given the vagaries of the Crown Prosecution Service these days - that it wants to proceed with this case against a 55-year-old man of exemplary character. 'It is crackers. The CPS really needs to get some sense of what is important to the public. 'This is a dispute between neighbours. It was a fence post before he cut the top off it and it is still a fence post. 'The neighbour is £7.49 out of pocket. It is the height of nonsense.' The Smiths are believed to have filmed Mr Hallam chopping the top off the fence post with their CCTV cameras. Mr Hallam said the case arose from a long-running dispute with his. neighbour over rights of access and encroachment. He said: 'This is a matter of. principle which I will not give way to. If I lose the case it could. undermine a seriously expensive civil action. 'Take my employment away as well as. leave me with a criminal record but the principle is something I will. live with long after all this is over and I want to be able to live. comfortably with my conscience if I have nothing else in the world.' Prosecutor Chantel Lowery-Green said. it was impossible to prove whose land the fence post was on, and said it. was felt Mr Hallam had to be prosecuted because of a chance of further. trouble. A CCTV still showing Timothy Hallam chopping the top off the fence post - he argues it is on his property. The fence post, seen here in the centre of the picture with wires coming out of it, is at the centre of the case. She said the boundary dispute was due to be sorted out at county court. 'A way out of this would have been to offer Captain Hallam the chance to be bound over to keep the peace. 'I understand he will not accept a. binding over because he says he was in his rights to cut the top off the. post. We will have to list it for trial.' Brian. Bushell, for Mr Hallam, said he believed he was within his legal rights. to cut off the top of the post because it was on his land and he. claimed it contravened planning regulations. Neighbours' dispute: The post lies between the Smiths' home, left, and Mr Hallam's house, on the right. The Smiths are said to have been involved in a long-running dispute with their neighbour in the Yorkshire village. Now Barnsley Central MP Dan Jarvis has waded into the row, saying the CPS needed to clarify the issue to assure the public that the correct decision had been made to prosecute. He said: 'Given the current pressures on the public purse and the comments made by the judge, it is right that questions are asked about the wisdom of pursuing a case of this nature which has presumably come at significant expense to the taxpayer.' Mr Hallam was granted unconditional bail until the trial on September 12. A CPS spokesman said following the judge’s comments they would reassess the case before proceeding with the prosecution. He said: 'We are aware of concerns raised by district judge Foster. This is a matter which was charged by the police and we await a full file from them at which point the matter will be further reviewed.'

We typically visualize a solid as tiny particles in constant motion held together by attractive forces. As we add heat to the solid, the motion, or the kinetic energy, of the particles increases. At some temperature, the motion of the particles becomes great enough to overcome the attractive forces. The thermal energy that was added to the solid up to this point was absorbed by the solid as kinetic energy, increasing the speed of the molecules. The lowest temperature at which the particles are able to exist in the liquid form is called the melting point . Now, I have a new situation: As a science experiment for his school homework, Kendra is putting two ice cubes on separate pans and then putting those pans on burners set to different temperatures. Ice cube A is set on top of a burner set to a low temperature, and ice cube B is placed on a burner set quite a bite higher. One minute later, Kendra begins writing down what she sees happening to the ice cubes. Answer this question please: Which ice cube will melt faster? Answer:","completion":"Ice cube B will melt faster because it is placed on a burner with a higher temperature, which will provide more thermal energy to increase the kinetic energy of the particles and overcome the attractive forces holding them as a solid.

The woman is appealing against the UK regulator's refusal to allow her to take her only child's eggs to a US clinic to be used with donor sperm. Her daughter, who died five years ago, was said to have approved of the plan. The mother lost a High Court case last year but was subsequently granted permission to challenge the decision. The latest round of the case is being heard at the Court of Appeal in London, before a panel of three judges. The UK fertility regulator, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA), said, in 2014, the daughter's eggs could not be released from storage in London because she had not given her full written consent before she had died, from bowel cancer at the age of 28. But, in the latest legal proceedings, lawyers acting for the mother told the judges she wanted to fulfil her daughter's wishes to carry a child created from her frozen eggs and \\"raise that child\\". Jenni Richards QC added the eggs would \\"simply be allowed to perish\\" if the court did not rule in her favour. Meanwhile, Catherine Callaghan, appearing for the HFEA, said in a written argument before the court: \\"It is natural to feel sympathy for the appellants' loss and for their wish to keep their daughter's memory alive by trying to conceive a child using their daughter's eggs.\\" But it was not the court's role to decide whether it would have permitted the mother to undergo fertility treatment using her daughter's eggs. Ms Callaghan added: \\"Rather its role is to determine whether Mr Justice Ouseley erred in concluding that the HFEA's statutory approvals committee acted lawfully and rationally in exercising its broad discretion to refuse to authorise export of the frozen eggs to a treatment centre in New York for use in the way proposed.\\" During earlier High Court proceedings in June 2015, the court was told her daughter was desperate to have children and had asked her mother to \\"carry my babies\\". Lawyers acting for the mother and her 59-year-old husband told Mr Justice Ouseley the daughter would have been \\"devastated\\" if she had known her eggs could not be used. But the judge ruled that the HFEA was entitled to find the daughter had not given \\"the required consent\\" and said there had been no breach of the family's human rights. Although she consented for her eggs to be stored for use after her death, she did not fill in a separate form outlining how she wished them to be used. He said he was dismissing the case \\"conscious of the additional distress which this will bring to the claimants, whose aim has been to honour their daughter's dying wish\\". It was thought if the case had been successful her mother could have become the first person in the world to become pregnant using a dead daughter's eggs. In February 2016, when seeking permission to appeal, her lawyers argued there was \\"clear evidence\\" of what the daughter wanted to happen to her eggs when she died. Lord Justice Treacy said the case papers had left him doubtful as to whether there would be \\"sufficiently strong\\" reasons to allow the challenge to continue further. But after hearing submissions in court, he concluded there was \\"an arguable case with a real prospect of success\\".

The university student, 19, believes the only reason she was assaulted was because she was wearing a headscarf. \\"I felt pretty unsafe,\\" Ms Merheb told the BBC. \\"I was pretty angry that this happened to me in my home country.\\" A study has found that women wearing head coverings are most at risk of Islamophobic attacks in Australia. The report has been billed as the nation's first of its kind. The study analysed 243 incidents reported to the Islamophobia Register of Australia between September 2014 and December 2015. Almost three-quarters of those behind the abuse were male. The victims were 68% women - four in five of them were wearing a head covering. Of female victims, more than 30% were accompanied by a child at the time. Despite about half of the incidents taking place in public, bystanders intervened in only 25% of cases. The authors defined an Islamophobic incident as any act of \\"abusive hatred, vilification and violence inflicted on Muslims going about their daily lives\\". The Islamophobia in Australia study involved several universities, the Islamic Sciences and Research Academy of Australia and the Diversity Council Australia. Ms Merheb said although her minor bruising and facial cuts had healed after the May incident, she remained uneasy about wearing a headscarf in public. \\"Every person I know who wears it is always wary that something is going to happen,\\" she said. Study co-author Dr Mehmet Ozalp, from Charles Sturt University, said Islamophobia was often a reaction to anti-Islam political rhetoric and media coverage of terrorism. \\"Over time people associate Islam and Muslims with terrorism and violence - and they lash out in anger at that,\\" said Dr Ozalp. \\"But it is these innocent Muslims - mainly women - that are visible in public.\\" Dr Ozalp said that Islamophobia should be better researched and documented around the world. \\"I think the first solution is that the problem has to be recognised at all levels including in academia and political circles,\\" he said.

Question: suppose less human activity happens, how will it affect less forest formation. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect The answer to this question is:","completion":"less effect. Step 1: Analyzing the scenario To answer this question, we must consider the process of forest formation and the effects of reduced human activity on it. In the given process: - Networks of trees start forming - The trees die off - The dead material provides nutrients for more trees - The rising trees provide shelter - And more organisms begin to thrive - The ecosystem known as a forest is made Step 2: Human activity's effect on forest formation Human activities such as deforestation, urbanization, and pollution can negatively impact forest formation. When there is less human activity, there could be less deforestation, allowing trees to mature and die, thereby providing nutrients for new trees to grow and shelter for other organisms. Step 3: Examining the second effect mentioned The second effect mentioned in the process is \\"the trees die off.\\" In general, this step contributes to forest formation by providing nutrients for more trees to grow. Trees might die off because of natural reasons or human activities. In our case, we assume that less human activity is happening. Step 4: Assessing the perturbation impact on the second effect Less human activity might reduce the direct negative impacts on the forest such as deforestation or pollution. Since the trees might then have more opportunities to die off naturally without significant human interference, this could help the natural cycle of decomposition and nutrient replenishment to continue. Step 5: Conclusion The supposed perturbation (less human activity) might have less effect on the forest formation's second effect (the trees die off) since trees would experience more natural life cycles and decomposition processes. This could potentially contribute positively to the overall growth and success of the forest ecosystem."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

It was a fresh, exciting sound, something he hadn't experienced before. It seemed to encompass a mixture of various genres, from rock to electronic and even a hint of classical influences. The melodies were intricate, the beats infectious, and the harmonies resonated deeply within William's heart. This was music that truly spoke to him, and he felt an instant connection to the artist. As William continued to listen, he couldn't help but tap his feet and nod his head to the rhythm, feeling the energy coursing through his veins. Seeing William's enthusiasm, Adam couldn't help but smile, pleased to introduce someone else to the unique sound that had captured his own heart. Considering the options at hand, Adam decided to introduce William to even more of the captivating music that the artist had to offer. He thought for a moment before deciding on the perfect course of action: he was going to gift his good friend William with a CD by the same artist. He knew that this was no ordinary collection of songs, but rather a compilation filled with magic that had the power to inspire and lift one's spirits. Excitedly, Adam shared his decision with William, whose eyes lit up with pure joy. Grateful for the thoughtful gesture, William eagerly accepted the CD and marveled at the album art, which showcased the brilliant creativity and vision of the artist. He knew that Adam's generous gift held endless hours of musical bliss within its compact disc, and the prospect of discovering more about the mysterious artist filled him with anticipation. Over the next few weeks, William dove headfirst into the fascinating world created by the musician.

They formed a deeper bond, their friendship solidified not only by their shared love for the music, but also by the emotional connections it helped foster. Through laughter and tears, they found solace in the music and a sense of belonging; it became more than just a shared favorite artist, but an indelible part of their lives. Ultimately, Adam's decision to share the CD with William had profound consequences for both of them. It opened doors they would have never even known existed and forged a friendship that would never fade, all the while leading them on a wondrous journey filled with spine-tingling melodies, powerful lyrics, and the beauty that comes when two souls are bound together by the magic of music."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Premise: \\"Dissenting, the Wall Street Journal 's Donald Lyons complains that Leguizamo's rants about Latino stereotypes make him a self-important bore.\\" Hypothesis: \\"Lyons enjoys Leguizamo's rants.\\" Step 2: Analyze the premise. The premise states that Donald Lyons complains about Leguizamo's rants. Specifically, Lyons finds the rants about Latino stereotypes to make Leguizamo come across as self-important and boring. Step 3: Compare the premise to the hypothesis. By stating that Lyons complains about Leguizamo's rants, the premise suggests that Lyons does not enjoy the rants. This is in direct contradiction to the hypothesis, which claims that Lyons enjoys the rants. Step 4: Determine if the premise entails the hypothesis. Given that the premise suggests that Lyons does not enjoy the rants, and the hypothesis claims that he does, the premise contradicts the hypothesis. Therefore, if the premise is true, it does not entail the hypothesis. In fact, it tells us that the hypothesis is likely false."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

How do I express that I care?\\" Would you say that these questions are the same?","completion":"No, these questions are not the same. They address different topics and require separate explanations. Let me provide a detailed answer for each question. 1) \\"Why do people say 'mine as well,' instead of 'might as well'?\\" The phrase \\"mine as well\\" is likely a malapropism or a mishearing of the correct phrase \\"might as well.\\" Malapropisms occur when a word or phrase is mistakenly used in place of a similar-sounding one, often unintentionally creating a humorous effect. In this case, the phrase \\"might as well\\" is the accurate expression, which means that there is no significant difference or no good reason not to do something. It is typically used to suggest that something is worth trying or that it cannot be any worse than not doing it. The confusion between \\"mine as well\\" and \\"might as well\\" may arise mainly from informal conversations or non-native speakers being unfamiliar with the correct phrase. In spoken language, words can sometimes be unclear and can easily be misconstrued, particularly when often-used expressions are mispronounced or misunderstood. It is essential to use the proper phrase \\"might as well\\" to convey the intended meaning accurately and avoid confusion in both written and spoken language. Proper usage ensures effective communication and prevents misunderstandings. 2) \\"People say I am nonchalant and have an 'oh! well!' attitude. How do I express that I care?\\" Being perceived as nonchalant or having an \\"oh! well!\\" attitude may give others the impression that you are indifferent or uncaring. To show that you genuinely care, consider the following suggestions: a. Be mindful of your body language: Body language is a vital component of communication, as it can sometimes convey more meaning than words. Make sure to maintain eye contact, have an open posture, and avoid crossing your arms when engaging with others. These actions can help project an image of warmth, attentiveness, and genuine interest. b. Actively listen: Engage in active listening by paying close attention to the speaker, responding empathetically, and asking relevant questions. This demonstrates that you are invested in understanding their perspectives or concerns. c. Express your feelings: Communicate your emotions and thoughts openly with others. Let them know that you appreciate being included in the conversation and that their opinions are important to you. d. Offer assistance: If someone needs help or support, take initiative and find ways to provide it. This can range from lending an ear when they need to vent or helping them brainstorm solutions to their problem. Providing assistance shows that you value the person and their well-being. e. Be responsive and reliable: Respond promptly to messages or calls, and follow through on commitments. Being reliable and responsible indicates that you respect others' time and priorities, and that you are willing to put in the effort for them. By taking these steps to enhance your communication skills and showcase empathy, you will be better able to convey that you care about others and that you are not simply nonchalant or indifferent to their feelings and experiences."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

As a result of the now near-universal human reliance upon agriculture, the few contemporary hunter-gatherer cultures usually live in areas unsuitable for agricultural use. Is there an answer to this question (If it cannot be answered, say \\"unanswerable\\"): How many cultures rely on agriculture?","completion":"Determining the exact number of cultures that rely on agriculture is a complex task due to the ever-changing nature of human societies and the vast diversity of cultural practices around the world. Nevertheless, we can provide an approximate understanding of the prevalence of agricultural practices in global cultures. Agriculture has been a staple of human societies for around 12,000 years, beginning with the Neolithic Revolution. Since then, it has spread throughout the world, becoming the primary source of sustenance for the vast majority of human populations. Presently, nearly every nation and culture on Earth engages in some form of agricultural practice, whether it be large-scale farming or small-scale subsistence agriculture. It is important to note that agriculture encompasses a wide range of practices and traditions, as different societies have cultivated various types of crops and employed diverse farming methods. For instance, rice paddies are predominantly found in Asian cultures, while corn and wheat farming are more prevalent in North and South America and Europe, respectively. While it is impossible to determine an exact number of cultures that rely on agriculture, we can assert that a significant portion of human societies do so, accounting for much of the global population. This is evidenced by the presence of agriculture in every inhabited continent and in cultures with varying levels of technological advancement and resources. Conversely, there are relatively few hunter-gatherer cultures remaining today, numbering only in the hundreds. These communities typically reside in remote locations or regions with challenging climates, such as the Arctic, deserts, and dense rainforests. Such environments tend to preclude large-scale agriculture, essentially forcing these groups to resort to traditional hunting and gathering practices for sustenance. Furthermore, hunter-gatherer societies are often marginalized, making it difficult for them to adopt agricultural practices even if they inhabit suitable regions. In summary, while it is challenging to pin down an exact number of cultures that rely on agriculture, it can be reasonably argued that the majority of the global human population depends on agricultural practices for their sustenance and livelihood. Farming has become a near-universal feature of human societies, with only a small fraction of extant cultures still maintaining a hunter-gatherer lifestyle."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The \`\`Dark Ages'' is a historical periodization traditionally referring to the Middle Ages, that asserts that a demographic, cultural, and economic deterioration occurred in Western Europe following the decline of the Roman Empire. is the dark ages the same as the middle ages?","completion":"The terms \\"Dark Ages\\" and \\"Middle Ages\\" are often used interchangeably, but they have different connotations. The Middle Ages is a more neutral term that describes the period of European history between the fall of the Roman Empire in the 5th century and the beginning of the Renaissance in the 14th century. The Dark Ages, on the other hand, specifically refers to the initial centuries of the Middle Ages (roughly from the 5th to the 10th century), a time that has been characterized as an era of cultural and economic stagnation with little to no progress. It is important to note that the perception of this period as \\"dark\\" is a matter of debate among historians, as recent historiography has provided evidence of significant cultural and technological advancements in this period, particularly in the Islamic world and Byzantine Empire. Nevertheless, the concept of the Dark Ages originates from the general decline in cultural and technological progress during this time in comparison to the achievements of the preceding Roman Empire and the later Renaissance era. While the concept of the Dark Ages is primarily focused on the decline and deteriorating conditions in Western Europe, the Middle Ages as a whole encompasses a much broader range of historical events, cultural developments, and regional variations. Apart from the initial decline, the Middle Ages is also marked by the periods of the Early Middle Ages (5th to 10th centuries), High Middle Ages (11th to 13th centuries), and Late Middle Ages (14th to 15th centuries). Each of these epochs has its own unique characteristics, and a variety of developments took place during these times, including the rise of feudalism, the spread of Christianity, cultural and artistic achievements of the Gothic and Romanesque styles, the establishment of the Holy Roman Empire, and many more. Therefore, while the Dark Ages is a specific and potentially negative characterization of the first few centuries of the Middle Ages, it is not entirely accurate to equate the two terms. The Middle Ages is a more comprehensive and neutral term that encompasses a range of historical events and developments that took place between the decline of the Roman Empire and the emergence of the Renaissance. Meanwhile, the Dark Ages refers to the initial phase of this period, traditionally viewed as a time of decline and stagnation in Western Europe. However, it is essential to keep in mind that historians continue to debate the accuracy and relevance of the term \\"Dark Ages,\\" as more nuanced views of this period emerge."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Input: Article: Campers Gene and Marie Marsden took pride in being good citizens when in the wild. While driving miles to the Green River Lakes area, they taught their children what they had learned in the bear safety handbook put out by the Bridger-Teton Forest Service. Mr. and Mrs. Marsden did their best to keep a tidy camp. As the handbook had said to hang all food at least ten feet off the ground and four feet out from the trees, they did that and locked their food in their trailer at night. It was already dark when they went to bed, but they _ the campsite with flashlights, making sure nothing was left out. Following the bear book's advice, they slept a hundred yards from where they cooked their food, and kept the car near their tents, separated from the trailer, which they left up at the other camp. The Marsdens liked having their dog Spike on guard. But on the first night, Spike would not stop barking. When Marie Marsden pulled the tent open and shone her flashlight, she saw a young bear. They all piled into the car and drove quickly down the path, calling out of the window to Spike and abandoning the trailer. They drove to a pay phone and called a Fish and Game Department guard, who identified the bear by the white ring of the fur the Marsdens had seen around his neck. The authorities informed the Marsdens that the bear was a young male that they'd been keeping an eye on. The next morning, the Marsdens heard helicopters circling over the mountain and wondered if it might have something to do with the bear. After spending the night in the public campground, they drove back to their site. Wandering the area in search of clues, Marie came to a stop below a tall tree. She slapped her head and shouted, \\"Oh no!\\" \\"What is it?\\" Gene asked. Marie pointed at the ground where Spike's dog food bowl lay upside down. A week after their return home, the Marsdens read the headline in their local paper. \\"Bear Killed in Wind Rivers.\\" According to the article, the Fish and Game Department had shot the young bear because, having been rewarded for invading a human campsite, it would likely to do so again. The Marsdens knew they had been lucky in the encounter, yet much to their shame and sadness, they also knew that the bear had not. Answer: They did what the bear safety handbook had said.

However, it does provide some relevant context and background information about the timber export sanctions imposed by the United Nations on Liberia in 2003. To answer the question \\"When were the timber export sanctions lifted for Liberia?\\", it is necessary to look further into the timeline and events that took place after the UN imposed these sanctions in 2003. The United Nations imposed sanctions on Liberian timber exports in 2003, through the UN Security Council Resolution 1478, due to concerns that the timber industry was funding illegal armed groups and contributing to regional instability, particularly in Sierra Leone. These sanctions came in addition to the sanctions on diamond exports imposed in 2001 (Resolution 1343), which served similar purposes of preventing the use of natural resources by then-president Charles Taylor and his government, to fuel conflict in West Africa. The timber export sanctions on Liberia were eventually lifted on June 20, 2006, by the UN Security Council Resolution 1689. The decision to lift the sanctions came after the situation in Liberia had improved significantly, particularly with the election of Ellen Johnson Sirleaf as the President in November 2005. President Sirleaf's commitment to reform, transparency, and good governance played a key role in convincing the international community that Liberia was ready to rejoin the legitimate global timber trade. The lifted sanctions also reflected acknowledgment of the country’s efforts to establish a legal framework and control mechanisms to ensure that timber revenues would be used for social and economic development, rather than perpetuating conflict and corruption. In conclusion, although the provided statement does not directly answer the question, it gives essential historical context. The timber export sanctions on Liberia were lifted on June 20, 2006, through the UN Security Council Resolution 1689, following significant progress in political stability and national governance as well as credible actions towards ensuring proper management of timber revenues for the country's development."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

A) tell us about an unusual graduation gift B) introduce a dangerous journey to us C) give advice on how to travel to Tibet D) encourage us to be a teacher in Tibet Answer:","completion":"A) tell us about an unusual graduation gift This passage narrates the story of Cai Kaiyuan, a 21-year-old student who decided to give himself an unconventional graduation gift: volunteering as a teacher in a remote village in Tibet. Unlike most students, Cai's choice of a graduation gift was not a car or money for a deposit on a house. Instead, he sought a unique experience that would lead to self-discovery and personal growth. Cai initially planned to cycle from Sichuan to Tibet, hoping to enjoy the beautiful scenery along the way. However, the difficult conditions and challenges he faced during the journey, such as cycling at high altitudes, frostbitten fingers, icy roads, and lack of oxygen, led him to reconsider his goals and aspirations. These experiences ultimately changed his outlook on life. Upon meeting other university students during his trip, Cai was particularly inspired by a girl named Wu Ling, who planned to work as a teacher in a primary school in Tibet after her journey. Cai was impressed by her dedication and resolve despite her appearance and physical stature. Later, in Shigatse, he connected with two young girls who wanted to improve their Mandarin. This encounter solidified his passion for helping the locals improve their language skills, as he understood the importance of education for their future opportunities. In summary, the passage highlights an unusual graduation gift with elements of self-discovery, altruism, and personal challenge. While it also touches upon the difficulties faced during a journey to Tibet, the central focus lies on Cai's decision to volunteer as a teacher in a remote village and the experiences that led him to make that choice."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Just as he is about to activate the electricity for container B, the power goes out, and he is unable to do so. Frustrated, John goes to find the circuit breaker to see if a fuse has blown. Will the gas in container A have a higher or lower energy level than container B? Hint: Noble gases are also used to fill the glass tubes of lighted signs like the one in the Figure below . Although noble gases are chemically nonreactive, their electrons can be energized by sending an electric current through them. When this happens, the electrons jump to a higher energy level. When the electrons return to their original energy level, they give off energy as light. Different noble gases give off light of different colors. Neon gives off reddish-orange light, like the word “Open” in the sign below. Krypton gives off violet light and xenon gives off blue light. Answer:","completion":"The gas in container A will have a higher energy level than container B. This is because when John sends electricity through container A, the electrons in the noble gas are energized and jump to a higher energy level, as mentioned in the hint. In contrast, container B did not receive electricity, so its electrons remain at their original energy level."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It was a three person show, and one of the roles was written specifically for me. Many of the lines were written after we improvised the scenes in my living room as she wrote the piece. Took it to Scotland, where it was quite well received. A year or so later, it was being produced in New York in a much more prestigious setting. I auditioned, was called back a couple times, and got to the play the role again. Fantastic! THEN, it was produced by an even larger theatre. Different producer, different casting director, etc. I went to the open call for it, and the casting director treated me really poorly. It was odd. She looked at my resume and said, “It says you have already played this role.” I said, “Yes, I was fortunate enough to workshop it and originate the role.” She looked at me like I was lying. I mean, shuttled me out the door like I was a crazy woman. Needless to say, I was not called back. And that was okay—(I mean, of course I wanted to do the show with this group of people, but hey, we can’t always get what we want). Fast forward to opening night: my playwright friend invites me to see the show. The actress playing “my” role was fantastic, but they had to change lines in the script that indicated what she looked like, because she was of Hawaiian descent. Again, no big deal…and she was great! What was strange was meeting the director that evening. My friend introduced me as the originator of the role, and the director asked me why I hadn’t auditioned…Overall, it wasn’t a harsh rejection or a terrible story, it was just weird to have been treated like a liar when I was not lying… According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.

Donald Trump declined Monday to back down from his vow to deport 11 million immigrants in the country illegally, despite a top advisor’s signal that he might take a more moderate approach. The Republican presidential nominee said that he would enforce the law more rigorously than other presidents and that his first priority would be criminals, such as Los Angeles gang leaders. “They’re going to be out of here so fast, your head will spin,” Trump told Fox News. “As far as the rest, we’re going to go through the process, like they are now — perhaps with a lot more energy.” Trump’s remarks came a day after his new campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, suggested he might not honor his pledge during the Republican primaries to use a “deportation force” to expel 11 million immigrants who lack legal papers. “To be determined,” she told CNN. It was the latest of many occasions when Trump advisors have suggested he might adjust his rhetoric to widen his appeal, only to be contradicted by a candidate who resists attempts to bend his will.

At a rally Monday night in Akron, Ohio, Trump struggled to stick to a script prepared by campaign staff, repeatedly veering from the words on his teleprompter. Responding to chants of “Build that wall,” Trump assured the crowd that he would seal the southern border, a plan that is popular among his overwhelmingly white loyalists but offensive to many Latinos and Asians whose votes he needs in Colorado, Nevada and Florida. “Don’t worry. We’re going to build the wall,” he said. “That wall will go up so fast, your head will spin. And you’ll say, ‘You know, he meant it.’ And you know what else I mean? Mexico is going to pay for the wall.” Reading a passage on trade, the New York businessman added President Obama’s middle name to the prepared remarks, deploring the economic legacy of “Barack Hussein Obama.” It was a reminder of Trump’s suggestions that the Christian president might secretly be a Muslim who sympathizes with terrorists. Trump, who has long fought critics’ charge that he is racist, urged supporters “to reject the bigotry of Hillary Clinton.” The Democratic presidential nominee, he said, “sees people of color only as votes, and not as human beings worthy of a better future.” He blamed Democrats for “poverty, failing schools and broken homes” in America’s inner cities. “Our government has totally failed our African American friends, our Hispanic friends and the people of our country, period,” he said. “To the African Americans, who I employ so many of, so many people, to the Hispanics, tremendous people, what the hell do you have to lose?” Trump said. “Give me a chance. I’ll straighten it out.” “It is a disaster the way African Americans are living in many cases, and in many cases the way Hispanics are living, and I say it with such a deep felt feeling: What do you have to lose?” Trump said that once he cuts crime and creates jobs, “you’ll be able to walk down the street without getting shot. Right now, you walk down the street, you get shot.” After the rally, the Clinton campaign released a statement denouncing Trump for “insults, fear and stereotypes that set our community back and further divide our country.” Trump’s remarks were not surprising, it said, for “a man who questions the citizenship of the first African American president, has a disturbing pattern of courting white supremacists and has been sued for housing discrimination against communities of color.” At a Republican presidential debate in November, Trump praised President Dwight Eisenhower’s deportation program of the 1950s, known as “Operation Wetback.” “Moved 1.5 million illegal immigrants out of this country, moved them just beyond the border,” Trump said after one of his competitors, Ohio Gov. John Kasich, argued that his vow to expel 11 million immigrants “makes no sense.” “They came back. Moved them again, beyond the border. They came back. Didn't like it. Moved them way south. They never came back.” Asked the next day how he would round up 11 million people, Trump told MSNBC, “You are going to have a deportation force, and you are going to do it humanely.” In Akron, Trump was introduced by former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who suggested Clinton should be indicted for the way she handled her email as secretary of State. “Lock her up!” the audience shouted. “No!” Giuliani hollered back. “Beat her!

Now a meeting with a Hispanic advisory panel and statements from his surrogates are calling into question whether that's still the plan. (Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post) After spending a few days reflecting on his immigration stances and consulting with Hispanic supporters, Donald Trump on Monday detailed how he would deal with the millions of immigrants illegally living in the United States: Enforce laws that are already on the books and continue to do what President Obama is doing, although \\"perhaps with a lot more energy.\\" This strategy marks a sudden change for the Republican nominee, who has presented himself as a politically incorrect outsider who is not afraid to take extreme measures to combat illegal immigration, such as deporting 11 million people or constructing a massive wall along the Southern border. For more than a year, Trump insisted that all illegal immigrants \\"have got to go\\" and that he would create a \\"deportation force\\" to carry out the task. Trump struck a starkly different tone during an interview with Bill O'Reilly that aired on Fox News on Monday night. Trump said he would separate the country's undocumented immigrants into two groups: The \\"bad ones\\" who would be kicked out of the country as soon as he takes office and \\"everybody else\\" who would go through the same process that the Obama Administration is currently using. \\"The first thing we're going to do if and when I win is we're going to get rid of all of the bad ones,\\" Trump said. \\"We've got gang members, we have killers, we have a lot of bad people that have to get out of this country. We're going to get them out, and the police know who they are. They're known by law enforcement who they are. We don't do anything. They go around killing people and hurting people, and they're going to be out of this country so fast your head will spin. We have existing laws that allow you to do that.\\" [Donald Trump delays giving an immigration speech] The United States has long deported illegal immigrants who are violent criminals, and Obama's administration has focused on targeting “felons, not families.” As the United States recently saw a surge of tens of thousands of women and children fleeing violence and corruption in Central America, the administration has deported all new arrivals who did not qualify for political asylum in hopes of deterring others from making the dangerous journey — a stance that has angered immigrant rights groups. Clinton has said that she would deport only violent criminals and terrorists. Trump has long called for quicker removal of illegal immigrants who become violent. On Monday night, Trump explained how he would address nonviolent illegal immigrants. \\"As far as everybody else, we're going to go through the process,\\" Trump said. \\"What people don't know is that Obama got tremendous numbers of people out of the country. Bush, the same thing. Lots of people were brought out of the country with the existing laws. Well, I'm going to do the same thing.\\" Donald Trump at a rally in Dimondale, Mich. (Carlo Allegri/Reuters) Later in the interview, Trump again explained how this group of people would be treated. \\"As far as the rest, we're going to go through the process, like they are now, perhaps with a lot more energy, and we're going to do it only through the system of laws,\\" Trump said. At one point, O'Reilly asked Trump about expanding the court system to adjudicate all of these cases and setting up detention centers to house people as they wait for their immigration cases to be heard. Trump quickly batted down the suggestion that he would house people in detention centers. [ In the latest shift, Donald Trump’s campaign seems to waver on mass deportations ] \\"You don't have to put them in a detention center,\\" Trump said. \\"Bill, you're the first one to mention 'detention center.' You don't have to put them in a detention center. ... I'm not going to put them in a detention center. No.\\" O'Reilly said that he suggested detention centers because Trump had previously likened his plans to mass deportations carried out during the 1950s under President Dwight D. Eisenhower. \\"I said that it's something that has been done in a very strong manner,\\" Trump said, explaining why he had originally referenced the historic deportations. \\"I don't agree with that.

In Hillary Clinton’s world, we have one set of rules for her – and another set of rules for everyone else,\\" he said. The Clinton Foundation has been scrutinized for years because of the potential for conflicts of interest, but in recent days, leaders seemed to acknowledge critics, announcing that if Clinton wins the presidency, the foundation will no longer accept foreign contributions. During his remarks, Trump also amplified his appeal to African American and Hispanic voters, repeatedly asking \\"What do you have to lose\\" by supporting him in the race.\\" He described rampant crime in inner cities that he pinned on Democratic municipal leaders. Under a Trump administration, he said, \\"You'll be able to walk down the street without getting shot.

Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, “has placed several news organizations on notice of her legal claims against them, including Daily Mail among others, for making false and defamatory statements about her supposedly having been an ‘escort’ in the 1990s.” “All such statements are 100 percent false, highly damaging to her reputation, and personally hurtful,” Mr. Harder added. “She understands that news media have certain leeway in a presidential campaign, but outright lying about her in this way exceeds all bounds of appropriate news reporting and human decency.” He said no suit had been filed, but added, “That may change.” The Daily Mail, a British tabloid, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Write an article based on this \\"Pakistan's Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani has proved himself to be a wily and resilient political operator who up until June 2012 had persistently defied his critics and the might of the judiciary to cling onto his job.\\" Article:","completion":"Title: The Resilience of Pakistan's Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani up to June 2012 Introduction The history of Pakistan's political climate bears witness to the tireless efforts of countless leaders working to navigate the country's complex terrain. One such leader, Yousuf Raza Gilani, served as the 16th Prime Minister of Pakistan from March 2008 to June 2012, a time marked by persisting challenges and an ever-evolving political landscape. Through discreet political maneuvers and determination, Gilani repeatedly silenced critics and resisted the judiciary throughout his tenure, effectively securing his position in office until June 2012. The Wily Political Operator: Yousuf Raza Gilani Born on June 9, 1952, Yousuf Raza Gilani's political aptitude can be traced back to his lineage, as he hails from an influential family in the Multan district in the Punjab province. His family's long history of political engagement provided him with a strong foundation, eventually propelling him into a successful political run. As a member of Pakistan's major political party, the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), Gilani's wit and proficiency made it easier for him to infiltrate the political world. It was during his tenure as Prime Minister when he first encountered scrutiny from Pakistan's Supreme Court. Following accusations of financial corruption in 2009, the apex court ordered the reopening of corruption cases against the President Asif Ali Zardari. Gilani, however, was resolute in rejecting the court's request, adamant that the sitting President enjoyed immunity from prosecution. This dispute would mark the beginning of Gilani's brushes with the judiciary- a high-stakes tug-of-war that would continue to play out for the duration of his time in office. Enduring the Storm: Defying Critics and the Judiciary Despite the clouds of controversy that loomed over him, Gilani demonstrated a remarkable ability to survive the hostile political environment. Throughout his time as Prime Minister, he employed a variety of tactics to ensure his longevity in the face of adversity. Among the key strategies he employed were the formation of essential political alliances, remaining loyal to party leaders, and navigating parliamentary politics with dexterity. First, Gilani's keen understanding of the importance of political alliances became his secret weapon in securing his office. His unwavering loyalty to the PPP, particularly its party leaders, allowed him to execute directives effectively and deflect backlash from the opposition. By aligning himself with influential stakeholders, Gilani ensured that the balance of power was in his favor, which safeguarded him against legal challenges. Second, his mastery of parliamentary politics allowed him to overcome numerous obstacles that arose throughout his tenure. His compassionate demeanor made it easier for him to establish rapport with members of the opposition, using their support to push through significant bills and policies. This strategy was not only instrumental in achieving breakthroughs for the politicians but also created a favorable reputation for himself, both locally and internationally. Lastly, remaining loyal to the PPP ensured that he maintained the backing of his party. Throughout his tenure, Gilani consistently supported party leaders and reinforced the PPP's vision for a progressive and prosperous Pakistan. This loyalty reinforced his position within the party and solidified his power base, effectively allowing him to face down challenges from the judiciary and resist any attempts to remove him from office. Conclusion Yousuf Raza Gilani's tenure as Pakistan's 16th Prime Minister highlights a story of resilience marred by numerous complexities and hurdles. Despite the challenges posed by Pakistan's turbulence-afflicted political climate, Gilani's unwavering determination helped him maintain his position in the face of critics and the judiciary until June 2012. His unique style, adept political maneuverings, and unwavering loyalty to his party serve as a testament to his political mastery and resilience in office."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: When we give our kids holiday gifts, many of us can't wait to hear their appreciative cries of\\"thank you!\\"once the wrapping gets ripped off. But here's a tip: You'd be wise not to expect much gratitude from them for what they receive. Gratitude can make us happier, healthier, and even fitter. But do the kids show their gratitude for the stuff we buy them? All the research I've done has convinced me that it won't happen. One mom told me that when she asked her 16-year-old son to thank her for buying him a cellphone, he said, \\"But that's what moms should do.\\" From a teenager's angle, it's a parent's responsibility to take care of the family. According to Dunham, Yale's assistant professor of psychology, \\"When teenagers code it that way, a gift is no longer something given freely and voluntarily\\"--it's just mom and dad living up to their obligation. Parents do have the right to demand good manners and children should thank sincerely whoever gives them something. But kids can't know how blessed they are unless they have a basis for comparison. And they don't learn that by a parent complaining that they're ungrateful. We need to give our children the gift of a wider world view. Show by example that gratitude isn't aboutstuff--which ultimately can't make any of us happy anyway.It's about realizing how lucky you are and paying your good fortune forward. You can collect all the charitable appeals and sit down together with the kids to go through them. You set the budget for giving and the kids decide how it's distributed. Once the conversation about gratitude gets started, it's much easier to continue all year. Also you can set up a family routine at bedtime where kids describe three things that have made them grateful. When kids go off to college, you can text them a picture each week of something that inspires your appreciation. Teaching children to focus on the positive and appreciate the good in their lives is perhaps the greatest gift we can give them. And we can all learn together that the things that really... Question: How do children respond when receiving gifts from their parents? Answer: Answer:","completion":"Children often respond to receiving gifts from their parents with an expectation that it is the parent's responsibility to take care of the family and provide them with what they need or desire. This perspective might hinder them from expressing genuine gratitude for the gifts they receive, as they may view them as a result of their parents simply fulfilling their duties. To counter this, it is important for parents to encourage a wider worldview and an understanding of gratitude that goes beyond material possessions. By teaching children to focus on the positive aspects of their lives and appreciate their good fortune, parents can nurture a more genuine sense of gratitude in their children when receiving gifts."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In this problem, a car travels from San Diego to San Francisco and back at different speeds. The average speed of the trip is the total distance traveled divided by the total time taken. Step 2: Identify the given information in the problem. - The average speed from San Diego to San Francisco is 54 mph. - The journey back takes twice as long. Step 3: Use the given information to find the total distance and total time of the trip. For this step, let's assume the distance between San Diego and San Francisco is \\"D\\" miles. - Since the journey back takes twice the time, it means the car's average speed on its way back is half of its speed on its way to San Francisco, so 54/2 = 27 mph. - The total distance of the trip is the distance from San Diego to San Francisco, multiplied by 2 (since the car goes there and back): 2D. - To find the total time of the trip, add the time for the journey to San Francisco and the time back: D/54 (time to San Francisco) + D/27 (time back). - The total time can be expressed as: (D/54) + (D/27). Step 4: Find the average speed of the trip. The average speed of the trip is the total distance traveled divided by the total time taken. So, divide the total distance (2D) by the total time ((D/54) + (D/27)). The average speed formula is: Average Speed = (2D) / [(D/54) + (D/27)] Step 5: Choose the correct answer choice using the information from steps 3 and 4.

Please answer the following question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: In 1917, Baby Jane Hudson is a vaudevillian child star while her sister Blanche Hudson is not famous and overlooked by their father. By 1935, both sisters are movie actors, but Blanche has achieved stardom, while Janeâs films have flopped, leading Jane to drink heavily. One night, returning from a party, one of the sisters gets out of the car to open the gate leading up to the house, while the other attempts to run her over. The resulting accident leaves Blanche paralyzed. In 1962, a wheelchair-bound Blanche (Joan Crawford) and a bitter, irritable Jane (Bette Davis) are living together in Blanche's mansion. Because she is wheelchair-bound, Blanche rarely leaves her bedroom on the second floor and becomes close with her cleaning woman, Elvira (Maidie Norman). Elvira believes that Jane is exhibiting symptoms of mental illness and becomes concerned for Blanche's well-being, but Blanche defends her sister. Later, when Blanche informs Jane she may be selling the house, Jane's mental health begins to deteriorate further. During an argument, she removes the telephone from Blanche's bedroom, cutting Blanche off from the outside world. Later, Jane begins denying Blanche food, killing her pet parakeet and serving it to her on a platter. Later, when Jane leaves the house to put an advertisement in the paper, Blanche tries to get the attention of her neighbor, Mrs. Bates (Anna Lee), by writing a note pleading for help and throwing it out her bedroom window. Jane returns in time to notice the note and prevents Mrs. Bates from seeing it. When Jane reads the note, the two sisters quarrel again. The next time Elvira comes to clean the house, Jane initially pays her and gives her the day off, but when Elvira returns later on, Jane abruptly fires her and sends her away.

He turns out to be Gabe Walker, a ranger with Rocky Mountain Rescue. (Yes, that makes him \\"Ranger Walker,\\" and he is addressed as such several times during the course of the movie.) He is in communication with his co-worker and girlfriend, Jessie, who is on a chopper piloted by an older co-worker, Frank. The three are mounting a rescue of yet another co-worker, Hal Tucker, and his girlfriend Sarah, who is on her first climb. Hal and Sarah made it to the top of the mountain, but Hal has aggravated an old knee injury and can't make it back down.Gabe makes it to the top of the peak where Hal and Sarah are. The chopper drops Gabe a cable, which he secures, while the chopper lands on a nearby peak. All is set for the three to shuttle across the cable to where the chopper is. There is a lot of light-hearted banter as this is a routine operation that they all (except Sarah) do all the time. Hal goes first, and as he is crossing, Gabe asks Sarah how Hal persuaded her to accompany him on this escapade. She replies laconically, \\"He told me it's better than sex.\\"Hal makes it across and now it's Sarah's turn. She is a little frightened at the thought of hanging from a cable 4,000 feet above the ground, but the fact that Hal crossed without incident is reassuring. Halfway across her equipment fails and suddenly she is hanging by a strap and unable to reach and grab onto the cable. Gabe quickly crosses to her and grabs her arm just as the strap breaks free. But they are unable to keep their grip on each other, and Sarah falls 4,000 feet to her death.

Premise: Two gray puppies are chewing on a plastic red toy. Hypothesis: Two dogs are playing Let's examine the multi-select options one by one: (1). yes The premise mentions \\"two gray puppies\\" which are essentially young dogs. It is stated that they are \\"chewing on a plastic red toy\\". This kind of behavior is indicative of playtime for puppies, as they often engage in play as a way to learn, interact with others, and release energy. Therefore, the hypothesis indicating that \\"two dogs are playing\\" can be considered true based on the information provided in the premise. (2). it is not possible to tell Although there could always be more context or information that could further clarify the situation (e.g., if the puppies are being supervised, if they are truly enjoying the playtime, etc.), the information present in the premise is enough to conclude that two dogs are playing. The fact that they are chewing a toy leans in favor of considering them as playing. Therefore, we can reject option 2 as it is possible to tell, based on the premise, that the hypothesis is true. (3). no As explained in the assessment of option 1, there is adequate information in the premise to determine that two dogs are playing.

Here is a question about this article: The Ottoman Empire, believed to be about to collapse, was portrayed in the press as the sick man of Europe\\". The Balkan states, with the partial exception of Bosnia and Albania, were primarily Christian. Starting in 1894 the Ottomans struck at the Armenians on the explicit grounds that they were a non-Muslim people and as such were a potential threat to the Muslim empire within which they resided. The Hamidian Massacres aroused the indignation of the entire Christian world. In the United States the now aging Julia Ward Howe, author of the Battle Hymn of the Republic, leaped into the war of words and joined the Red Cross. Relations of minorities within the Ottoman Empire and the disposition of former Ottoman lands became known as the \\"Eastern Question,\\" as the Ottomans were on the east of Europe. What is the answer to this question: How was the Ottoman Empire portrayed in the press?","completion":"The Ottoman Empire was portrayed in the press as the \\"sick man of Europe.\\" This label reflected the widespread perception that the empire was on the verge of collapse due to its internal weaknesses, political instability, and inability to keep up with the modernizing European powers. The image of the Ottoman Empire as the \\"sick man of Europe\\" emerged in the 19th century, particularly as the empire struggled to maintain its territories and faced recurring financial crises. The European press often depicted the Ottoman Empire as a decaying entity, characterized by inefficiency, corruption, and the suppression of minority populations, such as Christians. This portrayal further fueled nationalist movements among the Balkan states, which were primarily Christian and sought independence from the predominantly Muslim Ottoman rule. These movements led to a series of conflicts and confrontations that became known as the \\"Eastern Question.\\" One significant event that exemplified the Ottoman Empire's internal strife and fueled its negative image in the press was the Hamidian Massacres, which occurred between 1894 and 1896. These massacres were carried out by the Ottoman authorities against the Armenian Christian population, leading to the death of tens of thousands of Armenians and generating international outrage. The European and American press covered these events extensively, highlighting the empire's oppressive actions against its non-Muslim citizens and further solidifying the \\"sick man of Europe\\" portrayal. Public figures in the West, such as Julia Ward Howe, author of the Battle Hymn of the Republic, also contributed to the criticism of the Ottoman Empire by speaking up against its actions and supporting organizations like the Red Cross that provided aid to the affected populations. Overall, the press portrayed the Ottoman Empire as the \\"sick man of Europe,\\" highlighting its political instability, internal strife, and oppressive nature, particularly towards non-Muslim minorities. This negative portrayal contributed to the growing concerns and debates surrounding the \\"Eastern Question,\\" which dealt with the disposition of the Ottoman lands and the treatment of minorities within the empire."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Preferred headlines are under fifteen words. Stacked denoising auto encoders (DAEs) are well known to learn useful deep representations, which can be used to improve supervised training by initializing a deep network. We investigate a training scheme of a deep DAE, where DAE layers are gradually added and keep adapting as additional layers are added. We show that in the regime of mid-sized datasets, this gradual training provides a small but consistent improvement over stacked training in both reconstruction quality and classification error over stacked training on MNIST and CIFAR datasets. 1 GRADUAL TRAINING OF DENOISING AUTOENCODERS We test here gradual training of deep denoising auto encoders, training the network layer-by-layer, but lower layers keep adapting throughout training. To allow lower layers to adapt continuously, noise is injected at the input level. This training procedure differs from stack-training of auto encoders (Vincent et al., 2010) More specifically, in gradual training, the first layer of the deep DAE is trained as in stacked training, producing a layer of weights w1. Then, when adding the second layer autoencoder, its weights w2 are tuned jointly with the already-trained weights w1. Given a training sample x, we generate a noisy version x̃, feed it to the 2-layered DAE, and compute the activation at the subsequent layers h1 = Sigmoid(w > 1 x), h2 = Sigmoid(w > 2 h1) and y = Sigmoid(w ′> 3 h2). Importantly, the loss function is computed over the input x, and is used to update all the weights including w1. Similarly, if a 3rd layer is trained, it involves tuning w1 and w2 in addition to w3 and w′ 4. 2 EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES We compare the performance of gradual and stacked training in two learning setups: an unsupervised denoising task, and a supervised classification task initialized using the weights learned in an unsupervised way. Evaluations were made on three benchmarks: MNIST, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR100, but only show here MNIST results due to space constraints. We used a test subset of 10,000 samples and several sizes of training-set all maintaining the uniform distribution over classes. Hyper parameters were selected using a second level of cross validation, including the learning rate, SGD batch size, momentum and weight decay. In the supervised experiments, training was ’early stopped’ after 35 epochs without improvement. The results reported below are averages over 3 train-validation splits. Since gradual training involves updating lower layers, every presentation of a sample involves more weight updates than in a single-layered DAE. To compare stacked and gradual training on a common ground, we limited gradual training to use the same budget of weight update steps as stacked training. For example, when training the second layer for n epochs in gradual training, we allocate 2n training epochs for stacked training (details in the full paper). 1 ar X iv :1 50 4. 02 90 2v 1 [ cs .L G ] 1 1 A pr 2 01 5 Accepted as a workshop contribution at ICLR 2015 a) Unsupervised Training b) Supervised training 0 0.25 0.5 10.4 10.5 10.6 10.7","completion":"Generate Headline for Article on Gradual Training of Denoising Autoencoders Task: Create a headline (title) for the provided article text about stacked denoising autoencoders and their gradual training.

More Marines deploy in south WASHINGTON -- The U.S. deployed a quick-reaction force in northern Afghanistan on Wednesday to quell any renewed Taliban resistance as more Marines poured into the southern part of the country, where the Taliban's supreme leader implored his troops to stand and fight. \\"Don't vacate any areas,\\" Mullah Mohammed Omar was quoted as saying in a radio message to his soldiers. \\"This is not a question of tribes. This is a question of Islam.\\" Though the 7-week-old conflict has wrested most of Afghanistan from Omar and relegated what remains of the Taliban to the southern stronghold of Kandahar, the leader told his troops he forbade surrender. Omar's statements came a day after an American B-1 bomber unleashed an attack on a Taliban leadership compound in Kandahar. U.S. officials said it was unclear whether Taliban or Al Qaeda leaders were killed. Red Cross workers Wednesday began tending to the grisly aftermath of a three-day uprising near Mazar-e Sharif, hauling away bodies of slain Taliban fighters, some of whose hands were bound with scarves. Although Red Cross workers suggested that the fighters had been executed, Northern Alliance leaders denied that and said all prisoners had been treated in a brotherly fashion. \\"We did not tie them. We brought them here to be safer,\\" said alliance Gen. Rashid Dostum, whose headquarters are in the Qalai Janghi fortress. \\"We behaved brotherly with them. We treated prisoners according to human rights.\\" Wary that the uprising illustrated the lack of stability plaguing northern Afghanistan, the U.S. sent a small infantry unit from the Army's 10th Mountain Division based in neighboring Uzbekistan to the area around Mazar-e Sharif. The unit, only about 24 soldiers, may become the vanguard of a larger deployment in the beleaguered nation's northern mountains and plains to secure locations like the Bagram airfield, a planned conduit for an expansion of humanitarian relief, U.S. officials said. Meanwhile, CIA officials confirmed Wednesday that Central Intelligence Agency operative Johnny Micheal \\"Mike\\" Spann, the first U.S. combat death in Afghanistan, was killed by rioting prisoners at the Qalai Janghi fortress near Mazar-e Sharif. The Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners were captured during fierce fighting in the northern city of Kunduz and taken to the mud-walled fortress used by the Northern Alliance as a makeshift prison. They staged the revolt after seizing a cache of guns, grenades and mortar shells and using weapons they smuggled past their captors into the fort. The uprising was all but quelled Tuesday after alliance troops reclaimed the fortress, with the help of U.S. commandos and American air strikes. One of those bombs went astray and wounded five U.S. soldiers Monday. They were evacuated to a U.S. military hospital in Germany, where one was in intensive care Wednesday and the other four were in good condition. Four other Americans, all military personnel, have been killed during the U.S. military campaign in Afghanistan. All died in accidents outside the country, two in a helicopter crash in Pakistan. Along with the Kandahar strike, U.S. warplanes this week bombed areas near Jalalabad where Al Qaeda's leader, Osama bin Laden, might be hiding amid the fortified caves and bunkers of the Tora Bora mountain encampment. U.S. military officials believe they have narrowed the location of bin Laden and top Taliban leaders to the Tora Bora region or a small area near Kandahar, just inside the Afghan-Pakistani border. The contingent of Marines at a base outside Kandahar grew to between 750 and 800, Pentagon spokeswoman Victoria Clarke said Wednesday. The commander of the U.S. war effort, Gen. Tommy Franks, has said up to 1,100 troops could be stationed at the base, located within striking distance of the Taliban's last stronghold, Kandahar. \\"The Marines have clearly strengthened their positions,\\" said Marine spokesman David Romley. \\"There were no engagements on our perimeters; however, we continue to flow in additional personnel, equipment and ordnance.\\" The Marine deployment will give the U.S. military campaign a forward operating base to support southern opposition forces as they attack Kandahar and interdict roads thought to be escape routes for fleeing Taliban and Al Qaeda troops and leaders. Omar is believed to be alive, but U.S. military officials insist his control over his troops is rapidly crumbling. The takeover of much of Afghanistan by opposition forces, coupled with air strikes aimed at Taliban leadership, has severely hampered the battered Afghan regime's lines of communication between senior Taliban leaders and their troops, Rear Adm. John Stufflebeem said. \\"Any time you can dismantle leadership or chain of command, you have troops uncontrolled and therefore less effective,\\" said Stufflebeem, deputy director of operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff. U.S. pilots are countering Omar's urgings with leaflets aimed at persuading Taliban troops to surrender. Stufflebeem said U.S. military leaders have seen evidence that the leaflet campaign is working. \\"In having interviews with those who are detained, there is information that is coming forward that they are having a positive effect,\\" he said. The U.S.-led campaign in Afghanistan was complicated this week by Russia's decision to send scores of troops to Kabul and the Bagram airfield. Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday said 12 Russian transport planes had arrived in Afghanistan, bringing staff and supplies, The Washington Post reported. Putin told his Cabinet the planes carried emergency ministry staff, construction crews, demining experts and diplomats to Kabul to establish a humanitarian center and reopen the heavily damaged embassy abandoned when Soviet forces withdrew from Afghanistan in 1989 after a 10-year occupation, the newspaper reported. State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said he believed the troops were dispatched for humanitarian reasons and not military operations. Still, Secretary of State Colin Powell called Russia's foreign minister and urged the Russian government to avoid military or diplomatic moves that could disturb the trust between Russia and the U.S. Talks aimed at ensuring that a stable government is in place once the conflict is over entered their second day near Bonn, as representatives for the Northern Alliance, which controls most of Afghanistan, rejected a United Nations proposal for an international security force in the war-torn country. Alliance officials say their troops are already providing adequate security in Afghanistan. \\"We don't feel a need for an outside force. There is security in place,\\" said Mohammad Yunis Qanooni, the alliance's interior minister. Northern Alliance leaders also said Wednesday that they plan to send forces south of Kabul to establish control of the Ghazni province, which likely would anger Pashtuns in the south and Pakistan, home to many Pashtuns and a key U.S. ally in Central Asia, senior commanders told The New York Times. In southern Afghanistan, anti-Taliban Pashtun leader Gul Agha Shirzai said talks over a peaceful Taliban surrender at Spin Boldak had failed and opposition forces would fight. Shirzai said he had 3,000 fighters ready. Tribal rivalries between Nurzais and Achekzais have complicated talks for the surrender of the Afghan border town in the past three days. The former mujahedeen commanders representing the two tribes have been vying for control of Spin Boldak, a center for smugglers and traders. Nurzai tribal leader Abdul Khaliq left the negotiations Wednesday, said his spokesman, Zulmai Afzali. \\"Neither side is prepared to give power to the other,\\" Afzali said. \\"The Taliban are still in control.\\" Write a one or two sentence summary.","completion":"The U.S. deployed a quick-reaction force in northern Afghanistan and more Marines into the southern part of the country to quell any renewed Taliban resistance, as Mullah Mohammed Omar urged his troops to stand and fight.

The impact weighting of the Research Excellence Framework has been increased for 2021, and more recently the UK Government announced a new funding stream for knowledge exchange. But achieving impact isn’t easy, especially for researchers early in their careers. If you ever have a spare week, or ten, it’s worth reading through some of the 6,637 REF impact case studies on the HEFCE website. There are some brilliant and fascinating examples of how researchers have achieved impact, but what strikes me most is how different impact looks across different subjects. At the risk of being flippant, among many of the medical or technological examples there is a familiar pattern and a clear route to impact: make breakthrough; license drug/technology; save lives/£millions. For social and political science (not to mention economics, languages, education, philosophy, etc.) the route to impact is much more fragmented. Among the 97 sociology case studies, for example, impact comes from numerous briefings of government officials and parliamentarians, before the academics join “networks” and “committees” discussing their research and wider issues. Their research is covered by national media, they meet even more people – practitioners or third sector campaigning organisations to pass on their knowledge. And, after all that, and often a good deal more, sometimes there is a policy or practice change that can be pointed to as a direct impact, sometimes not. Central to much of the impact is “access”. Prominent and experienced academics are more likely to get on the committees, know the right journalists and government officials, and have links into third sector organisations, etc. I worked with Professor Sir John Curtice, of election night fame, for a number of years.

Help as much as you can. I have another guest post for you today. This one comes from Selina from Beautystorm. Beautystorm are proudly the cheapest stockists of Dermalogica products in Australia and provide online skin consultations with their in house Skincare Therapists. Selina will be giving us advice on how to repair sun damaged skin. Whilst we are blessed to be living in such a sun drenched country, here in Australia, as a consequence the majority of us will have sun damaged skin. Here are Selina's tips to repair some of the damage: The severe, Australian suncauses a multitude of cases of serious skin damage every year. However, there are ways, to repair rough, dry, wrinkled skin that may also suffer from redness and brown spots. The very first step to reverse some of that skin damage is some gentle cleansing. Never wash the face with an ordinary bar of soap. This will make the situation worse and cause severe dry skin. In order to wash the sun-damaged skin effectively without causing further injury, use a gentle exfoliating facial cleanser. This will remove, not only dirt and oil, but also the top layer of dead skin cells, providing a nice glow. This will reveal fresh skin cells ready for treatment. After cleansing the skin, follow with a mud mask or a facial mask made specifically for skin that’s been damaged by the sun. The purpose of a mask is to draw out impurities in the skin while adding key ingredients like moisturisers and minerals back into the skin. After gently rinsing the purifying mask, a lotion, cream or serum containing key ingredients should be applied to the skin. The difference between the three is that a lotion is best for daytime use, worn under makeup or for those prone to breakouts. Creams are considered heavier and best used at night or for those with dry skin. Serums are usually highly concentrated formulas that can be used day or night, but a little goes a long way. Those with the most severe sun damaged skin should use them. According to the above context, answer the following question. When will fresh skin cells ready for treatment occur when cleansing skin? Choose from: [A]. not enough information [B]. after using water [C]. after using a gentle exfoliating facial cleanser [D]. after using soap Answer:","completion":"C. after using a gentle exfoliating facial cleanser"},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What is the full name of the person who is killed in an apparent robbery in Brussels? from the following article ? Former Marine and Defense Intelligence Agency spy Robert McCall now lives in a diverse apartment complex in urban Massachusetts. He is working as a Lyft driver and assists the less fortunate with the help of his close friend and former CIA colleague, Susan Plummer. McCall travels to Istanbul by train to retrieve a local bookstore owner's daughter who was kidnapped by her father. He also helps Sam Rubinstein, an elderly Holocaust survivor who is looking for a painting of his sister; the two siblings were separated when they were transported to different camps by the Nazis, but the painting has been auctioned off and Sam cannot prove that he owns it. After discovering that the apartment courtyard has been vandalised, McCall accepts an offer from Miles Whittaker, a young resident with an artistic but troubled background, to repaint the walls. At some point, McCall rescues Miles, who had been lured away by a gang to commit crimes for them. One day, Susan and DIA operative Dave York, McCall's former teammate, are called to investigate the apparent murder-suicide of an agency affiliate and his wife in Brussels. When the two separate after reaching their hotel, Susan is accosted and killed in an apparent robbery by two men who got off the elevator on her floor. When he receives the news, McCall begins to investigate both her death and the case she was working on. After reviewing CCTV footage, McCall determines that the suspects' foreknowledge of her floor and the expertly-delivered fatal stab suggest that she was targeted. He also confirms that the incident Susan was looking into was staged to look like a murder-suicide, and that Susan's death is probably connected to it.

Write highlights for this article: BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- The notorious Iraq prison once called Abu Ghraib has reopened under Iraqi government control. And the Ministry of Justice has launched a public-relations campaign to show it has changed since the days when prisoners were tortured there -- first under Saddam Hussein, and later by American troops. The Iraqi Ministry of Justice gave journalists an inside look at the prison formerly known as Abu Ghraib. It is now called Baghdad Central Prison, and has water fountains, a freshly planted garden and a gym -- complete with weights and sports teams' jerseys on the walls. Under Saddam Hussein, tens of thousands of Iraqis were thrown behind bars here. There were horrific stories of torture, abuse, execution without trial. In 2004, the prison was once again thrown into the international spotlight, this time because of abuse by U.S. troops. Watch how the prison has been revamped ». Detainees were photographed in degrading positions, as Americans posed next to them smiling. The images -- naked prisoners stacked on top of each other, or being threatened by dogs, or hooded and wired up as if for electrocution -- caused outrage around the world when they were leaked to the news media in May 2004. Brig. Gen. Janis Karpinski, commander of the Abu Ghraib prison at the time, was demoted in rank to colonel because of the scandal. Seven low-ranking guards and two military intelligence soldiers -- described by then-U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld as \\"bad apples\\" -- were disciplined after the scandal surfaced. Rumsfeld later said the day the scandal broke was the worst in his tenure as defense secretary. \\"Clearly the worst day was Abu Ghraib, and seeing what went on there and feeling so deeply sorry that that happened,\\" Rumsfeld said shortly before leaving office at the end of 2006. \\"I remember being stunned by the news of the abuse.\\" The United States always denied it was a matter of policy to torture detainees. But it shut down Abu Ghraib in September 2006 and turned the facility over to the Iraqis. They have revamped and reopened it. Rooms have been transformed and renovated. CNN was told, but not shown, that a few hundred prisoners are here already, in a revamped part of the facility that can hold up to 3,000 prisoners. The capacity is critical to help deal with overcrowding at Iraq's other facilities and the potential security threat. The Iraqi government is going to great lengths to try to change the image this facility has. It organized a tour for journalists, very carefully orchestrated by the Ministry of Justice. Murtada Sharif, the only Ministry of Justice official to speak to CNN on camera about the prison, admitted Abu Ghraib is synonymous in people's minds with the inhumane acts that took place there both before and after the fall of Saddam in 2003. \\"We want to change its image, to make it a place of justice,\\" he said. A wing that used to hold a thousand prisoners In Saddam Hussein's time now is ready for 160. Cells that used to hold between 30 and 50 people now have a capacity of eight. Prisoners and their families actually get to see each other -- the prisoners behind a cage-like structure, the families on the other side of the fence, in a courtyard with a playground for the children. Again, it is part of the whole effort to create a different atmosphere. But human rights organizations in Iraq say abuse and torture remain routine in Iraq's detention facilities. Changing Abu Ghraib's infamous reputation may take more than fresh paint and fake flowers. Highlights:","completion":"1.

Sentence 2: The country's geography is starkly different throughout. Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","completion":"Step 1: Understand both sentences. Sentence 1 suggests that the country has a vast and diverse range of geographical features. Sentence 2 states that the geography of the country is noticeably different in various parts. Step 2: Determine the connection between the sentences. Both sentences are describing the variability of the country's geography. Step 3: Determine if Sentence 2 is entailed by Sentence 1. To determine if Sentence 2 is entailed by Sentence 1, we must examine if Sentence 2 would necessarily be true if Sentence 1 is true. Step 4: Analyze the entailment. Since Sentence 1 describes the country as a \\"veritable compendium of geography,\\" it implies that the country's geography includes a wide variety of features. This would mean that there are differences in the geography throughout the country. Sentence 2, stating that the country's geography is \\"starkly different throughout,\\" also points to the differences in the geography across various parts of the country. In conclusion, Sentence 2 is indeed entailed by Sentence 1. The first sentence implies the existence of diverse geographical features throughout the country, which in turn leads to the second sentence's assertion that the geography is noticeably different in various parts."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Second question: Is there hope in my ex wanting to get back with me? Are these two questions asking the same thing? Choices: a). no; b). yes;","completion":"b). yes; These two questions are indeed asking the same thing, as both questions seek to explore the possibility of an ex-partner wanting to rekindle a romantic relationship. While they are phrased differently, the core concern expressed in both questions is the same. To address the matter, it is essential to consider various aspects of the situation, and not just the way your ex talks to you. The fact that your ex still talks to you the same way as before might signal that they still feel comfortable communicating with you. However, this could also mean that they are attempting to maintain a healthy friendship or just remaining cordial despite the breakup. Whether or not there is hope of getting back together requires analyzing more variables. Some factors you may want to consider include: 1. Mutual feelings: Do both you and your ex still have feelings for each other? Sometimes, after a breakup, feelings can linger, but it is essential to assess whether this will lead to a healthy, loving relationship when you get back together. 2. Understanding the reasons for the breakup: Reflecting on the causes of the breakup can illuminate whether the same issues might resurface if you were to get back together. If the problems seem resolvable or are now in the past, the chances of having a successful, renewed relationship might be higher. 3. Communication: Open and honest communication is key in determining whether your ex has any interest in rekindling the relationship. Discussing the matter with your ex will be more reliable than making assumptions based on how they talk to you. 4. Assessing personal growth: Have you or your ex grown, changed, or evolved since the breakup? Personal growth can ignite new hope in a relationship, especially if the growth has led to tangible self-improvement and lessons learned from past mistakes or shortcomings. 5. Timing and external factors: Sometimes, external factors unrelated to the relationship can influence whether getting back together is feasible, such as long-distance, work, or other life circumstances. In conclusion, while the way your ex talks to you might provide some indication of their feelings towards you, it is not enough to discern whether they genuinely want to get back together. Taking into account the aspects listed above, as well as engaging in open communication, can help determine the possibility of rekindling your relationship."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Bio: charles timothy slack -lrb- april 11 , 1913 -- june 1976 -rrb- is a former republican member of the pennsylvania house of representatives . A:","completion":"Charles Timothy Slack's biography provides various pieces of information about his personal and professional life. 1. Full Name: His full name is Charles Timothy Slack. The use of his middle name suggests that he might be generally referred to as \\"Timothy\\" or \\"Tim\\". 2. Date of Birth and Death: Timothy Slack was born on April 11, 1913, and he died in June 1976. This means that at the time of his death, he was 63 years old. Thus, we can gather that he lived through significant periods of American and global history, including both World Wars, the Great Depression, and the initial stages of the Cold War. 3. Political Affiliation: Slack was a member of the Republican Party. This provides information about his ideological perspective and general stance on economic and social issues, assuming his views aligned with typical Republican viewpoints during his lifetime. 4. Professional Life: He served in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, marking him as a significant political figure within the state. However, the biography doesn't specify the precise years of his tenure, the specific district he represented, or the issues he championed while in office. 5. Residence: Given his political role, it can be inferred that Timothy Slack resided in Pennsylvania for at least a portion of his life, although the biography doesn't provide further details about his life outside of his political career. 6. Nationality: As he was a member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, it can be deduced that he was an American citizen.

Paragraph: Have you are burned something on the stove or in the oven? Do you know why things burn? It all has to do with temperature. Changes in matter are affected by temperature. For example, what if you place a cake in the oven and you leave it in too long? What do you think will happen? Thats right, it will probably burn. The same thing will happen if the oven setting is too high and you apply too much heat. In either case, heat has affected the rate of change in matter. Its probably obvious that when the temperature is increased a chemical change, like cooking, will occur faster. What about a physical change? Are physical changes affected by temperature? Most of us have seen steam rising off a wet road after a summer rainstorm. This happens because the road surface is very warm. The warm road and warm air temperature causes the water to evaporate quickly. The liquid water is turning into water vapor, but it is still water. The evaporation of water is a physical change.

PUBLISHED:. 07:40 EST, 12 July 2013. |. UPDATED:. 12:11 EST, 12 July 2013. Darren Feldman was given £20,000 compensation after a tribunal agreed his position at HCA International had become intolerable. A Jewish surveyor received £20,000 in compensation today after a tribunal found that his bullying boss repeatedly taunted him and said he wanted to lock up and gas 'Yids' like Apprentice star Lord Sugar’s son. Darren Feldman’s manager Chris Oates also repeatedly invited him to JuJu, an exclusive champagne bar on London’s King’s Road and mocked Jewish Tottenham football fans. Mr Oates also said he wanted to run past the club’s White Hart Lane stadium wearing an Arsenal top with ‘IVOR 4 SKIN’ printed on the back. Referring to Lord Sugar’s son Daniel, with whom he was negotiating a deal, Mr Oates said: 'Quite frankly they’re all a bunch of Yids. I’d like to lock them in the building and gas them all.' A panel at Central London employment tribunal ruled that Mr Feldman, 33, was hounded out of his £47,500-a-year job with private hospital group HCA International. It found the firm and Mr Oates guilty of race and religious discrimination and harassment, ruling that Mr Feldman was constructively dismissed. Mr Feldman, of Teddington, south-west London, was awarded £15,000 for injury to feelings and £5,000 for lost earnings. Speaking after the tribunal, Mr Feldman said: 'I am very relieved by this outcome. I was so disturbed by my treatment at HCA and it is a shame the company fought this to the end. 'I hope HCA takes action to make sure this never happens again.' HCA’s London hospitals also include. the Portland, Princess Grace, Wellington, Lister, London Bridge, Harley Street Clinic, and Harley Street at University College Hospital. Mr. Feldman’s solicitor Shilpen Savani of law firm DWFM Beckman, said:. 'This is an extreme instance of an employer failing to safeguard an. employee. 'Mr Feldman should never have been subjected to such abuse.' Giving evidence, qualified surveyor Mr Feldman told how he joined HCA as a construction project manager in April last year. Colleagues soon learned that he was Jewish when he showed them a tattoo in Hebrew on his ankle. He told how director of estates and projects Mr Oates, who is in his 40s and not Jewish, called him into his office. Mr Feldman (pictured above) alleged that on his boss's birthday,. the pair discussed doing a potential business deal with Daniel Sugar,. son of Apprentice star Lord Sugar, when Mr Oates made the remarks. Mr. Feldman said: 'Chris asked me what I thought of the idea of his to run. down White Hart Lane wearing an Arsenal football top with the writing. ‘IVOR 4 SKIN’ on the back. He wrote it out on a piece of scrap paper. 'This was a derogatory and offensive. reference to the fact that Tottenham Hotspur Football Club is known to. have a large contingent of Jewish supporters. 'I did not know how to answer that question as I was shocked and offended.' Mr Feldman said that his tormentor then looked up bar JuJu on an iPad and showed him the search results. 'Chris. then asked if I wanted to go to a club after work which is located. along King's Road called JuJu. He pointed his finger at me saying \\"want. to go to JuJu, Juju?\\" repeating it several times in an intimidating. manner.' 'Chris was not only a bully in the way that he treated me but he was also seriously abusive towards me because I was Jewish.' In. his evidence, Mr Feldman said that on his boss's birthday the pair. discussed doing a potential business deal with Daniel Sugar, son of. Apprentice star and former Tottenham chairman Lord Sugar.

Mr. Oates is alleged to have said: 'I'm just messing them around. Quite. frankly they're all a bunch of Yids. I'd like to lock them in the. building and gas them all'. It. will be the second payout by American firm HCA, the world’s largest. private hospital group, in recent years after a race discrimination. claim. HCA and Mr Oates strenuously denied Mr Feldman's allegations. A. string of HCA witnesses including Mr Oates, who remains at the firm,. had also denied Mr Feldman’s allegations of racism but the tribunal. rejected their evidence. HCA said that it is 'deeply disappointed' by the judgment and considering an appeal. A. spokesperson said: 'HCA has a clear code of conduct around acceptable,. professional and ethical behaviour and offers an inclusive, open and. supportive working environment for all our staff.' In 2009, Spanish. electrician Juan Ignacio alleged that he was nicknamed ‘Manuel’ after. the Fawlty Towers waiter by workmates at HCA’s London Bridge Hospital. He. complained he was taunted with the famous ‘I know nothing’ and ‘Que?’ catchphrases used by Andrew Sachs’s iconic sitcom character. He. claimed that bullying bosses mocked his accent and jibed ‘He’s from. Barcelona’ in front of others - the standard excuse made for Manuel by. John Cleese’s Basil.

Answer the following question: Question: What is Mill's position at the studio? If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: The Player Context: Griffin Mill (Tim Robbins) is a Hollywood studio executive dating story editor Bonnie Sherow (Cynthia Stevenson). He hears story pitches from screenwriters and decides which have the potential to be made into films, green-lighting only 12 out of 50,000 submissions every year. His job is threatened when up-and-coming story executive Larry Levy (Peter Gallagher) begins working at the studio. Mill has also been receiving death threat postcards, assumed to be from a screenwriter whose pitch he rejected. Mill surmises that the disgruntled writer is David Kahane (Vincent D'Onofrio). Mill is told by Kahane's girlfriend, June Gudmundsdottir (Greta Scacchi) that Kahane is at a theater in Pasadena. Mill pretends to recognize Kahane in the lobby, and offers him a scriptwriting deal, hoping this will stop the threats. The two go to a nearby bar where Kahane gets intoxicated and rebuffs Mill's offer; he calls Mill a liar and continues goading him about his job security at the studio. In the bar's parking lot, the two men fight. Mill goes too far and accidentally drowns Kahane in a shallow pool of water, then stages the crime to make it look like a botched robbery. The next day, after Mill is late for and distracted at a meeting, Studio chief of security Walter Stuckel (Fred Ward) confronts Mill about the murder and says that the police know Mill was the last one to see Kahane alive. At the end of their conversation Mill receives a fax from his stalker. Thus, Mill has killed the wrong man, and the stalker apparently knows this. Mill attends Kahane's funeral and gets into conversation with June. Detectives Avery (Whoopi Goldberg) and DeLongpre (Lyle Lovett) suspect Mill is guilty of murder. Mill receives a postcard from the writer suggesting they meet at a hotel bar. While Mill is waiting, he is cornered by two screenwriters, Tom Oakley (Richard E.

Question: The answer to the question: What is the name of the person that composed the four-act \\"drame lyricque\\", Le timbre d'argent? is inside the article: For a French composer of the 19th century, opera was seen as the most important type of music. Saint-Saëns's younger contemporary and rival, Massenet, was beginning to gain a reputation as an operatic composer, but Saint-Saëns, with only the short and unsuccessful La princesse jaune staged, had made no mark in that sphere. In February 1877, he finally had a full-length opera staged. His four-act \\"drame lyricque\\", Le timbre d'argent (\\"The Silver Bell\\"), to Jules Barbier's and Michel Carré's libretto, reminiscent of the Faust legend, had been in rehearsal in 1870, but the outbreak of war halted the production. The work was eventually presented by the Théâtre Lyrique company of Paris; it ran for eighteen performances.The dedicatee of the opera, Albert Libon, died three months after the premiere, leaving Saint-Saëns a large legacy \\"To free him from the slavery of the organ of the Madeleine and to enable him to devote himself entirely to composition\\". Saint-Saëns, unaware of the imminent bequest, had resigned his position shortly before his friend died. He was not a conventional Christian, and found religious dogma increasingly irksome; he had become tired of the clerical authorities' interference and musical insensitivity; and he wanted to be free to accept more engagements as a piano soloist in other cities. After this he never played the organ professionally in a church service, and rarely played the instrument at all. He composed a Messe de Requiem in memory of his friend, which was performed at Saint-Sulpice to mark the first anniversary of Libon's death; Charles-Marie Widor played the organ and Saint-Saëns conducted. In December 1877, Saint-Saëns had a more solid operatic success, with Samson et Dalila, his one opera to gain and keep a place in the international repertoire. Because of its biblical subject, the composer had met many obstacles to its presentation in France, and through Liszt's influence the premiere was given at Weimar in a German translation.

California's Proposition 64, which is leading in the polls, could create a multibillion-dollar marijuana industry by legalizing the recreational use the drug for adults in the state. Similar measures are on the ballot in Arizona, Nevada, Maine and Massachusetts. Marijuana could be legalized for medical use in Florida and three other states. Medical marijuana is already permitted in half the 50 U.S. states, and recreational use is allowed in Alaska, Colorado, Washington state, Oregon and the District of Columbia. Marijuana is banned under federal law, but U.S. officials have taken a hands-off approach on the issue. Voters in Maine and Nevada are considering measures that would expand background checks for gun purchases, which is already required for buying guns from dealers, by extending the provision to private sales. Californians will consider measures requiring background checks for buyers of ammunition and banning high-capacity ammunition magazines. Washington state has a measure that would allow the courts to bar the sale of guns to individuals deemed an extreme risk to themselves or others. Californians are considering whether to eliminate the death penalty with Proposition 62, or to maintain capital punishment and make the process more efficient with Proposition 66, which supporters say makes it more fair to victims of violent crimes. Twenty states and the District of Columbia have abolished or overturned capital punishment on the grounds that it is unequally applied to minority populations and that innocent people are sometimes convicted. South Dakotans will decide whether to make statewide offices nonpartisan and create a citizens commission to redraw voting districts after each 10-year national census, removing...

It is hoped that the move, which will be tested in the coming months, might lessen traffic in inner cities and reduce CO2emissions . This should help DHL, a division of the German postal service, reach its target of improving the company's carbon efficiency by 30 percent before 2020. \\"As the world's biggest logistics provider, we recognize a special responsibility to reduce the impact on the environment as much as possible,\\" said Frank Appel, Chief Executive Officer of Deutsche Post DHL, in a statement referring to a variety of measures being considered. The \\"fetch friends\\" find out online about parcels that need delivering to people who live or work along the way that they are planning to travel through the city. They then select the ones that they want to take. Codes sent to their mobile phones tell the volunteers where to pick the packages up. Parcels can be taken part of the way or passed on to another volunteer but all volunteers need to have the right code on their mobile phone so the track and trace system can be updated. Logistics companies will be responsible for looking after the operation to make sure that the privacy of post is respected.

Mitch remembers the wish they made the night before and they drive back to the park, planning to urinate again in the fountain and wish for their original lives back, but find the fountain has been removed for restorations.

Frank Answer:","completion":"Title: \\"The Tides of Justice\\" Genre: Legal Drama, Thriller Plot: Frank Thompson, a seasoned and much-beloved public defender, has spent his entire career fighting for the underdogs in his community. While his success rate in the courtroom is admirable, it's not without its consequences. Frank has faced backlash from numerous powerful and influential figures in the legal system, many of whom want nothing more than to see him lose in a highly-publicized case. Meanwhile, Kelly Matthews, a young and ambitious prosecutor, is handpicked by District Attorney Arnold Becker to ensure Frank's next high-profile case ends in defeat. The case involves the mysterious death of a local councilman who was found dead on a park bench with no apparent evidence pointing to any suspects. When evidence begins to surface indicating that the late councilman's involvement in illegal activities may be the motive behind his murder, Frank steps up to defend the young man accused of the crime – Nick Collins. Nick, a small-time homeless guy, had been seen arguing with the councilman on numerous instances, but despite his disadvantaged situation, he is well-liked by the community and seems to have a philanthropic spirit at his core. Kelly, eager to make a name for herself in the legal world, believes she has gathered enough evidence to convict Nick of the murder and is prepared to win at any cost. The trial begins with a battle of wits as Kelly and Frank face off in a series of intense and emotional arguments as they try to sway the jury to their respective sides. Each day becomes more dramatic than the last as new evidence and shocking revelations come to light, and it soon becomes apparent that there may be more to this case than meets the eye. As public interest about the trial grows, the stakes are raised even higher for both Frank and Kelly. Despite their differing opinions, the two lawyers begin to develop a mutual respect for each other's abilities and tenacity. However, their newfound connection is soon put to the test on the climactic day of the trial. In a surprising twist, Frank finds evidence exonerating Nick, implicating the late councilman's shady business partners in the murder instead. As the truth unfolds, Kelly starts to question her own integrity and motivations for winning the case. Who gives the closing argument? Frank, against all odds and much to the dismay of the District Attorney, delivers a passionate and stirring closing argument, describing the importance of justice for all, regardless of their social standing or past mistakes. He also highlights the danger of prosecuting and convicting innocent people just to maintain a perfect track record in the courtroom. His eloquent and heartfelt words strike a chord with the jury, who return a verdict of not guilty for Nick. As Kelly acknowledges her defeat, she realizes the importance of seeking genuine justice rather than personal gain within the legal system. In the end, \\"The Tides of Justice\\" is a gripping legal drama that will keep you on the edge of your seat until the very end. With its captivating performances, fascinating twists, and powerful message about the importance of finding the truth and maintaining one's integrity, it's a film that will leave a lasting impact on audiences everywhere."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Entailment occurs when the truth of one sentence guarantees the truth of another sentence.

To summarize, the second sentence is not entailed by the first sentence as the presence of SCUBA divers and mermaids are not explicitly mentioned or guaranteed in the first sentence.

The Russian language is an East Slavic language, primarily spoken by the people of Russia and some neighboring countries. It is the most widely spoken of the Slavic languages, with over 258 million speakers globally, and it is an official language of Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan. Russian uses the Cyrillic alphabet, which was derived from the Greek alphabet and some additional local symbols, eventually evolving into its modern form by the early 18th century. Russian grammar is characterized by a complex system of noun cases, which show the relationship between the noun and other elements in a sentence, such as adjectives, verbs, and prepositions. There are six main cases in Russian: nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, instrumental, and prepositional. The language also features extensive use of prefixes and suffixes to create new words or alter the meaning of existing words. Verb conjugations in Russian depend on both tense and the subject's gender, with distinct forms for present, past, and future tenses. In addition to its grammar, Russian is known for its rich literary heritage, with famous authors like Alexander Pushkin, Fyodor Dostoevsky, Leo Tolstoy, Anton Chekhov, and many others who made significant contributions to world literature.

Article: February 7, 2018 is a day that will live forever in the hearts of celebrity news connoisseurs, for that was the day that Quincy Jones gave an interview to Vulture in which he claimed, among other things, that: A) Ringo Starr can’t drum for shit; B) The Chicago mob killed John F. Kennedy; and C) Richard Pryor and Marlon Brando made sweet, druggy love to each other back in the ‘70s. It was a great moment in internet culture, bringing together people of all walks of life to gossip about affairs that happened 40 years ago—which are the best kinds of affairs to gossip about, because everyone involved has already moved on (or is no longer with us, in the case of Brando and Pryor). Now, though, Jones has apologized for the “silly things” he said in his interviews with Vulture and GQ, saying that his six daughters had sat him down and basically told him he was too old and too distinguished of a public figure to be running his mouth like that. “Even at 85, it’s apparent that ‘word vomit’ and bad-mouthing is inexcusable,” he says, referring to all the shit he talked not only about The Beatles, but U2 (who he says used to be a good band) and Michael Jackson (who he called “Machiavellian”) as well. Jones doesn’t go so far as to walk back anything he said in those interviews, mind you, just says that he should have known better than to put all that on the record. As far as Brando and Pryor go, soon after the Vulture interview was published, Pryor’s widow Jennifer Lee Pryor told TMZ that hell yeah, they hooked up, and that Pryor would have found the whole thing hilarious. Pryor’s daughter Rain and Brando’s son Miko then came forward to dispute Jennifer Lee Pryor’s claim, a family disagreement that may have helped prompt Jones’ apology. [via Vulture] ||||| The 84-year-old record producer says he had a long talk with his daughters about what he said, and he is sorry. Quincy Jones on Thursday morning issued an apology for remarks he made in bombshell interviews with Vulture and GQ in late January. In his apology, the music legend said his daughters took him aside and talked to him about the effects of the comments. The 84-year-old record producer said he stopped drinking a few years back and his memory of past events is not as sharp as it should be, which is one of the side effects, so his stories do not paint the whole picture. \\"I am sorry to anyone whom my words offended, and I am especially sorry to my friends who are still here with me and those who aren't,\\" Jones said in the statement. One of the biggest tales Jones shared in one interview was that the late Richard Pryor allegedly had a sexual relationship with the late Marlon Brando. Pryor's ex-wife said it was true, but Brando's son denied the claim. Jones was also pretty hard on The Beatles in one interview, calling them \\"no-playing motherfuckers.\\" \\"Paul was the worst bass player I ever heard. And Ringo? Don't even talk about it,\\" he said. \\"I remember once we were in the studio with George Martin, and Ringo had taken three hours for a four-bar thing he was trying to fix on a song. He couldn't get it.\\" In the lengthy apology, Jones made it clear he already reached out to \\"many\\" of his friends who were mentioned in the interviews so he could tell them sorry, personally. \\"These friends are like blood family to me,\\" he said in the Thursday statement. ||||| Tweet with a location You can add location information to your Tweets, such as your city or precise location, from the web and via third-party applications.

Among these were criticisms of Ringo Starr's drumming abilities, allegations that the Chicago mob killed John F. Kennedy, and that Richard Pryor and Marlon Brando engaged in a sexual relationship back in the '70s. The interview quickly became a major talking point in celebrity news and internet culture. However, Jones later apologized for his comments, stating that his six daughters had confronted him about his remarks. He admitted that, even at 85, he should not have engaged in bad-mouthing or \\"word vomit,\\" acknowledging that his behavior was inexcusable. While Jones did not wholly retract any of his statements, he recognized that he should have known better than to put such claims on record. Following the Vulture interview, Richard Pryor's widow, Jennifer Lee Pryor, confirmed the alleged relationship between Pryor and Brando to TMZ, stating that Pryor would have found the whole situation amusing. However, Pryor's daughter, Rain, and Brando's son, Miko, subsequently came forward to dispute Jennifer Lee Pryor's account, contributing to Jones's decision to issue an apology. In his apology, Jones mentioned that he had stopped drinking a few years prior, resulting in a less sharp memory of past events, and that his stories may not have painted the whole picture.

Is The Gram stain, developed in 1884 by Hans Christian Gram, characterises bacteria based on the structural characteristics of their cell walls. a good answer to this question?","completion":"Step 1: Understand the given information and question The given information is about the Gram stain, developed in 1884 by Hans Christian Gram, and its ability to characterize bacteria based on structural characteristics of their cell walls. The question is asking if The Gram stain would show better test results on Nocardia bacteria. Step 2: Assess the information about the Gram stain The Gram stain is a widely used method in microbiology for differentiating bacterial species into two groups (Gram-positive and Gram-negative) based on the characteristics of their cell walls. While the Gram stain is useful for classification, it may not always provide specific information on the optimal stain for a particular bacterium. Step 3: Research Nocardia bacteria characteristics Nocardia is a genus of bacteria that are Gram-positive, aerobic, and filamentous. They are part of the Actinomycetales order, and some species are known to cause human diseases such as nocardiosis. Step 4: Determine if the Gram stain is suitable for Nocardia bacteria Since Nocardia bacteria have a Gram-positive cell wall structure, the Gram stain would generally be effective in distinguishing them from Gram-negative bacteria. However, the question asks which stain shows better test results on Nocardia bacteria, which implies a comparison to other staining methods. Step 5: Assess other staining methods for Nocardia bacteria One specific staining method for Nocardia is the modified Kinyoun acid-fast stain, which allows for better visualization and identification of these filamentous bacteria. Step 6: Provide the answer The Gram stain can provide some information on Nocardia bacteria, as they are Gram-positive. However, the modified Kinyoun acid-fast stain might show better test results specifically for Nocardia bacteria, as it is designed to visualize and identify filamentous bacteria like Nocardia more effectively. In conclusion, while the Gram stain can help differentiate Nocardia bacteria based on their cell wall structure, the modified Kinyoun acid-fast stain may provide better test results specifically for this genus."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Information: - The Dust Brothers are Los Angeles, California-based, producers, E.Z. Mike (Michael Simpson) and King Gizmo (John King), famous for their sample-based music in the 1980s and 1990s, and specifically for their work on the albums \\"Paul's Boutique\\" by the Beastie Boys, \\"Odelay\\" by Beck, the soundtrack to the film \\"Fight Club\\" and \\"MMMBop\\" by Hanson. - DGC Records (an acronym for David Geffen Company) is an American record label that currently operates as a division of Interscope-Geffen-A&M, which is owned by Vivendi S.A.. - \`\` Debra '' is a song by Beck . He had originally attempted to record \`\` Debra '' with the Dust Brothers for Odelay , but he thought that it was too tongue - in - cheek . It was debuted main - stream in 1996 , and , as Beck noted , \`\` it became the centerpiece of the whole set .

The song maintains a cult following . The song was covered by German industrial artist Kompressor . Kompressor 's version is called \`\` Kompressor Want To Get With You . '' - \\"MMMBop\\" is a song written and performed by the American pop rock band Hanson from their 1997 album \\"Middle of Nowhere\\". The song was nominated for two Grammys at the 40th Annual Grammy Awards in February 1998, and is the band's most successful single to date. \\"MMMBop\\" was phenomenally successful, especially for a debut single, reaching number one in 27 countries including the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, Australia and Mexico. In the United Kingdom, the song sold 710,000 copies and stayed at number one for 3 weeks. - Beck Hansen (born Bek David Campbell; July 8, 1970), known mononymously as Beck, is an American singer, songwriter, rapper, record producer and multi-instrumentalist. He is mostly known for his musical composition, as well as a palette of sonic genres. - Midnite Vultures is the fourth official studio album and seventh overall by American alternative rock artist Beck, released in November 1999 by DGC Records. While similar to most of Beck's previous albums in its exploration of widely varying musical styles, \\"Midnite Vultures\\" didn't achieve the same blockbuster success as his breakthrough, \\"Odelay\\", though it was still critically and commercially well received. - Music is an art form and cultural activity whose medium is sound and silence, which exist in time. The common elements of music are pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the \\"color\\" of a musical sound). Different styles or types of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs without instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and instruments. The word derives from Greek (\\"mousike\\"; \\"art of the Muses\\"). In its most general form, the activities describing music as an art form include the production of works of music (songs, tunes, symphonies, and so on), the criticism of music, the study of the history of music, and the aesthetic examination of music. Ancient Greek and Indian philosophers defined music as tones ordered horizontally as melodies and vertically as harmonies. Common sayings such as \\"the harmony of the spheres\\" and \\"it is music to my ears\\" point to the notion that music is often ordered and pleasant to listen to. However, 20th-century composer John Cage thought that any sound can be music, saying, for example, \\"There is no noise, only sound.\\" - A soundtrack, also written sound track, can be recorded music accompanying and synchronized to the images of a motion picture, book, television program or video game; a commercially released soundtrack album of music as featured in the soundtrack of a film or TV show; or the physical area of a film that contains the synchronized recorded sound. - Paul's Boutique is the second studio album by the American hip hop group Beastie Boys, released on July 25, 1989, on Capitol Records. Featuring production by the Dust Brothers, the album was recorded in Matt Dike's apartment and the Record Plant in Los Angeles from 1988 to 1989, and mixed at the Record Plant. Subsequent remixes were done at the Manhattan-based Record Plant Studios. The album is noted for being almost completely composed of samples, excluding the group's vocal output. - Albums of recorded music were developed in the early 20th century, first as books of individual 78rpm records, then from 1948 as vinyl LP records played at rpm. Vinyl LPs are still issued, though in the 21st century album sales have mostly focused on compact disc (CD) and MP3 formats. The audio cassette was a format used from the late 1970s through to the 1990s alongside vinyl. - The Beastie Boys were an American hip hop group from New York City, formed in 1980. For the majority of their career, the group consisted of Michael \\"Mike D\\" Diamond (vocals, drums), Adam \\"MCA\\" Yauch (vocals, bass) and Adam \\"Ad-Rock\\" Horovitz (vocals, guitar). - Odelay is the second official studio album and fifth overall by American alternative rock artist Beck, originally released on June 18, 1996, by DGC Records. - Alternative rock (also called alternative music, alt-rock or simply alternative) is a genre of rock music that emerged from the independent music underground of the 1980s and became widely popular in the 1990s and 2000s. In this instance, the word \\"alternative\\" refers to the genre's distinction from mainstream rock music. The term's original meaning was broader, referring to a generation of musicians unified by their collective debt to either the musical style or simply the independent, D.I.Y. ethos of punk rock, which in the late 1970s laid the groundwork for alternative music. At times, \\"alternative\\" has been used as a catch-all description for music from underground rock artists that receives mainstream recognition, or for any music, whether rock or not, that is seen to be descended from punk rock (including some examples of punk itself, as well as new wave, and post-punk).

Could you help me answer this question? If not, let me know by writing \\"Not answerable\\". Plot title: The Final Cut Movie plot: The serial opens with Prime Minister Francis Urquhart shooting his gun dog, now too old to perform its duties â a scene which establishes the theme of the ending of a career. Shortly afterwards, Urquhart attends the fictional state funeral of Margaret Thatcher. He publicly praises Thatcher as his mentor, but privately begrudges her record as the longest-serving prime minister in recent history,[note 1] a record that Urquhart himself is soon to surpass. To \\"leave my mark on the world,\\" Urquhart champions a treaty resolving the Cyprus dispute while secretly working to bring offshore oil deposits under the control of the Turkish authorities on the island so that a Turkish-British consortium will have the drilling rights; an executive of the consortium has promised to provide for Urquhart's retirement fund in return. Urquhart also has a personal connection to Cyprus: as a nineteen-year-old British Army lieutenant serving there in 1956, he killed two young EOKA guerrillas while trying to get information from them. Urquhart has frequent nightmares and flashbacks of this event, and also of the murders of Mattie Storin and others, shown in the previous series. On a motorway near London, Urquhart's car is rammed by another car containing three drunken louts. The attackers are quickly killed by his security staff. Urquhart sustains minor head injuries in the collision, but his life is not endangered. When Elizabeth arrives at hospital, he is delirious and confuses the incident on the motorway with the incident in Cyprus. Tom Makepeace, Urquhart's Foreign Secretary and Deputy Prime Minister, chairs a cabinet meeting while Urquhart is in hospital; Urquhart considers Makepeace â the actual negotiator of the Cyprus treaty â as a potential challenger, although he doesn't take the threat very seriously, considering him \\"not a fighter\\" but \\"a sentimental dreamer\\".

Q: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: It helps to choose the colors you plan to live with in your home with awareness of how different colors affect your emotional and physical states. Every color has a unique meaning, and this can significantly affect how you feel in a room. A room that is painted red will energize, inspire activity and movement, help passion, and be powerful and stimulating. A red room can also be exhausting and overpowering, and stressful for those who are anxious. Orange rooms encourage happy, joyful, social gatherings. While an orange dining room or family room can stimulate the appetite, it is a great choice for such gathering places. Orange enhances parties, communication, positive feelings, and general good cheer. Yellow rooms inspire intellectual clarity, organization, clear -headed thinking, and happy energy. Yellow is considered a color for the logical left side of the brain. Yellow is also very bright and somewhat energizing. Blue rooms are often chosen for bedrooms and meditation rooms because its cool energy is very calming, restful, peaceful, and spiritual. Blue helps inspire a quiet meditative quality, and color therapy with blue has been found to reduce blood pressure. Blue is also useful to make one to sleep. Green rooms are very restful but combine with an energizing quality. Green is the color of outdoors, calm and active at the same time.

Q:Nowadays,much of the profit of a business--sometimes the whole of its success--depends upon the use of the odds and ends.The odds and ends are various small things,which are left over when the main things are produced.But they possess a real value of their own. If a business,big or small,looked down upon these odds and ends,it would mean a big difference in the amount of the benefit of the business.Take a meat factory for instance,there are countless odds and ends--bones and hair,which can be made into glue and rope to increase its profit greatly. Then,if we are college students,what about our odds and ends--the odd moments?Take time for example.Every one of us has the exact same amount of it.Everyone's success or failure depends on the use of their time.But everyone uses the time more or less in the same way.However,why many great men in science or art have made huge successes for themselves in the world?Because they have made best use of their odd moments.Thomas A.Edison,never allowed his odd moments to slip by.He thought,planned,and tried his inventions.He always worked twenty hours out of each twentyfour.His inventions made him famous all over the world,and provided valuable wealth for the human beings. So,remember this _ :busy people always find time for everything.However,people with great spare time find time for nothing.Is it very strange?Not at all!The question is how to gather up fragments of time and make full use of them.As many big businesses have found,the real profit is in using the odds and ends.We also must do in this way to make best use of our odd moments and manage to be successful in something we do. What are odds and ends? A) They are nothing useful. B) They are very small,but valuable things. C) They are the main things factories produce. D) They are odd moments students refuse to gather up. A:","completion":"B) They are very small, but valuable things. Odds and ends refer to various small things that are left over when the main things are produced. In the context of a business, such as a meat factory, these odds and ends, like bones and hair, may seem insignificant at first glance; however, they can be made into useful products, like glue and rope, to significantly increase the factory's profit. This means that even though these items are smaller and less obvious than the main products, they hold considerable value in their own right. Similarly, for college students, odds and ends can refer to odd moments or fragments of time, which when utilized well, can contribute to their overall success. Great people in science, art, and other fields have managed to achieve significant accomplishments by making the best use of their odd moments. Thomas A. Edison serves as a good example of this, as he constantly utilized his odd moments for thinking, planning, and working on his inventions. This diligent use of his time allowed him to create inventions known worldwide and provided valuable resources for humanity. Recognizing that busy people always find time for everything while people with great spare time find time for nothing emphasizes the need to make the best use of one's time, particularly those odd moments. When individuals learn to gather the fragments of their time and use them effectively, they follow a similar principle to that of businesses utilizing every odds and ends, turning apparent insignificance into significant value. This maximizes the potential for success in their studies, careers, or any other endeavors they pursue."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer this question: What is added to steel (approx 11%) to make it stainless and gives properties that prevent it from corroding, rusting or staining with water ?","completion":"Stainless steel is a popular material known for its corrosion resistance, rust protection, and low maintenance properties. To achieve these characteristics, approximately 11% or more of chromium is added to the steel. Chromium is the key element that provides stainless steel with its unique attributes and makes it more resistant to the effects of water, air, and chemicals than ordinary steel. But what is it about chromium that makes stainless steel so effective at combating corrosion, rusting, and staining? Let's discuss this in detail. When chromium is added to steel, it reacts with oxygen in the air to form a thin, invisible, and adherent layer of chromium oxide over the surface of the steel. This passive film is responsible for protecting stainless steel from external elements that might cause corrosion or rusting. The oxide layer is only a few atoms thick and acts as a barrier, hindering further reaction between the steel and its environment. The chromium oxide film is self-healing, which means that if the stainless steel surface is scratched or damaged, new chromium atoms will come into contact with the oxygen, reforming the protective oxide layer and continuing to provide corrosion resistance. This self-healing ability is an essential aspect of the durability and longevity of stainless steel. There are also other alloying elements sometimes added in smaller amounts to enhance the properties of stainless steel: 1. Nickel: Improves corrosion resistance and provides better toughness, formability, and ductility. It also stabilizes the passive oxide film and extends its resistance to more aggressive environments. 2. Molybdenum: Increases resistance to pitting corrosion and crevice corrosion, which are localized corrosive attacks that can occur in chloride-rich environments, such as seawater. 3. Titanium and niobium: These elements are often added to form stable carbides and prevent the formation of chromium carbides, which can lead to intergranular corrosion. By stabilizing the carbides, these elements maintain the corrosion resistance of stainless steel. 4. Copper: Enhances corrosion resistance, particularly against sulfuric and phosphoric acids, and imparts antibacterial properties to the alloy. 5. Nitrogen: Improves strength and corrosion resistance, and it is particularly beneficial in stabilizing austenitic stainless steels. To summarize, adding approximately 11% or more of chromium to steel is what creates stainless steel and imparts properties that prevent it from corroding, rusting, or staining when exposed to water. The chromium reacts with oxygen to form a self-healing, passive chromium oxide film on the surface of the material, providing an effective barrier against corrosive agents. Other alloying elements may be added to further enhance stainless steel's properties, making it a versatile and popular material for various applications."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Dr. Gridlock The Dr. Gridlock column receives hundreds of letters each month from motorists and transit riders throughout the Washington region. They ask questions and make complaints about getting around a region plagued with some of the worst traffic in the nation. The doctor diagnoses problems and tries to bring relief. Dr. Gridlock appears in The Post's Metro section on Sunday and in the Extra section on Thursday. His comments also appear on the Web site's Get There blog. You can send e-mails for the newspaper column to drgridlock@washpost.com or write to Dr. Gridlock at 1150 15th St. NW, Washington, D.C. 20071. Dr. Gridlock: Fellow voyagers, it's a pleasure to join you on what's shaping up as an interesting day in local transportation. I've just come from the Metro rail station at Reagan National Airport, where the transit authority was displaying some new rail car interiors. One was a test car that has some bench seating along the sides. Metro wants to put that on the rails today or tomorrow and see how you react to it. Metro also had an example of the new interior design that will be entering service within a month. It's the one in which floor to ceiling poles have been removed in favor of seat to ceiling poles. The idea is to move us into the car, away from the congestion around the doors that riders find so annoying. I'll put something up on our Get There blog later today, describing this some more. Maybe I can show you a picture, too. Also today, at about the time we wrap up this discussion at 2 p.m., a panel of experts commissioned by the state of Virginia will be releasing its recommendations on whether the new rail line through Tyson's Corner should be above or below ground. We can talk about those topics, or anything else in transit and traffic that's on your mind today. I can tell you some of the things I've been up to during my first week as the new Dr. Gridlock. Let's start off with some of the questions and comments that were waiting for me when I came in. Washington, D.C.: Why Dr. Gridlock? Did you write a dissertation? Get an honorary degree? Until you earn it, I think you should go by Mr. Gridlock. Dr. Gridlock: I'm in the process of certifying myself. I've been making the rounds, trying to learn about what hurts, so I can make proper diagnoses. For example, I circumnavigated the outer loop of the Capital Beltway. I'm closing in on another goal of riding the entire Metro system. Still have legs of the Red, Yellow and Blue lines to complete. Been exploring Braddock Road, Fairfax Parkway, Route 7, the Ride On bus, the DC Circulator -- I know it's Cole's Notes, not \\"Grey's Anatomy.\\" I know you expect the doc to know our corner of the world on a micro level. Rockville, Md.: Congratulations (I think) for becoming the next Dr. Gridlock! Just an observation, but it seems like summer commuting is a good indication of what rush hour traffic would be like if more people telecommuted. Just taking off the vacationers from the roads during the summer seems to make a tough commute tolerable. Dr. Gridlock: One thing I'm very aware of as I go out on test drives across the region is that I'm not seeing experiencing the agonies that so many of you have reported for so long. We've had a lot of people respond to our Get There posting by offering to let us accompany them on their commutes. I expect to be doing that. For most of the past seven years, I've had a luxurious commute: Red Line from Silver Spring to Farragut North. I used to drive downtown, but it dawned on me that I was paying ten bucks a day to warehouse my car. When I started taking the Red Line, I figured I was saving about 750 a year. Must have been a lot more by the time I stopped doing that regularly. You've got big shoes to fill, but I am sure you are going to do great. Any word on when the Springfield Interchange will finally be completed? There were MAJOR backups this weekend coming from Washington, D.C. going south. Dr. Gridlock: Thank you, I do indeed feel like I have big shoes to fill, and I'm trying to get smart in a hurry. I've been The Post's editor for local transportation issues for most of the past seven years, so I've got a broad understanding of the region's traffic and transit issues. Now, I'm trying to learn this at the level you folks expect. Springfield Interchange is still on schedule for completion in late 2007. Our other big project, the Wilson Bridge, also is on schedule. Second span is to be completed in 2008. But those two big projects have providing some of the big action this summer, as they progress. There's a lot of work going on at Springfield that has a high impact on travelers. Wilson Bridge opened the first new span over the past two months. That was a big disruption on two weekends as the lanes were shifted to the new span, but I thought it was managed very well. Silver Spring, Md.: What is your view of the Purple Line's chances of becoming a reality (in our lifetime)? Dr. Gridlock: When I was The Post's transportation editor, I used to ask the reporters to write a series called \\"Not In My Lifetime,\\" describing all the road and rail projects that we've been teased about over the years. Currently, I'm wondering if the Purple Line and Rail to Dulles will fall into this category. Both projects have serious financing issues. Both have issues about whether to tunnel. There are questions about whether the federal government will provide essential funding. These are issues on want to stay on top of in the newspaper column and online. Severn, Md.: Dr. Dr. Give me the news, I've got a bad case of gridlock blues. Wondering if there has been any further news on the Metro expansion to BWI and all those stops along the way? Dr. Gridlock: I just expressed my concerns about the Purple Line and Rail to Dulles. That goes triple for Metro to BWI. It's another project that would require gobs of federal money. How could Maryland suck up that much more money from the feds after the inter county connector and the Purple Line? Clifton, Va.: What type of vehicle do you drive?? Other car and trucks in the family. I really think Dr. Gridlock should have a Ducati 999 in Ferrari Red.! Dr. Gridlock: My editor, Steven Ginsberg, says I need to buy a hybrid -- that Dr. Gridlock needs to make a statement. Others say a hybrid, with a GPS, and satellite radio. I drive a 1997 Toyota RAV4 SUV. I get the hand-me-downs in our family. My wife, who commutes from our inside the Beltway home in Montgomery County home to Baltimore, gets first crack at vehicles. When she builds up high mileage, she passes them down to me. Wheaton, Md.: I figure that the high heat that is predicted for the next few days will require the trains to slow down, due to the tracks' tendency to expand with heat. Dr. Gridlock: I see the heat advisories from VRE and MARC, when the temperature causes the freight lines that own some of the region's track to issue go-slow orders to the commuter lines. Seems like there have been an awful lot of them this summer. It must be hard to operate a commuter service when riders can't count on a schedule. I understand the safety issue involved: That high heat can kink rails and create dangerous situations. By the way, I'm an admirer of Train Talk, the alert system used by VRE to keep riders informed of such things. Washington, D.C.: I'm curious. I know you've subbed in from Mr. Ginsberg on his blog when he's away. Do you plan to have your own Dr. Gridlock blog or do you plan to share with him? Dr. Gridlock: Now that Steven has taken my old job as transportation editor, our plan is to share the Get There blog. Steven was on vacation last week. (He looks great. Tanned and rested for his new assignment.) ICC in my backyard: Speaking of the ICC - do you think it will be built? How do you feel about it since you live in Silver Spring? Dr. Gridlock: It's always been an interesting thing to me: The projects that soak up most of our transportation money don't necessarily have a widespread impact. For me personally, ICC is in that category. We live in Silver Spring. If we want to go over to Bethesda, we take either East-West Highway or the Beltway. If we're going to Baltimore, it's Route 29 or I-95, and maybe sometimes the BW Parkway. I don't expect I'll drive the ICC, though it will be just a few miles from where I live. Rockville, Md: Got to go .Will I be able to see responses later, and where? Dr. Gridlock: We'll have a transcript posted. That's true of all our Live Onlines. Inside the beltway: Are you going to do more columns on bike and walking commutes. We have issues too, you know -- like sidewalks closed for construction, and drivers who won't yield. Dr. Gridlock: We get many such comments and indeed will be certain to pay attention to issues concerning biking and walking. Washington, D.C.: Why was the new Wilson Bridge span designed with the same number of lanes as the old Wilson Bridge span? Size matters. What's up with that? Dr. Gridlock: What you're seeing now is only half the action. The first of the two new spans is open. That allows the project workers to tear down the old bridge to clear room to complete the second new span. Once that opens in 2008, there will be more lanes on the bridge than on the Beltway approaches to it. That's when you should really see some relief. For now, the advantage is that at least the new span has shoulders for disabled vehicles. Re: Summer Commutes: I'm sorry to say I haven't experienced much relief in my evening commute home to Rockville from Tyson's this summer. At best, the relief is sporadic. Last summer (when I started this commute), I remember lighter traffic more days than not. Is anyone else noticing this? Dr. Gridlock: I'm curious about that, too. I think summer traffic is generally down, but there are exceptions. Bethesda, Md.: I read about how starting this fall all the trains on the Red Line will go to the end of the line during the weekend and non-peak hours. How about peak hours? It would be great if all the trains went to Shady Grove. Dr. Gridlock: I believe that's the only change that's scheduled: That starting in October, trains will no longer turn back at Grosvenor during non-peak hours and on weekends. Maryland had to pay for the additional service. The rationale I've heard for the improvement on the west side of the Red Line, as opposed to the east side where trains turn back at Silver Spring, is the extra development to the west that's increasing rider ship on the Shady Grove side. \\"We have issues too, you know -- like sidewalks closed for construction, and drivers who won't yield.\\": Can I ask that the analysis of the issue present the problem from both sides? LOTS of pedestrians downtown think that the \\"Don't Walk\\" signs don't apply to them. They walk when it starts flashing and become livid if drivers don't yield--well, if it says \\"Don't Walk,\\" the driver isn't supposed to have to yield (the pedestrian is!) None of us will ever get anywhere if BOTH sides don't cooperate. Look at New Yorkers--they jaywalk like crazy, but no New Yorker is stupid enough to try to hold up oncoming cars (especially not taxis). D.C. pedestrians need the same common sense! Dr. Gridlock: What do folks think of those \\"walk-don't walk\\" signs with the countdown timers? Are they helpful to pedestrians? Once in a while, I encounter one that seems to skip about 10 seconds. That makes it extra interesting. Re: Summer Commutes: I drive from Tyson's to Silver Spring and it is just as bad during the summer as during the other parts of the year. But, what can you do? Congrats on the new position and thanks for taking the time to get to know us! Dr. Gridlock: Thank you. That's just a killer stretch. So unpredictable, too. One thing I'd like to hear about from folks is how they get their traffic information. When I visit our Fairfax Bureau, where transportation researcher Diane Mattingly is based, I look at the online traffic cameras before I leave home and before I leave the bureau -- not that there are all that many alternatives anyway. Washington D.C.: I read that you rode the Circulator bus last week. I love the service, but I have two questions. First, the obvious, are they planning any more routes? Second, do they have any plans to better advertise and encourage riders to purchase tickets before boarding and then to enter by any door? It seems as though no one knows they can do this! I only know that you can by going to their Web site. It is a great system similar to London's bendy-buses, and it really speeds things up if the bus doesn't have to wait for a long queue to put their exact change into the fare box. I also wish they would put a SmartTrip scanner near the rear door so that those users can bypass the front and enter the rear. Thanks. Dr. Gridlock: No definite plans at the moment for more routes or more hours. I think it's a great service and would like to encourage more people to use it. You'll probably see more about it on the Get There blog, and I might write about it for the Sunday Gridlock column. Good as I think the Circulator is at making things clear and simple, they could still do more. I like your suggestion about the SmartTrip cards at the other doors, but bet that's an expensive addition. The service is pretty heavily subsidized already. One thing I noticed is that if you don't know where you're going -- if you're a tourist, or taking a trip you don't usually take -- it's a bit hard to figure out your best stop from inside the bus. Arlington, Va.: Can you please explain why anyone continues to drive inside the Beltway? I'm from the Midwest, where I've been driving since the age of 15, and since moving to the area I love the freedom of public transportation. With the D.C. Metro trip planner web site you can easily get anywhere in the Beltway. My friends tease me for this fondness of buses and metro, but I catch up on my reading, rest, and even nap while they sit in traffic polluting our environment. On top of that, I've met many interesting people and learned a lot about the region in just a few years here. Dr. Gridlock: I'm a big fan of transit, but I do drive. For example, if my wife and I want to go to dinner in Bethesda some night, we're not going to take the Red Line V into downtown Washington and then back up to Bethesda. The bus connections would be problematic. Purple Line would make a difference. Bethesda, Md.: I think it would be good for you to let readers know your positions on some of our regional transportation issues such as the Tyson's to Dulles Rail Project, the Bethesda to New Carrollton \\"Purple Line,\\" adding HOT lanes to the VA Beltway, the ICC, etc. Dr. Gridlock: I'll be telling you what I think on these topics and many others. Stick with me. Check the Get There blog. I'll put something up there today about the new rail car designs, for example. We have Dr. Gridlock on page 2 of the Sunday Metro section, and hope to restart the Dr. Gridlock columns in The Post's Extra sections in late August. I-270, Exit 1: Good afternoon and congratulations on becoming Dr. Gridlock. I imagine it's like being the next Dr. Who, you travel around and try to solve problems. My question is about the column/chat itself. How does one measure the success of this enterprise? Has Dr. Gridlock ever remedied a traffic problem with local governments, or is success more a measure of the number of readers who informally exchange alternate routes, but mainly vent about bad traffic management and driving practices? Thank you and best wishes. Dr. Gridlock: This is a really good question. Ron Shaffer got some things changes. I hope I can help, too. Getting some wrongs righted would be tremendously satisfying. Sometimes, though, you readers of the columns and the blogs and the Live Onlines help each other. I've seen you do that over the years through Dr. Gridlock. Dr. Gridlock: Folks, despite having many, many more questions and comments to go, I think I'd better sign off for today. I want to get up a blog item about those new Metro rail cars and maybe post a picture of the interior. Thanks for making this first foray such a welcoming experience. For all those readers whose notes I didn't get a chance to respond to today, please be aware that I'm reading them all and will take the advice seriously and try to find answers to the questions, so that I can respond in future discussions and columns.

Commercialisation – Société Iogen En avril 2004, la société Iogen a amorcé les opérations d’une usine de démonstration d’avantcommercialisation entièrement intégrée. Translate this to English?","completion":"Commercialization - Iogen Corporation In April 2004, the Iogen Corporation began operations at a fully integrated pre-commercialization demonstration plant. The Iogen Corporation, a bio-energy company, took a major step in its journey towards commercialization in April 2004 with the launch of a fully integrated pre-commercialization demonstration plant. This new facility served as a platform to showcase the company's innovative technologies and processes, as well as their potential to revolutionize the bioenergy industry. The demonstration plant played a key role in validating the technical and economic viability of the Iogen's production processes, allowing for potential investors, partners and clients to become more familiar with the benefits of the company's offerings. By providing a tangible, working example of the technology, the plant aimed to build trust and confidence in the company's ability to deliver on its promises and effectively scale up the processes for commercial purposes. One of the main focuses of the Iogen Corporation is the production of cellulosic ethanol, an alternative fuel produced from biomass rather than conventional food crops such as corn or sugar cane. This innovative approach offers a more sustainable and environmentally friendly alternative to traditional fossil fuels. In order to produce cellulosic ethanol, Iogen has developed advanced processes for breaking down the complex structure of plant cellulose, which is then converted into sugars suitable for fermentation into ethanol. At the pre-commercialization demonstration plant, these processes and technologies were tested and optimized, refining the production methods and improving efficiency, while also allowing for the assessment of any potential challenges and risks associated with scaling up the operations. The success of the demonstration plant was pivotal to the Iogen Corporation's efforts to advance the commercialization of its technology. Following the successful operations of the plant in 2004, the company was able to secure further funding and partnerships, which enabled continuous improvement of its technology and processes, and ultimately contributed to the development of a full-scale commercial production facility. In conclusion, the establishment of the fully integrated pre-commercialization demonstration plant in April 2004 marked a significant milestone for the Iogen Corporation, showcasing its innovative bioenergy solutions and boosting confidence in its ability to deliver on a commercial scale.

If not, let me know by writing \\"Not answerable\\". Plot title: Don't Look in the Basement Movie plot: The film is set in Stephens Sanitarium, a secluded rural mental health institute whose chief doctor believes that the best way to deal with insanity is to allow the patients to freely act out their realities in the hopes that they will snap out of it, so to speak. The film begins with an elderly nurse in Stephens Sanitorium making her rounds. After a troubling incident in which a patient threatens her life, she decides to retire, and goes out to visit the chief doctor, Dr. Stephens, to inform him of the decision. Unfortunately, in the process of therapy (which involves chopping wood with an axe), the crazed former magistrate known as Judge (Gene Ross) accidentally lands the axe in Dr. Stephens' back, apparently killing him. The shaken nurse returns inside to finish packing, where she is attacked by Harriet (Camilla Carr), a patient who accuses her of stealing her \\"baby\\" (actually a plastic doll). The patient kills her by crushing her head in the nurse's suitcase. The only remaining doctor appears to be Dr. Geraldine Masters (Anne MacAdams), who is greeted by Charlotte Beale (Rosie Holotik), a pretty young nurse who informs Dr. Masters that Dr. Stephens had hired her a week ago. Dr. Masters begrudgingly allows her to settle in. The young nurse meets the patients, including a lobotomized and childish man named Sam (Bill McGhee) who enjoys popsicles and his plastic toy boat, a nymphomaniac and schizophrenic named Allyson (Betty Chandler), an emotionally dependent woman named Jennifer (Harryette Warren), an octogenarian woman named Mrs. Callingham (Rhea MacAdams) who spouts bizarre poetry and mistakes flowers in the garden to be her own children, a juvenile prankster named Danny (Jessie Kirby), a shellshocked Sergeant (Hugh Feagin) who lost his mind after accidentally killing his men in Vietnam, and the crazed judge who seems incapable of speaking in anything other than courtroom jargon and the repeated phrase \\"My name... is...

It seems that traditional medical and psychiatric treatments might not be the primary focus at Stephens Sanitarium, with the emphasis placed more on letting the patients express themselves without restrictions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

No. 14 seed UAB takes out No. 3 Iowa State in tourney's first upset Updated MAR 19, 2015 6:45p ET LOUISVILLE, Ky. -- The UAB Blazers may not have a football program anymore. They do have the first big upset of the NCAA tournament and hope they can give their university something to rally around. William Lee scored the last four points for 14th-seeded UAB, and the Blazers knocked off third-seeded Iowa State 60-59 on Thursday in their opening game in the NCAA tournament. It's the third straight year a 14 seed has upset a No. 3 seed, and Georgia State followed up by joining the list within an hour with a 57-56 win over Baylor. The Blazers (20-15) came in with the third-youngest team in the NCAA tournament and with nobody having played in this tournament before. They wound up winning the program's first NCAA game since 2005 and ran over to celebrate in front of the fans of a school that shut its football program down in December. \\"For us, it was just huge,\\" UAB junior Robert Brown said. \\"We come here, not just to play games, but to actually make some noise and to win some games. To be able to do that and win for Birmingham, win for Coach (Jerod) Haase, it's a great feeling.\\" And it set off a wild celebration in the Blazers' locker room. \\"We were celebrating because that was a really big win for us with us being the underdogs,\\" UAB guard Tyler Madison said. Haase estimated maybe four or five of the Blazers didn't even realize a month ago that the Conference USA tournament champion earned an automatic berth, while another had never watched a selection show before Sunday. \\"You're a product of your thoughts,\\" Haase said. \\"There's been more talk right now about 14 seed or upsets than we've said the entire year. Our thoughts have been, when we play well, we think we can compete with anybody, and those thoughts have been expressed to our team, and our team has made the choice to believe in that. I think that's what you saw today.\\" The ninth-ranked Cyclones (25-9) came into the South Regional looking for a much longer run than a year ago when they reached the Sweet 16 without top scorer Georges Niang due to injury. But they just couldn't match the scrappy Blazers on the boards in a second half where the Cyclones couldn't hold onto a 55-51 lead with 3:13 left. For Iowa State coach Fred Hoiberg, it's as tough a loss as he's had. His Cyclones came in having won five straight, rallying from double-digit deficits in each on their way to the Big 12 tournament title. Hoiberg called that an emotional three days in Kansas City followed by playing the first game Thursday. \\"I'm not going to make any excuses,\\" Hoiberg said. \\"You've got to come out and play 40 minutes. ... I don't know. Maybe we should have let them get up double digits. That's kind of how we play our best.\\" The Blazers, who outscored Iowa State 9-4 down the stretch, will play 11th-seeded UCLA, a 60-59 winner over sixth-seeded SMU, on Saturday. Iowa State, which lost its opener as a No. 2 seed in 2001, last led at 57-56 on a basket by Monte Morris. But Lee hit a jumper with 24 seconds left putting UAB ahead to stay. Niang had a jumper blocked by Tosin Mehinti, and Lee got the rebound. Lee hit two free throws with 12.1 seconds left for the Blazers' final points. Naz Long missed a 3 that Morris tipped in with 0.4 seconds left, and the Cyclones couldn't get the ball back before the Blazers started celebrating their gutty win. \\"We got lackadaisical,\\" Long said. \\"We have no one to blame but ourselves. This one burns, man. It burns.\\" Brown led UAB with 21 points, Lee finished with 14 points and 12 rebounds. Madison also had 11 rebounds as the Blazers dominated the boards 52-37. Morris finished with 15 points for the Cyclones, who were making a school-record fourth straight tournament appearance only to lose their opener for the first time since 2001. Niang and reserve Matt Thomas both added 11 points, and Jameel McKay had 10 points and 12 rebounds. Iowa State looked ready to finally put away an opponent as the Cyclones opened the game with a 12-2 lead. The Blazers settled down quickly enough and used a 14-4 run to turn it into a game taking advantage of repeated turnovers by the Cyclones. The Blazers took a 31-28 halftime lead before a 6:52 scoring drought. Not that it hurt as the teams wound up swapping the lead a total of 17 times with eight ties. STREAK CONTINUED: UAB's win as a No. 14 seed follows up what Mercer did to Duke last year in the tournament. In 2013, it was Harvard upsetting New Mexico. So now Iowa State joins the list. Notre Dame coach Mike Brey, whose team was also a 3 seed, saw UAB's upset and said of Iowa State: \\"They took the bullet, not us.\\" UAB: Blazers' fans didn't miss an opportunity to chant \\"Fire Ray Watts\\" during timeouts in their protest against the university president who shut down the school's football program in December. ... The Blazers had a 19-9 edge on the offensive glass. ... Haase won his debut as a head coach, though he appeared in 17 other tournaments as a player or assistant. Iowa State: Thomas hadn't scored in double figures since late February, a span of six straight games. ... The Cyclones, who came in with the third-most wins in school history, lost as a No. 2 seed to 15th-seeded Hampton in 2001. ... Niang broke a bone in his right foot in their first NCAA game last year with the Cyclones losing in the Sweet 16 to eventual champ Connecticut.

UAB's victory was particularly meaningful for the team and its fans due to the controversial decision to shut down the school's football program in December 2014. The Blazers' win was fueled by strong performances from players William Lee, Robert Brown, and Tyler Madison, while Iowa State struggled to maintain their early lead and secure rebounds."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I am living in a society where there are almost 90 houses and almost all of them are occupied. We have one sweeper hired for whole society to collect waste and sweep out dust from our society roads. BTW her name is Hira masi (my brother calls her diamond masi :p). And she is extremely poor and she lives in those slums where almost nothing is available. She earns 50/100 per house each month. (Source) As she is extremely poor, all the society people help her a lot. From giving 2 times food to giving clothes and giving bonuses on special occasion as much as Rs. 1000, they almost help her in each and every aspect. And this is by far the most incredible thing our society has which is humanity. But the twist comes here. On the other side, she is extremely cunning. She rarely cleans the road, takes rarely wastes from homes, gives excuses that she is sick and does not come for work, etc. She does not do her work properly. She also request money from us saying that her family members are ill as much as Rs 10000, even if they are not. So this thing was discussed in our meeting and there some decided to continue her as she was very poor and some decided to leave her. But my mom today told me a great thing- If a person is doing her work seriously, then we will surely help him in every way, even if it is a matter of money, but the person who is not sincere and not doing work properly, then sometimes we have to step back from humanity and be strict. If the person is honest and he is REALLY in need of help, we should definitely help them. But the person who just fakes that he is in need, we should be strict/ignore them, else they will not do any work, and just simply rely on us. Sometimes, being strict and giving up humanity will make the person grow. Question: The author probably believes that === The answer to the above question is Available options: (1).

Adam chose to purchase a wig instead of receiving a haircut because the Available choices: (A). wig was cheaper.. (B). haircut was cheaper..","completion":"Adam chose to purchase a wig instead of receiving a haircut because the wig was cheaper. This decision was influenced by several factors that Adam took into consideration before making his choice. First and foremost, the cost difference between the wig and the haircut played a significant role in this decision. Adam found a high-quality, stylish wig at a discounted price, making it an attractive and affordable option. On the other hand, the haircut he was interested in required the expertise of a skilled hairstylist, which would have been significantly more expensive. By opting for the wig, Adam was able to save a considerable amount of money that he could utilize in other aspects of his life or personal grooming. Secondly, the wig allowed Adam the flexibility to switch up his look with ease and without too much commitment. With a haircut, he would have been limited to one particular style for several weeks or even months until his hair grew back. The wig, however, provided him with the option to alternate his appearance whenever he wanted, offering more versatility and ensuring that he would never grow bored with his style. Additionally, if Adam were to attend a special event or have an important meeting where he wanted to present a more polished appearance, he could easily do so by simply switching to a different wig. Moreover, wigs generally require less maintenance than natural hair. With a wig, Adam wouldn't have to worry about regular visits to the hairstylist to maintain the shape and style or investing in expensive hair care products. This would save him not only money but also valuable time – something that many people often overlook when making such decisions. Furthermore, choosing a wig also meant that Adam could avoid potential damage to his natural hair that could be caused by frequent salon visits, chemical treatments, and styling tools. Hair damage is a common concern for many individuals, and investing in a wig provided him with a worry-free solution, reducing the risk of potential hair issues such as breakage and split ends. In conclusion, Adam's choice to purchase a wig instead of receiving a haircut was driven by the numerous benefits offered by this alternative option. The wig was not only cheaper but also granted him the freedom to experiment with different looks, lower maintenance requirements, and the added advantage of minimizing damage to his natural hair. Considering all these factors, Adam's decision to go with the wig rather than the more expensive haircut proved to be a smarter, more practical choice."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Formed in 1993, Boyzone was a widely popular group during the 1990s and early 2000s. The original line-up of the band consisted of five members: Ronan Keating, Mikey Graham, Shane Lynch, Keith Duffy, and Stephen Gately himself. Managed by Louis Walsh, who is also known for managing another Irish boyband, Westlife, Boyzone found considerable success in the United Kingdom, Ireland, and across Europe. Their music typically belonged to the pop and ballad genres and earned them numerous chart-topping hits and accolades. Throughout their career, Boyzone released several albums, including their debut album \\"Said and Done\\" (1995), \\"A Different Beat\\" (1996), \\"Where We Belong\\" (1998), \\"Brother\\" (2010), and \\"BZ20\\" (2013).

Besides his musical endeavors, Gately also pursued acting and appeared in various theater productions and television shows. Tragically, Stephen Gately passed away on October 10, 2009, at the age of 33 due to a congenital heart condition. His death came as a shock to his fans and the entertainment industry. Since then, members of Boyzone have continued to honor his memory in various ways, releasing the album \\"Brother\\" in 2010 as a tribute to Gately. Boyzone officially disbanded in 2019 after releasing their final album, \\"Thank You & Goodnight,\\" and completing a farewell tour that marked their 25th anniversary as a group.

Write an article with the title: \\"‘The Bachelor’ for porn stars, and other reality shows that failed to make it on TV\\"","completion":"Title: 'The Bachelor' for Porn Stars, and Other Reality Shows That Failed to Make It on TV Introduction Some mainstream reality shows have managed to capture the imagination of a diverse audience, keeping them entertained for years. However, for every successful reality show, there are numerous others that never quite made it on TV, with some of them even crossing the boundary of bad taste. One such example, 'The Bachelor' for porn stars, promises thrills and escapades from the world of adult entertainment, but the concept was too risqué for network television. In this article, we will take a closer look at this controversial idea and other reality show concepts that never found a secure spot on the small screen. 'The Bachelor' for Porn Stars The proposed \\"adult\\" version of the popular dating show, 'The Bachelor,' would have seen porn stars vying for the affections of a single, eligible bachelor. Contestants would engage in various challenges designed to showcase their charm, wit, and sexual prowess. While there might have been a market for this provocative reality show, it may have led to protests and censorship based on its adult content, which would have harmed the ratings and advertising revenues of traditional broadcasters. Thus, this titillating concept never saw the light of day. Other Reality Shows That Failed to Make It on TV 1. 'Celebrity Boxing' In the early 2000s, FOX attempted to cash in on the popularity of celebrity-based reality shows by pitting D-list stars against one another in boxing matches. Every episode would be filled with rival celebrities putting on the gloves and going head-to-head in a boxing ring. While a few episodes were aired, it was a unanimous flop with both critics and audiences. 2. 'Who's Your Daddy?' Controversial from the get-go, this reality show had a controversial premise: an adopted adult would choose from a group of men whom they believed was their biological father. If the adult guessed correctly, they would win a cash prize. But if the contestant was wrong, the faux father would walk away with the money. FOX received significant backlash after airing the pilot episode in 2005, critics labeling the show tasteless and exploitative. The network quickly canceled the show. 3. 'The Will' This show took advantage of family tensions in the most distressing way, with family members battling one another in various challenges to win a share of a deceased relative's inheritance. The concept was not well received, and CBS axed the show after only one episode. 4. 'All My Babies' Mamas' Oxygen Network’s proposed reality series 'All My Babies' Mamas' featured rapper Shawty Lo, his 11 children, and their ten mothers, exploring the unique world the rapper had created for his family. Critics saw the show as perpetuating stereotypes and glorifying irresponsibility, and the network decided to scrap the project before any episodes were broadcast. 5. 'Bridalplasty' E! Network's reality show 'Bridalplasty' had brides-to-be competing for plastic surgery and a dream wedding based on their narcissistic desires. It was met with public outrage, with viewers questioning the show's morality and insensitivity towards the institution of marriage. The show was canceled after only one season. Conclusion Although reality television thrives on capturing the most intriguing and unpredictable human elements, it is crucial for creators and networks to respect certain boundaries that exist for a good reason. As the failures of shows like 'The Bachelor' for porn stars and others on this list demonstrate, pushing the envelope too far can infringe upon moral sensibilities and generate controversy, rather than capture an audience's interest. Moving forward, reality show creators must strike a delicate balance between creating unique, engaging television programs while maintaining a sense of responsibility for the impact they have on society."},{"prompt":"I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: Everybody cheats. Whether it's the taxi driver who tricks a visitor and takes them the long way round, or the shop assistant who doesn't give the correct change, or the police officer who accepts a bribe - everybody's at it. Cheats in the nest include the scientist whose research was based on fake data, the game show competitors who worked with a friend in the audience or win a million pounds, and the doctor who made up his qualifications and wasn't really a doctor at all. Everybody cheats; nobody's playing the game. Is cheating acceptable, a natural way of surviving and being successful? Or is it something that should _ , and young people discouraged from doing? If it's the latter how can we explain to children why so many bend the rules? Take sport for example. The Word Cup was filled with cheating. Whether diving, pretending to be hurt or denying a handball, footballers will do anything for a free - kick or a penalty shot. France striker Henry denied cheating to win the free - kick which led to his side's second goal in their 3 - 1 victory over Spain. Many footballers, however, are often putting it on. Whatever the nationality there's one common ploy: the player rolls over holding their leg, ankle or head seeming to be in great pain. As a result a yellow card and / or free - kick is given for the foul and then, a few seconds later, the player is up and about as if nothing had happened ! The ref may be taken in by it but youngsters watching the game aren't. they also see their heroes getting away with it. Of course it's not just football.

Although Powell was intimidated by Lennon's attitude and appearance, she heard that he was obsessed with the French actress Brigitte Bardot, so she dyed her hair blonde. Lennon asked her out, but when she said that she was engaged, he screamed out, \\"I didn't ask you to fuckin' marry me, did I?\\" She often accompanied him to Quarrymen gigs and travelled to Hamburg with McCartney's girlfriend to visit him. Lennon was jealous by nature and eventually grew possessive, often terrifying Powell with his anger and physical violence. Lennon later said that until he met Ono, he had never questioned his chauvinistic attitude toward women. He said that the Beatles song \\"Getting Better\\" told his own story, \\"I used to be cruel to my woman, and physically – any woman. I was a hitter. I couldn't express myself and I hit. I fought men and I hit women. That is why I am always on about peace.\\"Recalling his July 1962 reaction when he learned that Cynthia was pregnant, Lennon said, \\"There's only one thing for it Cyn. We'll have to get married.\\" The couple wed on 23 August at the Mount Pleasant Register Office in Liverpool, with Brian Epstein serving as best man. His marriage began just as Beatlemania was taking off across the UK. He performed on the evening of his wedding day and would continue to do so almost daily from then on. Epstein feared that fans would be alienated by the idea of a married Beatle, and he asked the Lennons to keep their marriage secret. Julian was born on 8 April 1963; Lennon was on tour at the time and did not see his infant son until three days later.Cynthia attributed the start of the marriage breakdown to Lennon's use of LSD, and she felt that he slowly lost interest in her as a result of his use of the drug.

But she bumps into Dan Lefcourt (Chris Young), one of the school geeks, who has also gone to the cinema to avoid the prom.

I must say, the experience was nothing short of spectacular, and we left the restaurant with full stomachs and content hearts. Upon arrival, we were greeted by the warm and inviting ambiance of the establishment. The dimly lit interior, rustic wooden furniture, and the authentic Italian music playing in the background had already won us over even before we were seated. Our server, Giuseppe, was an absolute delight from the moment we sat down. He was knowledgeable about the menu, offered thoughtful recommendations and wine pairings, and catered to our dietary restrictions with ease. His friendly demeanor and attentive service truly enhanced our overall dining experience. As for the food, every dish was a scrumptious masterpiece. The antipasto platter, featuring an assortment of cured meats, cheeses, and olives, was a perfect start to our Italian culinary journey. The presentation was impeccable, and the flavors were rich and authentic. For our main courses, we decided on the Tagliatelle alla Bolognese, Gnocchi al Pesto, and Branzino al Limone. Each dish was cooked to perfection. The Tagliatelle was tender and beautifully coated in a rich, meaty sauce. The Gnocchi was pillow-soft, and the homemade pesto was aromatic and packed with flavor. The Branzino was moist and flaky with a delicate lemon-butter sauce that accentuated the fish's natural flavors. The wine list, curated by an expert sommelier, featured a fine selection of both Italian and international wines that catered to different tastes and budgets. We opted for a bottle of the recommended Barbera d'Asti, which greatly complemented our meal. To finish off our evening, we shared a heavenly Tiramisu. The dessert was an exquisite balance of silky mascarpone cream, espresso-soaked ladyfingers, and a dusting of cocoa powder. We couldn't have asked for a better way to end our meal. In conclusion, Trattoria Bella offers a superior Italian dining experience that is not to be missed! The charming atmosphere, exemplary service, and delectable dishes guarantee nothing short of a fantastic evening. It's a welcomed gem in our town that I believe will thrive for years to come.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. The British Agricultural Revolution, or Second Agricultural Revolution, was the unprecedented increase in agricultural production in Britain due to increases in labour and land productivity between the mid-17th and late 19th centuries. Agricultural output grew faster than the population over the century to 1770, and thereafter productivity remained among the highest in the world. This increase in the food supply contributed to the rapid growth of population in England and Wales, from 5.5 million in 1700 to over 9 million by 1801, though domestic production gave way increasingly to food imports in the nineteenth century as population more than tripled to over 32 million. The rise in productivity accelerated the decline of the agricultural share of the labour force, adding to the urban workforce on which industrialization depended: the Agricultural Revolution has therefore been cited as a cause of the Industrial Revolution. Answer this question, making sure that the answer is supposed by the text: what relationship was there between improvements in agriculture and the industrialisation of britain?","completion":"The relationship between improvements in agriculture and the industrialization of Britain was significant and closely intertwined. The British Agricultural Revolution, marked by an unprecedented increase in agricultural production, contributed to several key factors that spurred the Industrial Revolution. First, the rise in agricultural productivity led to a faster growth in food supply compared to the population from the mid-17th to the late 19th centuries. This allowed the population to grow rapidly, with the numbers increasing from 5.5 million in 1700 to over 9 million by 1801. The larger population provided a crucial labor force for the emerging industrial sector. Second, the efficiency brought about by the Agricultural Revolution led to the decline of agricultural share in the labor force. As productivity increased and fewer people were needed to work in agriculture, many workers from rural areas migrated to urban areas, becoming part of the growing urban workforce. This shift in labor from agricultural to industrial sectors was essential to support the increasing scale and complexities of industrialization. It is essential to note that while domestic agricultural production supported the population in the earlier stages of the revolution, food imports started to take a larger share in the 19th century as the population continued to grow rapidly, reaching over 32 million. Furthermore, the improvements in agriculture not only added to the urban workforce but also influenced the development of other sectors like transportation and trade. In conclusion, the relationship between improvements in agriculture and the industrialization of Britain is marked by the growth in the food supply and the shift in labor force from the agricultural sector to the urban workforce. The Agricultural Revolution played a significant role in setting the stage for the Industrial Revolution, demonstrating how these two transformative periods in history were profoundly interconnected."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. How do you do this: make a box of jello","completion":"Making a box of Jello is quite simple and only requires a few steps. Here's a detailed guide to ensure that you'll make a perfect and delicious Jello: Ingredients: 1. A box of Jello of your preferred flavor. Jello is available in a wide range of flavors, such as strawberry, lime or orange. 2. Water. You'll need equal parts of boiling and cold water. Utensils: 1. A kettle or a saucepan to boil the water. 2. A big bowl where you'll be making your Jello. 3. A whisk or a big spoon. 4. A refrigerator. Here are the steps: 1. First of all, you'll need to boil water. The amount required is usually printed on the back of the box. If you're using a standard, small box of Jello (85g), you'll need one cup of boiling water. If you're using a large-sized box (170g), you'll need two cups. 2. While your water is boiling, open your box of Jello and pour its contents into a large bowl. 3. Once your water has boiled, carefully pour it into the bowl, on top of the Jello powder. 4. Use your whisk or spoon to stir the mixture. Make sure to stir until the powder completely dissolves. This usually takes around 2 minutes. 5. After your Jello has dissolved in boiling water, you'll need to add cold water. The amount of cold water should be equal to the amount of boiling water you've added. So if you've used one cup of boiling water, now add one cup of cold water. For two cups of boiling water, add two cups of cold water. 6. Stir again to mix the hot and cold water together. 7. Now that your Jello mix is ready, it's time to let it set. Jello needs to be chilled in a refrigerator in order to turn from a liquid to a gel. 8. Place your bowl in the refrigerator. Make sure to keep it level to prevent any spills. 9. Allow your Jello to set for at least 4 hours. Remember, the longer you let it set, the firmer it'll be. It's often best to make your Jello a day ahead of when you plan to eat it. 10. After your Jello has set, you can serve it. To make it more appealing, you can cut it into cubes, or use cookie cutters to create fun shapes. If you're serving it for dessert, you can add whipped cream on top, or pair it with fruits. And that's it! You've made a box of Jello. It's a fun, easy, and versatile dessert that's always a hit, especially with kids. Happy cooking!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Brian Vetrulli, 36, and John Vetrulli Jr, 38, of Gilbertsville, were arrested on Saturday in the King of Prussia section of Upper Merion Township in their white 2013 Chevrolet Silverado pickup truck. Police were alerted to the truck because it matched the description of a vehicle believed to be involved in the thefts of 13 iron sewer grates from parking lots in the area. John Vetrulli Jr. (left) and Brian Vetrulli (right) were jailed on Saturday in Montgomery County on charges of theft, conspiracy and receiving stolen property. After the vehicle was stopped, 'officers noticed a large pry bar [crowbar] in the bed of the truck', according to police. The truck contained receipts from scrap metal dealers dating back to December 12, 2014, that indicated the brothers had sold off more than 1,000 grates for about 9 apiece. Investigators discovered the younger Vetrulli already had an outstanding warrant for theft and when police questioned the brothers, they reportedly confessed to the 13 thefts in Upper Merion Township. The Vetrulli brothers reportedly confessed to taking 13 grates from Upper Merion Township in Pennsylvania. The Vetrullis also confessed to grabbing grates in Philadelphia, Limerick, Collegeville, Plymouth Meeting, Willow Grove, Abington, Bensalem, Haverford, Broomall, Upper Providence, and Montgomeryville. At this point, investigators believe the Vetrulli brothers 'caused approximately 500,000 worth of loss throughout five counties in approximately one month' as the iron grates cost nearly 475 to replace.

As they raised a hand to effortlessly wipe away a stray droplet that dared to escape its confines, the cool metal shaker glistening with condensation, the bartender couldn't help but smile at the anticipation etched on the faces around the bar. They knew that a well-crafted cocktail could transport the drinker to another world – a world where the stresses and strains of daily life eventually faded away. As the bartender's hand deftly grasped a freshly-plucked mint sprig, they expertly slapped it between their palms to release the fragrant oils. As the invigorating scent wafted through the atmosphere, mingling with the scent of sweet fruitiness that already permeated the air, anticipation for the cocktail's completion continued to build. Placing the mint sprig delicately atop the drink, the bartender's focus shifted to selecting the perfect straw to match the concoction. The choice was crucial; this seemingly innocuous detail often went unnoticed by the uninformed person, but the bartender knew just how much impact a straw's color, length, and design could have on the overall drinking experience. After a moment's consideration, their fingers selected a bright orange bendy straw, a playful choice that perfectly balanced the sophisticated presentation with a whimsical twist. With a soft \\"pop,\\" the straw disappeared beneath the drink's enticing waves, making its journey to the glass's bottom as if seeking out the most delicate notes hidden within the depths. As the final cherry atop the masterpiece, the bartender confidently sprinkled a dash of superfine sugar around the rim of the glass. This simple yet elegant touch provided an unexpected contrast in texture that could turn an ordinary drink into a symphony of flavor with just the slightest hint of sweetness. The final product stood before them, a harmonious blend of vibrant color, complex taste, and eye-catching presentation. The bartender slid the craft cocktail across the bar's smooth surface, their keen eyes catching the flicker of excitement in their patron's widened eyes. The pulse of the bar seemed to collectively quicken in that brief moment before the drink met the parched lips of its eager recipient, the first sip permanently cementing the memory of this artfully crafted cocktail. As the patron indulged, the bartender moved on to the next order, their focus sharp and assured, even as they began to mix and blend a new symphony of flavors for the next awaiting customer. The bar came alive with a cacophony of sounds: the laughter of delighted patrons, the clinking of ice in glasses, the pouring of premium spirits and the hum of animated conversations. And at the center of it all was the bartender – a master of their craft – blending their love of flavor and art into each meticulously crafted beverage. It mattered not if they were fulfilling a standard request or a completely unique concoction, as the true satisfaction came from creating a moment that would be forever etched in the taste buds and memories of their patrons."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the title of this article: The independence of the Thirteen Colonies in North America in 1783 after the American War of Independence caused Britain to lose some of its oldest and most populous colonies. British attention soon turned towards Asia, Africa, and the Pacific. After the defeat of France in the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars (1792–1815), Britain emerged as the principal naval and imperial power of the 19th century (with London the largest city in the world from about 1830). Unchallenged at sea, British dominance was later described as Pax Britannica (\\"British Peace\\"), a period of relative peace in Europe and the world (1815–1914) during which the British Empire became the global hegemon and adopted the role of global policeman. In the early 19th century, the Industrial Revolution began to transform Britain; by the time of the Great Exhibition in 1851 the country was described as the \\"workshop of the world\\". The British Empire expanded to include India, large parts of Africa and many other territories throughout the world. Alongside the formal control it exerted over its own colonies, British dominance of much of world trade meant that it effectively controlled the economies of many regions, such as Asia and Latin America. Domestically, political attitudes favoured free trade and laissez-faire policies and a gradual widening of the voting franchise. During this century, the population increased at a dramatic rate, accompanied by rapid urbanisation, causing significant social and economic stresses. To seek new markets and sources of raw materials, the Conservative Party under Disraeli launched a period of imperialist expansion in Egypt, South Africa, and elsewhere. Canada, Australia, and New Zealand became self-governing dominions.

After hearing this news, he convinced his wife, Charlotte, to get checked out. After running several tests, the doctors determined Charlotte has no cancer, but she does have high blood pressure. Relieved at this news, Jason was now focused on battling his cancer and fighting as hard as he could to survive. Who has less abnormal cells in their body? Hint: Cancer is a disease that causes cells to divide out of control. Normally, the body has systems that prevent cells from dividing out of control. But in the case of cancer, these systems fail. Cancer is usually caused by mutations. Mutations are random errors in genes. Mutations that lead to cancer usually happen to genes that control the cell cycle. Because of the mutations, abnormal cells divide uncontrollably. This often leads to the development of a tumor. A tumor is a mass of abnormal tissue. As a tumor grows, it may harm normal tissues around it. Anything that can cause cancer is called a carcinogen . Carcinogens may be pathogens, chemicals, or radiation. Answer:","completion":"Based on the given information, Jason, who has cancer, has more abnormal cells in his body due to the uncontrolled cell division caused by mutations in the genes that control the cell cycle. Charlotte, with her high blood pressure, does not have a condition that is explicitly caused by abnormal cell division, suggesting that she has fewer abnormal cells in her body compared to Jason."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Plot title: Used Cars Movie plot: The New Deal Used Car lot in Arizona is in danger of being taken over by the Roy L Fuchs car dealership across the roadway where they do business. Both dealerships are run by twin brothers, Roy L Fuchs and Luke Fuchs (both played by Jack Warden). However, Roy L's dealership is easily the more lucrative than his brother's, which deals in often junked used cars.One of New Deal's most prominent salesmen is Ruddy Russo (Kurt Russell), a young man who never shies away from making a deal, and also is planning to run for a seat on the State Senate. Along with Ruddy, there's Jeff (Garrit Graham), a superstitious fellow, and Jim (Frank McRae), the mechanic who is easily excitable.Recently, Luke has been having problems with his heart, much to the delight of his other brother. Roy L sends one of his mechanics over to the lot under the guise of an 'interested party,' and gets Luke to give him a test drive. However, Roy L's mechanic takes Luke on a wild ride during which Luke has a heart attack and dies.Ruddy, Jeff, and Jim try to cover this up by burying Luke in an old Edsel in a service pit out back. When Roy L and his lawyer Sam (Joe Flaherty) show up looking for Luke, Rudy explains that Luke drove to Florida in the Edsel. Roy L believes that Ruddy is lying, but Sam explains that there's no way to disprove this claim.Ruddy goes through with the first of several advertising stunts.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Read the following article and answer the question. Article: When travelers think of an Adriatic cruise, scenes of Venice, Italy--its canals, bridges, piazzas, and stunning architecture--come to mind. It's one of the most popular cruise destinations in Europe. And for many, the sail-away from Venice, through its Giudecca Canal, is an awe-inspiring experience. Venice may be known as La Serenissima, or \\"the most peaceful,\\" which, however, isn't entirely accurate these days. Venetians have been increasingly concerned about the impact of tourism and the potential for an environmental disaster off its shoreline due to the number of cruise ships that enter and exit its lagoon . That's why earlier last month, Venice announced a new policy to forbid the transit of cruise ships to the city via the Giudecca Canal. It's not that the city wants to shun the cruise industry altogether: It simply wants to force traffic further away from the landmarks along the shoreline. City officials say that most ships will now transit the Contorta Sant'Angelo Canal. Additionally, the city is _ the size of ships that can visit Venice, as well as the total number of ships that call on it on a daily basis. As of January 2014, Venice plans to reduce the visitations of larger ships (those that are 40,000 tons or heavier) by 20 percent. This effectively caps the number of ships that can enter per day to five. In November, ships heavier than 96,000 tons will not be allowed to enter Guidecca Canal at all. How the city plans to carry out the new five-ships-per-day rule remains to be seen and have yet to be announced. Which ships will be allowed passage? Will it be first-come, first-served? However they proceed, cruise line executives want their passengers to know that Venice will remain a regular port of call--even if the transit to and from the city must evolve. Question: The new policy was issued in order to _ . Answer: Answer:","completion":"The new policy was issued in order to protect Venice's environment and historical landmarks from the negative impacts of mass tourism and potential environmental disasters associated with large cruise ships. By forbidding the transit of cruise ships through the Giudecca Canal, the city aims to direct the ship traffic further away from the shoreline and preserve its heritage. Additionally, the policy includes limiting the size of ships allowed to visit and reducing the number of daily ship visits to the city. This approach demonstrates the city's commitment to balancing the need for tourism revenue with the preservation of its unique environment and cultural heritage."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is a news article: Philip Lussier and his family are hoping to find out the cause of a disease that has caused nerve and muscular skeletal problems. Philip hits a chip shot in front of his parents Betsy and Phil Lussier and his siblings, Amy and Mark, in their backyard. In medicine, it’s called the diagnostic odyssey: the difficult months and years that patients and families spend trying to figure out the cause of a baffling collection of symptoms. The National Institutes of Health announced Tuesday it will expand its efforts to solve such medical mysteries by creating a network of six centers, including one in Boston, that will each receive 7.2 million over the next four years. Advertisement The new Harvard Center for Integrated Approaches to Undiagnosed Diseases will combine the resources of Brigham and Women’s, Massachusetts General, and Boston Children’s hospitals. A coordinating center at Harvard Medical School will help route patients to centers across the country and facilitate the sharing of data among the programs. The project leaders hope to identify rare diseases that are currently unknown and develop treatments -- and gain insights that might apply to illnesses affecting many more people.

Sign up for more newsletters here “We should be able to generalize what we learn from this to more common diseases in this era of the hope for increasingly personalized and precision medicine,” said Dr. Joseph Loscalzo, chief of medicine at the Brigham. The network is an expansion of a pilot Undiagnosed Diseases Program the NIH launched in 2008 at its Bethesda, Md., campus. Over the past six years, the NIH has been able to study only about 600 of the more than 3,000 children and adults who applied to the program. The Boston center will use techniques that include DNA sequencing and analysis of the microbes present on patients’ skin or in their digestive tracts to discern the root of illnesses of a dozen patients in its first year. The hope is that newer technology, including the ability to search for networks of genes working in concert to cause disease, will improve the odds of finding the cause of a rare disease, which are currently around 25 percent. Advertisement The effort to understand rare, mysterious diseases is nothing new in Boston, where researchers have identified the causes of inherited hearing loss, muscle-weakening disease, and seizures. But Loscalzo said the new center will consolidate those kinds of efforts across institutions and help formalize the process for using cutting-edge technologies to understand patients’ illnesses. The coordination with other centers across the country could help doctors see patterns that would be hard to detect in a single ill patient and strengthen their confidence that a specific gene mutation is connected to a condition. The other centers will be located at Baylor College of Medicine, Duke University, Stanford University, the University of California, Los Angeles, and Vanderbilt University Medical Center. Undiagnosed diseases can take a huge financial and psychological toll on families. Patients often visit many clinics in search of a diagnosis, and having one can be important not only for finding the best treatment, but also for peace of mind and genetic counseling of other family members. “We should not underestimate the value of carrying a diagnosis, because individuals who lack a diagnosis are actually a little suspect in terms of their complaints -- not being trusted by family, friends, employers, and even their doctors,” said Dr. William Gahl, clinical director of the NIH-based Undiagnosed Diseases Program. “If we can take away that element of desperation and have some diagnosis for them even though it’s a bad diagnosis, they’re incredibly grateful and it changes their lives and the lives of their families.” One of the families waiting on a diagnosis are the Lussiers of Milton. From the day Philip was born more than 30 years ago, Betsy and Phil Lussier helplessly watched him struggle with a condition no one could comprehend. Philip was born small and failed to grow -- when he turned one, he still weighed just nine pounds. He developed unexplained gastrointestinal problems, musculo-skeletal issues, and pain, and the Lussiers went to many genetics specialists in the search for a clue about what they were dealing with. As Philip underwent surgeries, went on morphine, and received an evolving series of possible diagnoses that all turned out to be wrong, the uncertainty about what to expect was tremendously difficult. At one point, Betsy joined a support group for parents of children with muscular dystrophy, because it was one of the diagnoses Philip received. Despite the fact that it turned out to be the wrong diagnosis, she stayed in the group for 15 years. “Living like that, not knowing tomorrow or where we were going down the road, it was so much harder than if we had some idea of what we’re dealing with,” Betsy Lussier said. As time went on, things gradually got easier -- Philip is happier today and in less pain. In April, they celebrated his 30th birthday, a day the Lussiers never expected to be able to share with their son. He lives independently with the help of an aide, attends a day program, and comes home to Milton to spend the weekends, amusing his family with his sense of humor and a love of US history and sports. In 2012, the Lussiers made a trip to the undiagnosed diseases program at the NIH to see if the latest genomic analysis could finally reveal what caused Philip’s condition. They aren’t holding their breath for a miracle treatment; instead, the information might help his younger siblings when they think about starting their own families. “It would just be helpful to know if there is something genetic, because it’s a hard life Philip has lived,” Lussier said. “I would choose to have him here with us; he’s taught everybody else so much.” ||||| NIH names new clinical sites in Undiagnosed Diseases Network Four-year, 43 million initiative engages broad expertise in study of mystery conditions The National Institutes of Health has awarded grants to six medical centers around the country to select from the most difficult-to-solve medical cases and together develop effective approaches to diagnose them. The clinical sites will conduct clinical evaluation and scientific investigation in cases that involve patients with prolonged undiagnosed conditions. Each clinical site will contribute local medical expertise to the NIH Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN). The network includes and is modeled after an NIH pilot program that has enrolled people with intractable medical conditions from nearly every state, the District of Columbia and seven foreign countries. The network builds on a program at the NIH Clinical Center in Bethesda, Md., that for the past six years has evaluated hundreds of patients and provided many diagnoses, often using genomic approaches, for rare conditions. “Newly developed methods for genome sequencing now provide us amazingly powerful approaches for deciphering the causes of rare undiagnosed conditions,” said Eric D. Green, M.D., Ph.D., director of the National Human Genome Research Institute. “Along with robust clinical evaluations, genomics will play a central role in the UDN’s mission.” Dr. Green and Story Landis, Ph.D., director of the National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Stroke, co-chair the UDN working group. Undiagnosed diseases are conditions that even skilled physicians cannot diagnose despite extensive clinical investigation. They may not be recognized by doctors because they are rarely seen, are previously undescribed, or are rare forms of more common diseases. The NIH Common Fund awarded four-year grants of approximately 7.2 million (pending available funds) to each of the six medical centers around the country. James M. Anderson, M.D., Ph.D., director of the NIH Division of Program Coordination, Planning, and Strategic Initiatives (DPCPSI), announced in an NIH telebriefing that the six newly awarded sites join a clinical site already established at NIH in pursuing cutting-edge diagnoses. In addition, this past December, NIH selected Harvard Medical School as the UDN Coordinating Center for the multi-institution network. “The NIH Undiagnosed Diseases Network has the potential to transform medicine and serve as a catalyst for new discoveries,” said Dr. Anderson. “It is an ideal NIH Common Fund program—the only one focused on diagnoses of rare disorders.” The following institutions were awarded grants to establish UDN clinical sites: Baylor College of Medicine, Houston; Principal Investigator: Brendan H.L. Lee, M.D., Ph.D. Boston Children's Hospital, Brigham and Women's Hospital, and Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston; Principal Investigator: Joseph Loscalzo, M.D., Ph.D. Duke University, Durham, North Carolina; Principal Investigators: Vandana Shashi, M.D. , and David B. Goldstein, Ph.D. Stanford University, Stanford, California; Principal Investigators: Euan A. Ashley, M.D., D.Phil., Jonathan Bernstein, M.D., Ph.D., and Paul Graham Fisher, M.D. University of California, Los Angeles; Principal Investigators: Eric J. Vilain, M.D., Ph.D., Katrina M. Dipple, M.D., Ph.D., Stanley Nelson, M.D., and Christina Palmer, C.G.C., Ph.D. Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville; Principal Investigators: John A. Phillips, III, M.D., and John H. Newman, M.D. “This type of program can invigorate a medical center anywhere in the country and in the world,” said William A. Gahl, M.D., Ph.D., clinical director at the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), director of the NIH-based Undiagnosed Diseases Program (UDP) and co-coordinator of the UDN working group. “Often, patients have a lot of physical complaints and no objective diagnoses. Our goal is to use the latest tools to make a diagnosis that spans the clinical, pathological and biochemical spectrum to uncover the basic genetic defect.” Since 2008, the UDP has explored this fascinating area of medical research and acquired practical insights in the process of enrolling approximately 600 undiagnosed children and adults in its clinical protocols. The multidisciplinary clinical and research team diagnosed approximately 100 patients (20-25 percent of those evaluated), discovered two unknown diseases and identified 15 genes not previously associated with any other human disease. A combination of genomic and clinical analyses contributed to the diagnoses. By including an additional six clinical sites, the NIH UDN will both draw upon the unique expertise of new clinical research groups and cultivate opportunities for collaboration among a larger group of expert laboratory and clinical investigators. Physicians within the network will collect and share high-quality clinical and laboratory data, including genomic information, clinical observations and documentation of environmental exposures. They also will benefit from common protocols designed to improve the level of diagnosis and care for patients with undiagnosed diseases. “The UDN will look at diseases across all clinical specialties using new tools and methods of analysis for the identification of new diseases,” said Anastasia L. Wise, Ph.D., a program director in NHGRI's Division of Genomic Medicine and co-coordinator of the UDN working group that oversees the development and implementation of the UDN. “The network will facilitate collaboration and shared use of genomic tools among the sites.” Based on the NIH UDP experience, the UDN Coordinating Center at Harvard Medical School has begun paving the way for the new UDN clinical sites to begin accepting patients. Among the coordinating efforts are the preparation of draft protocols and operating guidelines, and the definition of an initial framework of common practices across the network. The network will share systems for data collection and develop common approaches to patient selection, evaluation and diagnosis. Each new clinical site may have variations in handling health insurance coverage for clinical testing and care. However, no patient will be turned away from participation in the UDN based on lack of health insurance coverage. “We believe that there is a substantial unmet demand for the diagnoses of conditions that have perplexed skillful physicians,” said Isaac Kohane, M.D., Ph.D., professor of pediatrics at Harvard Medical School and Boston Children’s Hospital and principal investigator of the Coordinating Center. “We want to address inquiries from physicians and patients throughout the country who require these services and, in doing so, create a 21st century model for diagnosis and treatment in this genomic and information-intensive era.” UDN investigators will share genomic data from UDN patients with the research community through multiple public repositories. Network-wide data sharing will observe standards of patient privacy, confidentiality and management of health information. The network will start up and test its operating procedures during its first year. It will progressively expand recruitment of patients so that by the summer of 2017, the rate of admissions at each new clinical site will be about 50 patients per year. For a period this summer, referrals from clinicians on behalf of undiagnosed patients may continue to be made through the existing NIH application pipeline.

Now the National Institutes of Health is setting up a network of research centers where doctors will examine these unlucky patients, test their genetic codes and swap information on what they find. The hope is that by pooling information and patients, doctors can solve these medical mysteries and perhaps also shed light on more common diseases. “The Undiagnosed Diseases Network that we are announcing today will focus on the rarest of disorders — often those that affect fewer than 50 people in the entire world,” said Dr. Eric Green, director of the National Human Genome Research Institute, one of the NIH institutes. “They are so rare that they may never have been discovered or doctors may never have encountered them.” Sign up for top Health news direct to your inbox. \\"They sent us through ever doctor imaginable.\\" One of the patients who finally got a diagnosis is Louise Benge, 59, from Brodhead, Kentucky. She’s been suffering odd pain since she was 16. “By the time I was in my 20s, the pain in my legs was so bad I had trouble sleeping and lots of trouble walking,” Benge told reporters. Her brothers and sister shared the mysterious affliction. Not only did Benge go to her primary care physician, but she beat paths to the doors of vascular specialists, neurologists and other specialists, too. Then she got into NIH’s early Undiagnosed Diseases Program. “At NIH they sent us through every doctor imaginable,” Benge said. They had CT scans, MRIs, genetic tests and electrocardiograms. Finally, genetic testing showed Benge and her siblings had ACDC, a rare calcification disorder. It causes calcium to build up in the blood vessels of her hands, legs and feet but, luckily, not to the heart. Eventually the calcium completely blocks blood flow, causing pain and forcing the body to grow new vessels to bypass the blockage. Benge and her family members are taking a drug called a bisphosphonate, usually used to treat osteoporosis or brittle bone disease. The hope is it can stop or even reverse the calcium buildup. Louise Benge, 56, Brodhead , Ky., is a patient in the NIH Undiagnosed Diseases Program on Jan. 31, 2011. Jeannine Mjoseth / National Human Genome Research Institute But even if it doesn’t help, Benge may already have benefited, says Dr. William Gahl, who directs NIH’s Undiagnosed Diseases Program. “We should not underestimate the value of hearing a diagnosis,” Gahl said. People with rare diseases have often lived under a veil of suspicion from loved ones, employers and sometimes even their doctors. “How difficult it is to go through life with that element of desperation,’ he said. “Even though it’s a bad diagnosis, they are incredibly grateful and it changes their lives and the lives of their families. Cures and treatments are one thing but changing quality of life is another thing that this program has offered to a number of people.” Rare diseases may each only affect a few people, but collectively they affect about 10 percent of the population, said Dr. James Anderson, director of program coordination at NIH.

Individually, these may be rare conditions, but nearly 30 million Americans— almost one in 10 people—are dealing with the effects of such a condition.” Genome sequencing technology has finally made it possible to find out what’s causing many of these conditions, said Green. “Newly developed methods for genome sequencing now provide us amazingly powerful approaches for deciphering the causes of rare undiagnosed conditions,” he said. “To date, researchers have discovered the genomic bases of more than 5,000 rare genetic disorders, but we are still on the hunt for the cause of an additional 2,000-3,000 single-gene, also called Mendelian, disorders.” What the NIH announced Tuesday is a four-year, 43 million program. Six centers have been given four-year grants of about 7 million each: Baylor College of Medicine, Houston Boston Children's Hospital, Brigham and Women's Hospital, and Massachusetts General Hospital Duke University, Durham, North Carolina Stanford University, California University of California, Los Angeles Vanderbilt University Medical Center The coordinating center is at Harvard Medical School in Boston. The NIH hopes that each center will be seeing 50 patients a year by 2017. “If we find a second patient with that same variant then that pretty much nails it.\\" Up to now, all patients have had to be seen at NIH’s clinical center in Bethesda, Maryland. Even so, the interest has been overwhelming. “We have had about 10,000 inquiries,” Gahl said. About a third have completed applications to go through the program, which is free of charge. NIH has accepted just 750. Getting into the program doesn’t guarantee a diagnosis, much less a potential treatment. “We think we have got a decent diagnosis in about a quarter to 40 percent or so. It’s rough,” Gahl said. But the hope is that getting more people into the program will help. “Patients have many mutations and not clear often which one is causing the symptoms,” Gahl said. “If we find a second patient with that same variant then that pretty much nails it.\\" ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has created a network of six centers, called the Undiagnosed Diseases Network, to help diagnose and treat patients with rare and undiagnosed diseases. The centers will use techniques like DNA sequencing and analysis of patients' microbes to determine the cause of illnesses. By collaborating and sharing data among these programs, the network aims to find the cause of rare diseases and develop treatments, potentially gaining insights that could apply to more common illnesses as well. The focus on undiagnosed diseases aims to relieve the financial and psychological toll they take on families, while also providing a better understanding of rare genetic conditions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: The Buccaneers began their 2008 campaign on the road against their NFC South foe, the New Orleans Saints. In the first quarter, Tampa Bay trailed as Saints QB Drew Brees completed a 39-yard TD pass to WR David Patten. The Bucs would respond with CB Phillip Buchanon returning an interception 26 yards for a touchdown. In the second quarter, Tampa Bay took the lead with kicker Matt Bryant getting a 37-yard field goal. In the third quarter, New Orleans would reply with kicker Mart&#237;n Gram&#225;tica getting a 34-yard field goal, yet the Buccaneers replied with Bryant nailing a 33-yard field goal. Afterwards, the Saints got their lead back with Brees completing an 84-yard TD pass to WR Devery Henderson. In the fourth quarter, Tampa Bay would go ahead again as QB Jeff Garcia completing a 2-yard TD pass to WR Ike Hilliard. However, New Orleans regained the lead after Brees completing a 42-yard TD pass to RB Reggie Bush. Inside the final minute, Garcia drove the Buccaneers to the Saints 24-yard line. Facing 4th down & 6, Garcia threw an interception, and the Saints clinched the victory. With the loss, the Buccaneers began their season at 0-1 and lost on opening day for the third straight year. Question: Which players score the two longest touchdowns of the game? Answer:","completion":"The two players who scored the longest touchdowns of the game were David Patten and Devery Henderson, both from the New Orleans Saints. While verifying this information, these were the steps I followed: 1. First, I went through the text to locate instances where touchdowns were mentioned. 2. I spotted that Drew Brees completed a 39-yard TD pass to WR David Patten in the first quarter. 3. Then I noticed Drew Brees completed an 84-yard TD pass to WR Devery Henderson in the third quarter. 4. I realized that Brees also completed a 42-yard TD pass to RB Reggie Bush in the fourth quarter. 5. Comparing these, it's clear that the 84-yard and 39-yard touchdowns were the longest. Hence, David and Devery were the two players who scored the longest touchdowns of the game. The 42-yard touchdown by Reggie Bush in the fourth quarter came in third and wasn't one of the two longest touchdowns of the game."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The eventual configuration was rare in terms of contemporary fighter aircraft design, with only the preceding Fokker G.1, the contemporary Focke-Wulf Fw 189 Luftwaffe reconnaissance aircraft, and the later Northrop P-61 Black Widow night fighter having a similar planform (aeronautics). The Lockheed team chose twin booms to accommodate the tail assembly, engines, and turbo-superchargers, with a central nacelle for the pilot and armament. The XP-38 gondola mockup was designed to mount two .50-caliber (12.7 mm) M2 Browning machine guns with 200 rounds per gun (rpg), two .30-caliber (7.62 mm) Brownings with 500 rpg, and a T1 Army Ordnance 23 mm (.90 in) autocannon with a rotary magazine as a substitute for the non-existent 25 mm Hotchkiss et Cie aircraft autocannon specified by Kelsey and Saville. In the YP-38s, a M4 cannon with 15 rounds replaced the T1. The 15 rounds were in three five-round clips, an unsatisfactory arrangement according to Kelsey, and the M9 did not perform reliably in flight.

After the funeral of a seven-year-old boy, Lucius Hunt (Joaquin Phoenix) asks the village elders for permission to pass through the woods to get medical supplies from neighboring towns; however, his request is denied. Later, his mother Alice (Sigourney Weaver) admonishes him for wanting to visit the neighboring towns, which the villagers describe as wicked. The Elders also appear to have secrets of their own and keep physical mementos hidden in black boxes, the contents of which are reminders of the evil and tragedy they left behind when they left the towns. After Lucius makes a short venture into the woods, the creatures leave warnings in the form of splashes of red paint on all the villagers' doors. Meanwhile, Ivy Elizabeth Walker (Bryce Dallas Howard)âthe blind daughter of the chief Elder, Edward Walker (William Hurt)âinforms Lucius that she has strong feelings for him, and he returns her affections.

A newly-released 911 tape from the Florida movie theater shooting reveals that the alleged shooter sat and watched the victim die from a gunshot wound to the chest. A frantic call was made from the movie theater in Wesley Chapel, Florida at 1.29pm on January 13 after a shot rang out. A caller is heard on the tape telling the dispatcher 'there’s been a gunshot... it looks like it broke his sternum' with a 'shotgun or pistol'. He also frantically alerts the dispatcher to the fact that the shooter, 'an older gentleman', is still present. Scroll down for audio tape of the harrowing call. Suspected Florida movie theater shooter Curtis Reeves was led away in handcuffs wearing a white jumpsuit after police removed his clothing for evidence. A 911 call released today revealed he had watched as his alleged victim died from a gunshot wound. The dispatcher, from the Pasco County Sheriff's Office, asks: 'Do you know who shot him?' The caller said: 'I don’t know…it looks like an older gentleman in the movie theater.' 'Is he still in there?', says the sheriff's office responder. 'Yes, he is,' comes the callers whispered response. Meanwhile married father-of-one Chad Oulson, 43, was lying on the floor of the movie theater with a gunshot wound to the chest. The 911 caller, who explains that he is a trained nurse, says: 'Looks like there’s blood going through his lungs, so we need someone here fast.' A woman then takes the phone asking: 'Where are they? The pulse is really slow…I can’t feel it anymore.' The dispatcher tries to calm the callers, telling them that help is on the way. At 10 minutes, 11 seconds after the call is placed, police arrive - but it is too late to save Mr Oulson. Devastated: The killing of Chad Oulson, center, has left 22-month-old Lexy, right, without a father and Nicole Oulson a widow. Florida Police Captain Curtis Reeves, Jr., suspected of fatally shooting Chad Oulson, 43, and wounding his wife, Nicole, 33, appears in court wearing a suicide-prevention gown. Curtis Reeves, 71, is charged with second-degree murder in the death of the married father. He is being held without bail at Land O' Lakes jail in Florida. Chad Oulson's widow Nicole. struggled to contain her emotions as she spoke on Thursday about the. day that her husband was shot dead. The couple had gone on a rare date to watch the movie Lone Survivor, leaving their 22-month-old daughter, Lexy, with a babysitter. As Mr Ouslon checked his phone for. any word on his daughter during the previews, another cinema-goer,. retired police officer and father-of-two Curtis Reeves who was sitting behind the couple with his wife, asked him to put it away. An. argument ensued - with some witnesses saying Mr Oulson threw popcorn -. and Reeves shot the father once in the chest. Mrs Oulson was shot. in her hand as she tried to protect her husband. She said that she wants his 'senseless' killer locked up for life. 'He brought an unfair life sentence to me to have to raise our daughter alone,' Nicole Oulson, 33, told Good Morning America in her first live interview. 'To. have to live without the love of my life, for my daughter to have to. grow up without her daddy by her side for graduation and marriage. 'It was so unnecessary. It was for no reason, so I want him behind bars and to be punished for his senseless act.' Heartbroken: Nicole Oulson spoke to Good Morning America on Thursday about the loss of her husband, Chad, who was shot dead in a movie theater last week. She said she wants his killer locked up forever. Lawyers representing the Oulson family. have confirmed that Lexy was unwell and that Chad was keeping a close. eye on his phone in case he and Nicole had to leave early and go to pick. her up. Mrs Oulson said her husband was 'absolutely not' threatening the shooter. 'I. never expected it,' she said. 'I never could have imagined it. There. were a couple of words, no threats, no harm, no nothing.' Her attorney, TJ Grimaldi, joined her. on Good Morning America and said that Reeves might try to use the. controversial 'stand your ground' law for his defense. 'There's just no way that this can stand up in this case,' he said. 'In my opinion it doesn't matter if it was. popcorn, Twizzlers, a hot cup of coffee - there is absolutely no reason. that it should have to escalate like this.' Torn apart: She said the killer left her without the love of her life, Chad, center, and Lexy without a daddy. Now Mrs Oulson said she is just trying to be there for her young daughter. 'She's luckily at a young age... she doesn't know what's going on,' she said. But she knows there are things her husband did she will never be able to replace, such as putting Lexy to bed. 'The. last thing he would say before tucking her in was, \\"You make me so happy,\\" and she would say, \\"Me happy. too, Daddy\\". And those are the times I'll never be able to replace, and that's when it's hard.' Mr Oulson's colleagues at Sky Power Sports have set up a Facebook page to raise money for Nicole and Lexy.

The premise states: In the eastern part of the country, states realized that emissions from sources in other states were significantly contributing to their 1-hour ozone non-attainment problems. The hypothesis states: This has happened in the western part of the country when states realised emissions from other sources were negligible. To evaluate the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis, it is essential to examine the potential connections and discrepancies. Similarities: 1. Both the premise and the hypothesis involve a realisation or recognition by the given states concerning emissions affecting their ozone non-attainment problems. 2. The geographical context indicates the potential for differences in emissions contributions based on location, with the eastern part of the country experiencing significant impacts from other states, and the western part of the country potentially seeing negligible effects. Discrepancies: 1. The premise focuses on a situation where emissions from other states are making a substantial impact on ozone non-attainment problems. In contrast, the hypothesis is discussing a scenario where emissions from other sources are considered negligible. 2. While the premise highlights the eastern part of the country, the hypothesis features the western part. The spatial distinction may lead to differences in population, industrial structures, meteorological patterns, and transportation networks, all of which can influence the emissions contributions and their impact on ozone levels. These factors complicate the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis, making it inappropriate to directly connect the two. To conclude, given the similarities and discrepancies between the premise and the hypothesis, it is not possible to assert that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis. The geographical context, differences in emissions impact, and other regional factors create a complex situation that prevents drawing a direct correlation between the conditions in the eastern and western parts of the country. To make a more accurate conclusion, additional evidence and a deeper analysis of the underlying factors affecting emissions contributions and ozone non-attainment issues across the country would be necessary."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Appointments to the Order of the British Empire were at first made on the nomination of the self-governing Dominions of the Empire, the Viceroy of India, and the colonial governors, as well as on nominations from within the United Kingdom. As the Empire evolved into the Commonwealth, nominations continued to come from the Commonwealth realms, in which the monarch remained head of state. These overseas nominations have been discontinued in realms that have established their own Orders—such as the Order of Australia, the Order of Canada, and the New Zealand Order of Merit—but members of the Order are still appointed in the British Overseas Territories. Any individual made a member of the Order for gallantry could wear an emblem of two crossed silver oak leaves on the same riband, ribbon or bow as the badge. It could not be awarded posthumously and was effectively replaced in 1974 with the Queen's Gallantry Medal.

Q:Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: Gunshots rang out once again on a campus in the United States on Wednesday. Students and faculty raced out of harm's way, ducked under furniture, barricaded doors and hid in interior rooms, bathrooms and labs. The short-lived nightmare on the campus of the University of California, Los Angeles came one day before Wear Orange: National Gun Violence Awareness Day. Wear Orange was inspired by friends of Hadiya Pendleton, a 15-year-old Chicago high school student killed by gunfire in 2013. The group decided to honor her life by wearing orange — the color worn by hunters in the woods to protect themselves and others. While the idea has been embraced by civic organizations, politicians and celebrities, it has been rejected by gun rights advocates. The National Rifle Association has attacked the campaign as \\"pointless,\\" and said \\"participating is an easy way of scoring points for being 'socially conscious.'\\" Here is a look at the unique relationship between Americans and their guns. Any law-abiding citizen in the United States is allowed to own or carry a gun. That right comes from the U.S. Bill of Rights and the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. It says: \\"A well-regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.\\" The Second Amendment was based partially on English common law, which describes an auxiliary right, supporting the natural rights of self-defense, resistance to oppression, and the civic duty to act in concert in defense of the state. To purchase a gun in the majority of states, a person needs to be of age, pass the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check and fill out a firearms transaction record. However, background checks are not currently required for private sales, including those conducted at gun shows. Certain people are banned from owning weapons, including convicted criminals, people with mental health illnesses or non-U.S. citizens. But the system has major holes in it.

Article: Pilar Abel, 58, says she is result of illicit romance between artist and her mother, who worked for family that spent holidays near painter’s home More than two decades after the Spanish surrealist painter Salvador Dalí died, a woman claiming to be his daughter has lodged a paternity suit, asking for help in obtaining DNA evidence to back her claim. Pilar Abel, 58, claims her mother and the artist met in the 1950s when her mother was working for a family that would often spend summers in Cadaqués, close to where Dalí had a home. The pair “had a friendship that developed into clandestine love”, said Abel, in documents presented to a Madrid court. Abel was born in 1956. At the time, Dalí would have been married to Gala, born Elena Ivanovna Diakonova. They married in 1934 and had no children. Driven by her mother’s repeated comments that she was the daughter of Dalí, Abel took a DNA test in Madrid in 2007, using hair and skin remains that she had obtained from a death mask of the painter. The results were inconclusive. She then turned to Dalí’s close friend and official biographer, Robert Descharnes. It was agreed that further DNA testing would be carried out in Paris using medical samples that had belonged to Dalí. Abel said she never received the results of the test. On Thursday, she took her battle to a Madrid court, asking for help in obtaining the results or, if necessary, backing to have another DNA test carried out. If there is insufficient genetic material for the test, the court documents raise the possibility of exhuming Dalí’s remains. Abel’s legal challenge is filed against the heirs of the painter, specifically Spain’s tax office and public administration, as well as the Dalí Foundation. In 2008, Descharnes’ son Nicolas refuted Abel’s paternity claim, saying the doctor who had carried out the paternity tests in Paris had verbally communicated to Abel that the tests were negative. “There is no relationship between this woman and Salvador Dalí,” he told Spanish agency Efe at the time. ||||| A judge has ordered the exhumation of Salvador Dali's body for a biological test to determine the paternity of Maria Pilar Abel Martinez, 61, who claims to be his daughter.

I also call her Lionette, because when she gets angry she roars like the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer lion\\" Gala (Kazan, Russia, 1894 - Portlligat, Girona, 1982) Salvador Dalí's wife and muse, whose real name was Elena Ivanovna Diakonova was a mysterious and highly intuitive woman, which was able to recognise artistic and creative genius when she saw it, and had relations with a number of intellectuals and artists. Nevertheless, the truth iss that very little is known about herpersonality: she had two older brothers, Vadim and Nicolai, a younger sister, Lidia; she spent her childhood in Moscowand her father died when she was eleven years old. Her mother remarried later to a lawyer, with whom Gala related very well and thanks to whom she managed to acquire a good education. She was a brilliant student, completing her studies at the M.G. Brukhonenko academy for young ladies with a very high average mark; a degree from the tsar authorised her to become a primary school teacher and to give lessons in people's homes. In 1912 she suffered a worsening of the tuberculosis that had afflicted her for some time, and her family decided to move her intothe Clavadel sanatorium in Switzerland, where she met Eugène Grindel (later to be known as Paul Eluard). Their similar ages and love for reading made them become good friends. Both were discharged from the sanatorium in 1914.Gala returned to Russia and Eluard went to the war front, but the couple proposed to each other before that. They married in 1917, and the following year was born the girl that was to be Gala's only daughter, Cécile. Eluard, who had already been revealed as poet and had changed his surname, had close relationships with the leading figures of the surrealist movementand in particularl with the creators of the Littérature magazine: André Breton, Philippe Soupault and Louis Aragon. Gala also attended some of their meetings. In 1922 she started a relationship with Max Ernst but they broke up in 1924. Max Ernst painted her in a number of portraits. Also noteworthy was her friendship with the poet René Char, and particularly with René Crevel. It was in 1929 when she first met Salvador Dalí. In April of that year Dalí went to Paris to present the film that he had created with Luis Buñuel, Un chien andalou, and it was there where Camille Goemans, a Belgian poet and gallery owner, introduced Dalí to Paul Eluard. Dalí invited them to spend the summer in Cadaqués. Goemans and a friend of his, as well as René Magritte and his wife, and Luis Buñuel, Paul Eluard and Gala, and the couple's daughter Cécile, all spent some time there. When the painter met Gala it was love at first sight. In his Secret Life, he wrote: \\"She was destined to be my Gradiva (the name comes from the title of a novel by W. Jensen, the main character of which was Sigmund Freud; Gradiva was the book's heroine and it was her who brought psychological healing to the main character), the one who moves forward, my victory, my wife\\". And Gala was indeed to remain forever at the painter's side, so that from that time on her biography was linked with that of Dalí. In 1948, Dalí and Gala returned from the United States after eight years of exile there. Dalí had achieved recognition in his own country, and his father had come to accept his son's relationship with a divorced Russian woman. From that time onwards, the Dalís would spend the spring and summer in Portlligat and the autumn and winter between New York and Paris. In 1958 Dalí and Gala got married at the Àngels chapel, near Girona. In 1968 the painter bought Gala a castle in Púbol, Girona, and it was agreed that the painter could not go there without her prior permission . Between 1971 and 1980, Gala would spend some time at her castle, always during summer. It was there that Gala was buried, after she died in 1982. Since 1996 the castle has been open to the public as the Gala-Dalí Castle House Museum in Púbol. ||||| GIRONA, Spain — Salvador Dalí led the kind of eccentric and sensational lifestyle that might have been expected of one of the greatest Surrealist painters. A quarter century after Dalí’s death, however, Pilar Abel, a tarot card reader, is determined to add another twist to Dalí’s story. She wants a court to recognize her as his daughter — and perhaps grant her a share of the hundreds of millions of euros worth of paintings Dalí bequeathed to the Spanish state upon his death in 1989. According to Ms. Abel’s paternity lawsuit, filed in a Madrid court in March, her mother had a “clandestine love affair” with the painter in the 1950s in Port Lligat, the fishing village where Dalí and his Russian-born wife, Gala, built their waterfront house. Ms. Abel’s mother, Antonia Martínez de Haro, spent several summers in the village, working mostly as a nanny for families living near Dalí’s home. ||||| Image copyright AFP Image caption Dalí died in Spain in 1989 and had no children with his wife A judge in Madrid has ordered the exhumation of the body of Spanish artist Salvador Dalí to get samples for a paternity suit. A Spanish woman, born in 1956, said her mother, a maid, had a clandestine affair with the painter in 1955. The judge said there were no biological remains or personal objects of the artist to be used in the test. He died in Spain in 1989 at the age of 85. The Dalí Foundation, which manages the artist's estate, says it will appeal. The surrealist painter was buried in the theatre and museum he designed himself, in his home town of Figueres in the north-eastern Catalonia region. Maria Pilar Abel Martínez, a tarot card reader who was born in Girona, made the paternity claim for the first time in 2015. Image copyright AFP/EPA Image caption Ms Martínez claims that her mother had an affair with the world-famous painter She said her mother, Antonia, had worked for a family that spent time in Cadaqués, next to where the painter had a home. Antonia left her job in 1955, moved to a different city and married another man. Ms Martínez claimed that her mother told her several times that Dalí was her father, on many occasions in front of others. \\"The only thing I'm missing is a moustache,\\" she once said, according to newspaper El Mundo (in Spanish). At the time of the alleged affair, Dalí was married to his muse Gala, born Elena Ivanovna Diakonova. The couple had no children. Image caption Salvador Dalí is best known for his surrealist works The decision also cites that Ms Martínez underwent two paternity tests, both in 2007, but never received the results. Her legal action is against the Spanish state, to which Dalí left his estate. If she is confirmed to be the artist's daughter, she could use his surname and be entitled to part of his estate - but Spanish media say she would have to legally request it. Ms Martínez's lawyer said there was no date for the exhumation, but that it could happen as soon as July. The Dalí Foundation said in a statement that an appeal would \\"be lodged in the coming days.\\" Other notable exhumations Richard III: When a skeleton was found underneath a Leicester car park in 2012, archaeologists hoped they may have found the last Plantagenet king. The next year, it was confirmed the bones did belong to Richard III, who was killed in battle in 1485. The monarch was interred in a more fitting location - that of Leicester Cathedral - in 2015. Lech Kaczynski: It did not take long for the rumours to start after the Polish president and a number of other senior figures - including the country's army chief, central bank governor, MPs and leading historians - were killed in a plane crash in 2010. But it took another six years for their bodies to be exhumed. And when they did, what they found was nothing less than baffling. The remains had been mixed up - with Mr Kaczynski's coffin containing the bodies of two other people. Nelson Mandela's children: As the South African president lay dying in 2013, three of the children who predeceased him were in the process of being exhumed. It was the second time the bodies had been dug up: Mr Mandela's grandson Mandla had first moved them from the family graveyard in 2011, allegedly without the family's consent. Pablo Neruda: The Nobel prize-winning Chilean poet was exhumed in 2013, 40 years after he died of prostate cancer. It was rumoured Neruda - whose death came days after the military coup which brought General Augusto Pinochet to power - may have been poisoned. The exhumation did not find any poison, but did find an unexplained bacterial infection before he was reburied in 2016. Lots of people in Madagascar: Some people on the African island exhume their relatives as an act of love and respect. And finally... a goose: Police in Hertfordshire exhumed the body of a goose, investigating allegations it was shot dead at point-blank range. A post-mortem found he had died of natural causes. ||||| What is a summary?","completion":"Pilar Abel, a 58-year-old Spanish tarot card reader, has lodged a paternity suit alleging she is the daughter of globally renowned artist Salvador Dalí. She claims her mother had a secret love affair with the surrealist painter in the 1950s while working for a family that spent summers near Dalí's home. To back her claim, Abel sought DNA evidence first in 2007 using hair and skin remains from the artist's death mask, which gave inconclusive results. Then she sought further testing with the help of Dalí's biographer, Robert Descharnes, using stored medical samples of the artist. The results of these tests, however, were never shared with her. Therefore, Abel has now approached a Madrid court to obtain these results or facilitate another DNA test. The case proceedings may even lead to the exhumation of Dalí’s remains if there’s insufficient genetic material for testing.

They can be glass, stones, porcelain, seashells, or whatever else you can find. You will also want to gather together any objects you might want to include. These could include buttons, bones, metals, etc. If you can, find them already precut into distinct shapes and sizes. This will keep you from having to break them with a hammer/saw later. Choose a wide variety of colors and shades. Even if your work will be mostly monochromatic, you will want varying values and ones. Choose tesserae that goes with the art you wish to create. For example, if you are doing a beach scene, it might be best to use a wide variety of shells. If you are looking to recreate the Brooklyn Bridge, you might want to look into metals. Tables, planters, birdbaths, or walking stones are just a few ideas to use. You can make almost anything work as a base. Wood, terracotta and/or glass are usually what people use as a base. Make sure the base is strong enough to hold the weight of the tesserae and grout. Choose bases which have large, open spaces. If there are numerous crevices on your base, it may be hard to create mosaic pieces which will fit. Find patterns for free online or use your imagination and come up with your own design. For a first time project, you may wish to work with a simple pattern. This could mean a house, a fish, a landscape, or anything else with simply defined shapes. After you work on a simple pattern, you can graduate up to more complicated projects. Print out the pattern to the dimensions needed. Begin transferring the design, first using a pencil. This will allow you to adjust for mistakes and inconsistencies. Once you have a rough outline with a pencil, go back and trace over the lines with a pen or marker, depending on the type of base. If you are using a basic design, this might be the time to add in details that are not present in the original design. If the pattern is extra large, do it in sections. Remember this is a rough outline, which can be changed when you start to lay down specific tiles. If you are using an original design, simply draw it directly onto the base. However, don't over plan. Spontaneity is key to creating artistically stunning art. Summary:","completion":"Mosaic art is made with little pieces called tesserae, which can be made from things like glass, stones, and even seashells. You can also use other items like buttons and metals. You'll need to pick tesserae and items that match what you're trying to make, like shells for a beach scene. You need a sturdy base to put your mosaic on, and you can use stuff like tables or walking stones. The base should be mostly flat so your mosaic fits. You also need a pattern, which can be totally made up by you or found on the internet. Start by sketching your pattern with a pencil so you can fix mistakes, then trace it with a pen.

I recently spent a weekend at the [Hotel Name], and I am sad to say that my stay was far from the pleasant experience I had hoped for. Arriving on a Friday evening after several hours of travel, my first encounter with the hotel's staff was a receptionist who seemed indifferent to my arrival and more focused on finishing a phone conversation with a friend. Check-in took far longer than necessary due to the receptionist struggling to locate my reservation, despite the fact that I had both a printed confirmation and provided the booking reference number. Eventually, after much frustration and confusion, I was finally given the keys to my room. Upon entering the room, I was disappointed to find that the accommodation seemed nothing like the luxurious pictures featured on the hotel's website. The room was small, dimly lit, and had a musty odor that suggested poor ventilation. The carpet was heavily stained, and some areas were even torn. The walls sported a tired, faded paint job and were marred by scuffs and marks. The bed, which was advertised as a comfortable, high-quality mattress, was in fact lumpy and very uncomfortable, leading to restless nights and little sleep. The linens were rough, and I was only provided with a thin, insubstantial blanket that did little to keep me warm in the chilly room. The bathroom was no better. The showerhead was poorly fitted, resulting in weak water pressure and an uneven spray that made showering an unsatisfying experience. The towels, like the bed linens, were rough and lacked an adequate level of softness. To make matters worse, the room was not well-soundproofed, and I was consistently disturbed by noise from neighboring rooms and the hallway. During my stay, I visited the hotel's restaurant in the hopes of finding some solace in a good meal. Sadly, the dining experience also fell short of expectations. The menu was limited, and the food I ordered was bland and unappetizing. The service was slow and unprofessional, and the high price of the meals felt unjustified given the overall quality. Throughout my stay, I encountered several staff members who were dismissive and unhelpful. Despite my numerous complaints regarding the room's many shortcomings, very little was done to rectify the situation or ensure a more comfortable stay. The general atmosphere of the hotel seemed to lack warmth and hospitality, making it an unwelcoming place to stay. In conclusion, my stay at the [Hotel Name] was an undeniably negative experience, and I cannot in good faith recommend this establishment to others. The poor service, substandard accommodations, and all-around disappointing experience have led me to decide that I will not be returning to this hotel in the future."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Article: In the past ten years, many scientists have studied the differences between men and women. And they all got the same answer: The sexes are different, because their brains are different. And this, the scientists say, makes men and women see the world in different ways. Boys, for example, generally are better than girls at mathematical ideas. Boys also generally are better than girls at the kind of hand and eye movements necessary for ball sports. Girls, on the other hand generally start speaking earlier than boys. And they generally see better in the dark than boys and are better at learning foreign languages. What makes men and women better at one thing or another? The answer is the brain. The brain has two sides connected by nerve tracks. The left side generally is used for mathematics, speech and writing. The right side is used for artistic creation and the expression for emotions . In men and women, different areas in each side of the brain develop differently. In boys, for example, it's the area used for mathematics. In girls, it is the area used for language skills.

Jimbob Blakey wasn't so much given birth to as clambered right out of his mother himself. He weighed in at almost thirteen pounds, came ready-fitted with a shock of fat black hair and a couple of razor teeth. Jimbob's folks loved him like most folks love their little ones, maybe more. They'd been trying so hard for a child, suffered more mid-term miscarriages than the ewes they shuttled off to market most Thursdays. They dressed him in a one-year babygro and took him home to their hill farm. They fought to get up nights and give him his milk. His teeth made breast-feeding impossible. They sat hours gazing down in his cot. They dressed him fine and took him to their church and gave their thanks. Showed him off like the proud parents they were. Others cooed and smiled. But they never asked to hold. They gave thanks the Blakeys were happy, and that the monkey-baby had not been born to them. Jimbob's folks never gave a second thought that their boy might be different. The first Spring he walked, he stomped the moors in his welly-boots helping herd the pregnant ewes down in-by. He copied his father, kicking and cuffing at the stragglers, when the flock was returned to the hills in May. As Jimbob grew, his hair became thicker, his arms longer. His head shrunk down on his shoulders. At check-ups, nurses fixed smiles and pronounced him healthy. Doctors said, 'he'll make you a strapping lad.' His mother smiled, her heart swelled. When he was three, she sent him to nursery. She wanted him to mix with other kids. To taste life off the hard hills. She said, 'it'll do him the world of good.' Jimbob hated leaving the farm. He clung to his mother. She drove away, blinking tears. On the third day, she took a phone call. 'It's Jimbob,' they said. 'He's scaring the other kids.'The truth hit Jimbob's mother like a hammer. According to the above context, answer the following question. what is probably true about jimbob? The answer is:","completion":"Jimbob is probably different from other children, both in appearance and behavior. Due to his unique characteristics, such as larger size, thick black hair, razor teeth, and long arms, people might find him intimidating or unusual. He also had an inclination towards farm life and was not comfortable with leaving the farm for nursery.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Erich Mielke was born in a tenement in Berlin-Wedding, Kingdom of Prussia, German Empire, on 28 December 1907. During the First World War, the neighborhood was known as \\"Red Wedding\\" due to many residents' Marxist militancy. In a handwritten biography written for the Soviet secret police, Mielke described his father as \\"a poor, uneducated woodworker,\\" and said that his mother died in 1911. Both were, he said, members of the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD). In February 1992, Mielke was put on trial for the first degree murders of Captains Anlauf and Lenck as well as the attempted murder of Senior Sergeant Willig. The evidence for Mielke's guilt was drawn from the original police files, the 1934 trial transcripts, and a handwritten memoir in which Mielke had admitted that, \\"the Bulowplatz Affair,\\" had been his reason for fleeing Germany. All had been found in Mielke's house safe during a police search in 1990. Mielke was believed to have kept the files for purposes of \\"blackmailing Honecker and other East German leaders.\\" Former Associated Press reporter and White House Press Secretary John Koehler also testified about how Mielke had boasted of his involvement in the Bulowplatz murders during a confrontation at Leipzig in 1965. During his trial, Mielke appeared increasingly senile, admitting his identity but otherwise remaining silent, taking naps, and showing little interest in the proceedings. In a widely publicized incident, Mielke appeared to mistake the presiding judge for a prison barber. When a journalist for Der Spiegel attempted to interview him in Plotzensee Prison, Mielke responded, \\"I want to go back to my bed\\" (German: \\"Ich mochte in mein Bett zuruck.\\"). Opinion was divided whether Mielke was suffering from senile dementia or was pretending in order to evade prosecution. After twenty months of one-and-a-half hour daily sessions, Erich Mielke was convicted on two counts of murder and one of attempted murder. On 26 October 1993, a panel of three judges and two jurors sentenced him to six years' imprisonment. In pronouncing sentence, Judge Theodor Seidel, told Mielke that he \\"will go down in history as one of the most fearsome dictators and police ministers of the 20th century.\\" Did the interview happen","completion":"Yes, the interview with the journalist from Der Spiegel did happen. While Erich Mielke was in Plotzensee Prison, the journalist tried to talk to him, but Mielke only responded by saying, \\"I want to go back to my bed\\" (German: \\"Ich mochte in mein Bett zuruck.\\"). This showed that Mielke was either genuinely confused and possibly dealing with senile dementia, or he was pretending in order to avoid answering questions and facing the consequences of his actions."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: All I Want is the first solo studio album by The Reverb Junkie - producer moniker for musician Michelle Chamuel.

Of Bill and Barack Bill Clinton takes to the Charlotte stage Wednesday night to do what he does best—talk . . . about the virtues of Democratic economics. He'll certainly make a better witness than President Obama, and his goal will be to burnish the last four dreary years with fonder memories of the 1990s. Which means it's a good moment to remind everyone about the real economic history of the Clinton years, and why the results differ so much from those of Obamanomics. Aside from Barack Obama, Bill Clinton is perhaps the Democratic party's most prominent figure. WSJ's Naftali Bendavid checks in on Mean Street, previewing Clinton's address to DNC delegates tonight. Photo: Associated Press. In the nostalgic Democratic telling, Mr. Clinton got elected, raised taxes on the rich in 1993 to close the budget deficit and reduce interest rates, and thus kicked off one of the great booms in history. The truth is very different, starting with the fact that there really were two Clinton economic Presidencies. Much like Mr. Obama, in his first two years the Arkansan bowed to the priorities of House Democrats and tried to govern from the left. He raised income and gas taxes while trying to impose a BTU energy tax, a government takeover of health care (HillaryCare) and a 31 billion stimulus, but putting off welfare reform. Unlike Mr. Obama, Mr. Clinton failed to get his main agenda other than a tax hike through a Democratic Congress. This turned out to be an economic blessing for the country because it didn't weigh on growth, and a political benefit for Mr. Clinton, who didn't have to defend an unpopular agenda in 1996. Republicans rode opposition to the early Clinton agenda to take Congress in 1994, and that's when the second Clinton Presidency began. Mr. Clinton moved sharply to the political middle. Remember \\"triangulation\\"? He embraced the goal of a balanced budget, using it to outmaneuver Newt Gingrich and Republicans over a government shutdown. After two vetoes and shortly before the 1996 election, he signed a GOP welfare reform. As for economic growth, Mr. Clinton inherited an economy that grew 3.4% in 1992, including 4.3% in the fourth quarter. The expansion stumbled in the first nine months of 1993, no doubt in part due to the uncertainty of the Clinton tax hike. In 1994 stocks were flat and interest rates actually rose throughout the year, peaking on the very day in 1994 that Republicans took Congress. As the nearby chart shows, that's when the real 1990s boom began. On policy, the rest of the decade was defined by a virtuous Beltway gridlock. Washington did little to interfere with private investment, and Congress even helped by restraining spending growth. Only toward the end of the decade did both parties began to spend like politicians again as surpluses rolled in. Consider the policy contrasts between Messrs. Clinton and Obama. Under Mr. Clinton, federal outlays as a share of the economy fell to 18.2% of GDP in 2000 from 21.9% in 1992. Nearly two percentage points of that was from the post-Cold War cut in defense spending, but domestic spending also fell as a share of the economy. For his part, Mr. Obama has presided over the largest spending binge since World War II, increasing outlays to 25.2% of GDP in 2009 and close to 24% of GDP for the next three years despite an economic recovery. Deficits have been above 1 trillion for four years. Mr. Clinton did raise the top income-tax rate to 39.6% from 31% in 1993, and Democrats credit that with shrinking the deficit. But even two years after that tax hike, the Congressional Budget Office was estimating annual deficits of 200 billion a year. Only as rapid growth continued in the later part of the decade did the deficits vanish. President Barack Obama and former President Bill Clinton in June Meanwhile, Mr. Clinton agreed to cut the capital-gains tax rate to 20% from 28% in 1997. Revenue rushed into the Treasury as investors cashed in their pent-up gains. Mr. Obama says he only wants to return to the Clinton-era tax rates, but he's already raised investment tax rates by 3.8 percentage points as part of Obamacare. Combined with the expiration of the Bush rates, that would leave some tax rates higher than in the 1990s. Arguably the most memorable phrase (not related to a scandal) that Bill Clinton uttered during his Presidency came in his 1996 State of the Union address: \\"The era of big government is over.\\" And for a few years, it was over. By contrast, Mr. Obama's four years have been spent expanding the government willy-nilly—with more spending, the promise of higher taxes, and intervention across the economy. His only economic plan now is still-more spending. So as Mr. Clinton tries to lay hands on Mr. Obama and rewrite the history of the 1990s, the real story isn't how much policy the two Democrats have in common. What matters is what they did differently. Bill Clinton learned from the mistakes of his first two years. Mr. Obama has doubled down on his—and, on all available evidence, he will double down again if he's re-elected. A version of this article appeared September 5, 2012, on page A16 in the U.S. edition of The Wall Street Journal, with the headline: Of Bill and Barack. What are the most important parts of this text?","completion":"1. The article discusses the economic policies of Bill Clinton and Barack Obama during their respective presidencies and contrasts their policies and the outcomes of them. 2. It suggests that Bill Clinton initially tried to govern left-leaning policies including tax hikes and attempted healthcare reform, which didn't pass through the Congress. However, failing to get his full agenda through became something of an economic boon, as the article argues that it prevented policies that might have hindered growth. 3. Clinton then pivoted towards the center, embracing a balanced budget and welfare reform, which according to the article helped fuel an economic boom. This period also saw restrained government spending and decreased federal outlays as portions of the GDP. 4. In contrast, the article asserts that Obama's tenure was marked by substantial spending and increased federal outlays as a portion of the GDP. The fiscal deficits remained over the 1 trillion mark for four years under his leadership. 5. Clinton’s agreement to cut the capital-gains tax rate also had a beneficial effect on revenue, whereas Obama has already raised investment tax rates. 6. Clinton's best-remembered phrase from his presidency is quoted: \\"The era of big government is over\\", contrasting this to Obama's expansion of government influence and spending. 7. The conclusion the article draws is that while both are Democrats, the significant economic differences between their presidencies lie in their approach to fiscal policies, spending, and government's role in the economy. While Clinton learned from his initial mistakes and adjusted his policies, Obama has continued down the path of his initial policy choices."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers: Urinalysis (urine analysis) often provides clues to renal disease. Normally, only traces of protein are found in urine, and when higher amounts are found, damage to the glomeruli is the likely basis. Unusually large quantities of urine may point to diseases like diabetes mellitus or hypothalamic tumors that cause diabetes insipidus. The color of urine is determined mostly by the breakdown products of red blood cell destruction (Figure 25.2). The “heme” of hemoglobin is converted by the liver into water-soluble forms that can be excreted into the bile and indirectly into the urine. This yellow pigment is urochrome. Urine color may also be affected by certain foods like beets, berries, and fava beans. A kidney stone or a cancer of the urinary system may produce sufficient bleeding to manifest as pink or even bright red urine. Diseases of the liver or obstructions of bile drainage from the liver impart a dark “tea” or “cola” hue to the urine. Dehydration produces darker, concentrated urine that may also possess the slight odor of ammonia. Most of the ammonia produced from protein breakdown is converted into urea by the liver, so ammonia is rarely detected in fresh urine. The strong ammonia odor you may detect in bathrooms or alleys is due to the breakdown of urea into ammonia by bacteria in the environment. About one in five people detect a distinctive odor in their urine after consuming asparagus; other foods such as onions, garlic, and fish can impart their own aromas!

Ong speculated that they had \\"jammed their way\\" in. Perhaps the terrorists stabbed the flight attendants to get a cockpit key, to force one of them to open the cockpit door, or to lure the captain or first officer out of the cockpit. Or the flight attendants may just have been in their way. At the same time or shortly thereafter, Atta-the only terrorist on board trained to fly a jet-would have moved to the cockpit from his business-class seat, possibly accompanied by Omari. As this was happening, passenger Daniel Lewin, who was seated in the row just behind Atta and Omari, was stabbed by one of the hijackers-probably Satam al Suqami, who was seated directly behind Lewin. Lewin had served four years as an officer in the Israeli military. He may have made an attempt to stop the hijackers in front of him, not realizing that another was sitting behind him. The hijackers quickly gained control and sprayed Mace, pepper spray, or some other irritant in the first-class cabin, in order to force the passengers and flight attendants toward the rear of the plane. They claimed they had a bomb. About five minutes after the hijacking began, Betty Ong contacted the American Airlines Southeastern Reservations Office in Cary, North Carolina, via an AT&T airphone to report an emergency aboard the flight. This was the first of several occasions on 9/11 when flight attendants took action outside the scope of their training, which emphasized that in a hijacking, they were to communicate with the cockpit crew. The emergency call lasted approximately 25 minutes, as Ong calmly and professionally relayed information about events taking place aboard the airplane to authorities on the ground. At 8:19, Ong reported:\\"The cockpit is not answering, somebody's stabbed in business class-and I think there's Mace-that we can't breathe-I don't know, I think we're getting hijacked.\\" She then told of the stabbings of the two flight attendants. At 8:21, one of the American employees receiving Ong's call in North Carolina, Nydia Gonzalez, alerted the American Airlines operations center in Fort Worth, Texas, reaching Craig Marquis, the manager on duty. Marquis soon realized this was an emergency and instructed the airline's dispatcher responsible for the flight to contact the cockpit.

Does the sentence \\"The First World War began in 1914 and lasted to the final Armistice in 1918.\\" answer the question \\"What were the Allied powers referred to before 1917?\\"","completion":"No, the sentence \\"The First World War began in 1914 and lasted to the final Armistice in 1918.\\" does not answer the question \\"What were the Allied powers referred to before 1917?\\" This sentence only provides information about the timeframe of the First World War. It does not mention anything about the Allied powers or their name before 1917. To answer the question, we need to provide information about the names or terms used for the Allied powers in World War I before 1917. The Allied powers, also known as the Entente Powers, were comprised of countries that opposed the Central Powers (Germany, Austria-Hungary, and the Ottoman Empire) in World War I. Before the entry of the United States into the war in 1917, the major members of the Allied powers were France, Russia, and the United Kingdom, along with other smaller countries such as Belgium, Serbia, and Italy, which joined the Allies in 1915. Before 1917 and the United States' involvement in the war, the Allied powers were typically referred to as the Triple Entente. The Triple Entente was a term used to describe the alliance between France, Russia, and the United Kingdom, which was formed by a series of diplomatic agreements in the early 20th century. The formation of the Triple Entente was a response to the Triple Alliance, a similar agreement that brought together Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Italy. The term \\"Entente\\" was derived from the French word \\"entente cordiale,\\" which means \\"cordial understanding\\" or \\"friendly agreement.\\" The agreements that formed the Triple Entente sought to solidify friendships, reduce tensions, and promote cooperation between the three major powers. The Entente was not a formal military alliance but rather an understanding between countries that they would support each other in case of conflict involving the Triple Alliance. Italy's entry into the war on the side of the Allies in 1915 added another major power to the Triple Entente, though the term itself did not change to reflect the added partner. Importantly, the broader collective of countries fighting against the Central Powers was still referred to as the Allied powers or the Entente Powers during this time. In summary, before 1917, the main countries of the Allied powers were called the Triple Entente, which highlighted the alliance between France, Russia, and the United Kingdom. While the specific sentence provided does not answer the question relating to the Allied powers' name before 1917, having this background information about the Entente and the evolution of the alliance throughout World War I provides a more comprehensive response."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Does it follow that \\"National savings in 22.\\"? Pick from: [1]. yes [2]. it is not possible to tell [3]. no","completion":"Based on the information provided, it is not possible to accurately assert that the national savings in 22 will follow the statement \\"National savings in 22.\\" without sufficient data and context surrounding the assumptions made in the simulation. First, it is essential to understand the variables and factors that might affect the national savings rate. National savings is the sum of private savings (composed of individual and business savings) and government savings. Various factors, such as economic growth, inflation, interest rates, fiscal policies, and social behaviors, play a crucial role in shaping the national savings rate over time. It is mentioned that a reference point was simulated assuming that national saving remains constant at the 2000 level of 18. However, holding the national savings constant at the 2000 level overlooks the multiple factors that could drastically affect the savings rate between 2000 and 22 years later. As an example, consider the following scenarios: 1. If there is significant economic growth between 2000 and 22, both private and government savings may increase due to higher income levels and increased tax revenue, respectively. As a result, national savings could be higher in 22 compared to the 2000 level. 2. Conversely, if there is an economic downturn during the same period, national savings might be lower than the 2000 level. High inflation or negative interest rates might discourage people from saving, and worsening fiscal balances may lead to increased government borrowing or spending, reducing government savings. 3. Additionally, changes in fiscal policy, such as introducing a new tax regime or altering government spending plans, could have significant implications for national savings, both positively and negatively. Considering these factors and many others that could occur during a 22-year period, it is not possible to determine the accuracy of the statement \\"National savings in 22.\\" solely based on the reference point information provided. Therefore, the appropriate answer would be [2]. it is not possible to tell."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

In addition, Democrats cheered a turnout that could have major implications for next year's congressional midterm elections, when all 435 House seats and one-third of the Senate will be on the ballot. Democrats are pointing to exit polls in both Virginia and New Jersey that showed that anger at Trump was a major factor in stimulating Democrats to get to the polls. They also note Democratic gains in the battle for state delegate seats in Virginia, another sign of grass-roots enthusiasm that could help Democrats in races for lower-level offices across the country. In New Jersey, Governor-elect Phil Murphy, a Democrat, saw his election as a direct rebuke of the Republican president. \\"New Jersey sent an unmistakable message to the entire nation. We are better than this!\\" Murphy told cheering supporters at his victory rally. In Virginia, Democrat Ralph Northam defeated Republican Ed Gillespie in a campaign that focused, in part, on Trump and his policies, especially on immigration. At a news conference Wednesday, Northam said his victory showed that Virginians had a message for the country and the world. \\"The divisiveness, the hatred, the bigotry, the politics that is tearing this country apart, that is not the United States of America that people love and it certainly not the Commonwealth of Virginia that they love,\\" he said. Political analysts said Democratic enthusiasm and a focus on Trump were clearly on display in both states. \\"We have heard for months and months about all this energy on the left. It had not materialized until tonight,\\" said Steve Peoples of the Associated Press. \\"A big night for Democrats and, really, it was a repudiation of sorts of the Trump nationalist message.\\" Even some Republicans saw the results as a rejection of the Trump political brand. Representative Scott Taylor of Virginia told the New York Times that he believes the president's \\"divisive...
