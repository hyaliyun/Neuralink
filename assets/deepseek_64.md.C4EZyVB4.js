The systems that control U.S. military drones have been infected with a computer virus, a U.S. defense official confirmed to CNN on Monday. Despite the infection of the classified program, the virus has not \\"stopped flights worldwide,\\" the official said. The official declined to comment on how the systems were infected nor whether the virus has resisted attempts to remove it. The infection was first reported by Noah Shachtman for Wired magazine last week. \\"Military officials are more concerned than panicked by this virus. They're just really not sure what's going on. They're not sure if it's a deliberate attack. They're not sure if it's something accidental,\\" he said. While drones are flown on missions in war zones such as Iraq and Afghanistan, the actual \\"cockpit\\" of the unmanned aircraft is on U.S. soil -- the operators work at Nevada's Creech Air Force Base. According to Wired, the virus, which records pilot key strokes, was first detected about two weeks ago. Tech specialists are unsure whether it was installed intentionally, Wired reported. Shachtman said the military has had a hard time wiping out the virus. \\"They're tried over and over again to get rid of this thing using some fairly conventional methods, and they haven't worked. And so it seems the only thing to get rid of this virus is to basically wipe the hard drives of these computers entirely and sort of rebuild the computers from scratch,\\" he said. But that can be an exhausting process. In 2008, removable hard drives introduced a virus into thousands of Defense Department computers, and to this day the Pentagon is still purging some machines. In the case of the computers that help coordinate the drones, care also has to be taken to back up all the information so it isn't lost during rebuilding. U.S. drone strikes have been responsible for the deaths of dozens of suspected militants. In recent years, the United States has sharply increased its used of unmanned planes to target insurgents in Pakistan's tribal region, a volatile area bordering war-torn Afghanistan. The covert CIA drone program has been deeply unpopular with many Pakistanis, who say the attacks kill civilians and violate their country's sovereignty. In August, a drone attack killed al Qaeda No. 2 Atiya Abdul Rahman in Pakistan. The most recent high-profile drone strike resulted in the death of U.S.-born militant cleric Anwar al-Awlaki in Yemen last month. Unmanned aerial vehicles have become indispensable for military planners who depend on constant combat air patrols. But current and former Pentagon officials admit the technology cuts both ways. At the confirmation hearing for Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, former Deputy Defense Secretary William Lynn said bluntly, \\"In the 21st century, bits and bytes can be as threatening as bullets and bombs.\\" He said even the National Defense University has been breached, and in a single intrusion this year 24,000 files were taken from a defense company. \\"Some of the stolen data is mundane, like the specifications for small parts of tanks, airplanes and submarines. But a great deal of it concerns our most sensitive systems, including avionics, surveillance technologies, satellite communications systems and network security protocols,\\" he said. Perhaps most alarming, Lynn admitted that up till now, the U.S. military had been unable to secure its systems. \\"Current countermeasures have not stopped this outflow of sensitive information,\\" Lynn said. \\"We need to do more to guard our digital storehouses of design innovation.\\" Officials have not yet determined whether the virus introduced into the drone program is benign, or doing actual harm. An investigation is ongoing. Despite the fact the controls are not linked into any outside network, and therefore seemingly impervious to intrusion, the drone systems do have security issues. Shachtman said they still use external hard drives, and when they're attached to top-secret computers they can open them up to infection. He said the true danger of the virus comes not from an ability to \\"bring down a drone,\\" which is unlikely, but from an erosion of trust. If officials come to think that the information they're receiving from the unmanned vehicles has been compromised, they're much less likely to view it as safe and valuable, he surmised.

Translate to English English:","completion":"Insufficient nutrition reduces the effectiveness of the immune system. Insufficient nutrition refers to the lack of adequate nutrients and energy sources necessary for the proper functioning of the body. A balanced and varied diet is crucial to maintaining a healthy immune system and overall well-being. Several factors contribute to the relationship between nutrition and the immune system's effectiveness. Firstly, malnutrition can impair the production and activity of white blood cells, which are essential for defending the body against infections and diseases. White blood cells, also known as leukocytes, are responsible for attacking and neutralizing various pathogens, such as bacteria, viruses, and other harmful microorganisms. A weakened immune response due to an insufficient diet can result in increased vulnerability to infections. Secondly, micronutrients play a vital role in the proper functioning of the immune system. Vitamins and minerals, such as vitamin A, C, D, E, B6, B12, folic acid, zinc, selenium, iron, and copper, contribute to the normal development of immune cells, the production of antibodies, and the regulation of inflammatory responses. Deficiencies in these micronutrients can compromise the immune system, making an individual more prone to infections and other health issues. In addition, a healthy gut microbiome is crucial for maintaining a strong immune system. The gut microbiome consists of trillions of bacteria, fungi, and other microorganisms that live in the digestive tract. Insufficient nutrition can negatively impact the balance of these microorganisms, leading to imbalances and compromising the gut's ability to protect against pathogens, as well as promoting inflammation. Furthermore, excessive intake of unhealthy fats, sugars, and processed foods can not only lead to nutrient deficiencies but also cause chronic inflammation. Chronic inflammation raises the risk of developing various disorders, including autoimmune diseases, asthma, allergies, and cardiovascular diseases. An imbalanced diet may also exacerbate existing health issues, further lowering the immune system's effectiveness. In summary, insufficient nutrition can have a detrimental effect on the immune system. A weakened immune response due to lack of adequate nutrients and energy sources may result in increased vulnerability to infections, hampered production and activity of white blood cells, a deficiency in vital micronutrients, an imbalance of the gut microbiome, and chronic inflammation. Therefore, it is essential to follow a balanced and varied diet to support a healthy immune system and overall well-being."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Paragraph: For much of the world, the Algarve is synonymous with Portugal, yet the Portuguese will tell you the exact opposite: the region has little in common with the rest of the country. The southern stretch of coast is more reminiscent of a North African landscape than a European one. It has no cosmopolitan cities, like Lisbon and Porto, which are farther north. Most of Portugal is known for quaint towns, medieval castles, and grand palaces. The Algarve is more recognizable for impenetrable blocks of tourist apartments, hotels, and meticulously manicured golf courses. And beaches. Think Algarve and the mind pictures long, glorious stretches of golden sands, secluded coves framed by odd ochre-colored rock formations, and deep green waters. With about 160 km (100 miles) of coastline, Portugal's southern province is one of Europe's premier beach destinations. The occasionally chilly ocean is the Atlantic, but the Algarve has a sultry Mediterranean feel. Its consistent climate is the best in Portugal, and one of the kindest in the world: more than 250 days of sunshine a year — more than almost any other international resort area. The moderating effect of the Gulf Stream produces a fresh springtime breeze throughout winter, and in late January and February, white almond blossoms blanket the fields. In summer the heat is intense but rarely unbearable, and regardless, beautiful beaches and innumerable pools are always just a dive away. Magnificent year-round weather has made the Algarve a huge destination for sporting vacations. Superb golf facilities abound — several with tees dramatically clinging to cliffs and fairways just skirting the edge of the ocean — and horseback riding, tennis, big-game fishing, sailing, and windsurfing are immensely popular. Sports, beaches and hospitable weather — not to mention easily organized package vacations — are surely the reasons the Algarve receives as many visitors as the rest of Portugal in its entirety. But it's not just international tourists that descend on the Algarve; many Portuguese from Lisbon and elsewhere in the north have holiday homes and spend their summer vacations here. The coast is neatly divided into the rugged Barlavento to the west and the flat beauty of Sotavento to the east. West is where you'll find the famous orange cliffs and surreal eroded rock stacks.

Please answer the following question: Information: - A vacuum solution is a solution of a field equation in which the sources of the field are taken to be identically zero. That is, such field equations are written without matter interaction (i.e.- set to zero). - Rome is a city and special \\"comune\\" (named \\"Roma Capitale\\") in Italy. Rome is the capital of Italy and of the Lazio region. With 2,870,336 residents in , it is also the country's largest and most populated \\"comune\\" and fourth-most populous city in the European Union by population within city limits. The Metropolitan City of Rome has a population of 4.3 million residents. The city is located in the central-western portion of the Italian Peninsula, within Lazio (Latium), along the shores of Tiber river. The Vatican City is an independent country geographically located within the city boundaries of Rome, the only existing example of a country within a city: for this reason Rome has been often defined as capital of two states. - Italy, officially the Italian Republic, is a unitary parliamentary republic in Europe. Located in the heart of the Mediterranean Sea, Italy shares open land borders with France, Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia, San Marino and Vatican City. Italy covers an area of and has a largely temperate seasonal climate and Mediterranean climate; due to its shape, it is often referred to in Italy as \\"lo Stivale\\" (the Boot). With 61 million inhabitants, it is the fourth most populous EU member state. - Particle physics (also high energy physics) is the branch of physics that studies the nature of the particles that constitute \\"matter\\" (particles with mass) and \\"radiation\\" (massless particles). Although the word \\"particle\\" can refer to various types of very small objects (e.g. protons, gas particles, or even household dust), \\"particle physics\\" usually investigates the irreducibly smallest detectable particles and the irreducibly fundamental force fields necessary to explain them. By our current understanding, these elementary particles are excitations of the quantum fields that also govern their interactions. The currently dominant theory explaining these fundamental particles and fields, along with their dynamics, is called the Standard Model. Thus, modern particle physics generally investigates the Standard Model and its various possible extensions, e.g. to the newest \\"known\\" particle, the Higgs boson, or even to the oldest known force field, gravity. - In theoretical physics, quantum field theory (QFT) is the theoretical framework for constructing quantum mechanical models of subatomic particles in particle physics and quasiparticles in condensed matter physics. QFT treats particles as excited states of the underlying physical field, so these are called field quanta. - Spontaneous symmetry breaking is a spontaneous process of symmetry breaking, by which a physical system in a symmetrical state ends up in an asymmetrical state. In particular, it can describe systems where the equations of motion or the Lagrangian obey symmetries, but the lowest-energy vacuum solutions do not exhibit that same symmetry. - The Sapienza University of Rome, (Italian: Sapienza Università di Roma), also called simply Sapienza or the \\"University of Rome\\", is a collegiate research university located in Rome, Italy. Formally known as Università degli Studi di Roma \\"La Sapienza\\", it is the largest European university by enrollments (the third if considering also the distance learning schools) and one of the oldest in history, founded in 1303. The University is also the most prestigious Italian university and also the best ranked in Southern Europe. - In physics, symmetry breaking is a phenomenon in which (infinitesimally) small fluctuations acting on a system crossing a critical point decide the system's fate, by determining which branch of a bifurcation is taken. To an outside observer unaware of the fluctuations (or \\"noise\\"), the choice will appear arbitrary. This process is called symmetry \\"breaking\\", because such transitions usually bring the system from a symmetric but disorderly state into one or more definite states. Symmetry breaking is supposed to play a major role in pattern formation. - In quantum mechanics, an excited state of a system (such as an atom, molecule or nucleus) is any quantum state of the system that has a higher energy than the ground state (that is, more energy than the absolute minimum). Excitation is an elevation in energy level above an arbitrary baseline energy state. In physics there is a specific technical definition for energy level which is often associated with an atom being raised to an excited state. The temperature of a group of particles is indicative of the level of excitation (with the notable exception of systems that exhibit negative temperature). - Southern Europe is the southern region of the European continent. Most definitions of Southern Europe, also known as Mediterranean Europe, include the countries of the Iberian peninsula (Spain and Portugal), the Italian peninsula, Southern France, Greece and Malta. Other definitions sometimes include the Balkan countries of Southeast Europe, which are geographically technically in the southern part of Europe, but which have different historical, political, economic, and cultural backgrounds that commonly places them in the category of Eastern Europe. - Condensed matter physics is a branch of physics that deals with the physical properties of condensed phases of matter, where particles adhere to each other. Condensed matter physicists seek to understand the behavior of these phases by using physical laws. In particular, they include the laws of quantum mechanics, electromagnetism and statistical mechanics. - The Accademia dei Lincei (literally the \\"Academy of the Lynx-Eyed\\", but anglicised as the Lincean Academy) is an Italian science academy, located at the Palazzo Corsini on the Via della Lungara in Rome, Italy. - In physics, quasiparticles and collective excitations (which are closely related) are emergent phenomena that occur when a microscopically complicated system such as a solid behaves \\"as if\\" it contained different weakly interacting particles in free space. For example, as an electron travels through a semiconductor, its motion is disturbed in a complex way by its interactions with all of the other electrons and nuclei; however it \\"approximately\\" behaves like an electron with a \\"different mass\\" (effective mass) traveling unperturbed through free space. This \\"electron\\" with a different mass is called an \\"electron quasiparticle\\". In another example, the aggregate motion of electrons in the valence band of a semiconductor is the same as if the semiconductor instead contained positively charged quasiparticles called holes. Other quasiparticles or collective excitations include phonons (particles derived from the vibrations of atoms in a solid), plasmons (particles derived from plasma oscillations), and many others. - Giovanni Jona - Lasinio ( born 1932 ) , sometimes called Gianni Jona , is an Italian theoretical physicist , best known for his works on quantum field theory and statistical mechanics .

How can I improve my English vocabulary? Do those questions have the same meaning?","completion":"Although the two questions posed are related, they are not precisely the same. The first question seeks methods to remember new words to expand one's vocabulary, while the second question broadly asks about improving English vocabulary. That being said, both inquiries require a focus on vocabulary improvement techniques. To provide a comprehensive response, I will address both questions by suggesting effective strategies for learning, remembering, and expanding your English vocabulary. 1. Read extensively: Reading a variety of material, such as books, articles, newspapers, and blogs, exposes you to different writing styles and new words. The more diverse your reading material, the more vocabulary you will encounter. While reading, note unfamiliar words, their context, and, if necessary, look up their meanings. 2. Keep a vocabulary journal: Document the new words you encounter along with their definitions, synonyms, and example sentences. This practice allows you to organize the words you are learning and enables quick refreshers when needed. 3. Learn a word a day: Choose a new word each day to focus on. Attempt to use it in conversation, writing, and social media posts. The repetition will help you remember the word and eventually make it a part of your active vocabulary. 4. Use mnemonics: Associate new words with images, stories, or other techniques to make them more memorable. This technique can be particularly helpful when learning complicated or abstract words. 5. Engage in conversation: Speak regularly with fluent or native English speakers. Conversing with others provides an opportunity not only to learn new words but also to practice using them in context. 6. Play word games: Games like Scrabble, Boggle, and crossword puzzles allow you to engage with words in a fun and challenging way. These activities can help reinforce your vocabulary knowledge and retention. 7. Use flashcards: Write new words and their meanings on index cards (or use a digital flashcard app) and review them regularly. This technique utilizes the concept of spaced repetition, which involves spreading out the learning and reviewing process over time to enhance memory retention. 8. Study etymology: Understanding the origins and histories of words can help you recall their meanings and recognize patterns within the English language. 9. Learn word families: Study groups of related words with a common root, such as \\"education,\\" \\"educate,\\" and \\"educational.\\" By learning words in groups, you can improve your understanding of their meanings and grow your vocabulary more efficiently. 10. Practice and repetition: Regularly review, practice, and use the new vocabulary you've learned. The more you use the words, the more they become a part of your long-term memory. It's important to remember that consistency and determination are crucial to vocabulary improvement. Employ a range of these techniques, and over time, you will see improvement in your English vocabulary."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

These letters shed new light on the predicament faced by the young princes during the great conflict of the early 20th century. Despite being the direct heir to the throne, Edward VIII, later known as the Duke of Windsor, was banned from active military service during the war, much to his despair. His younger brother, the future King George VI, was also unable to participate in the conflict due to health issues. Both princes, feeling neglected and left out of the great struggle of their time, took pen to paper and wrote to their military mentor to express their frustrations and the impact of the war on their personal and public lives. While many may assume that their royal status protected them from the horrors faced by ordinary soldiers during the war, these letters reveal the emotional turmoil these young men experienced when they found themselves unable to serve their country in such dire times. Edward VIII boldly admitted his envy for the soldiers fighting in the trenches and lamented the fact that he was left \\"totally devoid of any job\\" during the war. There was a deep feeling of frustration and guilt that haunted the prince as he struggled to come to terms with his lack of contribution to the war effort. For his younger brother, George VI, the constraints were physical. Suffering from chronic gastric problems, he was banned from serving by royal doctors who feared for his well-being. This, too, caused its own unique problems, with the prince worrying that the public would criticize him for not being on the front line and fighting alongside his fellow citizens. This fear of public backlash remained a constant source of stress for the prince, who felt both impotent and guilty for his inability to contribute directly to the war effort. But the royal brothers' contributions during the Great War cannot be overlooked. Although denied the opportunity to fight on the front lines, they played crucial roles in supporting the troops and the wider war effort back home. Edward VIII took up various administrative posts and public engagements, while George VI worked to overcome his stutter and became an important figure in bolstering morale both at home and abroad. Their commitment to their country and to the welfare of its citizens was palpable, despite the personal challenges they faced. It is important to recognize that the lives of the royal family, especially during times of war, are not as privileged and shielded as one might assume. They too faced pressure and anxiety as a result of their inability to participate in the conflict. These letters reveal the burden of responsibility that weighed on the royal brothers during World War I, a period that dramatically shaped their lives and the course of British history. The auctioning of these letters provides a fascinating insight into the turmoil, the loneliness and the frustrations of the future kings who felt left out in the midst of a war that consumed their nation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The fit - The customer mentions that the product \\"doesn't fit the way I want it to.\\" This demonstrates that the product did not meet the customer's expectations in terms of its fit, which is a critical aspect for customer satisfaction. 3. Return policy frustration - The customer also expresses their dissatisfaction with the return policy, stating that they cannot return the product because they had to wear it to determine that it didn't fit properly. This further contributes to their negative experience with the product, as they feel it is unfair that they are unable to return it and potentially receive a refund or exchange.

Article:","completion":"Title: Julie Gayet and François Hollande: A Breakup Caused by Heavy Pressure Introduction: In the wake of a high-profile breakup, Julie Gayet, the French actress involved in a relationship scandal with former French President François Hollande, has reportedly told friends that she was unable to cope with the pressure that came with the spotlight. The revelation comes after Hollande's split with his partner of ten years, Valerie Trierweiler, and Ms. Trierweiler's subsequent hospitalization due to shock. Reports have surfaced that Mr. Hollande was caught making late-night visits to Ms. Gayet, leading to the unraveling of events. Step 1: Introduce Julie Gayet's statement to friends Julie Gayet, the 41-year-old French actress known for her roles in French cinema, has allegedly expressed to her friends that she could not handle the immense pressure thrust upon her during her relationship with former French President François Hollande. The overwhelming attention and scrutiny from the media and public seem to have taken a toll on the actress, contributing to the ultimate demise of their relationship. Step 2: Discuss Hollande's split with former partner Valerie Trierweiler The pressure on Gayet began when Hollande split with his former partner of ten years, Valerie Trierweiler. The former first couple's separation in 2014 was already a significant event in French politics, and the subsequent discovery of Hollande's alleged affair with Gayet only amplified the attention on both women's lives. Step 3: Detail Ms. Trierweiler's hospitalization from shock Valerie Trierweiler, who had been Hollande's partner both before and during his presidency, went into the hospital for a week following Hollande's breakup and ensuing scandal with Gayet. The shock of the events that transpired took a significant toll on Ms. Trierweiler's mental well-being, amplifying the public scrutiny of the entire ordeal. Step 4: Describe Hollande's late-night visits to Gayet The affair between Hollande and Gayet garnered significant attention from French media outlets in 2014, with many speculating about the extent of their relationship. The interest was further ignited after Hollande was caught making late-night visits to Gayet, seemingly confirming the rumors of an affair and widening the spotlight on both parties involved. Conclusion: The pressure of being entangled in a high-profile relationship scandal with a former President proved to be too much for Julie Gayet. As details of the affair came to light, Hollande's breakup with his long-term partner, Trierweiler, and her subsequent hospitalization, the situation reached a boiling point. The public's insatiable curiosity and media scrutiny created an unbearable environment for Gayet, ultimately leading to the collapse of her relationship with Hollande."},{"prompt":"Question: What county is Farmington Hills, MI in??

The \\"spider-story\\" is often told. Robert Bruce, leader of the Scots in the 13th century, was hiding in a cave from the English. He watched a spider making a web . The spider tried to reach across a rough place in the rock. He tried six times. On the seventh time he made it and went on to make his web. Bruce is said to have been encouraged by this and to have gone on to defeat the English. Edison, the inventor of the light bulb, made hundreds of models that failed before he found the right way to make one. Once he was asked why he kept on trying to make a new type of battery when he had failed so often, he replied, \\"Failure? I have no failure. Now I know 50,000 ways it won't work.\\" So what? First, always think about your failure. What caused it? Were conditions right? Were you in top form yourself? What can you change so things will go right next time? Second, is the goal you're trying to reach the right one? Try to do some thinking about what your real goals may be. Think about this question, \\"If I do succeed in this, where will it get me?\\" This may help you prevent failure in things you shouldn't be doing anyway.

Erholung und Möglichkeiten zum Trainieren finden Sie kostenfrei im LivingWell Express Health Club, das rund um die Uhr geöffnet ist. Translate this to English?","completion":"Relaxation and training opportunities can be found for free at the LivingWell Express Health Club, which is open 24 hours a day. Firstly, let's break down the content of the sentence. 1. \\"Erholung und Möglichkeiten zum Trainieren\\": This means \\"Relaxation and training opportunities\\". 'Erholung' is the German word for 'relaxation', and 'Möglichkeiten zum Trainieren' translates to 'opportunities for training'. This phrase indicates that the place being described offers facilities for both rest and exercise. 2. \\"finden Sie kostenfrei\\": Literally translated, this means \\"you find free of charge\\". 'Finden Sie' is German for 'you find', and 'kostenfrei' means 'free of charge'. This suggests that the services offered by the place are available for free, i.e., no charge is incurred by those who make use of them. 3. \\"im LivingWell Express Health Club\\": This translates to \\"at the LivingWell Express Health Club\\". 'Im' is a contraction of 'in dem', which means 'in the'. 'LivingWell Express Health Club' is the name of the location being referred to. Here, 'club' indicates that it is a place where people can come together to partake in collective activities, typically of a recreational or leisurely nature. 4. \\"das rund um die Uhr geöffnet ist\\": This means \\"which is open around the clock\\". 'Das' is a relative pronoun, equivalent to the English 'which'. 'Rund um die Uhr' literally translates to 'around the clock' and means 24 hours a day, suggesting that there are no time restrictions as to when one can visit. Adding these segments together, an English translation of this sentence would be: \\"Relaxation and training opportunities can be found for free at the LivingWell Express Health Club, which is open 24 hours a day\\". This sentence tells us that the LivingWell Express Health Club offers facilities for exercise and relaxation that are free to use and are available at all times."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Q:The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the full name of the man who was the engineer on the album that had the spirit of experimentation? , can you please find it? In his book about psychedelic music, author Jim DeRogatis referred to Smiley Smile as a work of the \\"ultimate psychedelic rock library\\". Conversely, Stylus Magazine's Edwin Faust wrote in 2003 that the album \\"embraces the listener with a drugged out sincerity; a feat never accomplished by the more pretentious and heavy-handed psychedelia of that era. It is for this reason Smiley Smile flows so well with the more experimental pop of today\\". According to music theorist Daniel Harrison, Smiley Smile is not a work of rock music as the term was understood in 1967, and that portions of the album \\"can be thought of as a kind of protomiminal rock music\\". He continues: Smiley Smile can almost be considered a work of art music in the Western classical tradition, and its innovations in the musical language of rock can be compared to those that introduced atonal and other nontraditional techniques into that classical tradition. The spirit of experimentation is just as palpable in Smiley Smile as it is in, say, Schoenberg's op. 11 piano pieces. Yet there is also a spirit of tentativeness in Smiley Smile. We must remember that it was essentially a Plan B—that is, the album issued instead of Smile. The Beach Boys recorded using what was predominantly radio broadcasting equipment, which lacked many of the technical elements and effects found in an established studio. This led to unconventional ways of achieving particular sounds at the home, such as a replacement for what would be achieved by an echo chamber. The album's engineer Jim Lockert recalled how \\"Brian's swimming pool had a leak in it and was empty, so we put a microphone in the bottom of this damn near Olympic-size pool and the guys laid down inside the pool and sang so the sound would go down the wall of the concrete pool into the microphone – and that was part of the vocals on one of those songs.\\" Some recording accidents were used to their advantage, such as in \\"With Me Tonight\\", which contains an informal link between the verse and chorus by way of a voice...

Review: On an overnight flight from Los Angeles to Miami, Lisa Reisert (Rachel McAdams) meets a charming man who turns out to be a hired killer who demands her help killing a businessman or else her own father will die. Red Eye is a terrific thriller that keeps the audience on the edge of their seats. The premise is similar to Cellular and Phone Booth but Red Eye is better than both of those films. Almost everything about Red Eye is above average including the suspense, the acting and the direction. Most of the film does take place on a plane but that doesn't slow down the movie. The film is very fast pace and exciting with no slow or boring spots. Wes Craven does a really good job behind the camera. Instead of focusing on the thrills, he focuses on the story and the characters. The movie does have its share of suspenseful moments but that's not what the film is really about. I also like the way Wes Craven focuses on the other passengers and the small details that become important later on. Red Eye really shows his skills at storytelling. Red Eye also works well because of its young and talented cast. Rachel McAdams gives a very engaging performance and her character is hard to hate. You may even end up cheering for her out loud. Cillian Murphy gives a very creepy and effective performance as the villain. The way he acts charming at first but then turns psycho is especially impressive. The supporting actors are also pretty good which include Brain Cox and Jayma Mays. The movie is also very stylish and it has this overall creepy vibe to it. The setting works well since there is an obvious fear of isolation and no escape. Overall, the tone of the film is consistently creepy. The screenplay isn't as strong as everything else though. There are a few unrealistic moments that may distract the viewer. Most of them didn't bother me but there were of few that left me shaking my head. Also, the ending is disappointing. It isn't a bad ending just a very simple one and a different approach would have been better. Since the movie focuses on the characters, there is really no scream moments maybe just a few jumps. If you expect a horror movie then you will end up disappointed. In the end, Red Eye is an engaging thriller and it's one of the best movies of the summer.

The paragraph primarily focuses on choosing a suitable variety of tomatoes for indoor gardens, presenting the options between determinate (bush) and indeterminate (vining) varieties. It discusses the advantages of both options for indoor gardens but does not provide information on the difficulty of growing tomatoes indoors in comparison to outdoors. In order to accurately determine if the hypothesis is true, we would require additional information on factors such as the differences in resources needed, lighting conditions, and potential challenges faced in both indoor and outdoor environments. Moreover, it is important to consider how different varieties of tomatoes could affect the ease or difficulty of growing them in either setting. For example, growing tomatoes indoors allows for more control over temperature and humidity, which could potentially make it easier to maintain optimal conditions for the plants. Conversely, outdoor environments may expose tomatoes to variable weather conditions, pests or diseases, which could make growing outdoors more difficult. On the other hand, indoor growing typically requires additional resources, such as artificial lighting systems and possibly heating or cooling systems, to replicate natural environments. This might make indoor growing more complicated compared to outdoor cultivation, where tomatoes are exposed to natural sunlight and temperature fluctuations. Lastly, the choice between determinate (bushing) and indeterminate (vining) varieties also plays a role in determining the ease or difficulty of growing tomatoes indoors or outdoors. Bush varieties tend to remain shorter and more compact in size, thus potentially making them more suitable for indoor environments where space is limited. On the other hand, vining varieties are more robust and can grow taller, making them potentially more suitable for outdoor growing conditions where they can utilize vertical space without overcrowding. In conclusion, based on the information provided in the paragraph, it's impossible to say if the hypothesis is true or false. We would need further details on various aspects of indoor and outdoor growing conditions, as well as how distinct tomato varieties perform in each setting, to make a more accurate determination."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Living far from a lake or a body of water limits the opportunities and frequency of using a boat, ultimately making it a less practical investment. In contrast, an ATV provides much more recreational value and functionality for people who reside in areas with diverse terrains and outdoor activities. An ATV, or all-terrain vehicle, is specifically designed to handle a wide range of surfaces and is capable of traversing dirt, mud, sand, and rocky terrains with ease, thanks to its robust suspension system and specialized tires. This makes an ATV a perfect choice for thrilling off-road adventures, exploring remote and rugged landscapes, or simply enjoying the great outdoors. Moreover, the compact size and impressive maneuverability of an ATV allow it to navigate narrow trails and even tight spaces that larger vehicles cannot access. Besides recreational purposes, ATVs are also quite useful for performing various tasks and chores, including hauling equipment, towing small trailers, and even plowing snow during winter. They can be equipped with numerous accessories, enhancing their functionality and customizing them according to specific needs. This further solidifies the ATV as a practical and valuable investment. On the other hand, a boat requires a body of water, like a lake, river, or sea, for it to serve its primary purpose of traversing and exploring waterways. Owning and operating a boat demands additional expenses, such as docking fees, maintenance, and potential storage costs during off-seasons. This can quickly add up, and without a nearby lake or river, the utility and enjoyment derived from owning a boat are severely curtailed. In conclusion, investing in an ATV offers far greater benefits and opportunities for adventure and utility when compared to a boat, particularly in situations where a person lives far from a lake or other bodies of water. The versatility, functionality, and adaptability of an ATV make it an ideal choice for those looking for an outdoor vehicle that can provide excitement, exploration, and practicality, regardless of the surrounding terrain or environment."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Article: Margaret River murder-suicide: Seven people found dead at home near WA holiday town Updated Four children and three adults have been shot dead in a home near the West Australian town of Margaret River, in what is the nation's worst mass shooting since the 1996 Port Arthur massacre. Key points: Police were tipped-off by a man connected to the property Two adults were found outside the home, five bodies inside it, including four children It is the worst mass shooting in Australia since Port Arthur in 1996 Police are treating the incident as a murder-suicide and have confirmed they are not looking for any suspects. A friend of the family has confirmed to the ABC that Katrina Miles and her four children were among the seven victims. The friend confirmed that Katrina's parents, whose names are listed on the property title as Peter and Cynda Miles, were also killed in the incident. WA Police Commissioner Chris Dawson said all seven victims appeared to be residents of the property, which consists of an established house and a shed that had been converted to living quarters. Two adults were found outside and the other five bodies were discovered inside the converted shed. Police at the scene confirmed to the ABC that the family's next of kin had been notified, but they were yet to formally confirm the identities of the victims. The mass shooting has the most fatalities since the Port Arthur massacre, in which 35 people died and another 23 were seriously injured. Phone tip-off to police Commissioner Dawson said officers were called to the rural property in Osmington, about 20 kilometres north-east of Margaret River, about 5:15am on Friday. They found firearms at the crime scene. \\"It appears that gunshot wounds are there, but I don't want to go further than that as two firearms have been located,\\" Commissioner Dawson said. Detectives from the Homicide Squad and Forensic Crime Scene Unit have travelled to the scene as part of the investigation.

State Member for Vasse Libby Mettam, whose seat incorporates Margaret River, said the deaths had already sent \\"significant shockwaves\\" through the town, and the community was hurting. \\"This is a much-loved family, a big part of the Margaret River community,\\" she said. \\"Our thoughts and prayers go out to everyone that will be affected by this tragedy, including those first responders.\\" Former local councillor Felicity Haynes, who lives on a neighbouring property, said the family involved were \\"caring neighbours\\". \\"They were just such lovely people,\\" she said. \\"They were a very socially-aware family, doing their best to create a safe community, and that is why it is so shocking to think that could be destroyed so quickly.\\" Dr Haynes said the family had moved to the property about three years earlier to start a farm, having earlier lived in Margaret River. Another nearby resident, Freya Cheffers, said she was in shock. \\"Everybody's just devastated … I just prayed that I didn't know the family, as it turns out I kind of do.\\" Premier Mark McGowan described the incident as a \\"shocking tragedy\\". \\"Clearly this is a distressing day for Western Australia,\\" he said. \\"It's a dark day for every family member or friend of the people involved.\\" Tragedy to have 'lasting impact' Police said they were expecting to remain at the property for \\"an extended period of time\\". \\"We are trying to locate other members of the family and friends,\\" Commissioner Dawson said. \\"This devastating tragedy will no doubt have a lasting impact on the families concerned, the whole community and in particular, the local communities in our South West.\\" Margaret River is a small town about 270 kilometres south of Perth, and the surrounding region — with a population of about 9,000 — is well-known for its beaches, wineries and craft breweries. It is world-famous as a surfing destination, hosting an annual event of the World Surf League — the Margaret River Pro — and is a popular holiday spot among both West Australians and international tourists. Augusta-Margaret River shire president Pamela Townshend said the tragedy would send shockwaves throughout the small community. \\"It really hits hard, because everybody has links with that family in one way or another, so it will have a ripple effect right through our community,\\" she said. \\"The good thing about a small community is that we all mobilise to support people who are in terrible distress, and there will be a huge community response … to support people affected directly and indirectly by this. \\"My heart goes out to them and we will certainly provide as much support as we possibly can.\\" Anyone with information regarding the deaths, or who saw or heard anything suspicious in the Osmington area this morning, has been urged to call Crime Stoppers. Topics: police, crime, law-crime-and-justice, murder-and-manslaughter, perth-6000, wa, margaret-river-6285, osmington-6285 First posted ||||| CANBERRA, Australia (AP) — Seven people were found dead with gunshot wounds at a property near the tourist town of Margaret River in Australia's southwest on Friday in what could be the country's worst mass shooting in 22 years, police said. The bodies of three adults and four children and two guns were found at a rural property at the village of Osmington, Western Australia state Police Commissioner Chris Dawson said. The bodies of two adults were found outside a building on the property and the rest were found inside. They all resided at the property, he said. Police have no information to raise concerns about wider public safety. Police were led to the property by a phone call before dawn, Dawson said. He would not comment on the possibility of murder-suicide. \\"Police are currently responding to what I can only describe as a horrific incident,\\" Dawson told reporters. \\"This devastating tragedy will no doubt have a lasting impact on the families concerned, the whole community and, in particular, the local communities in our southwest,\\" he added. Police were attempting to make contact with victims' relatives, Dawson said. He declined to release the names or ages of the dead. This could be the worst mass shooting in Australia since a lone gunman killed 35 in Tasmania state in 1996, prompting the nation to introduce tough gun controls. Australia's gun laws are widely acclaimed as a success, with supporters including former President Barack Obama saying Australia has not had a single mass shooting since they were implemented. The generally accepted definition of a mass shooting — four deaths excluding the shooter in a single event — has been met only once in Australia since then. In 2014, a farmer shot his wife and three children before killing himself. Police have revealed few details about the recent killings, and it is not clear whether there was more than one shooter. Farmers are allowed to own guns under Australian law because they have a legitimate need to use them to kill feral pests and predators or sick or injured livestock. But automatic and semi-automatic rifles and shotguns are banned from public ownership. |||||Summary:","completion":"Seven people, including four children, were found dead from gunshot wounds at a home near the town of Margaret River in Western Australia.

With all due respect, its low rating is representative of the IQ level of those who rated it so poor. They would rather see a movie with cheap thrills, a bigger budget, and more gore. The first misconception by people is that this is a horror film. It is not, nor does the film mislead you into believing it is one. It is a psychological thriller. It is for people who actually want an intellectual experience when watching a movie. Reel.com's review is the perfect example of how I feel about this movie. All the other negative reviews doesn't make much sense. It's almost as if trying to make an original movie for a change- very rare these days- is something bad and not worth it. I will reveal some spoilers for the morons who said it was boring and didn't make sense. Martha was brainwashing herself and performing experiments on herself to be a caring mother while she really was an evil Nazi who would kill without warning. The evidence is all in the pudding and the fact that at first viewing, we sympathize with this cold-blooded monster for the duration of the movie is a testament to the film's direction and writing. I definitely feel that this movie should at least be rated in the 6's range on originality alone. I recommend this movie for the people on the other end of the IQ scale- aka smart people- since this movie is obviously being butchered by those who would rather watch Scream or Freddy's Nightmare. Kudos to the acting as well. For such a low budget film, you are amazed that this movie didn't hit your local cinema with the great direction, writing, and acting. Please don't be fooled by the rating by IMDb. This movie is worth it. I actually recommend buying the film since a first viewing on a rent will not do this justice.

You can harvest and eat your onions at any phase of their growth, but they'll be larger if you wait until the end of summer when they're fully mature. Target onions with flowers on top first because they will rot if left in the ground. Onions that form flowers don’t store well and must be used within 3-4 days. When an onion plant grows flowers, it’s a sign that the onion has stopped growing and the plant is now focusing its energy on the flowers. The growth of flowers on the top of an onion is known as “bolting” and is often seen as undesirable to onion growers. You do not have to go through the curing process for onions that have grown flowers. Most onion plants will ripen sometime in the late summer. When the green foliage of the onion plant falls over on its side and turns yellow or brown, it’s a good sign that the onion is ready to be harvested. Use a spade to carefully dig a circle, 1 inch (2.5 cm) around the bulb. Dig around and under the bulb and sever the roots of the onion. Do not cut the onion with the spade because it will cause the onion to rot prematurely. Firmly grab the base of the green leaves and pull up to extract it from the ground. Loosen the soil with the spade more if you’re having trouble getting it out of the ground. Handle onions carefully so that you don’t bruise them. Bruising will cause rot.

Somerset is a rural county of rolling hills such as the Blackdown Hills, Mendip Hills, Quantock Hills and Exmoor National Park, and large flat expanses of land including the Somerset Levels. There is evidence of human occupation from Paleolithic times, and of subsequent settlement in the Roman and Anglo-Saxon periods. The county played a significant part in the consolidation of power and rise of King Alfred the Great, and later in the English Civil War and the Monmouth Rebellion. The city of Bath is famous for its substantial Georgian architecture and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The people of Somerset are mentioned in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle's entry for AD 845, in the inflected form \\"Sumursætum\\", and the county is recorded in the entry for 1015 using the same name. The archaic name Somersetshire was mentioned in the Chronicle's entry for 878. Although \\"Somersetshire\\" was in common use as an alternative name for the county, it went out of fashion in the late 19th century, and is no longer used possibly due to the adoption of \\"Somerset\\" as the county's official name after the establishment of the county council in 1889.

In this task, you're given a paragraph from the research paper and your task is to generate a suitable title for the research paper based on the given paper. Under 100 words is a good title length. Human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) is a major cause of pediatric lower respiratory tract disease to which there is no vaccine or efficacious chemotherapeutic strategy. Although RNA synthesis and virus assembly occur in the cytoplasm, HRSV is known to induce nuclear responses in the host cell as replication alters global gene expression. Quantitative proteomics was used to take an unbiased overview of the protein changes in transformed human alveolar basal epithelial cells infected with HRSV. Underpinning this was the use of stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture coupled to LC-MS/MS, which allowed the direct and simultaneous identification and quantification of both cellular and viral proteins. To reduce sample complexity and increase data return on potential protein localization, cells were fractionated into nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts. This resulted in the identification of 1,140 cellular proteins and six viral proteins. The proteomics data were analyzed using Ingenuity Pathways Analysis to identify defined canonical pathways and functional groupings. Selected data were validated using Western blot, direct and indirect immunofluorescence confocal microscopy, and functional assays. The study served to validate and expand upon known HRSVhost cell interactions, including those associated with the antiviral response and alterations in subnuclear structures such as the nucleolus and ND10 (promyelocytic leukemia bodies). In addition, novel changes were observed in mitochondrial proteins and functions, cell cycle regulatory molecules, nuclear pore complex proteins and nucleocytoplasmic trafficking proteins. These data shed light into how the cell is potentially altered to create conditions more favorable for infection. Addition-ally, the study highlights the application and advantage of stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture coupled to LC-MS/MS for the analysis of virus-host interactions.","completion":"\\"Human Respiratory Syncytial Virus: Proteomic Analysis and Effects on Host Cell Functions\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? Acknowledge the positive in your life and begin to re-establish some balance in your emotional register. Avoid focusing on only the bad things that happened during your day, but consider the good as well. Stop and count your blessings. Write down even the simplest things that you have and enjoy: a roof over your head, a bed to sleep on, quality food, warmth, security, good health, friends or family. Acknowledge that not everyone has these things. Say something positive to yourself as soon as you wake up every morning. This will keep your energy and mind focused on positive thinking. Be thankful for each day that you have; you never know which one could be your last! Use positive self-talk. Reinforce your resolve through positive statements such as, \\"I can handle this, one step at a time,\\" or \\"Since I've been successful with this before, there's no reason why I can't do it again.\\" Visualize positive things; this does not take long but can help you regain focus. Think about success, read about successful people. Don't admit defeat before you've been defeated. You don't deserve to beat yourself down so that you can punish yourself. Set goals for what you need to achieve during the day, then write a \\"to do list\\". Add some breathing room in the middle of the day that will give you time to recharge. Taking control of your time and priorities will significantly decrease the amount of stress you feel. Know your limits. Be realistic about what you can and can't accomplish in a day. It's not helpful if you bite off more than you can chew and then castigate yourself for not getting it done. Prioritize your tasks. Work on finishing the highest priority (most urgent/important) items first. Put low priority items on the bottom of your list. Try to avoid multi-tasking, as this can decrease focus. Instead, try to focus on important tasks and eliminate distractions. Do your most unpleasant or most difficult task at the beginning of the day when you are fresh, thereby avoiding the stress of last minute preparation. Procrastination feeds stress! Emphasize quality in your work, rather than sheer quantity. Take pride in having done something well as opposed to having done a lot of something. Schedule your day, if possible, so that stressful scenarios don't overlap, reducing the number of stressors you must juggle at any one time. Stagger deadlines for large projects. Review your goals at the end of the day and think about everything you have achieved. This is cathartic and will help you sleep better. Check off the things that you accomplished on the to do list. Make sure you understand why you become stressed so that you can try to avoid these circumstances. Knowledge is powerful, and self-knowledge is especially powerful. If you notice, for example, that you regularly get stressed at a certain time with a certain person, go out of your way to prepare your brain for the upcoming stress. If the person is someone you love and trust, tell them how they make you feel in a non-threatening way. If you don't feel comfortable sharing your misgivings, remind yourself that the occasion is momentary, the feeling will pass, and you'll be in complete control soon. This especially comes with things such as politics, and often applies to other individuals. Learning to accept things as they are is an important coping mechanism, but not as easy as it sounds. Is the problem a real problem you’re currently facing, rather than an imaginary what-if? If the problem is an imaginary what-if, how likely is it to happen? Is your concern realistic? Can you do something about the problem or prepare for it, or is it out of your control Admitting to yourself that there's nothing you can do about a particular issue will go a long way in helping you adjust. Acknowledge that maybe you feed off of stress, like an adrenaline junkie feeds off adrenaline, but that in your case, it's becoming unmanageable. It is less stressful to make decisions and take action than to feel powerless and react to others' decisions. Decide what you want and go for it! Learn to say no on occasion. You cannot do everything you are asked, and even if you could, you probably wouldn't want to. Resist the urge to be perfect at all times. Perfectionism can cause huge amounts of stress if you hold yourself to unattainable standards. Be realistic about what you can and can't do. Don't set yourself up for failure just because you want to stroke your ego. Don't get down on yourself for failing if you tried your hardest. You gave it your all, and nobody would ask you for more. Hold yourself accountable, but don't make being accountable impossible. Be one of your own best friends. It may sound cheesy, like something out of a Leave it to Beaver commercial, but it's true: Love yourself, depend (mostly) on yourself, and celebrate the things you do well. Loving yourself will ease the anxious question \\"Am I good enough?\\" and replace it with \\"I know I'm good enough.\\" One of the barriers to stress reduction is the temptation to take things too seriously. It's okay to back off from your intensity and see the humour in life's situations. Laugh a little or better yet, laugh a lot! See the humour in stress. Learn to laugh at yourself. Don't put yourself down, or lash your self-esteem, but try to be playfully deprecating about yourself from time to time. How are you expected to laugh at other things if you can't even laugh at yourself? Help yourself learn to laugh by listening to some stand-up comedy throughout the day. This will help you cultivate humor and keep the tone of your day light. This is one of the most important things, as keeping things bottled up can only cause more stress. Your friends, if they are true friends, will try to understand what you're going through, and will accompany that empathy with a sincere desire to help out if at all possible. Ask your friends for help. If you want something done but can't find the strength or the time to do it, it's okay to ask your friends or loved ones for help. Express your gratitude and extend the offer of help as a kind of reciprocity. Learn to delegate to help decrease stress. Look for people's respect, not approval — your friends included. Your friends will respect you because they love you, even if they don't always agree with you. Your enemies (if you have any) will respect you because your motivations come from a sincere, heartfelt place. Resist the urge to be loved and accepted by everyone; it's literally a Herculean task. You'll find yourself a lot less stressed and a lot more satisfied if you do. Seek out positive people rather than negative ones. It sounds like a truism because it is: Surrounding yourself with people who are fun-loving, excited, and kind will help you avoid the stress you'd be feeling with pessimistic, cynical, mean people. Nothing else helps intensify stress more than negative thoughts. When you start to having the feeling of defeat is the perfect time for a little reminder. You know yourself better than anyone else, and you are the perfect person to give you the reminder that it will get better. Remind yourself of all of the things you have accomplished in the past. All of those small accomplishments add up to very big ones over time. Change the words you use. Instead of saying, \\"I can't do this,\\" say something like, \\"I've been able to get through this before, and I will get through it this time too.\\"","completion":"This article emphasizes the importance of maintaining a positive mindset, setting realistic goals, prioritizing tasks, avoiding multitasking, learning to say no, seeking support from friends, and surrounding oneself with positive people in order to reduce stress and achieve a balanced emotional state."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Anker and his climbing partner take on the Second Step without the use of the fixed ladder; free climbing it with the use of some modern safety precautions (e.g. perlon rope, camming devices, belay devices), to evaluate if indeed Mallory was capable of climbing the Second Step himself in 1924.

Question: What is the answer for the question: What is the name of the specific interior room that is described as a Chinese-style saloon enhanced by Queen Mary? from the following article ? Between 1847 and 1850, when Blore was building the new east wing, the Brighton Pavilion was once again plundered of its fittings. As a result, many of the rooms in the new wing have a distinctly oriental atmosphere. The red and blue Chinese Luncheon Room is made up from parts of the Brighton Banqueting and Music Rooms with a large oriental chimney piece designed by Robert Jones and sculpted by Richard Westmacott. It was formerly in the Music Room at the Brighton Pavilion. The ornate clock, known as the Kylin Clock, was made in Jingdezhen, Jiangxi Province, China, in the second half of the 18th century; it has a later movement by Benjamin Vulliamy circa 1820. The Yellow Drawing Room has wallpaper supplied in 1817 for the Brighton Saloon, and a chimney piece which is a European vision of how the Chinese chimney piece may appear. It has nodding mandarins in niches and fearsome winged dragons, designed by Robert Jones.At the centre of this wing is the famous balcony with the Centre Room behind its glass doors. This is a Chinese-style saloon enhanced by Queen Mary, who, working with the designer Sir Charles Allom, created a more \\"binding\\" Chinese theme in the late 1920s, although the lacquer doors were brought from Brighton in 1873. Running the length of the piano nobile of the east wing is the great gallery, modestly known as the Principal Corridor, which runs the length of the eastern side of the quadrangle. It has mirrored doors, and mirrored cross walls reflecting porcelain pagodas and other oriental furniture from Brighton. The Chinese Luncheon Room and Yellow Drawing Room are situated at each end of this gallery, with the Centre Room obviously placed in the centre.The original early 19th-century interior designs, many of which still survive, included widespread use of brightly coloured scagliola and blue and pink lapis, on the advice of Sir Charles Long.

They built many impressive churches during the term of the first Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem, but in 1187 they were driven out by Muslim forces under the great warrior Saladin. During the Sixth Crusade (1228– 1229), the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II managed to secure Jerusalem for the Christians by negotiation. The Christians, however, could not hold the city. After they lost Jerusalem, a Mongol invasion swept through, and in 1244 the Mameluke dynasty of Egypt took control, ruling Jerusalem for the next 250 years. The city struggled to rebuild from Crusader wars and invasions. Much of the best Islamic architecture in the city was constructed in the Mameluke era, but the past thousand years had taken their toll: Jerusalem was unable to regain the prosperity it had enjoyed in earlier times. In the early 16th century, the Ottoman Turkish Empire was advancing through the Middle East. Jerusalem fell to the Ottomans in 1517, remaining under their control for 400 years. Suleiman the Magnificent rebuilt the walls and gates in the form they retain to this day. Fountains, inns, religious schools, and barracks were constructed. But when Suleiman died, his empire, including Jerusalem, began a long period of decline. The Holy City remained a backwater until the 19th century, when renewed interest among Christian pilgrims made it the destination of thousands of travelers each year. Based on the paragraph, does the response \\"A lot of Islamic art was created in Jerusalem.\\" correctly answer the question \\"What happened to Jerusalem after the Christians lost it?\\"?","completion":"Yes, the response \\"A lot of Islamic art was created in Jerusalem\\" can be considered a correct answer to the question \\"What happened to Jerusalem after the Christians lost it?\\", but it only touches upon one aspect of the events that took place. After the Christians lost Jerusalem, it went through a series of changes in control and experienced various forms of development. Firstly, the Mongol invasion swept through the region, and then in 1244, the Mameluke dynasty of Egypt took control, ruling Jerusalem for the next 250 years. It was during this Mameluke era that much of the best Islamic architecture in the city was constructed, which supports the response that a lot of Islamic art was created in Jerusalem. However, the city also struggled to rebuild from the Crusader wars and invasions, and it couldn't regain the prosperity it had in the past. In the early 16th century, Jerusalem fell under the control of the Ottoman Turkish Empire, which remained in power for 400 years. Suleiman the Magnificent contributed to the city's development by rebuilding the walls, gates, fountains, inns, religious schools, and barracks. However, after his death, the empire, including Jerusalem, went into decline until renewed interest in the 19th century brought Christian pilgrims and travelers to the city. In conclusion, while the statement \\"A lot of Islamic art was created in Jerusalem\\" is accurate, it only provides a partial picture of what happened to the city after the Christians lost it. Other significant events, such as the Mameluke and Ottoman rule, the city's struggle to rebuild, and its eventual decline and resurgence, should also be mentioned for a more complete understanding of the city's history during that period."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the first name of the person who Jacquetta Hawkes developed \\"a very great liking?\\", using the article: In 1960, Ronald William Clark published a biography titled Sir Mortimer Wheeler. FitzRoy Somerset, 4th Baron Raglan, reviewed the volume for the journal Man, describing \\"this very readable little book\\" as being \\"adulatory\\" in tone, \\"but hardly more so than its subject deserves.\\" In 1982, the archaeologist Jacquetta Hawkes published a second biography, Mortimer Wheeler: Adventurer in Archaeology. Hawkes admitted she had developed \\"a very great liking\\" for Wheeler, having first met him when she was an archaeology student at the University of Cambridge. She believed that he had \\"a daemonic energy\\", with his accomplishments in India being \\"almost superhuman\\". Ultimately, she thought of him as being \\"an epic hero in an anti-heroic age\\" in which growing social egalitarianism had stifled and condemned aspects of his greatness.In the 2000 film Hey Ram, the lead character, Saket Ram (played by Kamal Haasan) and his friend, Amjad Khan (played by Shah Rukh Khan) are shown as employees of Wheeler, who was portrayed by Lewis K. Elbinger, before the 1947 Hindu–Muslim riots. In a 2003 volume of the South Asian Studies journal, Sudeshna Gusha published a research article examining Wheeler's use of photography in his excavations and publications in the Indian subcontinent. In 2011, the academic journal Public Archaeology published a research paper by Moshenska and Schadla-Hall that analysed Wheeler's role in presenting archaeology to the British public. Two years later, the Papers from the Institute of Archaeology issued a short comic strip by Moshenska and Alex Salamunovich depicting Wheeler's activities in studying the archaeology of Libya during World War II., what would be the answer ?

The purpose of the present study was to investigate the potential signal mechanism of tissue factor (TF)xa0in the regulation of the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in human retinal pigment epithelial (ARPE-19) cells.', 'An in vitro RPE cell chemical hypoxia model was established by adding cobalt chloride (CoCl2) in the culture medium. The irritative concentration of CoCl2 was determined with a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay kit. VEGF production in ARPE-19 cells was measured with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and western blotting. The Wnt signaling pathway-associated molecules, including phospho-glycogen synthase kinase 3β (p-GSK3β), GSK3β, p-β-catenin and β-catenin, were detected with western blotting. pEGFP-N3-hTF was constructed and verified with digestion of the restriction enzyme and sequencing analysis. Human TF overexpression and silencing plasmids were transfected into the ARPE-19 cells to clarify the causal relationship between TF and VEGF expression. The Transwell coculture system of ARPE-19 cells and RF/6A rhesus macaque choroid-retinal endothelial cells was performed to evaluate cell invasion and tube formation ability.', 'Our anoxic model of ARPE-19 cells showed that TF expression was upregulated in accordance with variations in hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1α) and VEGF levels. Silencing and overexpression of TF decreased and increased VEGF expression, respectively. The Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway played an important role in this effect. Results from the ARPE-19 cell and RF/6A cell coculture system showed that the enhancement of TF expression in the ARPE-19 cells led to significantly faster invasion and stronger tube-forming ability of the RF/6A cells, while siRNA-mediated TF silencing caused the opposite effects. Pharmacological disruption of Wnt signaling IWR-1-endo inhibited the effects compared to the TF-overexpressing group, indicating the importance of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in the process of TF-induced VEGF expression and angiogenesis.

He is a beautiful baby : small but not scrawny , with a perfectly round head , soft alert eyes and a little round nose . Question: Why would the baby be crying - even a little bit as the narrator mentioned ?","completion":"The baby would be crying for a few reasons during and after the circumcision process. First, it is essential to understand that circumcision is a surgical procedure involving the removal of the foreskin that covers the glans (head) of the penis in male infants. While the procedure itself is relatively quick (usually lasting about 10 to 30 minutes), it can cause some degree of distress and discomfort for the baby. Here are some reasons why the baby might be crying during and after the procedure: 1. Pain: Circumcision is typically performed using a localized anesthetic applied either as a cream or an injection to reduce the sensations of pain that the baby might experience. However, the anesthetic may not completely eliminate all discomfort or sensations associated with the procedure. As a result, the baby could be crying due to the residual pain or discomfort that they are feeling during and after the circumcision. 2. Fear and anxiety: Even though a baby may not fully comprehend the situation or understand what is happening, they can still sense discomfort, fear, and anxiety. They may feel vulnerable or scared because they are held down and have been separated from their caregiver momentarily during the circumcision process. The unfamiliar environment, bright lights, and possibly being cold or feeling exposed may also contribute to the baby feeling uneasy, thus causing them to cry. 3. Trauma: The process of circumcision involves cutting and removing a part of the baby's body, which, in some cases, may result in a mild shock or trauma for the infant. This could lead to the baby crying, even after the circumcision has been completed. 4. Physical irritation: After the procedure, the newly exposed glans may experience some irritation as it is now exposed to elements (such as air, clothing, or contact with the diaper) that it hasn't come into contact with before. Additionally, there might be some minor bleeding or swelling, which could cause discomfort leading the baby to cry. 5. Hunger or desire for comfort: Infants often communicate their needs, such as hunger or the need for comfort, through crying. During and after the circumcision, the baby might simply be seeking comfort or food from their caregiver, which could be why they are crying. It is essential for healthcare providers and caregivers to ensure that the baby is comfortable and well-taken care of during and after the procedure to minimize distress. In the situation described, the baby might have cried less than others because the medical personnel were successful in keeping their distress to a minimum by effectively managing pain, providing a comfortable environment, and offering timely comfort and support."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What country was formerly known as Siam until June 23, 1939, and again from 1945 to May 11, 1949?","completion":"The country formerly known as Siam until June 23, 1939, and again from 1945 to May 11, 1949, is Thailand. Thailand is a Southeast Asian country located at the center of the Indochinese Peninsula. It is bordered by Myanmar to the northwest, Laos to the northeast, Cambodia to the southeast, and Malaysia to the south. Before its name change, Siam was a powerful and influential kingdom in the region. The Siamese people, their language, and culture are still evident today in modern Thailand. However, the name Siam was officially changed to Thailand in 1939 by the then-authorities, who wanted to unite the different ethnic groups living within the country under one national identity. The reasoning behind the name \\"Thailand\\" was to emphasize \\"Thai\\" – meaning \\"free\\" or \\"freedom\\" in the Thai language – and \\"land\\" to signify the country as the land of the free people. This was a declaration of the independent spirit of the Thai people. Thailand has a rich and complex history that has been shaped by numerous foreign influences and internal power struggles. The country's history can be traced back to the Dvaravati period (6th-11th centuries), followed by the Lavo Kingdom (11th-14th centuries) and the Sukhothai Kingdom (13th-15th centuries). The Ayutthaya Kingdom (14th-18th centuries) brought Siam to the height of its political power and influence, but it eventually fell to the Burmese invasion in 1767. Despite being colonized by the British and the French during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Siam maintained a considerable level of autonomy and freedom. In 1932, a bloodless revolution transformed the Kingdom of Siam into a constitutional monarchy, paving the way for a tumultuous political landscape characterized by military and civilian coups in the following decades. In World War II, the country was occupied by the Japanese forces, which led to the brief restoration of the name Siam in 1945, following Japan's defeat. However, by May 11, 1949, the name was again changed back to Thailand. Today, Thailand is a constitutional monarchy with King Maha Vajiralongkorn on the throne. It has a diverse and vibrant culture, a rich history, and is known for its breathtaking landscapes, ancient temples, and delicious cuisine. As one of the most popular tourist destinations in Southeast Asia, Thailand plays a crucial role in the economic and cultural dynamics of the region."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This family was known as the Longxi Li lineage (Li lineage; 隴西李氏), which includes the Tang poet Li Bai. The Tang Emperors also had Xianbei maternal ancestry, from Emperor Gaozu of Tang's Xianbei mother, Duchess Dugu. Li Yuan was Duke of Tang and governor of Taiyuan, modern Shanxi, during the Sui dynasty's collapse, which was caused in part by the Sui failure to conquer the northern part of the Korean peninsula during the Goguryeo–Sui War. He had prestige and military experience, and was a first cousin of Emperor Yang of Sui (their mothers were sisters). Li Yuan rose in rebellion in 617, along with his son and his equally militant daughter Princess Pingyang (d. 623), who raised and commanded her own troops.

Wedge Donovan is a tough construction boss, building airstrips in the Pacific for the U.S. Navy during World War II. He clashes with his liaison officer, Lieutenant Commander Robert Yarrow, over the fact that his men are not allowed to arm themselves against the Japanese. When the enemy lands in force on the island, he finally takes matters into his own hands, leading his men into the fray. This prevents Yarrow from springing a carefully devised trap that would have wiped out the invaders in a murderous machinegun crossfire, with minimal American losses. Instead, many of Donovan's men are killed unnecessarily. As a result of this tragedy, Yarrow finally convinces the US Navy to form Construction Battalions (CBs, or the more familiar \\"Seabees\\") with Donovan's assistance, despite their mutual romantic interest in war correspondent Constance Chesley. Donovan and many of his men enlist and receive formal military training. The two men are teamed together on yet another island. The Japanese launch a major attack, which the Seabees barely manage to hold off, sometimes using heavy construction machinery such as bulldozers and a clamshell bucket. When word reaches Donovan of another approaching enemy column, there are no sailors left to oppose this new threat. In desperation, he rigs a bulldozer with explosives on its blade, intending to ram it into a petroleum storage tank. The plan works, sending a cascade of burning liquid into the path of the Japanese, who retreat in panic, right into the sights of waiting machine guns. However, Wedge is shot in the process and dies in the explosion. A:","completion":"The full name of the man who clashes with Robert is Wedge Donovan."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie plot title: Inside Man Movie plot: Dalton Russell (Clive Owen) speaks into a camera, recording a description of the crime he has taken part in. He says that he is \\"stuck in a tiny cell\\" (we see a small portion of this cell, and Dalton writing in a journal and doing push-ups), and that he recently executed a bank robbery. He describes the who (himself), the what (the robbery), the where (his current location in 'a tiny cell'), the when (recently) and the why (because he can). He says the only question remaining is how the robbery was completed.A man gets into a Chevrolet Express van parked next to the Coney Island Cyclone. The driver is shown driving through Brooklyn, making a streetside pickup for another painter. The van then enters Manhattan via the Brooklyn Bridge and picks up a final passenger in Chinatown, before parking the van outside a branch of the Manhattan Trust Bank at 20 Exchange Place near Broadway and Wall Street. The driver and passengers are dressed alike in painter's clothes.As employees and customers at the bank carry on their business, the painters begin to unload what appear to be paint and painting supplies onto hand carts. Dalton, who is one of the painters, walks into the bank, and we recognize him despite the clothes and dark. He places two large, high-intensity flashlights on one of the small service tables in the center of the bank's lobby. He turns them on and points them at two of the bank's security cameras, blinding them.The other painters follow him into the bank but nobody notices them locking the doors shut. When they raise their masks over their mouths and noses, a guard approaches and questions what they are doing. Dalton walks up behind him and puts a gun into his side.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Below is a selection from a popular science book. If blood is red, why are veins blue? Actually, veins are not blue at all. They are more of a clear, yellowish colour. Although blood looks red when it's outside the body, when it's sitting in a vein near the surface of the skin, it's more of a dark reddish purple colour. At the right depth, these blood-filled veins reflect less red light than the surrounding skin, making them look blue by comparison. Which works harder, your heart or your brain? This question depends on whether you're busy thinking or busy exercising. Your heart works up to three times harder during exercise, and shifts enough blood over a lifetime to fill a supertanker. But, in the long run, your brain probably tips it, because even when you're sitting still your brain is using twice as much energy as your heart, and it takes four to five times as much blood to feed it. Do old people shrink as they age? Yes and no. Many people do get shorter as they age. But, when they do, it isn't because they're shrinking all over. They simply lose height as their spine becomes shorter and more curved due to disuse and the effects of gravity . Many (but not all) men and women do lose height as they get older. Men lose an average of 3-4 cm in height as they age, while women may lose 5 cm or more. If you live to be 200 years old, would you keep shrinking till you were, like 60 cm tall, like a little boy again?No, because old people don't really shrink!It is not that they are growing backwards--their legs, arms and backbones getting shorter. When they do get shorter, it's because the spine has shortened a little. Or, more often, become more bent and curved. Why does spinning make you dizzy ? Because your brain gets confused between what you're seeing and what you're feeling. The brain senses that you're spinning using special gravity and motion sensing organs in your inner ear, which work together with your eyes to keep your vision and balance stable. But when you suddenly stop spinning , the system goes out... Options: A Their spine is in active use. B They are more easily affected by gravity. C They keep growing backwards.

This article: The Symphony No. 8 in E-flat major by Gustav Mahler is one of the largest-scale choral works in the classical concert repertoire. Because it requires huge instrumental and vocal forces it is frequently called the \\"Symphony of a Thousand\\", although the work is normally presented with far fewer than a thousand performers and the composer did not sanction that name. The work was composed in a single inspired burst, at Maiernigg in southern Austria in the summer of 1906. The last of Mahler's works that was premiered in his lifetime, the symphony was a critical and popular success when he conducted the Munich Philharmonic in its first performance, in Munich, on 12 September 1910. The fusion of song and symphony had been a characteristic of Mahler's early works. In his \\"middle\\" compositional period after 1901, a change of direction led him to produce three purely instrumental symphonies. The Eighth, marking the end of the middle period, returns to a combination of orchestra and voice in a symphonic context. The structure of the work is unconventional; instead of the normal framework of several movements, the piece is in two parts. Part I is based on the Latin text of a 9th-century Christian hymn for Pentecost, Veni creator spiritus (\\"Come, Creator Spirit\\"), and Part II is a setting of the words from the closing scene of Goethe's Faust. The two parts are unified by a common idea, that of redemption through the power of love, a unity conveyed through shared musical themes. Mahler had been convinced from the start of the work's significance; in renouncing the pessimism that had marked much of his music, he offered the Eighth as an expression of confidence in the eternal human spirit. In the period following the composer's death, performances were comparatively rare. However, from the mid-20th century onwards the symphony has been heard regularly in concert halls all over the world, and has been recorded many times. While recognising its wide popularity, modern critics have divided opinions on the work; Theodor W.... contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who conducted the Munich Philharmonic in Munich on September 12, 1910?, what is it ?","completion":"The person who conducted the Munich Philharmonic in Munich on September 12, 1910, was Gustav Mahler himself. Mahler not only composed the Symphony No. 8 in E-flat major but also had the privilege to conduct its premiere performance.

Article: With smart phones taking the world by Storm, a phone that can only send and receive voice calls and text messages may seem like a relic from a bygone age. Yet in East Africa,simple phones like these are changing the face of the economy, thanks to the mobile money services that are spreading across the region. Using the text-messaging function built into the GSM system used by most cell phone networks, these services allow people without a bank account or credit card to use their phone as an electronic wallet that can be used to store. send or receive cash. It works like this: you pay cash to your local agent who then tops up your mobile money account using a secure form of text messaging. That money can be transferred to another person by sending a message to their cell phone account. For some the system is a lifeline. \\"If I didn't have my mobile phone. I would be very poor, \\"says Neyasse Neemur, a mother of four children who lives in northern Kenya. \\"Now I can sell fish.\\" Neemur took up fishing in July last year, but making money from it was a little tricky, especially as Turkana people do not usually eat fish. A truck from Ethiopia to Tanzania passes through her village once a week, and she arranged to have the driver transport the fish several hundred kilometres south to market in Kisumu, where her s sell the fish. \\"I get the money transfer immediately.\\" says Neemur. \\"Then I can pay for my children to go to school and for vegetables and beans,\\" she adds, \\"so I don't need to eat fish.\\" According to the Central Bank of Kenya, payments worth around l billion Kenyan shillings(13 million)per day were transferred through Kenya's mobile money systems in 2009, equaling the country's credit card transactions .

The breaches were only discovered when the third recipient alerted the prison to the fact they had received a file. The ministry said the prison had altered its procedures since the incidents in August 2011. The fine was imposed by the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO). After the data breach was reported an internal investigation was launched and the same error was found to have occurred on two previous occasions within the previous month, with details sent to different inmates' families. The ICO said neither incident was reported at the time. The emails about upcoming visits came from the prison clerk but also included a spreadsheet containing sensitive information including the names, ethnicity, addresses, sentence length, release dates and coded details of the offences carried out by all of the prison's 1,182 inmates. The ICO said police and a member of the prison staff were sent to visit the homes of those who had received the emails to check that the files had been deleted. The unauthorised disclosures were reported to the ICO on 8 September 2011. The ICO's investigation found that there was a clear lack of management oversight at the prison, with the clerk working unsupervised despite only having been at the prison for two months and having limited experience and training. A lack of audit trails also meant that the disclosures would have gone unnoticed if they had not been reported by one of the recipients, said the ICO. ICO deputy commissioner and director of data protection David Smith said: \\"The potential damage and distress that could have been caused by this serious data breach is obvious. \\"Disclosing this information not only had the potential to put the prisoners at risk, but also risked the welfare of their families through the release of their home addresses. \\"Fortunately it appears that the fall-out from this breach was contained, but we cannot ignore the fact that this breach was caused by a clear lack of management oversight of a relatively new member of staff.\\" Furthermore, said Mr Smith, the prison service failed to have procedures in place to spot the original mistakes. \\"It is only due to the honesty of a member of the public that the disclosures were uncovered as early as they were and that it was still possible to contain the breach,\\" he added. The investigation also found problems with the manner in which prisoners' records were handled, with unencrypted floppy disks regularly used to transfer large volumes of data between the prison's two separate networks. A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: \\"We treat the security of information very seriously and took immediate steps to recover the data as soon as the loss was reported to ensure that it went no further. \\"These types of incidents are extremely rare but this does not mean that we are complacent. \\"A thorough investigation was held by the prison who immediately altered their procedures, and further changes were implemented across the prison estate.\\" Summary:","completion":"A prison was fined by the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) for accidentally including sensitive information about its 1,182 inmates in emails meant for upcoming visits.

The mechanic quickly diagnosed the problem with the muffler but couldn't figure out what was wrong with the alternator, because the problem with the","completion":"alternator seemed to be intermittent and elusive. So, he decided to inspect the vehicle thoroughly to track down the root cause and fix it permanently. It had been a long day for the mechanic, with numerous vehicles passing through his workshop. But he was determined to resolve this problem. After checking the battery charge and ruling out any issues with the battery cables, he decided to examine the voltage regulator thoroughly, as it could also be a potential reason for the inconsistent power distribution. The meticulous inspection of the voltage regulator revealed that the wires seemed frayed and worn out. He figured that the damaged wires could cause power surges and dips as they sporadically lose connection to the alternator. The damages in the vehicle were far beyond this old mechanic's assumption. While he was under the hood, he noticed that some of the engine belts had visible cracks and showed signs of wear. He grabbed his notebook and jotted down some notes about belt replacement, alternator repair, and rewiring. He knew the customer would not be happy about the added cost to their service, but if these repairs were not made, the vehicle could easily break down in a short period. Knowing that he had potentially uncovered the source of the problem, he decided to perform one last test. He started the engine and monitored its functioning with a multimeter, checking for any inconsistencies in the voltage output. His suspicions were proved right: the voltage levels showed drastic fluctuations, thereby proving that the incomplete connection between the alternator and the voltage regulator was causing the alternator's sporadic performance. The mechanic heaved a heavy sigh because he knew that he would have to deliver this bad news to the customer. As a responsible professional, he knew it was his duty to convey these concerns to the vehicle owner. So, he invited the customer to his workshop, explained the situation in detail, and discussed the costs and options for repairs. The customer, visibly upset but understanding, begrudgingly agreed to move forward with the repairs. He replaced the damaged wiring and ensured the connections were secure. Next, he replaced the worn-out belts and installed a brand-new alternator. Though the job was tedious and time-consuming, the mechanic took pride in his work and delivered the completed vehicle to the customer. He provided all the necessary details: how the alternator would function at its best with the new wiring and the ups and downs of the voltage levels were gone. The customer listened intently and thanked the mechanic for his meticulous work. A few weeks later, the mechanic received a call from the customer conveying that the vehicle was running smoothly without any issues. The mechanic felt fulfilled and grateful for the kind words. As challenging as the repair was, he knew that his persistence and determination had paid off. This experience also provided him with valuable lessons which he shared with the other mechanics at the workshop. He emphasized the importance of thorough inspection, unbiased diagnosis, and honest communication with customers.

Context: WHITE HOUSE — President Donald Trump, after a tactical retreat this week on immigration policy, demonstrated Friday that there is no strategic shift to his overall tough approach to those attempting to illegally enter the country, and vowing to \\"end the immigration crisis, once and for all.\\" U.S. immigration laws, Trump declared, are \\"the weakest in the history of the world.\\" Trump made the remarks in an auditorium in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, adjacent to the White House, where he presided over an event with so-called \\"Angel Families,\\" those who have had relatives killed by people who entered the country illegally. \\"Your loss will not have been in vain,\\" the president told the families, who held large photos of their slain relatives. \\"We will secure our borders … the word will get out. Got to have a safe country. We're going to have a safe country.\\" Trump called family members to the presidential lectern to recount how their loved ones had been killed by those who were in the United States illegally. Several of those speaking condemned the media for ignoring the stories of the victims and praised Trump and Vice President Mike Pence for their attention to border security. Crime assertion Trump, in his remarks, also suggested those illegally in the United States commit more crimes on a statistical basis than citizens or resident aliens. However, studies have shown that undocumented immigrants are less likely to commit a crime in the U.S. than native-born citizens, including one published by the libertarian CATO Institute this year. Following intense domestic and international condemnation, Trump on Wednesday signed an order ending his administration's practice of separation of children from their families while parents were being prosecuted for crossing the border illegally. The administration's recently implemented \\"zero tolerence\\" policy led to the criminal prosecutions of undocumented border crossers, which in turn led to federal officials separating adults and their children. Question: What did President Trump think of the compliments from the Angel Families? Answer: (a). They made him feel proud of the work he had done on border security.; (b). not enough information; (c). They were for Mike Pence only and not him.; (d). They made him feel afraid of Angel Families.; Answer:","completion":"(b). not enough information"},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

By Gerard Couzens for MailOnline Police believe that the Irish gangster gunned down in a Costa del Sol bar popular with Irish tourists was lured to his death by a mystery woman. Detectives recovered a mobile believed to belong to Gerard ‘Hatchet’ Kavanagh from the murder scene at the upmarket resort of Elviria near Marbella. They are now working through the numbers on it to see who called him before he died. The 44-year-old gangland enforcer was shot nine times in a professional hit just before 5pm local time on Saturday as he had a drink on an Irish bar terrace with an unidentified female. Blaze: The 4x4 was found near a supermarket three miles west on the road towards","completion":"Marbella, fully engulfed in flames. Investigators believe that the killers torched the vehicle to destroy any traces of evidence that may have been left behind after speeding away from the bar. The burnt-out vehicle was discovered by a local resident who alerted the emergency services, and the fire brigade was called to extinguish the blaze. Firefighters found the 4x4 charred and completely destroyed, making it difficult to retrieve any valuable information from the wreckage. However, the fact that the vehicle was set ablaze points to the high level of calculation and preparation by the culprits in covering their tracks. Suspicion has now turned to the mysterious woman who was by Kavanagh's side at the time of his murder. She has seemingly vanished without a trace since the incident, leaving investigators with more questions than answers. Witnesses described her as confident and alluring, sparking theories that she may have been a 'honey trap' used to isolate Kavanagh and make him an easy target. As detectives pore over Kavanagh's retrieved mobile phone, they hope to learn more about his final moments alive. The information on his phone would not only offer insight into the tangled web of lies and betrayals surrounding the victim's life but could also potentially hold critical evidence to solving the case. Key pieces of information such as call logs, messages, and GPS records could help officers unravel the truth behind the murder and perhaps even lead them to the identity of the perpetrators. The brutal slaying of Kavanagh has left many puzzled, as the gangland enforcer was known to be a feared and dangerous figure within the criminal underworld. Although not highly ranked, the reputation of 'Hatchet' was well established, making this targeted attack even more brazen and audacious. Police now speculate that the killing has all the hallmarks of a professionally orchestrated hit - perhaps done by rival gang members or even someone from his own organization. As the story unfolds, the Costa del Sol residents and Irish tourists alike anxiously watch as law enforcement pieces together the puzzle surrounding Gerard 'Hatchet' Kavanagh's death. One thing is for sure: the beaches and nightclubs of the popular Spanish resort are now tainted with the ever growing shadow of gangland violence. The once tranquil haven for holidaymakers has transformed into a breeding ground for criminals, lured by the sun-soaked beaches and lucrative rewards associated with drug smuggling, money laundering, and other forms of organized crime. Ultimately, the investigation must move quickly in order to catch those responsible for the ruthless murder of Kavanagh and prevent any further bloodshed. If left unchecked, the violence might escalate, resulting in an even more deadly and dangerous situation for both tourists and residents on the picturesque Costa del Sol. As authorities race against time to solve the case, it remains evident that the events unfolding on these sun-kissed shores are far from idyllic."},{"prompt":"In this task, you will be shown an English sentence.

Summarize the following: It is essential to get a checkup at your vet before your travel in order to receive a health certificate, often required for airline travel, and proof of vaccination. Many transportation services open to the public (trains, planes, boats) require a health certificate and proof of vaccination before agreeing to transport your dog. Carry all of your dog’s documentation with you while you are travelling to avoid any issues with veterinary border control or emergency illnesses. Depending on where you're traveling, your pet's health certificate may need to be issued no earlier than 10 days before your travel date. While you're at the vet, be sure to stock up on all necessary medications. If you are flying or driving to another country, be sure to check for their immigration and veterinary border control policies. Contact the airline you are traveling with as well as the border control for the country you will be arriving in to find out what restrictions and laws you need to abide by.k Some countries will require your dog to have specific vaccinations. They may also require your dog to be quarantined for a certain amount of time upon arrival at their border. Consult the airline you are travelling with to be put in touch with veterinary border control. Some airlines will not transport certain dog breeds, and some airlines won't fly dogs in extreme heat or cold. Crating your dog is recommended for both their and your safety. Before crating, be sure to exercise your dog so that they are more comfortable resting. Go for an extra long walk or run before putting your dog in the car or arriving at the airport. Whether you are driving or flying you’ll eventually need to find a dog-friendly hotel. Ask your hotel what their pet policies are when you are booking. Some hotels charge extra for animals, and some have breed and size restrictions. Bring extra waste bags and wipes in case your dog has an accident at the hotel. Find out if your accommodation is near a park, lake, trail, or field that you and your dog can walk to for exercise and bathroom breaks. It comes in handy for cuts, ticks and the like. It will give you peace of mind if nothing else! Make sure your kit also includes any medications that your dog might need. Emergency kits should contain all of your dog’s relevant paperwork, a nylon leash, muzzle, and various medical supplies like hydrogen peroxide, gauze, bandages, tweezers, and adhesive tape. Sedating your dog can often cause unwanted complications as most sedatives will reduce your dog’s response to pressure and climate changes. Instead of sedating your dog, be sure to give them plenty of exercise before crating and have drinking water close by. Consult your vet if you are concerned that your dog may be in need of a sedative or tranquilizer while travelling.","completion":"Before you travel with your dog, you need to visit the vet to get a health certificate and proof of vaccination, because trains, planes, and boats usually need to see these papers.

Chocolate is recession proof because we turn to it as a treat. Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"Title: Low-Cost Chocolate Treats: A Recipe for Thriving Through Recession Introduction Every now and then, the hope of recovery from a recession is dampened by the fear of economic nosedives. Amidst these uncertain times, market research firm Mintel sheds light on the significance of low-cost chocolate treats in aiding consumer spending during a recession. In this article, we will discuss why chocolate is considered recession-proof, how low-cost chocolate treats can stimulate spending and what this means for the confectionery industry. The Recession-Proof Nature of Chocolate Chocolate has often been fondly regarded as a 'comfort food'. The time-tested treat has a rich history of lifting moods and providing solace in times of despair. According to Mintel, chocolate is recession-proof because it caters to our inherent need for indulgence during stressful periods. As the economic landscape becomes more turbulent, consumers are likely to seek affordable ways to treat themselves, and chocolate steals the show as the perfect low-cost treat. Low-Cost Treats Stimulating Consumer Spending In difficult economic times, household budgets tend to tighten, and consumers prioritize their spending. Low-cost chocolate treats offer a delectable reprieve and a luxury experience at a fraction of the price compared to other indulgences. This encourages consumers to allocate more of their discretionary income towards confections, thereby boosting overall spending. When higher-end, luxury chocolate becomes less affordable for a significant share of the population, low-cost treats gain the spotlight. Mintel's observations highlight that these affordable treats will drive an increase in consumer spending. The behavior is reminiscent of the lipstick effect, a phenomenon observed in previous recessions where consumers are inclined to purchase small luxuries even in times of economic downturn. Furthermore, low-cost chocolate treats are scalable and easily accessible. They cater to consumers across a broad range of income levels without any compromise on quality or taste. Simple bars and bites that delight the senses speak to a sense of communal enjoyment and nostalgia. This mass appeal, coupled with keeping costs low, ensures that the demand remains strong, encouraging consumer spending and mitigating the impact of recessions on the confectionery industry. Thriving Confectionery Industry Amidst Recessions Mintel's insights on low-cost chocolate treats' impact on consumer spending can be pivotal for the confectionery industry during recessions. By focusing on delivering quality chocolate products at affordable prices, companies can leverage the recession-proof nature of chocolate while expanding their consumer base. Investing in research and development to craft cost-effective chocolates without compromising on taste and experience is essential for confectionery companies. This will not only lead to increased sales but also nurture brand loyalty and repeat purchasing even during economic hardships. Additionally, confectionery companies should consider targeted marketing campaigns that highlight the affordability and quality of low-cost chocolate treats. Creative campaigns appealing to the emotional and comforting aspects of these treats can provide consumers with a much-needed break from challenges posed by a recession. Conclusion The fact that chocolate treats are recession-proof offers hope to consumers and the confectionery industry alike during economic downturns. The key to thriving through a recession relies on providing low-cost, yet delightful chocolate treats that fulfill our innate need for indulgence. By recognizing this, confectionery companies can enhance consumer spending, garner loyalty and ultimately ride the wave of recession with greater resilience and confidence."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: What is the first name of the person whose art also bears some stylistic resemblance to the work of European post-impressionists such as Vincent van Gogh? Answer the above question based on the context below: Thomson was largely self-taught. His experiences as a graphic designer with Toronto's Grip Ltd. honed his draughtsmanship. Although he began painting and drawing at an early age, it was only in 1912, when he was well into his thirties, that he began to paint seriously. His first trips to Algonquin Park inspired him to follow the lead of fellow artists in producing oil sketches of natural scenes on small, rectangular panels for easy portability while travelling. Between 1912 and his death in 1917, Thomson produced hundreds of these small sketches, many of which are now considered works in their own right, and are mostly found in the Art Gallery of Ontario in Toronto, the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa, the McMichael Canadian Art Collection in Kleinburg and the Tom Thomson Art Gallery in Owen Sound.Thomson produced nearly all of his works between 1912 and 1917. Most of his large canvases were completed in his most productive period, from late 1916 to early 1917. The patronage of James MacCallum enabled Thomson's transition from graphic designer to professional painter. Although the Group of Seven was not founded until after his death, his work was sympathetic to that of group members A. Y. Jackson, Frederick Varley, and Arthur Lismer. These artists shared an appreciation for rugged, unkempt natural scenery, and all used broad brush strokes and a liberal application of paint to capture the beauty and colour of the Ontario landscape. Thomson's art also bears some stylistic resemblance to the work of European post-impressionists such as Vincent van Gogh. Other key influences were the Art Nouveau and Arts and Crafts movements of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, styles with which he became familiar while working in the graphic arts. The answer is:","completion":"The first name of the person referred to in the context, who's art also bears some stylistic resemblance to the work of European post-impressionists such as Vincent van Gogh, is Thomson.

To answer this question, we must consider what Logan knows about the pineapple's location. When Logan was last in the pantry, the pineapple was in the blue_bathtub. He does not know that Aria has moved the pineapple to the blue_suitcase. Therefore, Logan's belief doesn't match the reality. This situation falls into the second scenario, where the individual's belief does not match reality.

Question: \\"What proportion of Greece's energy was from renewable sources in the year that was before 2009?\\" Context: \\"In 2008 renewable energy accounted for 8% of the country's total energy consumption, a rise from the 7.2% it accounted for in 2006, but still below the EU average of 10% in 2008. 10% of the country's renewable energy comes from solar power, while most comes from biomass and waste recycling. In line with the European Commission's Directive on Renewable Energy, Greece aims to get 18% of its energy from renewable sources by 2020. In 2013 and for several months, Greece produced more than 20% of its electricity from renewable energy sources and hydroelectric power plants. Greece currently does not have any nuclear power plants in operation, however in 2009 the Academy of Athens suggested that research in the possibility of Greek nuclear power plants begin.\\" Answer: The answer to this question is:","completion":"In 2008, Greece sourced 8% of its total energy consumption from renewable sources. This marked an increase from the 7.2% figure in 2006 but still remained below the European Union's average of 10% for the same year. Among the various renewable sources, solar power contributed 10% to Greece's renewable energy mix, while the majority of the produced energy came from biomass and waste recycling. Driven by the European Commission's Directive on Renewable Energy, Greece set an ambitious target to achieve 18% of its energy generation from renewable sources by the year 2020. This goal demonstrates the country's commitment to promoting clean and sustainable energy practices, reducing its dependence on fossil fuels, and aligning itself with global climate change initiatives. In 2013, Greece made significant progress in increasing its renewable energy production. For several months that year, over 20% of the electricity generated in the country came from renewable energy sources and hydroelectric power plants. This demonstrated the nation's potential to not only meet but also exceed its renewable energy targets. At present, Greece does not have any operational nuclear power plants. Nonetheless, the Academy of Athens in 2009 encouraged research into the possibility of constructing Greek nuclear power plants. This suggestion may have been influenced by a desire to further diversify Greece's energy portfolio and explore alternative, low-carbon energy sources that can help the country achieve its sustainability and energy security goals. In summary, by focusing on renewable energy sources such as solar power, biomass, and waste recycling, Greece made strides in adopting sustainable energy practices and reducing its reliance on fossil fuels. While 8% of the country's total energy consumption came from renewable sources in 2008, the Greek government remained committed to its target of achieving 18% by 2020 and continues to explore the feasibility of incorporating nuclear power into its long-term energy strategy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Syd studied plate tectonics and mantle melting. His brother Dan got to study types of soil and pedology. and a hint : Mantle melting can come about three ways: (1) when the temperature rises, (2) if the pressure lowers (which lowers the melting point), and (3) if water is added, which lowers the melting point. Two of these (1 and 3) might explain why there are volcanoes at convergent plate boundaries the temperature of the subducting plate increases as it sinks into the hot mantle (1). Sediments lying on top of the subducting plate contain water. As the sediments subduct, the water rises into the overlying mantle material. This lowers the melting temperature of the mantle (3). When the mantle above the subducting plate melts, volcanoes form above it. This leads to volcanoes in an island arc or continental arc.

The reason lies in the different elements present in both the premise and the hypothesis. The premise states the following: 1. The speaker is asking if someone has tried growing fruits and vegetables. 2. The speaker is specifically enquiring about growing these plants indoors, using pots or other containers. On the other hand, the hypothesis focuses on the following aspects: 1. The speaker is again asking if someone has tried planting fruits and vegetables. 2. However, here, the focus is explicitly on growing these plants in a garden. Although both the premise and the hypothesis are centered on growing fruits and vegetables, the environments in which they are referring to the plants being grown are different. The premise concerns indoor cultivation, possibly with limited space and using pots or containers. In contrast, the hypothesis refers to outdoor cultivation in a garden.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. This article: During the 1913 Ballets Russes season in Paris, Monteux conducted two more premieres. The first was Jeux, with music by Debussy and choreography by Nijinsky. The choreography was not liked; Monteux thought it \\"asinine\\", while Debussy felt that \\"Nijinsky's cruel and barbarous choreography ... trampled over my poor rhythms like so many weeds\\". The second new work was Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring given under the French title, Le sacre du printemps. Monteux had been appalled when Stravinsky first played the score at the piano: I decided then and there that the symphonies of Beethoven and Brahms were the only music for me, not the music of this crazy Russian. ... My one desire was to flee that room and find a quiet corner in which to rest my aching head. Then [Diaghilev] turned to me and with a smile said, \\"This is a masterpiece, Monteux, which will completely revolutionize music and make you famous, because you are going to conduct it.\\" And, of course, I did. Despite his initial reaction, Monteux worked with Stravinsky, giving practical advice to help the composer to achieve the orchestral balance and effects he sought. Together they worked on the score from March to May 1913, and to get the orchestra of the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées to cope with the unfamiliar and difficult music Monteux held seventeen rehearsals, an unusually large number. Monteux's real attitude to the score is unclear. In his old age he told a biographer, \\"I did not like Le Sacre then. I have conducted it fifty times since. I do not like it now.\\" However, he told his wife in 1963 that the Rite was \\"now fifty years old, and I do not think it has aged at all.

People have various reasons for not wanting to attend social gatherings, and avoiding large groups might be one of them. This answer seems plausible, especially considering the fact that large gatherings can trigger various emotions in people, such as social anxiety, fear of judgment, or simply being overwhelmed due to the number of people present. Kai's preference for not attending the party could stem from a myriad of reasons, such as being an introvert, experiencing discomfort in crowded social settings, or even being sensitive to loud noises typically associated with parties. Moreover, Kai could also be concerned about the health risks attached to attending a gathering with a considerable number of people, particularly in light of the ongoing global pandemic. Suppose Kai's intention of not attending the party is truly to avoid a large group.

There were more questions about the dams on Oregon's Klamath River shutting off the salmon run for Indian tribes than the damming up of the credit markets. The word \\"recession\\" was never mentioned. \\"Inflation\\" only once. No one asked about the 1.6 billion loss Berkshire took on a derivative position in the last quarter. Not a soul inquired about the decline in Berkshire's earnings. Buffett's brilliant call in buying Brazilian currency (the real) never got a nod, even though Standard & Poor's raised that nation's credit to investment grade last week. Nor did anyone raise the provocative theme put forth in Buffett's letter to shareholders (See \\"Croesus, Buffett: New Advice From On High\\") that investors should not expect to earn on their common stock positions the modest 5.3% rate of return earned during the whole of the 20th century. Were none of the 30,000 shareholders alert enough to take the opportunity to ask Buffett what rate of return they could expect? After all, many small investors count on their Berkshire holdings as an important stake and nest egg. \\"Anyone who wants us to repeat the past should sell [his or her] stock,\\" said the Oracle of Omaha, without any follow-up questions from alarmed shareholders. Be fairly warned. This passivity cannot be due to Buffett's willingness to appear on a certain cable network nine times and another one five times since October 2007. This was a chance blown to find out how Buffett and Munger weighed the risks in the world. It was Buffett's acerbic partner Charles Munger who finally exclaimed that \\"we are having convulsions that make Enron look like a tea party. We will have changes in regulation but they won't work perfectly.\\" No one asked Munger what changes he saw on the horizon. Later on the 84-year-old Los Angeles lawyer described the convulsion as \\"a huge dislocation that was very extreme but very brief. It's interesting how brief these opportunities are.\\" Nevertheless, Berkshire was able to accumulate a 4 billion position in auction rate notes when that market froze up some weeks ago. It included the short-term debts of the nonprofit Los Angeles County Museum of Art at interest rates of 8% to 10%--triple the 3% to 4% the same notes sold for in January. Perhaps it was this opportunity that Munger chose to describe in his no-holds-barred style--\\"some idiot hedge fund bought municipal bonds on incredible margin. These things were disposed on a margin call,\\" meaning that the fund had to sell because it didn't have the capital to support its position. After a lunch break, Buffett finally got in some licks at the regulator of Fannie Mae (nyse: FNM - news - people ) and Freddie Mac (nyse: FRE - news - people )--Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight--for allowing accounting irregularities to go on for some time. Buffett, who describes himself as \\"the chief risk officer\\" of Berkshire, also slammed the large commercial and investment banks as both too big to manage and too big to fail, according to the government. He reckoned that the failure of Bear Stearns (nyse: BSC - news - people ) would have caused the failure of \\"another investment bank or two going down in a day or two.\\" The panic would have been caused by financial institutions \\"trying to undo 14.5 trillion [worth of] derivatives contracts in just hours, not days or weeks. Hardly anyone caught Buffett side-kick Munger muttering that \\"to some extent it's an evil culture.\\" The evil culture he was talking about was Wall Street, the commercial and investment banks who had no idea that their risk models were utterly useless. \\"They didn't have the faintest idea what risks were involved,\\" he said. As for politics, Buffett, a Democrat, said all three candidates are intelligent. But he scoffed at the way both Clinton and Obama \\"ask for an excess profits tax on Exxon\\"--but not on the farmers getting rich off the boom in commodity prices. Munger added that \\"while we don't like inflation because it's bad for our country, we'll probably make more money over time because there is inflation.\\" On oil prices, Buffett predicted that production will level off and then start to decline, which will tend to put a floor under the price of oil. His politically incorrect partner Munger declared that \\"in the 1930s [when oil was first discovered in the Middle East] we should have taken the oil out of the Middle East and put it in the ground\\" in the U.S. \\"Eventually,\\" Munger predicted, \\"we'll have to use the sun for our power.\\" On a lighter note, the high point of the meeting was a cartoon film that had Munger being elected president on the Financially Independent ticket--and naming Buffett secretary of commerce, secretary of the Treasury and chairman of the Federal Reserve all at once. In a serious vein, Buffett later said his inclination would be to raise taxes on the super-rich (himself included, of course) and lower them on the middle class, a position shared by both of the Democratic candidates. As for the stock market, Buffett, made it crystal clear that \\"Charlie and I haven't the faintest idea where [it's] going.\\" More from Croesus in Omaha Sunday. Stay tuned.

Summary:","completion":"The Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting attended by 30,000 saw an absence of discussion on the financial crisis and decline in the company's earnings. CEO Warren Buffett expressed concerns about the large commercial and investment banks, describing them as \\"too big to manage and too big to fail\\". He predicted oil production would level off, while futuristically considering the use of solar power. In a lighter moment, a cartoon film depicted Buffett taking up multiple roles in the US government."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Summarize: Chicks need plenty of protein, which is found in the starter feeds. The starter feeds also offer other nutrients and vitamins that enable the chicks to grow into healthy, fully-grown quail. Use long, straight troughs for brooding chicks. Transition to circular feeders after the chicks are 2 weeks old. Use a smaller bowl for water. Chicks can eat fine crumble until they are 6 to 8 weeks old. A coarser texture, or pellets, are better for older quail. When raising chicks, teach them how to drink by dipping their beaks into the bowl/dish. If they have their mother hen with them, this is not much of a worry as she will show them how to drink. The best feed for quail is a game bird feed that has at least 20 percent protein or more. Quail feed is expected to have plenty of protein to enable them to have a balanced diet for them to grow into great, healthy pets. If you are planning on using the quail for their meat, you do not need to give them a developer feed. Give them a finisher feed instead. If you are going to use your quail for breeding or laying eggs, slowly transition them to the new diet before they hit 10 weeks of age. Layer-pellets provide enough calcium for your quail to lay strong, healthy eggs. Make sure to grind the pellets up a bit if you find the quail quite big for them. This is especially important if you buy chicken pellets, as these are bigger than the quail layer-pellets. Just make sure you don't grind them up into a powder. Clean the water bowl one to three times a week and refill once a day. The bowls will tend to get dirty, as the quail will often stand in them, spill dirt/bedding in them and do all-sorts!","completion":"To raise healthy quail chicks, provide them with starter feeds containing high protein and essential nutrients.

Summarize the following: These aren’t absolutely necessary to sell a print version of your comic book, but they make distribution and retail much simpler. An ISBN number identifies your book by the title, cover and page number while the barcode allows it to be scanned. This gives you the option to sell your books in stores, be they online or brick and mortar. While any version of a comic book will need a cover, it’s especially important for printed comic books. You can draw and design your own cover, or you can collaborate with other artists for a different look. If you decide to stick to selling in online stores, the cover will be crucial for identifying your book, especially if you’ve bought an ISBN number. You can research print-on-demand companies to choose the one that benefits you. However they all work in essentially the same way; they handle the printing for you and only print copies as they’re ordered. This means you won’t have to hoard hundreds of copies of your comic book and ship them out yourself. The important thing to keep in mind is comparing the cost of this service to the advantages. A proof copy is a printed version of your book that you can review for errors before your comic goes to print. You’ll likely have to pay a fee, but you’ll get a good idea of what your comic book is going to look like when your readers order it. You might find that certain design choices that look good on a computer screen don’t look as good in print, and you can review them before the comic book is in the hands of your readers. While you’ll find comic books from major publishers on store shelves, it’s more difficult for independent comics to break into the same distribution networks. Instead, market to your readers directly. You can use an online platform like Amazon to handle the actual transaction and shipping; use social media and traditional networking to get your book out where readers can see them. If you want to deal with your readers directly, you can use an online marketplace such as Etsy to sell to them directly. You’ll need to handle the shipping of the comics yourself however. A popular method of marketing comic books is buying a table at comic book conventions. There you can sell your books in person and offer autographed versions. Summary:","completion":"To streamline the distribution and retail process of selling a print version of your comic book, consider acquiring an ISBN number and barcode, which enable selling in both physical and online stores. A well-designed cover is crucial for printed comic books, as it helps identify your book. Utilize print-on-demand companies to handle printing and shipping, while comparing their costs to the benefits of their service. Review a proof copy of your book for any errors or design choices before heading to the final print. As independent comics face challenges in distribution networks, use platforms like Amazon, Etsy, or market directly through social media and traditional networking methods. Attending comic book conventions is also an effective way to market your comic books and interact personally with potential readers."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: COLUMBUS, Ohio--The heart operation taking place in the pale-green operating room at the Ohio State University Medical Center was unusual. The patient, a 62-year-old man, was made to sleep, tied with blue drapes and lying face up on a narrow table. But no one was touching him. Instead, the operation was being performed by a robot, whose three metal arms went through pencil-sized holes in the man's chest. At the ends of the robot's arms were tiny metal fingers, with turning wrists, which held a tiny instrument, a light and a camera. The robot's arms and fingers were controlled by Dr. Randall K. Wolf, sitting at a computer in a corner of the operating room about 20 feet away. This sort of operation, heart surgeons say, is the start of what may be the biggest change in their profession since heart bypass surgery began nearly 30 years ago. \\"The reason we make cuts is that we have big hands,\\" said Dr. Wolf, the director of the surgery at Ohio State. The robot's _ fingers, no longer than a nail on the small finger, at the end of the long sticks could work better. Eventually, surgeons believe, most heart surgery will be done by robots whose arms are put in through pencil-sized holes punched in patients' chests. Instead of directly staring into a patient's body, surgeons will view magnified images of the operation on computer screens. In theory, the doctor would not have to be in the same room, or even the same country, as the patient. According to the passage, the reason that most operations require large cuts is that _ . A) patients have large organs B) surgeons have large hands C) large cuts take less time D) large cuts cost less money Answer:","completion":"B) surgeons have large hands"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Options: - drunkenness - arrest - fall down - regret - vomit Explain why a human would choose \\"arrest\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","completion":"A human would choose \\"arrest\\" as the answer to the question because it best describes the likely response of the authorities in such a situation. When a person becomes inebriated and starts a fight, they are typically exhibiting aggressive and dangerous behavior, which poses a risk to themselves and others around them. The options provided each represent different aspects or consequences of intoxication, but \\"arrest\\" is the most directly related to the involvement of the authorities. Let's analyze each option in detail: 1. Drunkenness: This option describes the state of being intoxicated, which is the root cause of the scenario. While this is relevant, it does not answer the question regarding the authorities' response to the situation. 2. Arrest: This option implies that the authorities, such as the police, would intervene to restore order and ensure public safety. By arresting the person who started the fight, they would aim to deescalate the situation and hold the individual accountable for their actions. Given the context of the question, this is the most appropriate answer. 3. Fall down: Falling down is a potential consequence of inebriation, as impaired coordination and balance can lead to accidents. However, this does not address the aspect of the question referring to the response of the authorities. 4. Regret: Regret is a feeling that can occur after a person has become sober and realized the negative consequences of their actions while intoxicated. While this emotional response may be relevant for the individual involved in the fight, it does not provide any insight into how the authorities would handle the situation. 5. Vomit: Vomiting is another possible consequence of excessive alcohol consumption, but like falling down and regret, it does not directly pertain to the authorities' response to the situation. In conclusion, a human would choose \\"arrest\\" to answer the question because it accurately portrays the most plausible action that authorities would take in the event of an inebriated person starting a fight. The remaining options, while related to various aspects of intoxication, do not effectively address the role of the authorities in dealing with such a situation. Arresting the individual serves the purpose of maintaining public safety and holding the person accountable for their actions, making \\"arrest\\" the most appropriate answer."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The actress looked stunning in a revealing white Versace gown with a plunging neckline and cut away sides that showcased her toned figure. So what's the secret to the 35-year-old's amazing body? Does she have to work out 24/7 in order to look so athletic? Scroll down for video. Stole the show: Kate Hudson wore a revealing white Versace gown with a plunging neckline. Consistency is key: The actress admitted her slim and toned figure is down to working out regularly. Not at all, the mother-of-two told The Sunday Times Style magazine. In fact, she said her fitness is often thanks to just 20 minutes of exercise a day. She said: 'I'm a big believer in doing 20 minutes of exercise a day. I love skipping with a rope because it's one of the hardest cardio exercises you can do, but it's so easy. I do three sets of three minutes; I'm always shocked at how sweaty I get.' She added in a separate interview with US Weekly that consistency is key to her maintaining her fabulous figure. She said people can't expect to have a body like hers unless they are prepared to make exercise a way of life - which doesn't mean it becomes all-consuming. She explains: 'I wouldn't say (I work out) a lot, just consistently. People think for some reason you have to work out for two and a half hours… but, it can be little. It can be 20 minutes, it could be 40 minutes. Keep fit: Kate will often do a mile run before a Pilates class. 'You can't do like two weeks and go like do two days and then take a week off and then do three days and then go, 'Why aren't I seeing results? I don't get it.' You know, you just got to do it - sad, like anything else in life!'

If I go past noon, it's hard for me to exercise. If you wake up and just do it, then it's done.' The How to Lose a Guy in Ten Days actress has long been a fan of Pilates and she credits this with keeping her toned and strong. Nicole Stuart, Kate's Pilates trainer, told Shape magazine the actress will do a Pilates class three times a week, usually preceded by a mile run. Look the part, feel the part: The actress has her own sports clothing range Fabletics which she says is flattering and functional for all body shapes. Support: The actress is passionate about encouraging more women to become active. Don't be shy: The actress gives it her all in the gym and says women shouldn't feel embarrassed about being seen working out. Explaining the benefits of Pilates, Nicole said: 'It primarily works your core, but not just the front. 'You'll work the entire body - front, sides, back, your whole midsection, trunk - it pulls everything in and together. 'You'll become tighter, more toned, and stronger. It makes you stand taller, makes you have more confidence, makes you more grounded. You'll lose inches and get that leaner, longer look. After the first 10 sessions, you'll feel different. After 20 sessions, you'll see a difference!' Kate has proved she's passionate about health and fitness and advocates everyone giving exercise a go, regardless of their current ability. She adds that women should not feel embarrassed about working out in public. Healthy eater: Maintaining a good diet also contributes to her amazing figure but she said she still enjoys M&Ms and wine. Dazzling: The mother-of-two on stage and on the red carpet at last night's awards. 'When you get into fitness classes, nobody cares, nobody's looking at anyone else. It doesn't matter what you do or where you come from, you just become a class and everybody's there supporting everybody, and you're all there for the same reason,' she said. The actress has founded the website Fabletics with the goal of getting more people active. Members of the site can gain access to fitness programmes and support from other users. She said: 'One of the reasons I love this company is that we are trying to make something affordable that could reach a demographic that don't necessarily have the means to go to a personal trainer every day, and to motivate people to just feel good in themselves. I think that all starts with being active.' Kate has also released an accompanying fashion range of fitness clothing which she says is functional and flattering for women of all shapes and sizes. As a mother to Bingham, ten, with ex-husband Chris Robinson. and Ryder, three, whose father, Matthew Bellamy, she split up with at the end of last year, Kate said getting the energy to exercise isn't always easy. So when she needs a good night's sleep, she calls on her mother Goldie Hawn to babysit. She revealed that diet is also an integral part of her health and wellbeing. 'Healthy food inspires me. It's important to know what you're eating because food is fuel, and we don't want to fuel our bodies in a way that could make them sick,' she said. But she added that she's not 'a health nut' as she'll tuck into M&Ms occasionally and loves to drink wine.

Context: Hoping to extend the Continental System, Napoleon invaded Iberia and declared his brother Joseph the King of Spain in 1808. The Spanish and the Portuguese revolted with British support. The Peninsular War lasted six years, noted for its brutal guerrilla warfare, and culminated in an Allied victory. Fighting also erupted in Central Europe, as the Austrians launched another attack against the French in 1809. Napoleon defeated them at the Battle of Wagram, dissolving the Fifth Coalition formed against France. By 1811, Napoleon ruled over 70 million people across an empire that had domination in Europe, which had not witnessed this level of political consolidation since the days of the Roman Empire. He maintained his strategic status through a series of alliances and family appointments. He created a new aristocracy in France while allowing the return of nobles who had been forced into exile by the Revolution.","completion":"In general, the article is about Napoleon's expansion of the Continental System, his invasion of Iberia, and the resulting wars in Europe, which led to his rule over a vast empire and the creation of a new aristocracy in France."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Jennifer is more artistic.","completion":"Kayla loves to play sports, but Jennifer really can't stand it because Jennifer is more artistic (Option B). The sentence above highlights the differences between Kayla and Jennifer's preferences regarding physical activities and their personal interests. While Kayla is passionate about playing sports, Jennifer does not share the same enthusiasm, as her interests are more inclined towards the artistic domain. Individuals possess a diverse range of hobbies and passions, and their preferences often determine their personalities and the choices they make in their lives. Kayla's inclination to play sports could be due to various factors, such as her natural athletic abilities, the excitement of competition, the feeling of accomplishment, or her dedication to maintaining physical fitness. On the other hand, Jennifer finds her joy and purpose in artistic pursuits and does not derive the same pleasure from sports activities. Jennifer's love for art may stem from her creativity, emotional expression, or simply her aesthetic sense. Art provides her with a platform to explore her imagination and to share her thoughts and feelings with others. Moreover, art has therapeutic qualities that allow Jennifer to relax, unwind and immerse herself in a world that speaks to her on a deeper level. Consequently, she may find sports taxing or uninteresting, as they do not offer her the same mental and emotional rewards that she receives from engaging in artistic endeavors. Both Kayla and Jennifer are quite distinct in terms of their likes and dislikes. Nevertheless, their differences open up opportunities for them to learn from each other and to respect the unique qualities that make them who they are. While sports and art may initially seem at odds with each other, they are, in fact, complementary in many ways.

Does the sentence \\"Bohemia (as Czech civilization was known by then) increased in power over the centuries, as its language did in regional importance.\\" provide a valid answer to the question \\"What did Jan Hus advocate for among the Czech commoners?\\"","completion":"No, the sentence \\"Bohemia (as Czech civilization was known by then) increased in power over the centuries, as its language did in regional importance.\\" does not provide a valid answer to the question \\"What did Jan Hus advocate for among the Czech commoners?\\". To provide a detailed and long answer to the question regarding Jan Hus' advocacy, let us first understand who Jan Hus was and the context of his actions. Jan Hus (1369-1415) was a Czech priest, philosopher, theologian, and reformer, who later became an influential figure in the history of Christianity and Bohemia. Jan Hus is best known for his efforts to reform the practices and beliefs of the Catholic Church, which led to his excommunication and eventual execution by burning at the stake. During the late 14th and early 15th centuries, there was a growing dissatisfaction among the people of Bohemia, including the Czech commoners, with the corruption and hierarchy within the Catholic Church. The Church was plagued by financial abuses, immorality among the clergy, and the lack of effective spiritual leadership. In this context, Jan Hus emerged as a seminal figure calling for much-needed changes. Though Jan Hus was influenced by the English reformer John Wycliffe, he developed his own ideas that addressed the unique challenges of the Czech church and society. Some of the key advocacies of Jan Hus among the Czech commoners were: 1. Elimination of corruption and financial abuses in the Church: Jan Hus called for the reduction of the wealth and worldly power of the clergy. He argued that such wealth corrupted the Church and stood in the way of spiritual growth. This resonated with the Czech commoners who felt exploited by the Church's financial demands. 2. Encouragement of the use of the Czech language in liturgy: Jan Hus advocated for the use of the vernacular (Czech) language in religious services, making them more accessible and understandable to the commoners. This was significant because, at that time, Latin was the exclusive language used in the Church administration and liturgy, which effectively alienated common people from participating in their own spiritual life. 3. Communion under both kinds - bread and wine: Jan Hus promoted the administration of the Holy Eucharist in both forms (bread and wine) to all believers, not just the clergy. This practice was a way to emphasize the equality of all Christians before God and reduce the hierarchical divide between the clergy and the laity. 4. Importance of personal piety and Bible study: Hus believed that individuals could access God's truth through their own conscience and by studying the Bible directly, rather than relying solely on the interpretation of the Church's clerical hierarchy. This encouraged Czech commoners to seek a more personal and direct relationship with God. While the sentence provided does not answer the question directly, it is important to acknowledge that Jan Hus' advocacy did contribute substantially to the empowerment of the Czech language, culture, and ultimately the influence of Bohemia in the region. Moreover, his reforming actions planted the seeds for the eventual emergence of Protestantism in Europe and the broader religious transformations that took place during the 16th century Reformation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Other notable sculptures nearby include Henry Moore's National Historic Landmark Nuclear Energy, which is on the site of the first self-sustaining nuclear reaction at the University of Chicago. Jackson Park, connected to Washington Park and Time by the Midway Plaisance, hosts the Chicago Landmark Statue of The Republic; at one time the Midway Plaisance, Jackson Park and Washington Park were jointly known as \\"South Park\\".There is little agreement on the dimensions of Time, with various sources describing it as between 102 to 127 feet (31.1 to 38.7 m) long. One of the few precise estimates describes it as 126 feet 10 inches (38.7 m) long, 23 feet 6 inches (7.2 m) wide and 24 feet (7.3 m) tall. The sources are often unclear about whether they are describing the width of the reflecting pool from exterior wall to exterior wall, the width of the water within the reflecting pool's interior walls, the width of the base of the sculpted mass of humanity, the width of the sculpted masses themselves, or the width of the..., what would be the answer ?

How do you say the word in French? In Spanish? In your language? Although people usually know what the word means, it often has no exact translation. It's not surprising really, because the idea of home differs from country to country, and from person to person. A home is more than a roof and four walls. It's the cooking, eating, talking, playing and family living that go on inside, which are important as well. And at home you usually feel safe and relaxed. But it's not just that homes look different in different countries, they also contain different things and reveal different attitudes and needs. For example, in cold northern Europe, there's a fire in the living room or kitchen and all the chairs face it. In the south, where the sun shines a lot and it's more important to keep the heat out, there are small windows, cool stone floors and often no carpets. We asked some people about their homes.

Translate \\"Both were romans à clef based on the radical adventures of Bernstein, Guy Debord, and their lovers and comrades.\\" to German?","completion":"Step 1: First, let's break the sentence down into simpler components so we can ensure an accurate translation. \\"Both were romans à clef\\" is the first component, meaning they are novels that represent real-life events or characters under the guise of fiction. \\"Based on the radical adventures of Bernstein, Guy Debord, and their lovers and comrades\\" is the second component. Here we are describing what these novels are based on. Step 2: Now let's begin to translate each component: For \\"Both were romans à clef\\", in German, it would be \\"Beide waren Schlüsselromane\\". \\"Both\\" translates to \\"Beide\\", \\"were\\" translates to \\"waren\\", and \\"romans à clef\\" is translated as \\"Schlüsselromane\\" in German. For \\"based on the radical adventures of Bernstein, Guy Debord, and their lovers and comrades\\", in German, it would be \\"basiert auf den radikalen Abenteuern von Bernstein, Guy Debord und ihren Geliebten und Kameraden\\". Here, \\"based on\\" is \\"basiert auf\\", \\"the radical adventures\\" translate into \\"den radikalen Abenteuern\\", \\"of\\" is translated into \\"von\\", \\"and\\" is translated into \\"und\\", \\"their\\" is translated into \\"ihren\\", \\"lovers\\" is \\"Geliebten\\", \\"and\\" again is \\"und\\", and finally \\"comrades\\" translates to \\"Kameraden\\". Step 3: Assemble the components. In German, the adjective often comes after the noun, so we need to adjust for that in our sentence structure: \\"Beide waren Schlüsselromane, basiert auf den radikalen Abenteuern von Bernstein, Guy Debord und ihren Geliebten und Kameraden\\".

Answer based on context: The Black Sea Fleet is the fleet of the Russian Navy in the Black Sea, the Sea of Azov and the Mediterranean Sea. The fleet is considered to have been founded by Prince Potemkin on May 13, 1783. In 1918, the fleet was inherited by the Russian SFSR then the Soviet Union in 1922, where it became part of the Soviet Navy. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, the Black Sea Fleet and most of its vessels were inherited by the Russian Federation. The Black Sea Fleet's official primary headquarters and facilities are located in the city of Sevastopol, which is de jure part of Ukraine but de facto part of Russia . The remainder of the fleet's facilities are based in various locations on the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov, including Krasnodar Krai, Rostov Oblast and Crimea. The current commander is Admiral Aleksandr Viktorovich Vitko, who has held the position since April 2013. Who inherited the Black Sea Fleet first, the Russian SFSR or the Soviet Union?","completion":"The Black Sea Fleet was first inherited by the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (SFSR). This occurred in 1918, just after the end of World War I and during the early days of the Russian Revolution. The Russian SFSR was one of the self-governing socialist republics that made up the Soviet Union. In 1917, the Russian RSFSR was established as a sovereign entity following the overthrow of the Russian Provisional Government in the Bolshevik-led Russian October Revolution. As an independent socialist republic, it had the political and administrative authority to inherit and manage assets, such as the Black Sea Fleet, within its geographical boundaries. The Russian SFSR retained control of the Black Sea Fleet for about four years, from 1918 to 1922. In December 1922, the Russian SFSR, together with the Transcaucasian SFSR, the Ukrainian SSR and the Byelorussian SSR, signed the Treaty on the Creation of the USSR, marking the establishment of the Soviet Union. Following the formation of the Soviet Union, control of the Black Sea Fleet transferred from the Russian SFSR to the newly created Union. This move was part of a larger centralization effort under the new federal structure, where most defense assets, including naval fleets, were taken under the direct control of the Union government, exemplifying the command economy practiced in the Soviet Union. As the Soviet Union assumed the management and command of the Black Sea Fleet, it became an integral component of the Soviet Navy, playing an essential role in the country's maritime defense strategy during most of the 20th century until the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. After the Soviet Union's collapse, the Russian Federation inherited the Black Sea Fleet along with most of its vessels. This continued the fleet's history under Russian governance, beginning with its foundation by Prince Potemkin in 1783, through its tenure with the Russian SFSR, and then the Soviet Union, and finally with its current stewardship by the Russian Federation."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

They both live alone in their homes since their wives have died, and exchange stories about how their friends are now dying when they are not busy insulting each other. They have a contemptuous rivalry that goes back over 50 years.A very attractive woman named Ariel, who is a little younger than them, moves in across the street during the days before Thanksgiving. She is so adventurous that she rides a snowmobile on the streets at night.Johns daughter Melanie has a baby girl but is separating from her husband. Maxs son Jacob is running for mayor of their town. Melanie and Jacob have an ongoing flirtation with each other.John is trying to evade the IRS, to whom he owes back taxes. One night he thinks the IRS has come for him, so he jumps out his bedroom window, and Ariel surprisingly shows up, asking to use his bathroom for no particular reason. She discloses that she has been watching how John and Max both ogle her.The next day, John tries to convince Max that his visit from Ariel was amorous in intent. Their bitter bickering at each other continues apace.Chuck is another older man who runs a local bait shop. He challenges John and Max to think about how attractive they actually are to women anymore.Johns father, known as Grandpa, goes ice-fishing out on a frozen lake, where his son and Max (and many other local men) also have their own little fishing shacks. Grandpa is a blithe spirit at the age of 94, enjoying a bounty of liquor and non-filtered cigarettes.One evening Chuck goes to visit Ariel at her home, which John and Max intently spy upon. When later asked why he was with her, Chuck says they did not have sex but something more like a spiritual awakening.John and Max thus both plan visits to Ariel and spend much time making themselves presentable.

Answer:","completion":"John and Max's rivalry is over the attention and affection of Ariel, the attractive woman who moves in across the street. Ariel, a little younger than John and Max, is an adventurous woman who catches the eye of both men. As their rivalry escalates, John and Max bicker with each other, trying to outdo the other in their pursuit of Ariel. The rivalry between John and Max is further fueled by their existing contemptuous relationship, which spans over 50 years. Although their rivalry appears to center around Ariel, it is also a product of their long-standing animosity and competition with each other. Ariel's presence in the neighborhood revitalizes their rivalry, giving them a new reason to compete with one another. As the story unfolds, John and Max make attempts to impress and woo Ariel, even though they face criticism from other characters, such as Chuck, who challenges them to think about how attractive they actually are to women anymore. In their pursuit of Ariel, both John and Max feel the need to compete with each other, driving the rivalry even further. In conclusion, John and Max's rivalry revolves around their shared infatuation with Ariel, the attractive and adventurous woman who moves in across the street. The presence of Ariel reinvigorates their long-standing animosity and competition with one another, creating an intense and ongoing rivalry over her attention and affection."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Staying active during the day may help alleviate any back pain you have. It will also help you burn energy, which will make it easier to fall asleep at night. Aerobic exercise, stretching, and core-strengthening exercises are all great for people with scoliosis. Avoid contact sports, as well as competitive swimming, which can strain your back. People with scoliosis may produce lower levels of the hormone melatonin, which helps us sleep. Nighttime light, whether it's from a lamp, the television, or any other source, disrupts melatonin production for everyone, and this is especially bad for individuals who produce less of it to start with. Keep your room nice and dark to avoid disrupting your body's melatonin production. Children with scoliosis tend to have higher levels of growth hormone. When there are high levels of growth hormone in the body, melatonin levels will usually be low. If you have just been given a brace to wear for your scoliosis, you may feel like sleeping comfortably in it will be impossible. Luckily, most people get used to their braces quickly, so it probably won't bother you at all after a week or two. If you continue to have discomfort while sleeping after the first few weeks, talk to your doctor and see if any adjustments can be made to the brace. While some people do not experience any pain from scoliosis, others suffer from severe pain. If pain is keeping you awake at night, talk to your doctor about the best treatment options for you. There are a variety of ways to treat scoliosis pain, depending on the severity of your condition. For mild pain, you can take over-the-counter NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen. If your pain is more severe, your doctor may suggest that you take prescription pain medication. Your doctor may also recommend spinal injections to help relieve pain, although these will only provide you with temporary relief. Physical therapy or chiropractic treatment may help you achieve long-term pain relief. If nothing else works to control your pain, your doctor may recommend surgery. The most common types of surgery performed for scoliosis are decompression surgery, which is done to remove a disc or bone that is compressing a nerve, and spinal fusion surgery, which is done to fuse two or more of the vertebrae together, thus improving the shape of the spine. What is a summary?","completion":"A summary of the article is: Maintaining an active lifestyle with aerobic, stretching, and core-strengthening exercises can help alleviate back pain and improve sleep for people with scoliosis. Avoiding contact sports and creating a dark sleep environment can also aid in better sleep. While some individuals may experience no pain, others with scoliosis suffer from varying levels of pain. Treatment options include over-the-counter medications, prescription pain relief, spinal injections, physical therapy, and chiropractic care. In some severe cases, surgery, such as decompression or spinal fusion, may be recommended. For those wearing braces, initial discomfort usually subsides within a few weeks, but adjustments can be made if necessary."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Answer:","completion":"It depends on your specific needs and the intended use of the color space in your project. However, your given answer provides a brief explanation about two common color spaces: \\"For example, Adobe RGB and sRGB are two different absolute color spaces, both based on the RGB model.\\" Now, let me break down the factors you should consider when choosing a suitable color space for your project: 1. Device and Output Purpose: Are you working on digital media or print media? If you're focusing on digital media, like websites or video editing, sRGB is a widely accepted standard that will likely offer consistently good results across a variety of devices. However, if you intend on working with print media, such as photo printing or graphic design, Adobe RGB can provide a larger color gamut and might be more suitable for that purpose. 2. Viewing Conditions: Does your project require accurate color reproduction across different devices or environments? If so, choosing a color space that minimizes color shifts between devices and environments is essential. For instance, sRGB is a widely supported color space for digital media, making it a safer choice for maintaining color consistency across different screens. 3. Software Compatibility: Check if the software you work with supports different color spaces and allows you to switch between them effortlessly. Adobe RGB often provides better compatibility with Adobe's Suite of products, like Photoshop and Illustrator, while sRGB may work better with non-Adobe software solutions. In conclusion, consider the purpose of your project, the devices it will be consumed on, and the software you will be using to choose the most appropriate color space. Adobe RGB and sRGB are two popular examples of absolute color spaces based on the RGB model, but the choice ultimately depends on your specific project requirements."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

But he had something much better in mind. \\"I thought if I owned a restaurant,\\" he said, \\"I could eat for free.\\" A 1956 meeting with Harland Sanders led Thomas to a career as the manager of a Kentucky Chicken restaurant that made him a millionaire in 1968. In 1969, after breaking with Sanders, Thomas started the first Wendy's Old Fashioned Hamburgers, in Columbus, Ohio, which set itself apart by serving made-to-order burgers. With 6,000 restaurants worldwide, the chain now makes 6 billion a year in sales. Although troubled by his own experience with adoption, Thomas, married since 1954 to Lorraine, 66, and with four grown kids besides Wendy, felt it could offer a future for other children. He started the Dave Thomas Foundation for Adoption in 1992. In 1993, Thomas, who had left school at 15, graduated from Coconut Creek High School in Florida.

She wanted to make a toilet paper roll butterfly by using the roll's tube and paint, but was unable to finish because the","completion":"paint wouldn't dry quickly enough. Undeterred, she was determined to complete her project and began exploring alternative methods to speed up the drying process. She was aware that a beautiful butterfly was waiting to emerge, hidden within the confines of the humble toilet paper roll. She started by researching the properties of the paint she was using. Upon discovering that her acrylic paint tended to dry slower than other types, she considered switching to a faster-drying paint, such as poster paint or tempura paint for her next attempt. This would undoubtedly make her butterfly come to life more swiftly. Meanwhile, she learned that the drying time of paint could also be influenced by the ambient temperature and humidity in the room. Realizing that she was working in a cooler and less ventilated space, she decided to move her workstation to a warmer and more open area of the house that would naturally promote quicker drying. After relocating her workspace, she decided to try reducing the thickness of the paint layers on the toilet paper roll. Instead of applying one thick and heavy coat, she began applying multiple thin layers, letting each layer dry before moving on to the next. This method proved to be very effective, as it significantly decreased the amount of waiting time between each coat. During her research, she also discovered that she could use a hairdryer, set on a low heat setting, to meticulously direct warm air onto the painted surface. This allowed her to take matters into her own hands, as the heat from the hairdryer gently accelerated the drying process without damaging the paint or the toilet paper roll itself. Feeling a renewed sense of hope and determination, she pressed on, adding the intricate patterns and vibrant colors that would bring her butterfly to life. With the help of her newly acquired knowledge, the once slow-drying paint became a mere obstacle rather than an insurmountable problem. Once the paint had thoroughly dried, she proceeded to transform the simple toilet paper roll into a stunning butterfly. Using scissors, she carefully cut the tube in a symmetrical, wing-like shape and attached additional sections for the antennae. Then, she added extra embellishments, such as glitter, sequins, and small beads, to give her butterfly an added touch of sparkle and charm. Finally, her hard work and determination paid off as she held the completed toilet paper roll butterfly in her hands. Its bright hues shimmered in the light, and its delicate wings sparkled, a testament to her perseverance and ingenuity. As she admired her handiwork, she felt a sense of accomplishment and a newfound appreciation for the beauty that can be found in everyday objects. Through trial and error, she had transformed a humble toilet paper roll into a vibrant and graceful work of art, proving that even the most unexpected items can hold a world of potential for creativity and inspiration."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Generate a question that has the following answer: 13 for the following movie plot: At the estate of King Herman the 6â (Don Brodie) (a parody of Kaiser Wilhelm II), the deposed king of Moronica, war profiteers Ixnay (Vernon Dent), Amscray (Lynton Brent) and Umpchay (previously Onay) (Bud Jamison) have decided that they have had enough of Moe Hailstone, the fascist dictator they put in power, and want to help Herman retake the throne. To this end, his daughter, the princess Gilda (Mary Ainslee), threatens to try and assassinate Hailstone using an explosive Number 13 pool ball strategically positioned in Hailstone's billiard table. The fictitious country of Moronica seems to be familiar with a pool game in which the 13 ball is placed at the head of the rack during set up.[1] Dictator Moe Hailstone of Moronica enjoys a shave, and fights Field Marshal Herring (Curly) and Minister of Propaganda (Larry) for a turkey (a parody of Hitler possibly wanting control in Turkey. Larry parodies the attempts to control Greece by saying, \\"I'll wipe out grease\\"). The winner of that battle is a portrait of Napoleon who grabs the bird from the bewildered Stooges, before running out of his frame. At a loss, Hailstone starts crying. Gilda enters, and shows the Stooges a glimpse through a telescope of all three of them on a spit roasting in Hell and starts to place in Hailstone's mind the idea that his allies, the \\"Axel\\" partners, are plotting against him. After doing this, she replaces the 13 ball on Hailstone's pool table with the explosive 13 ball and flees as Hailstone begins a pool game with his partners. Throughout the rest of the game, the cue ball inexplicably defies the laws of physics, thereby avoiding the explosive ball by swerving around it and finally jumping over it, colliding with Herring's head.

Place in the microwave in a glass bowl for one minute; ii. Place in the microwave in a metal bowl for one minute;","completion":"Combining chocolate and coconut together to make a liquid mixture can be done in several ways, but microwaving is indeed a quick and convenient method. Considering the options you've provided, let's analyze both and see which method makes the most sense: i. Place in the microwave in a glass bowl for one minute: Using a glass bowl in the microwave is a safe and practical option. Glass is a microwave-safe material that heats evenly, allowing the ingredients to be heated consistently without the risk of any chemical components getting into your food. To make a chocolate and coconut liquid mixture using a glass bowl, follow these steps: 1. Break or chop the chocolate into small, evenly-sized pieces. This will help the chocolate to melt evenly and avoid the formation of lumps. 2. Measure the desired amount of coconut. For a-liquid mixture, it would be best to use coconut milk or coconut cream. These two forms will blend well with the melted chocolate and create a smooth liquid mixture. 3. Combine the chocolate and coconut milk or cream in a microwave-safe glass bowl. 4. Place the bowl in the microwave and set the timer for one minute. Keep an eye on the mixture to prevent it from boiling over or burning. 5. After a minute, take the bowl out of the microwave using oven mitts or a thick cloth as it might be hot. Stir the mixture with a spoon or spatula to ensure the chocolate and coconut are fully combined. 6. If the chocolate is not completely melted, continue to microwave it in 15-30 second intervals, stirring each time until fully melted and combined. 7. Once the chocolate and coconut are thoroughly mixed, and you have a smooth and homogeneous liquid mixture, you can use it for various recipes such as beverages, sauces, or as a topping on desserts. ii. Place in the microwave in a metal bowl for one minute: It is important to note that using a metal bowl in the microwave is not recommended. Microwaving metal objects can cause a fire, damage your microwave, or result in electrical arcing, which poses a risk for you and your appliance. Metal bowls can reflect the microwaves, causing uneven heating in the food and even damaging the microwave itself. Due to these risks, it is best to avoid using a metal bowl in the microwave. In conclusion, option (i) - placing the combination of chocolate and coconut in a glass bowl and microwaving it for one minute - is the most sensible and safe method to accomplish your goal. It allows for even heating, is microwave-safe, and will provide you with a smooth and homogeneous liquid mixture perfect for various culinary applications."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

During Tool's post-Ænima hiatus to deal with their legal issues, Keenan began working with Billy Howerdel, Tool's guitar tech through the Ænima tour, on a different project. The supergroup they formed, A Perfect Circle, began performing in 1999 and released its first album Mer de Noms in 2000. They released a successful follow-up in 2003 titled Thirteenth Step, a reference to twelve-step programs (many of the songs were written from the perspective of recovery). Both albums were eventually certified platinum. Their subsequent 2004 album, eMOTIVe, was primarily composed of covers, except for the singles \\"Counting Bodies Like Sheep to the Rhythm of the War Drums\\"—a song inspired by \\"Pet\\" that was originally released on Thirteenth Step—and \\"Passive\\". Keenan later characterized the record as a political album with which he \\"tested the waters\\" and was subsequently \\"crucified\\" for it because of the content. It was certified gold the month after its release. That same year they released the DVD and CD set entitled aMOTION, which was certified platinum within a month of its release. Howerdel reported in a May 2006 interview with MTV that the supergroup's work was concluded for the time being. After more than two years since the band's last release, Keenan was asked about the status of A Perfect Circle during an interview with Revolver. He stated: The real problem with running Tool and A Perfect Circle at the same time was they both operate the same way. They're both live touring bands with a label, still working under the old contract mentality. So I thought it was time to let A Perfect Circle go for now and let Billy explore himself. It's tough for a guy who went from being a guitar tech [for Tool] to being in a band with a pretentious, famous singer and having to live in that shadow. It was important for Billy to go and do his own thing and really explore his own sound and let people hear what he has to say and how he would do it on his own, and then we'll get back and do some A Perfect Circle stuff.

The problem does not only apply to language but to any representation Add punctuation.","completion":"The problem does not only apply to language but to any representation. In fact, various aspects of communication and information transmission are affected by it. Firstly, let's discuss language itself. The primary purpose of language is to convey thoughts and ideas between individuals. Different languages have developed over time to suit the needs of different cultures and societies, but the way they are used is remarkably similar. All languages share common features, such as syntax, morphology, and phonology, which help create meaning and structure. However, language is not perfect. Ambiguities and misunderstandings can still occur due to various factors, such as cultural differences, context, and individual experiences. Punctuation is one such way to help clarify meaning and minimize confusion in written language. For example, commas can be used to separate a list of items, and periods mark the end of a sentence. Apostrophes indicate possession or contractions, while quotation marks denote dialogue or direct speech. Moreover, other types of representation also face similar issues. In mathematics, symbols and notations are used to represent different concepts and operations. Just like punctuation in language, the proper use of these notations, such as parentheses and brackets, is crucial to convey the correct meaning. For example, the order of operations in mathematical expressions is indicated through the use of parentheses, which helps avoid ambiguity. Visual representations, such as images, graphs, and diagrams, can also be subject to misinterpretation. The use of appropriate labels, legends, arrows, and color schemes helps to enhance clarity and minimize confusion. For example, in a bar chart, providing the units of the data being plotted along with a clearly labeled axis can aid the viewer in understanding the information displayed. In the realm of computer science, the correct use of syntax, structure, and data types is essential for ensuring the accurate representation and functionality of a program or algorithm. Just like punctuation in language, proper coding conventions and best practices help avoid misinterpretation and other errors, which can lead to unexpected results or even catastrophic failures. In music, notation plays a crucial role in representing the melody, rhythm, and harmony of a piece. Musicians rely on these notations, such as clefs, key signatures, and time signatures, to interpret and perform the music accurately. Similarly, dancers use notation systems, like Labanotation or Benesh Movement Notation, to preserve, communicate, and reproduce choreography. In conclusion, the problem of ambiguity and misinterpretation does not solely apply to language but is relevant to any representation. Whether it's spoken or written language, mathematical equations, images, computer programs, or artistic expressions, proper, and clear communication is critical to avoid confusion and misunderstandings. As such, the use of appropriate punctuation, syntax, notation, and other structural elements is vital for effective communication and information exchange in all areas of human interaction."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

If The purchase authorization portion of the process is the formal approval of the purchase by responsible designated officials within the agency and usually results in the obligation of budget authority., can we conclude that \\"The purchase authorization portion is the approval.\\"?","completion":"Yes, based on the provided information, we can conclude that \\"The purchase authorization portion is the approval,\\" as it signifies the formal endorsement of the purchase by responsible designated officials within the agency. However, it is essential to explore this concept further to understand its scope and implications. The purchase authorization portion of the process plays a vital role in ensuring transparency, accountability, and efficiency in an organization. It is an essential component in managing budgets and resources, as well as mitigating potential risks associated with procurement processes. Here are some important aspects of the purchase authorization portion: 1. Designated officials: The approval of the purchase is provided by officials who have been designated with the authority to authorize purchases within the organization. This helps to establish a clear chain of responsibility and ensures that only authorized personnel can commit funds and resources to a procurement. 2. Obligation of budget authority: Once the purchase authorization has been granted, it usually results in the obligation of budget authority. This means that the funds necessary to cover the cost of the purchase are reserved and committed, ensuring that the organization has the financial means to fulfill its procurement responsibilities. 3. Compliance with procurement policies and procedures: The purchase authorization process also helps to ensure that all purchases are consistent with the organization's procurement policies and procedures. This promotes accountability, as well as adherence to regulatory requirements and industry best practices. 4. Documentation and record keeping: The purchase authorization process typically involves the creation and maintenance of documents and records related to the approval of purchases. This provides an audit trail and allows for oversight and review of procurement practices, ensuring that resources are effectively managed, and any potential issues are identified and addressed. 5. Risk management and due diligence: By requiring formal approval for purchases, the organization can help to mitigate potential risks associated with procurement, such as fraud, waste, and abuse. The authorization process can include necessary due diligence measures, such as supplier evaluation and contract negotiation, to ensure that purchases are in the best interest of the organization and meet all relevant criteria. In conclusion, the purchase authorization portion is indeed the approval, as it encompasses the formal endorsement of the purchase by the authorized officials within the agency. This process is crucial for effective resource management, accountability, and compliance with procurement policies and procedures. It also plays a significant role in risk management, helping to ensure that an organization's procurement activities are conducted ethically, efficiently, and in the best interest of all stakeholders."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: Process: - Put water in an ice cube tray - Put the ice cube tray in the freezer - Wait 5 to 6 hours - Take the ice cube tray out of the freezer - Bend the tray slightly to get the ice cubes out and into a drink.

In March 2001, Rice asked the CIA to prepare a new series of authorities for covert action in Afghanistan. Rice's recollection was that the idea had come from Clarke and the NSC senior director for intelligence, Mary McCarthy, and had been linked to the proposal for aid to the Northern Alliance and the Uzbeks. Rice described the draft document as providing for \\"consolidation plus,\\" superseding the various Clinton administration documents. In fact, the CIA drafted two documents. One was a finding that did concern aid to opponents of the Taliban regime; the other was a draft Memorandum of Notification, which included more open-ended language authorizing possible lethal action in a variety of situations. Tenet delivered both to Hadley on March 28. The CIA's notes for Tenet advised him that \\"in response to the NSC request for drafts that will help the policymakers review their options, each of the documents has been crafted to provide the Agency with the broadest possible discretion permissible under the law.\\" At the meeting, Tenet argued for deciding on a policy before deciding on the legal authorities to implement it. Hadley accepted this argument, and the draft MON was put on hold. As the policy review moved forward, the planned covert action program for Afghanistan was included in the draft presidential directive, as part of an \\"Annex A\\" on intelligence activities to \\"eliminate the al Qaeda threat.\\" The main debate during the summer of 2001 concentrated on the one new mechanism for a lethal attack on Bin Laden-an armed version of the Predator drone. In the first months of the new administration, questions concerning the Predator became more and more a central focus of dispute. Clarke favored resuming Predator flights over Afghanistan as soon as weather permitted, hoping that they still might provide the elusive \\"actionable intelligence\\" to target Bin Laden with cruise missiles. Learning that the Air Force was thinking of equipping Predators with warheads, Clarke became even more enthusiastic about redeployment. The CTC chief, Cofer Black, argued against deploying the Predator for reconnaissance purposes. He recalled that theTaliban had spotted a Predator in the fall of 2000 and scrambled their MiG fighters. Black wanted to wait until the armed version was ready. \\"I do not believe the possible recon value outweighs the risk of possible program termination when the stakes are raised by the Taliban parading a charred Predator in front of CNN,\\" he wrote. Question: \\"Why did Cofer Black, argue against deploying the Predator for reconnaissance purposes?\\" Answer: \\"He believed they would cause a war\\" Is this answer to the question correct?","completion":"No, the answer is not correct.

Article: ADVERTISEMENT Talk about hedging your bets. While some might put their money on both the Broncos and Seahawks this weekend, a 64-year-old Republican congressional candidate is putting himself and his money into not one, but four races at the same time. Allan Levene is running for the House of Representatives in his home state of Georgia -- as well as Michigan, Minnesota and Hawaii. While Levene's plan is unorthodox, it also seems to be legal. The Constitution says a person elected to the House must be a resident of the state they will represent when elected, but says nothing about the primaries. So, Levene's logic goes, he doesn't have to pick one race unless and until he wins a primary. Levene's reasoning is simple: he wants to be a member of Congress and feels he is too old to follow a traditional path by working his way up in local government. A naturalized citizen originally from England, he told FoxNews.com he feels compelled to serve. “I have such a debt to this country, a debt of gratitude to the United States for taking me in and letting me become a citizen about 40 years ago that I have to repay it,” he said. “I just have to.” Though his plan certainly risks turning off voters in the states where he does not live, Levene said he got the idea when he was studying the Constitution and realized it was legal. “The Founding Fathers wrote in the Constitution -- they didn't really understand you could fly from state to state because people couldn't really travel before, they could only really focus on one state where they lived,” he said. “Times have changed so I am running in four states.” First up on Levene’s agenda is his home state, Georgia, where he is running to replace GOP Rep. Phil Gingrey in the state's 11th District. Gingrey announced last year he will seek the Republican nomination for Senate in the race to replace GOP Sen. Saxby Chambliss. The 11th district is holding its open primary in May, three months earlier than the other states where Levene is running. Levene says he is focusing on that race for now, but if he is does not win the primary he will turn his focus to the other three. One of the main issues Levene is running on is jobs. He said he wants to reduce the corporate tax rate to zero, with the hopes of bringing manufacturing jobs back to the U.S. and creating a “tax haven” for overseas businesses. He also has a proposal he says will stop overspending in Congress by forcing incumbents out of office. His plan would allow lawmakers to be in office no more than eight years or nix their pensions. All four of the districts Levene is running in are districts in which the incumbent is not seeking another term. Levene says he chose them for various reasons, but does not feel the fact he does not live in them should impact his electability. “I can represent the public no matter where I live,” he said. However, K. Mark Takai, a Hawaii state representative running as a Democrat in the same race for Hawaii's 1st district, is skeptical of that claim. Takai told FoxNews.com while he respects Levene's right to run in multiple states as long as it's legal, he finds his strategy a \\"bit odd\\" and is not sure it will resonate with Hawaiians. “It’s the heart of democracy. The heart of representative government (is) you want someone to represent you who represents your community and its people,\\" Takai said. However, Levene says he is already garnering strong interest in Hawaii and some interest in Michigan, because his ideas are ones that resonate across state lines. “People are people everywhere, and they are all interested in the same thing,” he said. ||||| Allan Levene isn’t absolutely convinced of his chances in the GOP race for the congressional seat now held by U.S. Rep. Phil Gingrey of Marietta. So the Kennesaw resident has hit on what he thinks is a unique strategy to increase the odds that he’ll have a job in Washington come next year. He’s going to run in three other congressional districts as well. In three other states: Michigan (14th CD), Minnesota (6th CD) and Hawaii (1st CD). The U.S. Constitution, he notes, only requires residency at the time of next year’s November election. Levene used to live in metro Detroit. Work as an IT man has sometimes carried him to Minnesota. “Of course, living in Hawaii wouldn’t be bad, but I’d rather stay in Georgia,” Levene, 64, said this morning. “But I’m a practical man. I don’t have time to do this two years at a time, since I expect to be dead in 10 years.” A London native but naturalized U.S. citizen, Levene has chosen an American football analogy: “Going wide rather than going long.” The 11th District race in Georgia is still in its early stages. So far, Levene’s biggest splash has been his idea for a permanent solution to Middle East tensions: Create a kind of back-up Israel, just in case things get too hot at the current location. Maybe in an under-used portion of Texas. There’s little doubt that Levene would remain an extreme long-shot in all four races – his Georgia campaign treasury is relatively miniscule, and would be even smaller when divided by four. But a quadruple race would be one for the books. Levene said he found his loophole during his constitutional studies. The Founding Fathers, he realized, didn’t know about jet travel. “People couldn’t conceive of people running in more than one geographic area,” he said. Levene said he checked with the Federal Election Commission. People there merely advised him to keep his contributions for each of the four contests strictly separated. “I’ve written to every secretary of state [in the four states]. They have no problem with it,” he said. His only concern is if he wins in two or more of his contests. Our advice: If it's a choice between Honolulu or Detroit, there is no choice. ||||| Story highlights Allan Levene wants to run for Congress in Georgia, Minnesota, Michigan and Hawaii Constitution and state laws don't preclude the strategy Experts mostly say it could be a waste of time, but it could set a new campaign model It's believed Levene is the first to try the approach Allan Levene really -- really -- wants to serve in Congress. So much so, that he plans to run in four states: Georgia. Minnesota. Michigan. Hawaii. It's puzzling, but the Republican freely admits his strategy increases his odds of winning a House seat. As he sees it, all roads lead to Rome. \\"No matter where you win a seat in Congress, you go to the same building. You do the same work,\\" he said. \\"You can work for your constituents, which all have similar needs, but the key is you go to Washington and help solve the country's problems.\\" Legally, his strategy is possible. But it likely will be a logistical nightmare. Running a congressional campaign as a political newcomer is tough enough. Multiply that by four and add a society that's quick to shun \\"carpetbaggers\\" -- people who move to a state to run for office -- and you get what some experts predict to be a waste of time and money. It appears Levene may be the first to try the unusual tactic. But what if he succeeds? Is he blazing a trail for a new campaign model? Jumping through the loophole The Constitution lists only a few requirements for a House member: Be at least 25, a U.S. citizen for at least seven years and a resident of the state when elected. But the Constitution says nothing about primaries or the nominating process, and that's the heart of Levene's strategy. Leaving out a rule that would prevent multi-state campaigns was an understandable omission by the Founding Fathers, Levene said. How could they have envisioned such an approach? \\"Back then they couldn't fly from state to state,\\" he said. In Levene's case, all four races are open, meaning there's no incumbent. Two districts — the ones in Georgia and Minnesota — are considered safe for Republicans, while the other two are considered safe for Democrats. The four states only require candidate residency at the time of the general election, not the primary. They also don't have laws prohibiting candidates from running in the primary if they're attempting to get on primary ballots in other states. The Federal Election Commission tracks the money side of federal campaigns. It told Levene his mission was legal as long he kept his fundraising separate in each state, meaning he couldn't raise money in Georgia and spend it in Minnesota. The FEC told CNN it hasn't issued specific guidance on that kind of campaign strategy. 'All politics is local' Levene, an avid blogger with some unorthodox ideas, has already created websites for each of his campaigns. But his true focus is on Georgia's 11th Congressional District, whose current representative, Republican Phil Gingrey, is running for the Senate. Of the four states, Georgia holds its primary first, on May 20. If Levene doesn't win the GOP nomination, he'll campaign in the other states. Minnesota, Michigan and Hawaii have nominating contests in August, just days apart from each other. Jordan Powell, a Republican political consultant based in Texas, said he's never heard of someone trying to run in multiple states and argued it's not a \\"viable political strategy.\\" \\"There's two problems: There's the practical day-to-day issues, like scheduling, fundraising, meetings, etc,\\" Powell said. \\"If you get past that, you still have a problem, to me, with voters about political opportunism.\\" A number of people, including Powell, brought up a common saying coined by former House Speaker Thomas \\"Tip\\" O'Neill: \\"All politics is local.\\" \\"It's very much true in Hawaii,\\" said David Chang, chairman of Hawaii's Republican Party. \\"People care what high school you went to, what nationality you are, what your last name is, how many generations your family has been in Hawaii, whether you know my auntie and uncle.\\" \\"Being from the mainland and running for the office Hawaii, you have an uphill battle because of those dynamics,\\" he added. Levene hasn't lived in Hawaii; he has only visited the state. But he says he still has a plan specific to the Aloha State . He wants to bring more IT jobs and companies from California and make the island known for being more than a tourist hub. \\"It's clear that you need a noisy, loud congressional mouthpiece. I am noisy and I will put Hawaii on the map,\\" he writes on his Hawaii website. Born in London, Levene, 64, first came to the United States when he was 21 and eventually became a naturalized citizen. He pursued a career in the IT industry and is now settled in Georgia, but he has lived in Michigan in the past, which is why he chose the Wolverine State as one of his \\"four.\\" As for Minnesota , the 6th Congressional District has been a Republican stronghold for the past decade. Its current representative, Michele Bachmann, is retiring. Levene is attracted to races that would essentially guarantee him a general election victory if he wins the primary. \\"The election process is about winning first and foremost,\\" he said. But three well-known Republicans have already been vying for the seat for months. \\"The runway for candidates who are serious about it literally started the day Congresswoman Bachmann announced her retirement,\\" said Keith Downey, chairman of the Minnesota Republican Party. Downey had not heard of Levene's plan to run in the state, but found it difficult to see voters gravitating toward an outsider. \\"I would imagine, like in most places, Minnesota voters are a little more comfortable voting for their own and having some past connection to a candidate,\\" he said. Copycats in the future? Levene is surely hedging his bets. But what if his plan works? A source who worked to get Democrats elected to the House last decade seemed open to the idea. \\"I wish we had known about that. Maybe we could have gotten even more Democrats elected,\\" the source said, somewhat jokingly. The source, who asked not to be identified, added the tactic could come in handy for candidates running in districts along state borders. Others had a hard time imagining the strategy becoming one for the textbooks. Powell said \\"some of the practical decisions would be easier\\" in such a scenario, but the candidate would still have a \\"messaging problem.\\" \\"You're still looking like you just desperately want to be in Congress, regardless of the district or the issue,\\" he said. Such an image doesn't pass \\"the smell test\\" with voters, he added. Another House campaign strategist, who asked not to be identified in order to speak more freely, had also never heard of the multi-state approach but said \\"it's something that a credible strategist would never recommend for any candidate.\\" \\"You're opening yourself up to several attacks,\\" the source said. 'Just ideas' Levene realizes he will run into criticism and said he's prepared to take on his opponents. \\"I'm not carpet bagging in the sense that I want to take advantage of the district that I'm running for,\\" he said. \\"I will work very hard for whichever district that I'm elected to.\\" For Levene, he believes he must get elected to carry out his ideas—which include carving out a back-up territory for Israel inside of Texas , and creating a pathway for thousands of Chinese nannies to come to the U.S. and teach children how to speak Mandarin. \\"Having ideas without going to Washington means they're just ideas,\\" he said in his Americanized British accent. \\"No one will pay the slightest bit of attention.\\" He also wants to eliminate corporate income taxes.

Levene believes this approach could maximize his chances of reaching Congress. His primary focus is Georgia's 11th Congressional District, with other states serving as fallbacks. His campaign includes proposals to reduce the corporate tax rate to zero, force incumbents out of office after eight years or forfeit their pensions, and create a back-up territory for Israel within Texas. Despite the substantial challenges this strategy may present, Levene remains hopeful about his chances and the potential relevancy of his ideas on a wider scale."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

So, William decided to help his friend by running after Fluffy, trying to bring him back to his safe and cozy home. As they ran through the house, Fluffy was like a little ball of fur, zipping under tables and chairs, and almost getting caught several times. William had to be patient and move carefully, so he wouldn't scare Fluffy away. Finally, they found Fluffy hiding behind a big plant in the corner of the room. With a gentle scoop of his hands, William picked up the adorable and playful hamster, and Nick sighed with relief. Together, they returned Fluffy to his cage, making sure that the door was locked tight so he wouldn't be able to escape again.

Short answers containing words that are present in the passage are preferred. Q: Omar Ali is a young man living in Battersea in the Wandsworth area of South London, right by the railway station[4] during the mid-1980s. His father, Hussein (known to the rest of the family as Papa), once a famous left-wing British Pakistani journalist in Bombay, lives in London but hates Britain's society and its international politics. His dissatisfaction with the world and a family tragedy have led him to sink into alcoholism, so that Omar has to be his carer. By contrast, Omar's paternal uncle Nasser is a successful entrepreneur and an active member of the London Pakistani community. Papa asks Nasser to give Omar a job and, after working for a brief time as a car washer in one of his uncle's garages, he is assigned the task of managing a run-down laundrette and turning it into a profitable business.At Nasser's, Omar meets a few other members of the Pakistani community: Tania, Nasser's daughter and possibly a future bride; and Salim, who trafficks drugs and hires him to deliver them from the airport. While driving Salim and his wife home that night, the three of them get attacked by a group of right-wing extremist street punks. Their apparent leader turns out to be Johnny, Omar's childhood friend. Omar tries to reestablish their past friendship, offering Johnny a job and the opportunity to adopt a better life by working to fix up the laundrette with him. Johnny decides to help with the laundrette and they resume a romantic relationship that (it is implied) had been interrupted after school. Running out of money, Omar and Johnny sell one of Salim's drug deliveries to make cash for the laundrette's substantial renovation.On the opening day of the laundrette, Omar confronts Johnny on his fascist past. Johnny, feeling guilty, tells him that though he cannot make it up to him, he is with him now. Nasser visits the laundrette with his mistress, Rachel. As they dance together in the laundrette, Omar and Johnny make love in the back room, narrowly escaping discovery. At the inauguration, Tania confronts Rachel about having an affair with her father. Rachel accuses Nasser of having invited Tania on purpose to have her insulted, and storms off despite his protests. Later that night, a drunk Omar proposes to Tania, who accepts on the condition that he raise money to get away. Soon after, Salim reveals to Omar that he is on to them, and demands his money back. Omar's father stops by late in the night and appeals to Johnny to persuade Omar to go to college because he is unhappy with his son running a laundrette.Offering Salim a chance to invest in his businesses as a much needed 'clean outlet' for his money, Omar decides to take over two laundrettes owned by a friend of Nasser. Salim drives Johnny and Omar to view one of the properties, and he expresses his dislike of the British non-working punks in Johnny's gang. He attempts to run them over and injures one of them. Meanwhile, Rachel falls ill with a skin rash apparently caused by a ritual curse from Nasser's wife, and decides it is best for all that she and Nasser part ways. The next day Tania drops by the laundrette and tells Johnny she is leaving, asking him to come along. He refuses, implicitly revealing the truth about himself and Omar and she departs wordlessly. After Salim arrives and enters the laundrette, the punks, who had been lying in wait, trash his car. When he runs out on noticing them, he is ambushed and viciously attacked. Johnny decides to interrupt and defend him, despite their mutual dislike, and the punks turn their attention to him instead. As he refuses to fight back, they beat him savagely until Omar returns and intervenes, protecting Johnny as the punks trash the laundrette and flee the scene.Nasser visits Papa, and the two discuss their respective failures, agreeing between them that only Omar's future matters now. Nasser sees Tania at the train platform while she is running away, and he shouts to her but she disappears. Meanwhile, at the laundrette, Omar nurses Johnny, and the two bond.

Answer the following question: If animals get food by eating other living things, then what get food by eating other living things? Answer choices: - fungi - a fish - humans - viruses - Animals - algae - bacteria - plankton Answer:","completion":"All the answer choices listed, except viruses and algae, can obtain food by consuming other living things. Here's a brief explanation for each: 1. Fungi: Many fungi are decomposers and obtain their nutrients by breaking down dead organic matter. However, some fungi can also be parasites, preying on living organisms. 2. A fish: Fish are animals, and many of them are carnivorous or omnivorous, meaning they consume other living organisms like smaller fish, insects, or plankton as a food source. 3. Humans: As part of the animal kingdom, humans are omnivores, and our diet includes various living organisms like plants and animals. 4. Viruses: Viruses don't \\"eat\\" living things in the traditional sense. They infect and take control of a host cell's machinery to reproduce themselves. Therefore, they cannot be considered as organisms that get food by consuming other living things. 5. Animals: Most animals (not including herbivores) get their food by consuming other living plants or animals. 6. Algae: Algae are photosynthetic organisms that produce their own food through the process of photosynthesis. Though they don't consume other living organisms, they may absorb nutrients from the environment. 7. Bacteria: Some bacteria are heterotrophic, meaning they obtain their food by consuming other living organisms or organic materials. Others are autotrophic, producing their own food through photosynthesis or chemosynthesis. 8. Plankton: Zooplankton, a subset of plankton, are small, often microscopic animals that consume other plankton or detritus. Phytoplankton, on the other hand, are photosynthetic microorganisms that produce their own food through photosynthesis. In summary, fungi, fish, humans, animals, bacteria, and some types of plankton (zooplankton) get food by consuming other living things."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: When the weather is hot, you go to a lake or an ocean. When you are near a lake or an ocean, you feel cool. Why? The sun makes the earth hot, but it can not make the water hot. Though the air over the earth becomes hot, the air over the water stays cool. The hot air over the earth goes up, then the cool air over the water moves in and takes the place of the hot air. When you are near a lake or an ocean, you feel the cool air when _ moves in. You feel the wind and the wind makes you cool. Of course, scientists cannot answer all of our questions. If we ask \\"Why is the ocean full of salt?\\" scientists will say that the salt comes from rocks. When a rock gets very hot or very cool, it cracks , and rain falls into the cracks. The rain then carries the salt into the earth and the rivers. The rivers carry the salt into the ocean. But then we ask \\"What happens to the salt in the ocean?

Movie plot title: The Nutty Professor Movie plot: At Wellman College, thousands of hamsters overrun the campus, due to the massively obese, yet loving and kind-hearted, professor Sherman Klump, who accidentally releases them. Meanwhile, Sherman has created an experimental formula that reconstructs the DNA of an obese person in a way that allows them to lose weight more easily. After class, Sherman meets and instantly falls in love with Carla Purty, a chemistry graduate student who is a big fan of his work. After dinner with his obese, impolite family, Sherman asks Carla out on a date, which she accepts, much to Sherman's surprise. The date begins well with Carla showing admiration for Sherman's work, but the club's obnoxious comic Reggie Warrington publicly humiliates him about his weight. Sherman becomes depressed and has a nightmare in which he becomes a rampaging giant and wrecks the city with a single fart that is ignited to cause an explosion. He tests his serum on himself and loses 300 pounds in seconds. Overwhelmed by his thinness, he goes out and buys copious amounts of normal-sized clothing to celebrate, and a 47,000 Viper sports car on his faculty expense account. To conceal his true identity, Sherman adopts a fake name, \\"Buddy Love\\", and invites Carla out on a date at the same club again (while the serum begins to wear off). Reggie is present again and Buddy takes revenge and heckles him mercilessly. Sherman's \\"Buddy\\" persona starts to develop an independent personality due to the heightened testosterone levels of the transformation, causing him to be overly assertive and confident. Klump's assistant Jason witnesses Buddy fleeing the scene after he is identified as the person who left Klump's credit card on the bar. Jason follows Buddy and witnesses the transformation back into Klump.

Given the question: WASHINGTON — In 2004, Desmond Meade, while serving a 15-year prison sentence for a drug offense in Florida, got a break. An appeals court returned his conviction to the original trial bench, allowing him to plead guilty to a lesser charge and get out of prison in three years, most of which he had already served. But his freedom came with a price, something that didn’t quite register with him at the time: as part of his plea agreement with prosecutors, Meade agreed to give up his civil rights: the right to vote, to serve on a jury and to run for office. “At the time, when I first accepted the plea deal, I didn’t understand the consequences,” Meade says. Fourteen years and a pair of college and law degrees later, Meade, now 50, still can’t vote; his application to regain his civil rights was rejected in 2011. The reason: a new Florida law that requires felons like him to wait for seven years before they could apply for rights restoration. Home to nearly a quarter of the nation's disenfranchised felons, Florida has become a battleground in a national debate over felony disenfranchisement laws. With lawmakers deeply divided over the issue, Meade says he wants the state’s voters to change the system when they head to the polls on Nov. 6. He’s promoting a ballot initiative that would amend the state's constitution, restoring the voting rights of all felons in Florida (except those convicted of murder and sexual assault) after they’ve completed the terms of their sentence. The measure enjoys broad voter support. A Quinnipiac University poll conducted in February showed that 67 percent of Floridians were in favor of restoring the voting rights of felons other than those convicted of murder and sexual assault. Another poll showed support at 71 percent. “We’re going to change the system,” Meade says confidently. “What we’re doing is taking the power out of the hands of politicians and we’re allowing the citizens of the state of Florida to decide whether or not folks should have a second chance, to be able to vote.” Who got a law degree? - Meade - his wife - not enough information - the brother The answer is:","completion":"Meade"},{"prompt":"Q:Siam Park -- Lagoa, Portugal Slide and Splash is Portugal's largest water park and at 16,000 acres, it is widely considered to be one of the best in Europe.

Answer the following question: In the shadow of the Seattle Space Needle, almost alien crystalline forms wrap their deft tendrils through the Chihuly Garden and Glass. Every single petal, bowl, stem and branch of cascading glass has been handblown under the guidance of Washington State native Dale Chihuly (in fact he grew up in nearby Tacoma), and we couldn’t quite believe our eyes. Having discovered this exhibit through the magic of Jaime’s instagram (she’s a self-named Angloyankophile who grew up in Seattle before moving to London) I knew we would have to visit. My photos don’t do the undulating forms any kind of justice; but they might just convey the incredible scale of the exhibition. I’d always been curious to learn more about Chihuly, after being introduced to his incredible sculpture suspended over the V&A Museum information desk, a glowing confection of green and white glass whisps. In 1968, after receiving a Fulbright Fellowship, he went to work at the Venini glass factory in Venice, observing the team approach to blowing glass, which is critical to the way he works today. In 1971, Chihuly cofounded Pilchuck Glass School in Washington State. With this international glass center, Chihuly has led the avant-garde in the development of glass as a fine art. His work is included in more than 200 museum collections worldwide. He has been the recipient of many awards, including twelve honorary doctorates and two fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts. He has also lost an eye to his passion, and now mostly directs the sculpture design and assembly. It was truly amazing. In 1999, Chihuly started an ambitious exhibition, Chihuly in the Light of Jerusalem; where more than 1 million visitors attended the Tower of David Museum to view his installations. In 2001, the Victoria and Albert Museum in London curated the exhibition Chihuly at the V&A.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. By. Ryan Gorman. Police have arrested two teenagers in the savage beating of 54-year-old. white man left in a coma after he got out of his car to check on a young black boy he accidentally hit. The two suspects, aged 16 and 17, were arrested in connection with the attack last week of beloved grandfather Steve Utash,. who was brutally beaten by an angry. mob in a poverty-stricken Detroit neighborhood after David Harris, 10, ran in. front of his truck on a busy street. Detroit police say about a dozen vigilantes beat Utash Wednesday, even stealing his wallet before leaving him injuries severe enough to cause bleeding on the brain - he is still in a medically induced coma. News of the arrests came as donations passed the 100,000 mark on a webpage set up to raise money to pay for Utash's mounting hosptial bills. Loving father: Steve Utash pictured with daughter Mandi Marie Utash. He was brutally beaten by a gang of men in a poverty-stricken Detroit neighborhood. Hoping and praying: A family member holds Steve Utash's hand as he is in a medically-induced coma at a local hospital. The two arrested are expected to be arraigned Monday or Tuesday, a police spokesperson told MailOnline. Expected charges were not immediately available. They were brought into custody Saturday morning by police without resistance from their homes with tips from the community, authorities told WXYZ. Community group Detroit 300 was seen in a WJBK report canvassing the neighborhood door to door with flyers and pleas for help tracking down the additional assailants. Detroit 300 joined police in saying there is no reason to suspect the attack was racially motivated. 'This is just an issue that happened, we're not going to put a racial component on it,' said one member of the. group. 'These sort of things could have happened whether it would have. been white on white, black on black, the fact of the matter is that it. was wrong and it shouldn't have happened. 'This unprovoked attack on Steve is just inexcusable.' News of the arrests was welcomed by a family member who spoke to WDIV. 'Happy, glad but now since the two dominos are going to fall, they're going to find out,' said brother-in-law Max Mohr. 'We want them all.' 'We want them all': Brother-in-law Mar Mohr says the family is happy arrests have been made, but this is only the beginning. Group of friends: Four individuals are shown. standing by the side of the road at left and Harris can be seen darting. head on into traffic at right. It also came as the family says a GoFundMe page set up to help pay for the uninsured man's medical bills has raked in more than 111,000 - the goal was 50,000. The family is grateful for the outpouring of generosity that has come from around the world. 'They're so appreciative that they don't really know how to take what the world is saying about this and their dad being the way he is,' Mohr added after saying that Utash's condition has not changed in days - there is still bleeding on his brain. The donations and arrests are good news for a family that has found it hard to come by in recent days, and come as community leaders are rallying around the family with calls to end the random violence that plagues the blighted city. 'We’re a predominantly black church and Mr. Utash is white, but love is universal,' Reverend Maurice Rudd said during his Sunday sermon, according to the Detroit Free-Press. 'There are no boundaries to love. Love crosses all racial barriers, all levels of class. 'There is something in the spirit in southeast Michigan,' he continued. 'The spirit of violence... has infected our people.' 'Why are we so angry? What's wrong with us?' Reverend Larry Simmons shouted to his church during a Sunday sermon, according to the paper. Simmons called on his flock to perform 'random acts of kindness' every day, and said 'we aren't going to be silent anymore... in the midst of all this anger.' Rev. David Alexander Bullock echoed his thoughts across town during his Sunday sermon. 'It’s the responsibility of the faith community to engage those who are blind, in this case, a mob of young men who don’t see clearly, who flew into a rage... we can't stand idly by, we have to engage them.' Loving husband: Steve Utash, pictured with wife Starr Utash, was beaten into a life-threatening coma after stopping to help a 10-year-old boy he hit with his pick-up truck in Detroit. His family say he has no insurance. He's going to survive: David Harris, 10, suffered a broken leg after running into traffic in the busy street. The calls came after another driver was beaten, this time to death, at a Detroit gas station. Utash himself was left for dead by the angry mob. 'If it went on any longer, my dad wouldn’t be in the hospital right now, he would be in the morgue,' son Joseph Utash told CBS Detroit. Security. footage from a gas station Harris and friends were standing in front of. shows him inexplicably running into oncoming traffic before being mowed. down by Utash's vehicle. Utash, from suburban Roseville,. immediately stopped to check on the boy, but several black males from. their late teens to their early 20s quickly descend on the scene. Police quickly ruled the incident an accident. 'It was determined that the driver of the vehicle wouldn't have had any chance of stopping,' Moreno explained. But what happened next is considered by Utash's family to be an act of retaliation. Police. tell MailOnline that about a dozen young males attacked the married. father of three, beating him into a coma that he still hasn't woken from. Family man: Utash is a married father of two children - the relatives pictured are not identified. Moment of impact: Mr Utash hits David Harris just after the boy ran into the street. On the ground: The young boy is crumpled in heap on the ground just after being hit. Released from the hospital: Harris suffered only a broken leg, he has already been sent home. 'It’s not like he hit the kid on purpose and they were trying to get revenge,' daughter Felicia Utash told WXYZ. 'He literally just tried to stop and help the kid and people came out of nowhere and tried to kill him.' His son Joseph Utash hinted it might have been a setup to rob his father, perhaps even a hate crime. 'I. think it was all a setup from the gate,' he told CBS Detroit. 'My dad’s. been driving up and down Morang for 15, 16 years working for the same. company... they know he has money and they robbed him. 'As far as a hate crime, it might be,' he continued. 'You go in Detroit and you’re white, you don’t belong.' Police immediately dismissed the notion. 'We have no evidence to suggest it's a hate crime,' Moreno told MailOnline. The. boy's father was arrested after a background check revealed he has an. active warrant, according to the Detroit Free-Press, but police declined to say if he would be charged in. connection with the beating. Mob rule: The angry mob that would soon mercilessly beat Utash begins gathering where the boy was struck. Devastated: Daughter Felicia Utash (right) insisted her father (left) was only trying to do the right thing. Witnesses said Utash immediately pulled over to check on Harris after hitting him. ‘David was laying right in front of the. driveway and he had blood coming out of his mouth,’ James Duston Jr.,. the boy’s godfather told WXYZ. He couldn’t move his body.’ The crowd ran towards the boy's screams and mercilessly beat Utash. ‘This little boy was screaming,’ a woman told the Free Press. ‘There was a lot of people that came out. It was crazy.’ All hell broke loose. ‘I think it lasted about one minute and. then they let him go,’ a bystander told WXYZ. ‘And then they jumped back. on him again and they did it about three times and finally someone was. trying to help the guy that got beat up.’ ‘He had the biggest gash on his head I. ever seen – he was bleeding from the mouth and he was unconscious when I. first got there,’ Debra Hughes told WWJ. Harris suffered a broken leg, he has since been released from a local hospital, Moreno said. A message left with the family seeking further comment has not yet been returned. Brutal: The unidentified driver was savagely beaten after stopping to check on the young boy he accidentally hit with while driving this pickup truck. ‘It was sad because I knew the guy was getting out of his car to try and see what damage he did,’ the witness added. ‘He got his,’ another witness to the beating told the Free Press. ‘He got beat up real bad.’Both the driver and the boy were taken to a local hospital. The boy’s family condemned the beating. ‘We don’t condone that at all,’ said Duston. ‘I told his mom and she just was like, no, we wouldn’t want that to happen.’ Doctors are still trying to determine if Utash will need surgery to save his life. Where it happened: The boy ran out into the street at this spot on Detroit's east side, police said. What are the important parts of this article?","completion":"This news article is about a 54-year-old man named Steve Utash, who was driving his truck when a 10-year-old boy named David Harris accidentally ran in front of his vehicle.

Women born after 6 April 1951 should all have been warned that they would not get a state pension at 60, as their retirement age is gradually raised. But thousands of women have complained that they were not given proper notice of the change. However, the government insisted all those women were contacted directly. \\"They deserve compensation. They were wronged,\\" said Baroness Bakewell, who was previously a government \\"tsar\\" for older people. \\"They expected that their pension would start at a certain age - 60 - and then the law was changed quite suddenly.\\" Under the 1995 Pensions Act, the government decided that the pension ages of both men and women would be equalised by 2020. Previously, women retired at 60, while men retired at 65. In 2011, state pension ages were raised at an even faster rate. Some of those born between April 1951 and 1960 will not qualify for a pension until the age of 66. Campaigners belonging to Women Against State Pension Inequality (WASPI) say some women had very little notice that they would not get a pension at 60. Norah Hickey, a 61 year-old former teacher from Solihull in the West Midlands, said she only had two years' warning. \\"When I was informed at the age of 58 that I wouldn't be getting it, it really was a big shock,\\" she told the BBC. Instead of getting her pension at 60, she will now get it at 65, meaning she will have lost at least Â£30,000 in pension payments. She said she had lived at the same address for 26 years, so there was no excuse for not writing to tell her. The government's state pension calculator is available here. However the government said that all those affected were written to, using address details recorded by HM Revenue and Customs. It said it would not be \\"revisiting\\" the arrangements. \\"I can't see any way in which the government would undo a law that was properly made in 2011, and which is potentially going to cost billions of pounds,\\" pensions minister Baroness Altmann told the BBC. \\"I really do feel for them. But at the end of the day most of these women will still get their state pension before a man born at the same time,\\" she said. More than 35,000 people have now signed a petition asking for the government to make transitional arrangements, to ease financial difficulties. Those whose pension ages are raised after 2017 are likely to be given at least ten years' notice of the changes.

Given the question: Given the background: Many people enjoy riding in hot air balloons. Some use them for romantic picnics and marriage proposals. Others race in competitions. Being above the earth gives a whole new perspective on the world around us. As the beginning of a hot air balloon ride, the balloon is flat because the pressure inside the balloon equals the pressure outside. When the air inside the balloon is heated, the speed of movement of those air molecules increases and the pressure goes up. After a while the balloon is completely expanded and the flight is ready to take off. and the situation: Bob just came from a hot air balloon ride. On his way home he saw two balloons, balloon A and balloon B. Balloon A was flat, but balloon B was inflated. He was wondering how balloons go up so effortlessly. Answer the following question: Would balloon B have higher or lower inside pressure than balloon A? The answer is:","completion":"Balloon B would have a higher inside pressure than balloon A. Step 1: Understand the background information. The background information states that the pressure inside the balloon equals the pressure outside when it's flat, which is the case for balloon A. And when the air inside the balloon is heated, the speed of movement of those air molecules increases, and the pressure goes up. This situation is applicable for balloon B, which is inflated. Step 2: Compare the pressure inside both balloons. Since balloon A is flat, its inside pressure is equal to the outside pressure. However, balloon B's inside pressure has increased because the air inside it has been heated, causing the balloon to inflate. Step 3: Determine the higher pressure. As the balloon B is inflated and the air molecules inside are moving at a higher speed, the pressure inside balloon B is higher than the pressure inside the flat balloon A.

One night, Trevor delivers instead and gets busted by narcs. 5 years later, Trevor is released from jail and learns his girlfriend Laura is now with Billy. Trevor gets back with her and decides to rob a local mobster. Trevor wants some cash to buy Laura some gifts and Andy was told by some local mobsters that they are investing money with huge profits and he wants some cash to buy in. However, their robbery is very sloppy and the head mobster quickly figures out what happened. However, he and Andy's grandfather were good friends, so he tells Andy and Trevor that they can work off what they owe by smuggling stolen diamonds. Billy finds out what is going on and is mildly amused by it until he realizes that Trevor has gotten back together with Laura behind his back. He retaliates by convincing the mobsters that Trevor is a junkie and is stealing the diamonds that he is supposed to be delivering to supply his habit. He also convinces the diamond dealer that Trevor cannot be trusted with real diamonds and he gives him fake diamonds instead.

Answer the following question: Process: - Dead organic material accumulates on the bottom of oceans, riverbeds or swamps, mixing with mud and sand - Over time, more sediment piles on top - The resulting heat and pressure transforms the organic layer into a dark and waxy substance known as kerogen - Left alone, the kerogen molecules eventually crack - The molecules break up into shorter and lighter molecules composed almost solely of carbon and hydrogen atoms - It will turn into either petroleum or natural gas - Perturbation hypothesis: suppose less sediment available happens, how will it affect less kerogen occurs. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"If less sediment is available in the environment, it will indeed have a direct effect on the formation of kerogen. As you mentioned, the process of kerogen formation begins when dead organic material accumulates on the ocean floor, riverbeds, or swamps, mixing with mud and sand. Over time, sediment layers pile on top of this organic material, generating heat and pressure, which cause the organic layer to undergo chemical transformation, resulting in the formation of kerogen. In the perturbation hypothesis, where there is less sediment available, the organic material would not be subjected to the same levels of heat and pressure as required for the formation of kerogen. This is because the sediment layers on top of the organic material play a crucial role in providing the necessary heat and pressure involved in the process. Less sediment means that there will be less overburden pressure, leading to a decrease in the overall heat and pressure experienced by the organic material. As a result, it is highly likely that less kerogen will be formed in such a scenario. This can indirectly impact the formation of petroleum or natural gas, as they typically form from the cracking of kerogen molecules under certain temperature and pressure conditions. With less kerogen available, the subsequent formation of petroleum or natural gas could also be negatively affected. In summary, the perturbation hypothesis of less sediment available would directly hinder the formation of kerogen, as the required heat and pressure are reduced. This in turn would have an indirect effect on the generation of petroleum and natural gas from these source materials."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Independence with Partition: The British began to see India's independence as inevitable; however, only a few seemed to understand the vital role of the religious groups. Britain prepared a parliamentary democracy with majority rule, but the majority were Hindus — and Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs had been killing each other in war for many centuries. Nehru's Congress Party, largely Hindu with a socialist leadership, wanted a parliamentary democracy. As counterweight, British legislation reserved parliamentary seats for religious minorities, but the Punjab and Bengal had such a complicated mixture of Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs that it was not possible to avoid fights over how separate constituencies were to be formed. The seeds of future trouble were sown. The legislation on reserving seats gave the Muslims the basis for an alternative to an India in which they were only a quarter of the population: Partition. In 1930, the poet Muhammad Iqbal proposed a separate Muslim homeland in the northwest of India. A small group of Indian Muslims at Cambridge came up with the name Pakistan, using the initials of the Punjab, Afghania (N.W. Frontier Province), Kashmir, and Sind (at the same time producing the word pak, meaning \\"pure\\"), and adding \\"stan,\\" the Persian suffix for the word \\"country. \\" The Muslim campaign for Partition was led by London-trained Bombay lawyer, Muhammad Ali Jinnah. Meanwhile, Gandhi vehemently opposed any dismemberment of the country, and tried to keep people united by fasting to uphold the spirit of love, and by focussing on the common adversary: the British. Advocating civil disobedience, he led his famous Salt March to the sea, to scoop up salt and circumvent the hated British salt tax. This put more than 60,000 in jail. Against this militancy, World War II did not elicit the solidarity of the first. Indians courageously fought alongside the British troops, in Burma, the Middle East, and Europe, but Gandhi saw the British as a provocation for Japanese invasion and was jailed yet again, for launching a \\"Quit India\\" campaign in the year 1942. Some anti-British extremists saw the Japanese as an Asian liberator. Winston Churchill didn't want any Indian independence and so it was probably as well for India that he was defeated by Attlee's Labor Party in 1945. With riots growing ever more bloody in Bengal, Bihar, and the Punjab, India's last viceroy, Lord Mountbatten, kept a mandate to make the British departure as quick and as smooth as possible. Quick it was — six months after his arrival — but not smooth. After reading the above, is \\"One million\\" the correct answer to the question \\"How many people were jailed because of the Salt March?\\"? Options: (A). no (B). yes","completion":"(A). no The correct answer is \\"no,\\" because one million people were not jailed because of the Salt March.

Article: Computerworld - The first presidential debate lit up social networks Wednesday night, even staggering Twitter throughout the one-and-a-half-hour debate. President Barack Obama and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney faced off in their first debate before the presidential election next month. And it wasn't just a big night for the two candidates. It also was a big night for the likes of Facebook, Twitter and Google+ . While social networks played a role in the 2008 presidential election, they've taken an even bigger part this year. That's not surprising since, for instance, Facebook had 100 million monthly users in 2008 and today it has 955 million. Using social networks is an effective way to send a single message out to potentially millions of eyeballs. Twitter played a starring role during the debate, which was the most tweeted about event in U.S. political history, generating 10.3 million Tweets in 90 minutes, according to Twitter. People are increasingly turning to social networks to share their opinions on the candidates and the issues. However, the individual campaigns also are using Facebook and Twitter, which set up a dedicated page for the debate. So when it came time for the first debate to air, users split their focus between watching the verbal sparring and tweeting their reactions with criticism, cheers and jokes. Twitter's Government and Politics team noted early on that tweets about the debate were coming in fast and furiously. \\"We're only minutes into the event and have already passed 2 million Tweets about this debate over the past 24 hours. #debates,\\" tweeted @gov. The heavy load on Twitter began well before the debate kicked off. Twitter noted, \\"In the last 24 hours there have now been twice as many Tweets about tonight's debate than there were about all of the #debates in 2008.\\" The heavy load took its toll on the microblogging site. Twitter's first noticeable stumble came just after 9:30 when the site didn't come up for some users for about seven minutes. It came back but was in trouble again just before 10 p.m. ET but the site struggled with slow load times and partially loaded pages off and on through at least 11 p.m. Despite Twitter's efforts to keep up with the onslaught of usage, the site noted that one of the most-tweeted moments of the debate came when Romney said he loves Big Bird but would cut funding to PBS. Shortly after, Twitter reported there were 17,000 tweets per minute for \\"Big Bird\\" and 10,000 tweets per minute for \\"PBS.\\" Facebook wasn't being left out of it, either. Images of Sesame Street's Big Bird holding a sign that reads, \\"Will work for food\\" quickly began showing up on the social network. Big Bird also showed up in the running list of debate-related topics, such as #debates, Jim Lehrer and #PresidentialDebate2012, that began appearing in Twitter's top 10 trending topics hours before the debate even began. Both the Obama and the Romney campaigns were trying to get as much play on the social networks as possible. Both political camps set up Web sites that promoted tweets and potential social network postings, offering suggestions for what users could post and retweet.

When the first of this season’s debates started on Wednesday in Denver, the scoring began at 9:01 p.m., as soon as Jim Lehrer, the moderator, said “Good evening.” Mr. Lehrer’s open-ended questions, Mitt Romney’s plan to end the federal subsidy for PBS and Mr. Romney’s high energy level — against President Obama’s comparatively low energy level — all received spikes of attention from viewers who were chatting online along with the debate. The instant feedback helped harden conventional wisdom that Mr. Obama had turned in a weak performance, even before he had finished speaking. On MSNBC, liberal hosts like Ed Schultz were taken aback by Mr. Obama. Mr. Schultz threw up his arms at one point after the debate and asked, “Where was the president tonight?” His colleague, Chris Matthews, loudly suggested that Mr. Obama watch MSNBC’s programs for debating advice. “He will learn something every night on this show and all these shows,” he said. Advertisement Continue reading the main story After Mr. Obama was pronounced “rusty” by CNN hosts, the analyst David Gergen said, “I didn’t think he was rusty so much as I don’t think anybody’s ever spoken to him like that over the last four years. I think he found that not only surprising, but offensive in some ways.” Photo The recent surge in so-called second-screen behavior was vividly on display during the debate, both on social networking sites like Twitter that barely existed four years ago and on all manner of even newer apps promoted by media companies. At least half a dozen outlets, as varied as CNBC and The Huffington Post, had debate drinking games ready to go beforehand. ||||| Image credit: Mark Lennihan/AP Photo While President Obama and Mitt Romney were trying to tout their economic plans, the social media sphere was massively distracted by a big yellow bird - Big Bird that is. After Romney said, \\"I love Big Bird,\\" but that he plans to cut funding for PBS anyhow, social media exploded with tweets about the \\"Sesame Street\\" character. According to Twitter data, the words \\"Big Bird\\" were tweeted 17,000 times per minute and \\"PBS,\\" the channel that airs \\"Sesame Street,\\" peaked at 10,000 tweets per minute.\\"Big Bird\\" was also the fourth highest-rising search term on Google. Romney's comment sparked the hashtag #SaveBigBird, which was trending worldwide, and spawned at least three pro-Big Bird Twitter handles, @BigBird, @BigBirdRomney and @FiredBigBird. The @BigBird handle, which sent out comments such as, \\"I guess I'm the 47%…\\" and, \\"Even Ernie is mad! :(\\", had nearly 14,000 followers one hour after the debate ended. The @FiredBigBird went virtually viral, garnering 2,000 followers in two minutes. One hour after the debate, 16,000 people were following the account. The @BigBirdRomney account, which had about 7,000 followers an hour after the debate, fired off nearly 50 tweets during the debate. \\"Under Mitt #Romney, Sesame Street will become an extension of Wall Street,\\" read one tweet. \\"Under Mitt #Romney, Cookie Monster won't receive the care he needs to overcome his addiction,\\" read another. \\"Sesame Street\\" declined to comment on Big Bird's newfound political fame, saying that the show is careful to remain apolitical and noting that Big Bird is only six years old and, thus, does not understand politics. The deluge of tweets were soon followed by an onslaught of .gifs, Tumblr images and blog posts. But despite the online explosion, Romney's intentions to cut funding to PBS are not new. He often mentions it as an example of how he will cut spending to shore up deficits and bring down the debt. \\"I'm going to stop the subsidy to PBS,\\" Romney said at Wednesday's debate. \\"I'm going to stop other things. I like PBS, I love Big Bird. Actually, [I] like you [moderator Jim Lehrer], too. But I'm not going to keep on spending money on things to borrow money from China to pay for.\\" Lehrer, who rarely spoke throughout the debate, was also mocked by the Twitterverse, inspiring the Twitter account @SilentJimLeher and propelling the moderator's name into the top trends nationwide. And while Big Bird and PBS were the big winners - or losers depending on how you look at it - on Twitter, the first presidential debate of was the most tweeted political event in U.S. history. Shortly after President Obama and Romney left the stage, Twitter spokeswoman Rachael Horwitz tweeted, \\"Tonight's debate was the most tweeted about event in US political history, topping the numbers from the RNC and DNC. #debates.\\" The debate generated more than 10.3 million tweets to move ahead of the 9.5 million tweets measured across the several days of the Democratic Convention last month and the 4 million tweets of the Republican Convention, according to Twitter Government ( @gov), who track political tweets. ||||| Starting in 1996, Alexa Internet has been donating their crawl data to the Internet Archive. Flowing in every day, these data are added to the Wayback Machine after an embargo period. |||||Summary:","completion":"The first presidential debate between President Barack Obama and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney in 2012 exploded on social media platforms, marking a significant shift in political discussions and communication. This debate became the most tweeted about event in U.S. political history at the time, generating 10.3 million tweets in a duration of 90 minutes. Social networks, notably Facebook, Twitter, and Google+, played a prominent role in this event. These platforms served as primary channels for immediate reactions, commentary, and discussion, providing a wide audience with a real-time platform to voice their opinions on the candidates and the issues being discussed. This marked a stark difference in usage from previous years, which was largely due to the rapid growth of platforms, such as Facebook, that had increased its monthly users from 100 million in 2008 to 955 million in 2012. One of the most tweet-driven moments of the debate came when Romney bluntly stated his love for Big Bird, a popular Sesame Street character, but also his intention to cut funding to PBS, the network that airs the program. Following this statement, there were 17,000 tweets per minute for \\"Big Bird\\" and 10,000 tweets per minute for \\"PBS.\\" Images related to Big Bird also started to appear on Facebook, reinforcing the debate's relevance and broad reach over social media. This activity on social media influenced the strategy of both political campaigns. Both the Obama and Romney camps actively utilized these platforms to get as much traction and attention as possible. They set up websites that promoted tweets and potential social network postings, suggesting what users could post and retweet. However, the massive surge of activity took a toll on the platforms. Twitter, in particular, struggled to handle the influx of usage. Just after 9:30 p.m., the site was inaccessible for some users for about seven minutes and continued to experience slow load times and partially loaded pages throughout the night. Despite these challenges, this debate marked a significant milestone in the relationship between politics and social media. It demonstrated the potential of these platforms as effective channels for political discourse and instant public response. Furthermore, it shed light on the potential influence and repercussions of political comments and decisions reflected through instant social media reactions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

News article: Sept. 4, 2012 -- Blood sugar levels at the high end of what is considered normal may put the brain at risk, according to a new Australian study. Researchers in Canberra report a link between the shrinkage of two brain regions, the hippocampus and the amygdala, and normal blood sugar levels. The hippocampus and amygdala are involved in memory, among other things, and researcher Nicolas Cherbuin, PhD, says shrinkage in these areas could worsen memory. \\"It has been generally assumed that blood glucose in the normal range is not a risk factor for brain health in non-diabetics,\\" Cherbuin says. \\"If the present results are replicated in other studies the definition of normal fasting blood glucose levels and of diabetes may need to be re-evaluated.\\" Results Are 'Robust' For the study, Cherbuin, a neuroscientist at Australian National University in Canberra, and his colleagues studied 249 people in their early 60s. Each of them had blood sugar levels in the normal range. At the beginning of the study, and again four years later, the researchers scanned their brains. Comparing the before and after images, they found significant brain shrinkage among those whose blood sugar levels were high but still below the World Health Organization's threshold for pre-diabetes. The researchers report that those high levels may account for a 6% to 10% decrease in the volume of the hippocampus and amygdala. Cherbuin and his team then excluded people who were overweight or obese, and substituted the American Diabetes Association's stricter normal range for that endorsed by the WHO. The results were virtually the same. Cherbuin says they did not take their conclusion \\"lightly,\\" but the association between these higher blood sugar levels and brain shrinkage was \\"robust.\\" Next, he plans to study the impact that such brain changes may have. More Research Required Cherbuin's results suggest a need to reassess what's considered a healthy blood sugar level, but more research must be done before any changes to recommendations are made, says neurologist Marc Gordon, MD. \\"The research is too preliminary, and the association shown here does not establish a cause or mechanism,\\" says Gordon, chief of neurology at Zucker Hillside Hospital in Glen Oaks, N.Y., who describes the study as thoughtful and carefully considered. \\"To speak as a clinician and tell patients that they better cut out all candy because it will shrink their brain is a leap of faith.\\" ||||| Reported by Julielynn Wong, M.D., ABC News Medical Unit High blood sugar levels may take a toll on the brain, a new study found. The Australian study of nearly 250 non-diabetic men and women found those with high blood sugar levels tended to have shrinking in brain areas linked to memory and emotional processing. The results held up even after controlling for lifestyle factors such as smoking and weight. \\"If replicated, this finding may contribute to a reevaluation of the concept of normal blood glucose levels and the definition of diabetes,\\" wrote study author Dr. Nicolas Cherbuin, director of the Neuroimaging and Brain Lab at Australian National University in Canberra, Australia. Previous research has linked diabetes, a disorder in which blood sugar levels are abnormally high, to age-related cognitive decline. But the new study, published Monday in the journal Neurology, suggested controlling blood sugar levels could boost cognitive health in non-diabetics. How exactly? The jury's still out. Some studies suggest blood sugar control can help regulate the body's inflammatory response, which has been linked to brain shrinkage. Another theory is that high sugar levels make the blood stickier, raising the risk of clots that starve the brain. Either way, experts said, the study supports healthy eating to keep blood sugar levels in check. \\"This in line with many other studies that have been published and adds to all of the data on diabetes affecting brain health,\\" said Dr. R. Scott Turner, director of the Memory Disorders Program and a professor of neurology at Georgetown University Medical Center, who was not involved with this study. For non-diabetic patients with high blood sugar levels, Turner recommended adopting the American Diabetes Association diet, which is high in non-starchy vegetables and low in carbohydrates and protein. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","completion":"An Australian study found that having high blood sugar levels might be bad for the brain, even if a person does not have diabetes. The study looked at around 250 people and discovered that those with high blood sugar had some shrinking in areas of the brain related to memory and emotions.

Oscar is still hosting a regular poker game and is still an untidy slob, now living in Sarasota, Florida, but still a sportswriter. One day, he is called by his son Brucey with an invitation to California for his wedding the following Sunday. A second shock for Oscarâthe woman his son is marrying is Felix's daughter, Hannah. On the flight from New York to Los Angeles, it becomes clear that Felix has not changed his waysâhe is still a fussy, allergy-suffering neat freak nuisance. Oscar and Felix are reunited at the airport and very happy to be together again after 17 years of separationâat least for a couple of minutes. They intend to share a rental car to San Malina for the wedding. But the trip begins with Oscar forgetting Felix's suitcase at the Budget car rental, including wedding gifts and wardrobe inside. Oscar also loses the directions to San Malina when his cigar ashes burn them. He and Felix become hopelessly lost, unable to even remember the name of the town where they are headed, so many California city names sounding alike. They end up in a rural area, where the car rolls off a cliff and catches fire.

If you have figured out that one of your family members is struggling with depression, it can be seem like you had something to do with it. But it’s not your fault. Depression makes it hard to for people to connect emotionally with their loved ones. To be available to this person and help them, it is important to understand that it’s not personal. When you are talking to a depressed family member, you have to keep in mind that they are dealing with an actual physical problem. It can be tempting to blame their mental disorder on decisions they have made, but recognizing that it’s not their fault can help you be less critical and more supportive. Keep in mind that your love and support can help them recover from depression. Your support of their recovery process is one of the most valuable things you can offer someone struggling with depression. Offering to let someone with depression talk about what they are feeling without judging them is an important part of recovery. It will help them feel less alone. You can also offer to help them find a support group, where they can talk to people who have been through what they are going through to help them feel less alone. To help your depressed family member, you need to know what they are experiencing. With depression, there are a lot of things that can be going on, so you have to ask direct questions to get to the heart of it. You can prompt your loved one to explore why they are feeling depressed to help them get to the other side of it. Ask questions like: “When did you first start to feel bad?” ”Do you know what triggered these feelings?” ”What makes it worse?” ”What makes it better?” Demanding that your loved one change the way they feel is a pointless exercise, mostly because they don’t know how to change how they feel. You will feel frustrated when they don’t change, and they will feel angry toward you, perhaps even feeling more depressed than ever. This can also trigger shame in them, which makes things even worse. If you try to rescue your family member, they will not learn for themselves how to manage feelings of sadness on their own. It is unlikely that you will be able to make the depression go away, and the fact that you are sticking your finger into their lives can trigger depressed relatives to feel frustrated with you. This will also lead you to have negative interactions with your loved one, such as when fixing it doesn’t work and you get angry with them. Accept them for who they are and where they are emotionally. Develop realistic expectations for your depressed loved one and maintain an attitude full of hope for them. Your loved one can get help for depression, and they can change. There is hope, and if you keep this in the forefront of your mind, you can help them have hope as well.","completion":"This article is about how to support a family member who is dealing with depression by understanding it's not their fault, asking them about their feelings, avoiding blame and not trying to fix them, but instead offering love, patience and hope for their recovery."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Information: - London is the capital and most populous city of England and the United Kingdom, as well as the most populous city proper in the European Union. Standing on the River Thames in the south east of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded by the Romans, who named it \\"Londinium\\". London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its medieval boundaries. Since at least the 19th century, \\"London\\" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which today largely makes up Greater London, governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly. - Eastleigh is in Hampshire, England, and the main town in the Borough of Eastleigh. The town lies between Southampton and Winchester, and is part of the South Hampshire conurbation. The first substantial growth was as a railway town. Now it is home to many businesses, including a manufacturing plant owned by Prysmian Cables & Systems (formerly the cables division of Pirelli). The town lies on the River Itchen, one of England's premier chalk streams for fly fishing, a designated site of Special Scientific Interest. - Art is a diverse range of human activities in creating visual, auditory or performing artifacts (artworks), expressing the author's imaginative or technical skill, intended to be appreciated for their beauty or emotional power. In their most general form these activities include the production of works of art, the criticism of art, the study of the history of art, and the aesthetic dissemination of art. - Collage (from the , \\"to glue\\") is a technique of an art production, primarily used in the visual arts, where the artwork is made from an assemblage of different forms, thus creating a new whole. - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union. - Portsea Island is a small, flat and low-lying island just off the south coast of England. The island is totally within, and contains a large proportion of, the city of Portsmouth. The third largest by population of any island in the British Isles after the mainlands of Great Britain and Ireland, it has the highest population density. - Population density (in agriculture: standing stock and standing crop) is a measurement of population per unit area or unit volume; it is a quantity of type number density. It is frequently applied to living organisms, and most of the time to humans. It is a key geographical term. - Havant is a town in the south east corner of Hampshire, England approximately midway between Portsmouth and Chichester. Its borough (population: 125,000) comprises the town and its suburbs including the resort of Hayling Island as well as Rowland's Castle (an exurb), the smaller town of Waterlooville and Langstone Harbour. Housing and population more than doubled under either definition of Havant in the 20 years following World War II, a period of major conversion of land from agriculture and woodland to housing across the region following the incendiary bombing of Portsmouth and the Blitz. - Derek Boshier ( born 1937 , in Portsmouth ) is an English pop artist works in various media including painting , drawing , collage , photography , film and sculpture . - Gosport is a Borough town in the South Hampshire conurbation, on the south coast of Hampshire in southern England. The 2011 Census recorded its population as 82,622. It is on a peninsula on the western side of Portsmouth Harbour opposite the City of Portsmouth, to which it is linked by the Gosport Ferry. - Hampshire (; abbreviated Hants, archaically known as the County of Southampton) is a county on the southern coast of England in the United Kingdom. The county town of Hampshire is Winchester, the former capital city of England. Hampshire is the most populous ceremonial county in the United Kingdom (excluding the metropolitan counties) with almost half of the county's population living within the South Hampshire conurbation which includes the cities of Southampton and Portsmouth. The larger South Hampshire metropolitan area has a population of 1,547,000. Hampshire is notable for housing the birthplaces of the Royal Navy, British Army, and Royal Air Force. It is bordered by Dorset to the west, Wiltshire to the north-west, Berkshire to the north, Surrey to the north-east, and West Sussex to the east. The southern boundary is the coastline of the English Channel and the Solent, facing the Isle of Wight. - A port is a location on a coast or shore containing one or more harbors where ships can dock and transfer people or cargo to or from land. Port locations are selected to optimize access to land and navigable water, for commercial demand, and for shelter from wind and waves. Ports with deeper water are rarer, but can handle larger ships. Since ports throughout history handled every kind of traffic, support and storage facilities vary widely, may extend for miles, and dominate the local economy. Some ports have an important military role. - Fareham is a market town at the north-west tip of Portsmouth Harbour, between the cities of Portsmouth and Southampton in the south east of Hampshire, England. It gives its name to the borough that comprises the town and its surrounding area. It was historically an important manufacturer of bricks (notably used to build the Royal Albert Hall, London) and a grower of strawberries. Current employment includes retail (including Fareham Shopping Centre with around 100 shops), small-scale manufacturing, and defence (with the Royal Navy's and the Ministry of Defence's Defence Science and Technology Laboratory nearby). - Portsmouth is a port city in the ceremonial county of Hampshire on the south coast of England.

A:","completion":"Yes, packing the hospital bag indeed makes for a valid answer when discussing the preparations Casey needs to make ahead of Cameron's impending birth. The hospital bag is essential for both the birthing person and their partner. There are several elements that comprise the hospital bag. For Cameron, these might include clothing — such as a robe, maternity bra, nursing pads, and comfortable, loose-fitting pieces for post-delivery — and toiletries, from toothbrush and toothpaste to deodorant and face wash. She might also want to pack personal items, like prescription medications and glasses, and comfort items, like her own pillow or relaxation materials for labor. For the newborn, the bag should include newborn clothing, diapers, baby wipes, receiving blanket, and car seat. For Casey, the bag should have a change of clothes, toiletries, snacks, and a list of important contacts and emergency numbers. They might also want to pack a phone charger, comfortable shoes, and items to aid in relaxation and support for Cameron, like a book to read to her during early labor or a list of soothing music. The idea behind packing these items is to ensure that both Cameron and Casey have everything they need for a comfortable, stress-free labor and delivery experience. Cameron will be able to focus on her labor knowing all necessary items for her, Casey, and the newborn are prepared. By packing the hospital bag ahead of time, Casey is exhibiting the qualities of a good partner — consideration, preparation, and a share in the responsibilities of baby preparation. It shows they are taking this role as a partner seriously, putting Cameron's needs and comfort first, and preparing for this major milestone in their life together.

In the summer of 1940, world-weary Harry Morgan operates a small fishing-boat, the Queen Conch, in Fort-de-France, on the French colony of Martinique. It is not long since the fall of France and the island is controlled by pro-German Vichy France. Harry makes a modest living chartering his fishing boat to tourists, along with his unofficial mate Eddie. Eddie is Harry's close friend and one time trusted co-worker, but he has of late become an alcoholic. The island is a tinder-box of dissent, harboring many people sympathetic to Free France. At his hotel home, hotel owner Gérard (known as \\"Frenchy\\" to English speakers) urges Harry to help the French Resistance by smuggling some people off the island. Harry steadfastly refuses, choosing to keep aloof from the current political situation. Also at the hotel, he meets Marie Browning, a young American wanderer who has recently arrived in Martinique. An accomplished singer, she sings \\"How Little We Know\\" with pianist Cricket in the hotel bar. Harry's current charter client, Johnson, owes Harry 825. Johnson insists he hasn't enough ready money, but promises to get the funds when the banks open the next day. In the hotel bar, Harry notices Slim pick Johnson's pocket and he later forces her to hand over the wallet. On inspection the wallet is found to contain 1,400 in traveler's cheques and a plane ticket for early the next morning (before the banks are open). On returning the wallet to Johnson, Harry demands that Johnson sign the traveler's cheques to pay him immediately. But just then, there is a shootout in front of the hotel between police and the Resistance, and Johnson is killed by a stray bullet. The police take Harry and several others for questioning, and seize Harry's passport and money.

Tell me who he is.","completion":"Mitt Romney and Rick Perry are both American politicians and prominent members of the Republican Party. Mitt Romney, full name Willard Mitt Romney, was born on March 12, 1947, in Detroit, Michigan. He is a successful businessman and politician. Romney served as the 70th Governor of Massachusetts from 2003 to 2007. Prior to his political career, Romney was the CEO of Bain & Company, a management consulting firm, and later, the co-founder of Bain Capital, a private equity firm. He was also the CEO of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee for the 2002 Winter Olympics held in Salt Lake City, Utah. Rick Perry, full name James Richard Perry, was born on March 4, 1950, in Haskell, Texas. He is a politician and veteran, serving as the 47th Governor of Texas from 2000 until 2015. Before becoming the Governor of Texas, Perry was the state's Commissioner of Agriculture from 1991 to 1999 and served in the Texas House of Representatives from 1985 to 1991. Perry also had a short stint as the United States Secretary of Energy under President Donald Trump from 2017 to 2019. He is a U.S. Air Force veteran and a staunch conservative. During the 2012 Republican presidential primaries, both Romney and Perry sought the nomination as the Republican candidate for the presidency. There was a notable moment in which Perry encountered backlash over his support for a Texas program providing in-state tuition rates for the children of undocumented immigrants. In a heated debate, Perry defended the program and said, \\"If you say that we should not educate children who have come into our state for no other reason than they've been brought there by no fault of their own, I don't think you have a heart.\\" Some Republicans saw Perry's comment as an attack on the many conservative voters who disagreed with the program, and Romney capitalized on this perception, painting himself as a more moderate and pragmatic candidate who understood the concerns of the party's base. As the primaries continued, Romney also presented himself as a more capable and experienced leader in terms of economic policy, given his successful background in the private sector. Ultimately, Republican voters preferred Romney over Perry in the 2012 primaries for a variety of reasons, including Romney's perceived economic competence and concerns over Perry's support for providing benefits to the children of undocumented immigrants. This preference culminated in Romney winning the Republican nomination for the 2012 presidential election, though he went on to lose the election to the incumbent president, Barack Obama."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Seeing Seahawks dominate Broncos with defense makes you think Rex Ryan is onto something with NY Jets You watched this Super Bowl game, watched the Seahawks come after Peyton Manning and crowd him to the point where he must have felt like he was a fan at one of those Jersey train stations trying to make it to MetLife Stadium, and here is what you had to think: That maybe Rex Ryan isn't so crazy thinking his team can play football the way he wants it to play and win the way he thinks it can win. Which means the way Pete Carroll's Seahawks played and won Sunday night. It doesn't mean that the Jets are anywhere close to having the kind of talent, up and down the roster, that the Seahawks do. Or that Rex's immediate boss — John Idzik — can put the whole thing together the way Idzik's old boss, John Schneider, so clearly has out there in 12th Man America. Most of all, no one is saying that Geno Smith can ever play with the kind of poise and imagination and sure right arm that Russell Wilson did in Jersey, on the night when he became one of the youngest quarterbacks to ever win the big game. And you know the deal on this, if Geno isn’t Rex’s guy or Idzik’s guy, even short term, it means they have to find somebody with whom they think they can win. Still: As the Jets try to become a winner again, you look at their defense, see the athleticism and speed and power especially in the front of that defense — nobody in the sport has guys like Richard Sherman and Kam Chancellor and Earl Thomas in the defensive backfield — and think that Rex’s vision of how you do it isn’t so different from an old Jet coach named Carroll’s vision. “We played football the way we like to play it,” Carroll said on the night when he joined Jimmy Johnson and Barry Switzer as coaches who have won it all in both college football and the pros. Guys like to play for Pete Carroll, they always have, even when he couldn't win the way he wanted to with the Jets and with the Patriots after that. Guys clearly like to play for Rex Ryan. Rex now works for a general manager, Idzik, who knows exactly what the plan was to build a champion in Seattle. Idzik seeing it all come together the year after he leaves and comes to the Jets. Maybe it turns out, then, that Idzik and Ryan are closer in philosophy or vision or whatever you want to call it than we thought when Idzik took the job, even if Ryan is working on a contract that seems to be more complicated than some of his blitzes. Say it again today: Considering who the Seahawks were up against Sunday night — Peyton Manning having the season of his life — and what they were up against — a Broncos offense that had averaged 38 points a game — this defensive performance stands with anything that has ever happened in the history of the Super Bowl. Noll’s Steelers. Ditka’s Bears. Ray Lewis and the Ravens. Anybody. Carroll’s guys took what was supposed to be a game about Manning’s legacy and made it about their own, and taking their place with the most storied defenses this game had ever seen. \\"We are so proud to put our stamp on the world championship the way we did tonight,\\" Carroll kept saying afterward. It doesn't mean the Seahawks are about to become a dynasty, we always hear that after somebody wins the Super Bowl, even when one team hasn't thrown the other out a window the way the Seahawks did with the Broncos. Right. The Seahawks are so much of a budding dynasty that two weeks before they did what they did to the Broncos, Colin Kaepernick and the 49ers had a ball in the air to beat them in Seattle. You want to know another team that thought of itself as a budding dynasty about 10 minutes ago? Jim Harbaugh’s 49ers, that’s who. Only Kaepernick couldn’t complete the pass that would have won the last Super Bowl in New Orleans, to Michael Crabtree, right side of the end zone. Then Richard Sherman deflected another ball intended for Crabtree and that ball fell into Malcolm Smith’s hands. Now Smith is the Super Bowl MVP and the Seahawks are the Super Bowl champs. But as you watched them become the champs the way they did, totally dominating the Broncos, a non-scrambling quarterback like Manning turning out to be much more of a dream opponent for them than Kaepernick was; as you watched them do this in the stadium shared by the Giants and Jets, you really could see Rex Ryan's Jets being a lot closer to a moment like this than the Giants are, just because the Giants have a whole lot more work to do building themselves another championship defense. It doesn't mean that the Jets can use all this cap space to spend their way there. Or that Idzik can draft his way there. If you're sure about Geno being the quarterback of both the present and the future, raise a hand. But if the Seahawks, winning this way with defense in what has become a passing league, are the current model franchise, Rex must be thinking, wait a minute, I made it to the AFC championship game with my own kid quarterback trying to build the exact same model! The country saw what happened on Sunday night, the way the Seahawks got after it, the way they closed on those short passes, the way they hit, the way they dared Manning to take shots down the field. You know Rex had to look at the whole thing differently, the Seahawks doing it this way in his stadium. You know Rex Ryan really thought this: That could be us. Sooner rather than later. What is a short summary of the above article?","completion":"The Seahawks' dominating defensive performance against the Broncos in the Super Bowl showcased a potential path to success for the New York Jets under Rex Ryan. While the Jets may not have the same level of talent as the Seahawks, their strong defense, particularly in the front, aligns with Pete Carroll's winning strategy. General Manager John Idzik, who worked with the Seahawks before joining the Jets, appears to have a similar philosophy to Ryan in terms of team building. The Jets will need to find a quarterback who can lead the offense effectively, but their defense provides a solid foundation for potential success."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Alina Bogdanova was found lifeless by Aleksandrs Zuks, 29, the next morning, after the pair rekindled their romance, an inquest today heard. The 28-year-old blonde had spent the night of October 25 last year with her ex-boyfriend, who lived with her brother in Spalding, Lincolnshire. Alina Bogdanova (right) hanged herself after sleeping with her ex-boyfriend Aleksandrs Zuks (left) behind her new partner's back. Mr Zuks found the 28-year-old's lifeless body the morning after the pair rekindled their romance last October. Giving evidence at an inquest at South Lincolnshire Coroners Court, Mr Zuks, said: 'We slept together after she came to my bedroom. 'I fell asleep with her beside me but found her the next morning. I thought she was standing on the stairway next to the wall. 'I started talking and asking what she was doing there and when I came closer I realised that her bottom lip was blue.' At the time of her death, Miss Bogdanova was in a relationship with fellow Russian Arturas Pakalniskis, who lived in Peterborough. He told the inquest: 'She was very happy. She wasn’t depressed. 'I knew Mr Zuks lived at her brother’s address but I was not concerned (about her visiting the house). 'She just said that \\"I am going to see my brother\\" and that was it.' Miss Bogdanova was visiting her brother Arnis, who lived with Mr Zuks in Spalding, Lincolnshire on October 25 last year. Mr Zuks told an inquest into her death she had fallen asleep beside him. South Lincolnshire assistant coroner Siobhan Kelly recorded a verdict of suicide. A friend paying tribute said: 'Alina was a beautiful person. People thought she felt guilty about cheating on Arturas which is maybe why she killed herself but we will never know. It is so tragic. She was so full of life' Miss Bogdanova’s brother Arnis told the hearing he had arranged for his sister to sleep in his room while he would use the sofa downstairs.

Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. In this task, you're given the title and three arbitrary sentences out of a five-sentence story. You are also given three additional sentence options, a, b, and c, that may or may not belong to the story. Your job is to pick the two options that seamlessly connect with the rest of the story and their positions in the sentence order of the story; note that the selected choices may fit into the story at any point. Your answer must be in the form of '2a, 5b', where '2a' means the candidate sentence 'a' will be inserted as the 2nd sentence in the story. The answer must also be in the order of the selected choices, i.e., '2a, 5b' is allowed, and '5b, 2a' is not allowed. If options are equally plausible, pick the ones that make more sense. Title: Tim was two years old when his family moved to the country. Tim was not used to this, as he was from the big city. Tim spent a lot of his day exploring the large yard of his new home. Choices: a. Over time, Tim began to love the freedom the country provided. b. Tim decided that he would never visit the city again. c. He did it and then went back to laying down.","completion":"Analyzing the title and the given sentences, the story appears to revolve around Tim's new country life after shifting from the big city. Tim's exploration of his new home and his adaptation to this new environment are the running themes. Looking at options a, b, and c, I can note the following: a. This sentence builds upon the theme of Tim adapting and becoming fond of his new environment. This is a compelling choice since it connects well with him exploring his new home (yard). b. This sentence implies a strong disconnection with the city, which might not necessarily be true just from few sentences we have. c. This sentence seems to be out of place. There is no mention of laying down or a connected event in the current story. Given these observations, the sentence 'Over time, Tim began to love the freedom the country provided' seems to smoothly continue the narrative, as it elaborates on Tim's emotional transition caused by his physical relocation. I conclude that option 'a' should follow after 'Tim spent a lot of his day exploring the large yard of his new home,' thus making it the fourth sentence of the story. Testing option 'b', it also seems to logically fit the sequence as the final sentence. It shows the result of Tim getting used to and even preferring the new country life now. On the other hand, option 'c' doesn't align with any relevant notion and seems arbitrary. Thus, it can be discarded. Therefore, the correct answer should be '4a, 5b', with option 'a' becoming the fourth sentence and option 'b' the concluding, fifth sentence of the narrative."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

One day he was teaching them about two particles of matter, particle A and particle B. Particle A moves faster, but particle B moves slower. He was showing the children about different characteristics of moving particles. Which particle would have lower temperature, particle A or particle B? Hint: No doubt you already have a good idea of what temperature is. You might say that it’s how warm or cool something feels. In physics, temperature is defined as the average kinetic energy of the particles of matter. When particles of matter move more quickly, they have more kinetic energy, so their temperature is higher. With a higher temperature, matter feels warmer. When particles move more slowly, they have less kinetic energy on average, so their temperature is lower. With a lower temperature, matter feels cooler. Answer:","completion":"Based on the hint provided and the definition of temperature in physics, the answer would be that particle B would have a lower temperature.

The public is shocked to hear the news of his arrest, as Radcliffe is known for his benevolent nature and strong sense of justice. Despite his pleas of innocence and the lack of substantial evidence, the jury, swayed by the accusatory stories surrounding the high-profile case, unanimously finds him guilty. Knowing that Radcliffe has been wronged and having a strong belief in his innocence, Dr. Frank Griffin, a scientist and Radcliffe's close friend, decides to take matters into his own hands. On the eve of the execution, the daring scientist enters the prison and covertly injects Radcliffe with an experimental invisibility drug, one he had been secretly developing for quite some time. Miraculously, the drug works, and Radcliffe disappears from sight. Taking advantage of the confusion that ensues in the prison, Radcliffe manages to escape, determined to clear his name and find the true murderer. After getting the hang of his newfound invisibility and learning from Dr. Griffin how to use it to the best of his abilities, Radcliffe begins his mission to find the real killer. He secretly investigates his former business colleagues, as well as his own family members, in search of answers. The first lead he comes across is a recently promoted employee, Willie Spears, who has suddenly climbed the ranks within Radcliffe's company. The speed of his rise to power seems suspicious and motivates Radcliffe to delve deeper into Willie's background. During his investigation, Radcliffe uncovers a myriad of lies and secrets, which ultimately leads him to confront a man named Cobb. As it turns out, Cobb is the true killer, responsible for Michael's murder. In a thrilling confrontation, the two men fight on top of a speeding coal wagon. Radcliffe's invisibility not only aids him in overcoming Cobb but also leaves the murderer feeling as if he is battling a ghost. Cobb finally confesses to the murder, unable to bear the terrifying feeling that his sins have returned to haunt him. However, before Radcliffe can bring him to justice, Cobb is killed as he loses his balance and falls off the moving coal wagon. With Cobb's confession, Radcliffe's innocence is finally acknowledged, and the hunt for him comes to an end. However, the invisibility drug's effects are irreversible, and Radcliffe is forced to live the remainder of his life as an invisible man. He takes up a new role as a protector of justice, using his invisibility to uncover hidden truths and help those who cannot help themselves. The most extraordinary aspect of Radcliffe's new life is his newfound ability to be heard and not seen. Vincent Price, a famous actor with an iconic voice, becomes Radcliffe's disembodied voice throughout the rest of the film. As Radcliffe continues his invisible crusade against evil, Vincent Price's haunting voiceover sends shivers down the spine of every evildoer who crosses paths with the once wrongfully accused Sir Geoffrey Radcliffe."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

SEOUL — In addition to growing concerns that North Korea will pull out of the upcoming nuclear summit with the U.S., prospects for improved inter-Korean relations have also stalled, as Pyongyang demands that U.S.-South Korea joint military drills be scaled back, and a group of defectors be returned. Just weeks after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in declared the beginning of a new era of peace during a historic summit held in the demilitarized zone of the inter-Korean border, Pyongyang has put further dialogue and cooperation on hold until its demands are met. President Moon will meet with U.S. President Donald Trump in Washington on Tuesday to discuss the upcoming Trump-Kim summit and the North’s sudden conditions set for continued dialogue and cooperation. Most of North Korea’s anger last week, expressed in official statements and reports carried by the state news agency KCNA, seemed to be directed at the U.S. It criticized the Max Thunder joint military exercise that is currently underway, and U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton’s demands for the North’s unilateral nuclear disarmament. North Korea in particular objected to Bolton’s insistence that North Korea follow the Libyan model, which involved the rapid and total dismantlement of that country’s nuclear program, but it was also followed by the overthrow of the country’s leader Moammar Gadhafi some years later. Unless the U.S. eased up on its uncompromising stance, Pyongyang indicated it would pull out of the June 12 meeting in Singapore between Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump to negotiate an end the North’s nuclear program in exchange for security guarantees and an end to punishing international sanctions. President Trump later said the Libya model does not apply to North Korea and that Kim Jong Un would remain in power and “be very rich” if he makes a deal to end his country’s nuclear program. North Korea denounced South Korea, as well, for the joint military drills, calling the Seoul government...

Luckily, there are some easy options for beginners that will create the look you want in your aquarium. Look for plants that are labeled as Echinoderms, Lilaeopsis, Anarchies, or Anubis. Good options for tall plants include Amazon Sword and Java Fern. Amazon Sword grows quickly and easily, providing great cover for your wiring and filter system if it’s visible from behind your tank. Java Fern has long leaves and provides good protection for fish. For medium-sized plants, great choices include Anubias Nana and Dwarf Sagittaria. Anubias Nana has curved stems with rounded leaves. Dwarf Sagittaria has long green leaves with curved blades and grows well around hard tank decorations like stone figurines. Easy to grow freshwater mosses include Java Moss, Willow Moss, and Water Wisteria. Moss is a low-growing plant, so you can put it in the front of your tank without obscuring other plants. It also helps keep your tank clean. Moss grows quickly, so you will see fast results with this plant. Moss grows best with medium to bright light. Mosses are often edible for fish. You will still need to feed your fish, however. Not all fish will eat the moss. Another great option for the bottom and forefront of your tank is a plant called dwarf baby tears. This lush, leafy plant grows quickly like moss but it has a more shrub-like appearance. This plant grows best in bright light. Full grown plants are more expensive, but they are the easiest way to get the look you want immediately. Choose plants that have started to bud and have white roots. Inspect the plants to make sure that they are free of snails, shrimp, and algae. You can buy aquarium plants at a local pet shop or aquarium store. You can also find them online. Research the seller before you make a purchase to ensure that they have a reputation for clean, healthy plants. While it will take longer for your final look to develop, cuttings are more economical. To grow them, you will need to acquire cuttings from an existing plant, which are sold through most aquarium stores and online. Locate the lowest stem node on your cutting, then remove the leaves below it. Plant the stem in the substrate so that it will take root. You may also be able to acquire a cutting from someone you know who owns an aquarium. Layering your plants will make your tank more attractive. Background plants should be larger, while medium-sized plants can be placed in the middle of the aquarium or along the sides. You can decorate the front of your aquarium with a carpeting plant, like moss or dwarf baby tears. Plants range from small 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm) plants up to plants that fill the tank. Add figurines, rocks, and driftwood for a more interesting look. They will also provide a great place to tie down plants that do not need to be buried. What is a summary?","completion":"In summary, maintaining a freshwater aquarium can be made easier for beginners by carefully selecting appropriate plants that require minimal care and have different sizes and growth patterns. Echinoderms, Lilaeopsis, Anarchies, and Anubis are some recommended plant types. Tall plants like Amazon Sword and Java Fern help create cover for wiring and filter systems, while medium-sized plants, such as Anubias Nana and Dwarf Sagittaria, can be placed around tank decorations. Mosses like Java Moss, Willow Moss, and Water Wisteria are suitable for the front of the tank and come with the added advantage of helping to keep the tank clean. Dwarf baby tears is another excellent foreground plant option with a shrub-like appearance. Purchasing plants with budding and white roots ensures healthy specimens, and layering plants of varying sizes can make the aquarium more visually appealing. Incorporating figurines, rocks, and driftwood can enhance the overall look and provide support for certain plant types."},{"prompt":"Q:It was their first official date.

Please answer the following question: Information: - Parkway Drive is an Australian metalcore band from Byron Bay, New South Wales, formed in 2003. As of 2015, Parkway Drive has released five full-length albums (\\"Killing with a Smile\\", \\"Horizons\\", \\"Deep Blue\\", \\"Atlas\\" and \\"Ire\\"), one EP, two DVDs, a split album and one book, titled \\"Ten Years of Parkway Drive\\". The band's latest four albums have reached the top 10 of the Australian ARIA Charts, with \\"Ire\\" reaching number 1 in October 2015. - Grindcore is an extreme genre of music that originated in the early to mid-1980s. It draws inspiration from some of the most abrasive-sounding genres including hardcore punk, thrash metal, crust punk, industrial, death metal and noise rock. Grindcore is characterized by a noise-filled sound that uses heavily distorted, down-tuned guitars, grinding overdriven bass, high speed tempo, blast beats, and vocals which consist of growls and high-pitched shrieks. Early groups like Napalm Death are credited with laying the groundwork for the style. It is most prevalent today in North America and Europe, with popular contributors such as Brutal Truth and Nasum. Lyrical themes range from a primary focus on social and political concerns, to gory subject matter and black humor. - Pantera was an American heavy metal band from Arlington, Texas. The group was formed in 1981 by the Abbott brothers drummer Vinnie Paul and guitarist Dimebag Darrell along with vocalist Terry Glaze. Bassist Rex Brown joined the band the following year, replacing the original unofficial bass guitarist Tommy D. Bradford. Having started as a glam metal band, Pantera released four albums during the 1980s. Looking for a new and heavier sound, Pantera replaced Glaze with Phil Anselmo in late 1986 and released \\"Power Metal\\" in 1988. With its fifth album, 1990's \\"Cowboys from Hell\\", Pantera introduced a groove metal sound. Pantera's sixth album, 1992's \\"Vulgar Display of Power\\", exhibited an even heavier sound. \\"Far Beyond Driven\\" (1994) debuted at number one on the \\"Billboard\\" 200. - Age of Ruin is an American metalcore band from Fairfax, Virginia. The group formed in 1998 and released a demo album the following year. The band's first full-length album was self-released in 2000. - Metalcore is a broad fusion genre of extreme metal and hardcore punk. The word is a blend of the names of the two genres. Among other genres blending metal and hardcore, such as crust punk and grindcore, metalcore is noted for its use of breakdowns, which are slow, intense passages that are conducive to moshing. Pioneering metalcore bandssuch as Integrity, Earth Crisis and Converge, all of which had formed by 1990are described as leaning more toward hardcore, with their style sometimes being called metallic hardcore, whereas later bandssuch as Killswitch Engage, All That Remains, As I Lay Dying, Bullet for My Valentine, and Parkway Drive are described as leaning more towards metal. Pantera (who influenced Trivium, Atreyu, Bleeding Through and Unearth) and Sepultura have been particularly influential to the development of metalcore in the 2000s, which saw many bands in the genre achieve considerable commercial success. - Bleeding Through was an American metalcore band from Orange County, California. Formed in 1999, the band blended influences stemming from modern hardcore punk, symphonic black metal, and melodic death metal. Although the band was often labeled as simply metalcore, when Brandan Schieppati was asked if he considered Bleeding Through a hardcore band, he said: \\"I think we're a hardcore band and I'll never say we are a metal band, we're all hardcore kids and we came from the hardcore scene. Ours is just a different version of hardcore, we're trying to do something which adds a different variety to the hardcore scene, which has been sounding the same way for so long.\\" - Alveran Records was a German-based independent record label, founded in 1995 by Sascha Franzen, which releases a diverse variety of bands with different musical styles. Mainly focused on everything between metal and hardcore, there are also rock, emo and punk bands who find their way to the label's roster. Alveran is also the European partner for the US-based labels Eulogy Recordings and Hand of Hope Records. In April 2006, Alveran became the official partner of Abacus Recordings in Europe, providing Alveran the opportunity to release selected titles from the Abacus Recordings catalogue in Europe as partners. - The Tides Of Tragedy is the second full - length album by American metalcore band Age of Ruin . It was released in the United States on June 22 , 2004 via Eulogy Records and in Europe on December 13 , 2004 via Alveran Records . - Extreme metal is a loosely defined umbrella term for a number of related heavy metal music subgenres that have developed since the early 1980s. It has been defined as a \\"cluster of metal subgenres characterized by sonic, verbal and visual transgression\\". The term usually refers to a more abrasive, harsher, underground, non-commercialized style or sound associated with the speed metal, thrash metal, death metal, black metal and doom metal genres. With the exception of doom metal, all of these genres are characterized by fast tempos, attesting to their roots in hardcore punk, which has also fused with extreme metal in the forms of crossover thrash, crust punk, grindcore, sludge metal and metalcore. Though many extreme sub-styles are not very well known to mainstream music fans, extreme metal has influenced an array of musical performers inside and outside of heavy metal. - Bullet for My Valentine, often abbreviated as BFMV or B4MV, are a Welsh heavy metal band from Bridgend, formed in 1998. The band is composed of Matthew Tuck (lead vocals, rhythm guitar), Michael Paget (lead guitar, backing vocals), Michael Thomas (drums) and Jamie Mathias (bass guitar). Former members include Nick Crandle and Jason James; both were on bass. They were formed under the name Jeff Killed John and started their music career by covering songs by Metallica and Nirvana. Jeff Killed John recorded six songs which were not released; two of these tracks were reworked later in their career as Bullet for My Valentine. Financial difficulties dictated the name change, which was followed by a change in music direction. In 2002, the band secured a five-album deal with Sony BMG. The band has stated that their music is influenced by classic metal acts such as Metallica, Iron Maiden and Slayer. The band is part of the Cardiff music scene. - Hardcore punk (often abbreviated to hardcore) is a punk rock music genre that originated in the late 1970s. It is generally faster, harder, and more aggressive than other forms of punk rock. Its roots can be traced to earlier punk scenes in San Francisco and Southern California which arose as a reaction against the still predominant hippie cultural climate of the time and was also inspired by New York punk rock and early proto-punk.

Article: Hetty Robinson learnt all about money when very young. As a child, she read the financial pages of the newspaper to her rich father. Her father died when Hetty was 30, and she inherited 1 million. When she herself died in 1916, she left almost 100 million to her two children. Hetty made her money on the New York stock exchange. She was a financial genius. She made money so easily that people called her the Witch of Wall Street. But although she was one of the richest women in the world, she counted every cent and spent as little as possible. She didn't own a house, because she didn't want to pay taxes. So she and her children lived in cheap hotels. She spent almost nothing on clothes, and always wore the same long black dress. She washed it herself, but to save soap she only washed the bottom of the dress, where it touched the ground. Other people had their own offices, but Hetty used a desk in the bank where she kept her money, because it didn't cost anything. She sat in the bank and ate her sandwiches while she bought and sold stocks and shares. If the bank complained, she just moved all her money to another bank. Hetty's family paid the price for her meanness. When she was 33 she married a millionaire, Edward Green, and they had two children. But Green lost all his money, so she left him. When her son, Ned, injured his knee, Hetty didn't want to pay for a doctor, so she took him to a free hospital for poor people. Unfortunately the doctor knew Hetty was rich and he asked for money. Hetty refused and took the boy away. His leg got worse and two years later doctors removed it. But eventually Ned got his revenge . At the age of 81, Hetty had an argument with a shop assistant about the price of a bottle of milk. She became so angry that she had a heart attack and died. So Hetty's meanness finally killed her. Ned inherited half his mother's fortune, and he spent it all on parties, holidays and expensive jewellery. Question: Why was Hetty Robinson called the Witch of Wall Street?

D: She made a large amount of money easily through stocks and shares.

A collection of humorous cartoons depicting a World War Two soldier’s experiences of war have been unearthed following his death. Weston Emmart recorded his time in the Second World War by sketching amusing pictures and writing witty captions which he sent back home to his family to stop them from worrying about him. The pencil drawings depict the late American war veteran struggling with seasickness on the troop ship to the UK and coming to grips with the English weather, traffic and coffee. Heading to England: One of the sketches by late American war veteran Weston Emmart which depicts him getting on the boat to come to the UK. Sea sickness: The artist reveals how he struggled on the journey across the Atlantic. Blackout: The moment the US troops disembarked at Liverpool at night during the blackout in 1944 - all that can been seen of a line of soldiers is their eyes. There is a series of spoof sketches showing the soldier cowering from an incoming shell only to be struck by it on the bottom. Other drawings show him being brutally treated by a nurse armed with an oversized needle in hospital while he was recovering from being shot in the leg. Weston died in March this year at the age of 90. His family has since unearthed his old art work and have made it public for the first time. His grandson Alex, 34 said: 'The drawings were all created during the war at different points. Artist: Weston Emmart served in France and then Germany where he was shot in the ankle by a German machine gunner. Bombs away: One of the early images in a series of spoof sketches which depict Mr Emmart being shot at. Take cover: Mr Emmart sticks his fingers in his ears as he prepares for the bomb to land following its launch. Direct hit: Unfortunately Mr Emmart suffers the full force of the attack. 'Medic!' Mr Emmart requires attention from the medics after the bomb strikes him on the backside. Emergency operation: While Mr Emmart is left dazed and confused, a doctor attempts to remove the bomb. 'He covered his training, being shipped off to England, his reaction to English life and culture and then the cartoon of the soldier getting shot, which is self explanatory. 'My grandfather was a talented artist but was always too humble to promote himself or show off these drawings. 'Since he passed away, my uncle and I have been trying to get his work out there for the world to see.' One of the drawings that Mr Emmart sent back to his family was of the moment the US troops disembarked at Liverpool at night during the blackout in 1944. Due to the darkness, all that can been seen of a line of soldiers is their eyes. Alongside. the image, he wrote of disembarking from the crowded troop ship but had. to leave a blank space for the location for security reasons. He filled. in the word ‘Liverpool’ when he returned home from war. Sleeping conditions: Mr Emmart humorously depicts the cramped conditions on the boat. The English weather: The artist reveals how he was forced to come to terms with conditions in England. 'English coffee': Mr Emmart also had to get used to the coffee served up in England. Veteran: Mr Emmart died in March this year at the age of 90. Mr Emmart, from Baltimore, US, served in France and then Germany where he was shot in the ankle by a German machine gunner. He and two comrades hid from the enemy soldiers beneath a train at Saarbrucken station in southern Germany for two days until they were rescued. His grandson said: 'He told me that his. company was advancing through Saarbrucken when they came under heavy. fire from a German machine gunner. 'He told me that he could see the. advancing bullets striking the gravel, slowly advancing closer and. closer to his position. The next thing he knew, he felt immense pain in. his ankles and dropped to the ground. The reality: File photo showing American troops of the 8th Infantry Regiment, 4th Infantry Division at Utah Beach, in northern France, on June 9, 1944. Patrol: American troops pass through the streets of Sainte-Mere-Eglise, in Normandy, keeping a sharp lookout for German snipers on June 14, 1944. 'The two other men he was with also went down, sustaining wounds to their knees and thighs. 'My grandfather and the two other men crawled under a stationary train on the tracks as their company was pushed back by the Germans. They waited for two days under that train until another company of Americans advanced on their position. 'When the medic was attending to my grandfather, he cut off his socks and out fell the bullet that penetrated his ankles. We still have the bullet to this day.'

Answer the following question: For those of us who struggle with thoughts about our size and shape, sometimes we don’t like our bodies and our behaviour very much. It seems like an impossible task to transform our self loathing into self-love, but it is possible with these five simple steps. I started to write some examples of the self loathing dialogue I occasionally have in my head and I found I couldn’t do it. It felt as wrong as criticising my closest friend. I guess it goes to prove that the shift from loathing to love is not always huge and momentous, but subtle and gradual. When I look in the mirror and see a part of my body I don’t like, I run through these five steps in my head. This following example is the kind of internal conversation I might have about my belly. 1. POSITIVE INTENT (THE GIFT) Recognise the gift your body is giving you. My belly fat is protecting and cushioning my intestines and reproductive system. By having a higher body fat percentage my hormones are functioning as they should, enabling me to have a normal transition through perimenopause. I fit my skin and the wrinkly empty skin folds are gone. 2. FORGIVENESS Acknowledge the way you have treated your body in the past. I am sorry that I have been either starving you or stuffing you with toxic food and that I have accused you of betraying me. I now realise that my body is a reflection of my thoughts and beliefs so I was hating myself. Please forgive me for treating you so badly. 3. GRATITUDE Notice the miracles your body performs even though you have abused it. I am so thankful that even though I have treated you so badly you are still healthy and functioning. I am amazed at your ability to heal a lifetime of digestive and hormonal issues within a short amount of time. Thank you for your forgiveness and that’s it’s not too late to take great care of you.

Nitrogen is a fertilizer in the water. Since there is a lot of nitrogen, it causes algae to grow out of control. Pictured below is a pond covered with algae ( Figure below ). Algae use up carbon dioxide in the water. After the algae die, decomposers break down the dead tissue. The decomposers use up all the oxygen in the water. This creates a dead zone.

Article: Tragedy struck for brothers Rob and Paul Forkan when they lost their parents in the 2004 Asian tsunami. Now, over ten years later, they're using their flip flop business to help other orphans. The boys had an unusual childhood. They were just 11 and 13 when their parents, Kevin and Sandra, took them out of the UK education system and moved the family to Goa in India. Their parents were of the philosophy that they would receive a healthier and fuller education by traveling the world and helping others. There they did lots of voluntary work and mixed with the local community. It was when the family were on holiday in Sri Lanka that the tsunami hit. Although the children managed to escape, their parents tragically couldn't. But Paul says their upbringing meant they were able to cope with this tough blow. \\"Our parents gave us this confidence that we could do anything, that nothing was hard to achieve,\\" says Paul. What the boys did was to start a business selling ethically-sourced sandals. They're called 'Gandys' after the father of India's independence movement, Mahatma Gandhi. \\"He was in all our schoolbooks as kids; he's on all the money over in India; he's famous for wearing his flip flops,\\" says Paul. The entire project was inspired by their parents' philosophy, their globetrotting childhoods and what happened to them in Sri Lanka. Their parents had previously worked in the fashion industry before quitting their jobs and focusing on humanitarian projects. Thus, Gandys is a very fitting tribute to their lives. Gandys sells flip-flops and donates 10 percent of the profits from every pair sold to orphans around the globe. In conjunction with Gandys, the Forkans also founded Orphans for Orphans, a charitable organization dedicated to helping orphans. They say they can make a profit and do good at the same time: they give 10% of their profit to charity, and have set up their own foundation through which they've been able to open a children's home in Sri Lanka. This year alone, Gandys has sold 250,000 pairs of flip... Question: The two brothers left the UK for India because _ .

Does the sentence \\"This practice goes back to the Apollo-Soyuz mission, which first flew in 1975.\\" answer the question \\"When did Apollo-Soyuz fly?\\" Options are: (a). yes; (b). no;","completion":"(a). Yes, the sentence \\"This practice goes back to the Apollo-Soyuz mission, which first flew in 1975.\\" answers the question \\"When did Apollo-Soyuz fly?\\" by providing the necessary information about the event's occurrence in the year 1975. The Apollo-Soyuz mission, also known as the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project (ASTP), was a historic joint space mission between the United States and the Soviet Union. This mission marked the first time that spacecraft from the two competing superpowers in the Cold War met and docked in space, signifying the easing of tensions and the beginning of international cooperation in space exploration. The primary goal of the Apollo-Soyuz mission was to test the compatibility of rendezvous and docking systems to facilitate future international space missions between the two nations. This was achieved by having the American Apollo spacecraft and the Soviet Soyuz spacecraft dock with each other, allowing astronauts and cosmonauts to visit each other's spacecraft, share meals, and conduct joint scientific experiments. It demonstrated that nations with different spacecraft and technology could work together for the greater good of humanity. The mission also showcased various scientific experiments and investigations in fields such as biology, astronomy, and meteorology, which were conducted jointly by the American astronauts and Soviet cosmonauts on board their respective spacecraft. Following the successful docking and collaboration during the Apollo-Soyuz mission, many additional collaborations between the United States and other nations (including Russia, successor to the Soviet Union) have taken place in the realm of space exploration. The most enduring example of this cooperation is the International Space Station (ISS), which is managed and operated by space agencies from several nations. In summary, the sentence \\"This practice goes back to the Apollo-Soyuz mission, which first flew in 1975.\\" effectively answers the question \\"When did Apollo-Soyuz fly?\\" by pinpointing the year of the mission's flight, thus providing the necessary information for those interested in this pioneering collaborative space effort."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie title: Captain Kronos - Vampire Hunter Movie plot: When his village is plagued by mysterious deaths marked by highly accelerated aging, Dr. Marcus calls in his army friend, Captain Kronos. Kronos and his companion, the hunchback Hieronymus Grost, are professional vampire hunters. Grost explains to the initially sceptical Marcus that the dead women are victims of a vampire who drains not blood but youth, and that there are \\"as many species of vampire as there are beasts of prey.\\" The discovery of another victim confirms Grost's explanation. Along the way, Kronos and Grost take in a local barefoot girl, Carla, who had been sentenced to the stocks for dancing on the Sabbath. She repays them by helping them hunt the vampire; she later becomes Kronos' lover. Grost and Kronos conduct a mystical test that indicates the presence of vampires. Their findings are contradicted by an eyewitness who claims to have seen \\"someone old, very old\\", whereas a youth-draining vampire should appear youthful. Marcus visits the family of his late friend, Lord Hagen Durward, and speaks with Durward's son, Paul (Shane Briant), and his beautiful sister Sara (Lois Daine). He must leave before speaking with the bed-ridden Lady Durward. While riding through the woods, Marcus encounters a cloaked figure that leaves him shaken, and he finds blood on his lips. At a tavern, Kronos defeats thugs led by Kerro, who were hired by Lady Durward's coachman to murder him. Kronos, Grost, Marcus and Carla set up a network of alarm bells in the woods to announce the passage of vampires. Meanwhile, a large bat attacks and kills a young woman. Marcus realises that he has become a vampire and begs Kronos to kill him. After various methods (including impalement with a stake and hanging) fail, Kronos accidentally pierces Marcus's chest with a cross of steel that Marcus had been wearing round his neck.

Q: who was secretary of state when china was lost? A:","completion":"A: The term \\"China was lost\\" generally refers to the establishment of the People's Republic of China by the Communist Party under Mao Zedong on October 1, 1949. At that time, the United States Secretary of State was Dean Acheson. Dean Acheson (1893 – 1971) was an American lawyer and statesman who served as the Secretary of State under President Harry S. Truman from January 21, 1949, to January 20, 1953. Acheson played a pivotal role in the development of American foreign policy during the early years of the Cold War. His tenure witnessed a series of significant events, including the establishment of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the outbreak of the Korean War, and the aforementioned Communist takeover in China. The \\"loss of China\\" was viewed as a major geopolitical setback for the United States and its allies, as it increased the influence of communism in Asia. It sparked a political controversy in the United States, as critics, especially Republican politicians, accused the Truman administration and the State Department of \\"losing China\\" due to policy failures, insufficient support for the Chinese Nationalists, and a lack of effort in combating communism in China. Acheson, as the Secretary of State at that time, became a key target of criticism. However, the reasons behind the Communist victory in the Chinese Civil War were complex and multifaceted, involving historical, political, social, and economic factors. It has been argued that both American policy and the actions of the Chinese Nationalists under Chiang Kai-shek also contributed to the eventual outcome. Dean Acheson remained a steadfast advocate of the containment policy, aiming to limit the spread of communism globally. In the wake of the loss of China, he advocated for the defense of Japan, Korea, and other strategic locations in East Asia. Despite the criticisms levied against him and the Truman administration, Acheson continued to play a crucial role in shaping American foreign policy during one of the most decisive moments of the Cold War."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize: The Very Reverend Martin Thrower, 56, rector of Hadleigh, Suffolk, held his mobile phone over the top of a toilet cubicle, Norwich Crown Court heard. Thrower was arrested at a shopping centre in Ipswich in August 2016. He admitted two counts of voyeurism at a previous hearing and his sentence was suspended for 24 months. Thrower was ordered to complete a 60-day course to address sex offending behaviour, and must attend a further 30-day rehabilitation course. William Carter, prosecuting, said the rector was caught when a 17-year-old heard a noise above him as he sat on the toilet at the Buttermarket shopping centre. The teenager saw someone's hand holding a mobile phone that was filming him over the cubicle partition. He grabbed the phone and Thrower was arrested. Passing sentence earlier, judge Katharine Moore told Thrower he had been \\"well-regarded\\" by those he had helped, adding he had been a listening ear \\"in times of great sadness and some in happier times\\". She told him: \\"It seems to me that there has been a tendency throughout to attribute this persistent behaviour over a two-year period to a breakdown in your mental health. \\"I accept without reservation that you were working very hard. \\"I do not accept that your actions here though were anything other than an exercise of free choice repeated again and again when you thought you could get away with it in public lavatories.\\" When Thrower was arrested, officers found three further videos recorded on the phone that day, including of two men who had not noticed they were being filmed. Thrower, of Church Street, Hadleigh, Suffolk, is rector of Hadleigh, Layham and Shelley. He has been suspended from all roles by the Diocese of St Edmundsbury in Ipswich. Stephen Nelson, mitigating, said Thrower was of previous good character and \\"deeply remorseful\\".

Title: A bit thin Review: I bought this because I couldn't find my fleece scarf that keeps me warm. I bought the grey and it looked nice but it was just surprisingly thin. It almost felt like if I pulled hard enough it would separate and create a hole of some sort. Luckily, I found my fleece scarf so I no longer need this one. The thing is, it has got to be cold outside for me to think about wearing a scarf in the first place. If it is cold enough that I will put up with the inherent hassle of wearing a scarf, then this scarf just doesn't have the warm factor that would make me think, \\"hey let me choose the grey scarf today now that it is cold.\\" I gave it two stars because if I lose my fleece scarf again, I can wear this scarf and block out some chill.

Step 1: Read the entire review carefully and understand the context and main points. - The reviewer bought the grey scarf because they couldn't find their fleece scarf. - The scarf appeared nice but was surprisingly thin. - The reviewer felt that the scarf might tear if pulled hard. - They eventually found their fleece scarf and no longer need the grey one. - The grey scarf doesn't provide enough warmth when it is cold outside. - The reviewer gave it two stars for its minimal use and softness. Step 2: Analyze the main points to determine positivity or negativity. - The reviewer had a strong preference for their fleece scarf over the grey one. - The grey scarf was described as thin and possibly prone to tearing. - The reviewer does not see themselves choosing the grey scarf when it's cold outside. - The reviewer gave the product two stars, which indicates dissatisfaction.

Question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: In choosing a friend, one should be very careful. A good friend can help you study. You can have fun together and make each other happy. Sometimes you will meet fair-weather friends. They will be with you as long as you have money or luck, but when you are down, they will run away. How do I know when I have found a good friend? I look for certain qualities of character, especially understanding, honesty and reliability . Above all else, I look for understanding in a friend. A good friend tries to understand how another person is feeling. He is not quick to judge. Instead, he tries to learn from others. He puts himself in the other person's place, and he tries to think of ways to be helpful. He is also a good listener. At the same time, however, a good friend is honest. He does not look for faults in others. He notices their good points. In short, a friend will try to understand me and accept me. Another quality of a friend is reliability. I can always depend on a good friend. If he tells me he will meet me somewhere at a certain time, I can be sure that he will be there. If I need a favor, he will do his best to help me. If I am in trouble, he will not run away from me. There is a fourth quality that makes a friend special. A special friend is someone with whom we can have fun. We should enjoy our lives, and we would enjoy our friendship. That is why I especially like friends who are fun to be with. A good friend likes the same things I like. We share experiences and learn from each other. A good friend has a good sense of humor, too. He likes to laugh with me. That is how we share in the joy of being friends. And I know that he is looking for the same quality in me. When I meet someone who is reliable, honest and understanding, I know I've found a friend!

What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? Part of being self-reliant is undertaking certain responsibilities that enable people to experience independence. Doing simple things such as paying your bills on time, cleaning up after yourself if you make a mess, and going to work or school on time can help you feel more responsible and self-reliant. If you do not have a job, you have the responsibility of looking for a job, seeking education that will lead to employment, or starting your own business. Information is power, so having information will give you the power to make your own decisions and assert your independence. Try to be well-rounded and keep up with information about what is going on in your place of business or school, your town, your state, your country, and the world. For example, knowing that a local ordinance determining whether backyard chickens can be kept in your area is coming up for a vote can give you the opportunity to lobby and vote for the ability to keep chickens for fresh eggs. You should have a sense of direction. Something has to drive you. For example, if you are attending college, you should at least have an idea of what you want to do after college and what you are passionate about studying. You should also try to set goals for yourself. Try setting short-term, medium-term, and long-term goals, then be realistic about what you need to do to meet those goals. Seek out a career counselor if you are not sure what you’d like to do with your life. Career self-assessments can be found online. Many websites like this one or this one can offer helpful guidance. Most schools have career centers or guidance counselors available to all enrolled students. These resources can help you shape a vision for your future. Allowing people to make your decisions for you is essentially giving up your independence and self-reliance. Assert yourself and make decisions for yourself based on your goals and dreams. While it is important to be considerate towards other people, it is not necessary to give up your ability to make your own decisions. For example, if you are looking for a place to live with a roommate, be sure you are making decisions based on what is best for you. If you prefer to rent a house and have a bit more independence than an apartment building, stick to your preference and do not allow your roommate to talk you into something that you don’t want to do. It can also be common for some people to allow their spouses or significant others to make all the decisions in their relationship, from where to go out to eat to where to live and what kind of car to buy. Changing the dynamic of such a relationship may strain the relationship, but having a part in the decision making at both daily and long-term levels can give you greater control of your life.","completion":"The article emphasizes the importance of taking responsibility, staying informed, having a sense of direction, setting goals, and making decisions for oneself to achieve self-reliance and independence in various areas of one's life."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Given the question: Emily Nagoski is a badass Ph.D. who teaches human sexuality. She wrote a book – Come As You Are. Here’s a secret: the entire sexology community was eager to get their mitts on her book, it was very exciting. I can’t recall the last time there was that much hullabaloo about one book. In this important book, Dr Nagoski explains the interplay between sexual desire and stress — a concept that gives us a unique insight into what is going on in women’s sex lives. THE ACCELERATOR AND THE BRAKES This concept is a big deal. Think of the accelerator and the brake of a car. Each pedal acts independently from one another; you can press on the accelerator and you can stomp on the brakes. You can even press both at the same time. We don’t often press them at the same time – in fact, I was specifically told NOT to do that in driver’s ed – but anyhow, pretend you do. If you press both pedals all the way to the floor of the car, do you stop or go? That’s right, you STOP! Ok, now get this, your brake pedal is all the stress you have and your accelerator is your sexual desire. In the same way that the brake and accelerator of a car are two separate pedals yet also inextricably linked, so are your stress and your arousal. They are not the same things, yet have everything to do with one another. If your stress level is high, the majority of women have brakes that turn on, meaning, no matter how much sexy stuff is going on around her, she does not want sex at all. It is like she is pressing down the brakes and the accelerator at the same time. This isn’t the case for all women; some women have extremely sensitive brakes or extremely sensitive accelerators. And as Nagoski has found, while this correlation between stress and sexual desire is more common for women, men experience it too (just not quite as often). After the end of the story, Nagoski probably: - doesn't write anymore books - ignores people's questions on the book - not enough information - answers questions about her book The answer is:","completion":"After the end of the story, it is most likely that Dr. Emily Nagoski continues to engage with her audience and addresses questions about her book, \\"Come As You Are.\\" As a respected expert in the field of human sexuality with a Ph.D., she is likely to be open to discussing her work, providing additional insights, and potentially even writing more books or articles on related topics.

Lucy Stone (August 13, 1818 - October 18, 1893) was a prominent U.S. orator, abolitionist, and suffragist, and a vocal advocate and organizer promoting rights for women. In 1847, Stone became the first woman from Massachusetts to earn a college degree. She spoke out for women's rights and against slavery at a time when women were discouraged and prevented from public speaking. Stone was known for using her birth name after marriage, the custom at the time being for women to take their husband's surname. In 1887, eighteen years after the rift formed in the American women's rights movement, Stone proposed a merger of the two groups. Plans were drawn up, and, at their annual meetings, propositions were heard and voted on, then passed to the other group for evaluation. By 1890, the organizations resolved their differences and merged to form the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA). Stone was too weak with heart problems and respiratory illness to attend its first convention but was elected chair of the executive committee. Stanton was president of the new organization, but Anthony, who had the title of vice president, was its leader in practice. Starting early in January, 1891, Carrie Chapman Catt visited Stone repeatedly at Pope's Hill, for the purpose of learning from Stone about the ways of political organizing. Stone had previously met Catt at an Iowa state woman's suffrage convention in October, 1889, and had been impressed at her ambition and sense of presence, saying \\"Mrs. Chapman will be heard from yet in this movement.\\" Stone mentored Catt the rest of that winter, giving her a wealth of information about lobbying techniques and fund-raising. Catt later used the teaching to good effect in leading the final drive to gain women the vote in 1920. Catt, Stone and Blackwell went together to the January, 1892 NAWSA convention in Washington, DC. Along with Isabella Beecher Hooker, Stone, Stanton and Anthony, the \\"triumvirate\\" of women's suffrage, were called away from the convention's opening hours by an unexpected woman suffrage hearing before the United States House Committee on the Judiciary. Stone told the assembled congressmen \\"I come before this committee with the sense which I always feel, that we are handicapped as women in what we try to do for ourselves by the single fact that we have no vote. This cheapens us. You do not care so much for us as if we had votes...\\" Stone argued that men should work to pass laws for equality in property rights between the sexes. Stone demanded an eradication of coverture, the folding of a wife's property into that of her husband. Stone's impromptu speech paled in comparison to Stanton's brilliant outpouring which preceded hers. Stone later published Stanton's speech in its entirety in the Woman's Journal as \\"Solitude of Self\\". Back at the NAWSA convention, Anthony was elected president, with Stanton and Stone becoming honorary presidents. Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: Once President what was Stanton views etc?","completion":"The text provided does not explicitly mention Stanton's views after becoming president. However, it does mention that Stanton gave a brilliant speech, which was published in the Woman's Journal as \\"Solitude of Self.\\" This suggests that her views and ideas can be found within that speech."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please tell me the sentiment of the following review: The Order starts in Rome where the head of a special order of priests who deal in ghosts & demons named Brother Dominic (Francesco Carnelutti) is found dead, cut to New York City where one of his order Alex Bernier (Heath Ledger) is contacted by top-brass Cardinal Driscoll (Peter Weller) who ask's him to investigate the mysterious circumstances surrounding Dominic's death. Along with his girlfriend Mara Willims (Shannyn Sossamon) & fellow priest Thomas Garrett (Mark Addy) Alex travels to Italy to delve into his mentor's death, as the truth begins to emerge it appears that Dominic was a 'Sin Eater' someone who absorbed other's sins & lived with the burden of them so they could die peacefully & that the Church wasn't happy about his activities. Alex must do what's right even if it goes against what he believes... Also know under the title The Sin Eater this American German co-production was written, produced & directed by Bian Helgeland & didn't really do that much for me if I'm honest & I usually am, honest that is. Anyway lets start with the mess of a script that has some OK ideas but it's throughly predictable, excruciatingly dull & boring, really silly at times & it takes itself far too seriously. The whole concept is daft & while it thinks it's clever with it's oh so neat twist ending that ties everything up & brings the story full circle I thought it was the most obvious & lazy way to end things. There's the usual religious themes here, morality, sin, forgiveness, faith, belief, prophecy's, blah, blah, blah you know the sort of thing. Then there's the twists which aren't hard to see coming, there's the abuse of power by high ranking clergymen, corruption, greed, evil, etc. you know the sort of clichéd Hollywood ideals & themes that get reused every time it deals with the Church. The Order has nothing new to say & as a serious piece of film-making it sucks, a lot. I'm not too sure who The Order is meant to appeal to, as a die-hard horror fan I didn't see much horror in this at all, as a thriller it's less than thrilling, as a mystery it's too predictable & there's nothing here to really grip or maintain ones interest & for some reason I cannot figure out the IMDb also lists The Order as an action film which is absurd as it's as exciting & action-packed as the average episode of Sesame Street (1969 - present), harsh maybe but it's what I think... Director Helgeland does an OK job, the film seems to have a very soft lighting scheme & it all looks a bit drab, grayish & dull. For a supposed horror film The Order is very light on scares or horror elements, in fact there aren't any of either apart from two evil kids who can turn into a flock of birds for no apparent reason, don't ask. Forget about any gore or violence as there isn't any which is fine but it would have helped at least make The Order somewhat watchable. According the IMDb's 'Trivia' section the release date of The Order was put back so some of the special effects could be improved because they looked unintentionally funny, all I can say is judging by the finished film the effects must have been really bad to start with because they aren't exactly brilliant as it stands now. I was amazed to see The Order had a budget of about 28,000,000 which is a hell of a lot of money & I just can't see where it all went apart from the sets & production design which are good. The whole film looks & feels very average & utterly forgettable. The acting is OK although the annoying fat guy who seems to be some sort of foul-mouthed comic relief irritates, a good actor such as Peter Weller deserves better than this. The Order, I prefer the title The Sin Eater actually not that it matters too much, misses all of it's intended targets by the proverbial mile as far as I'm concerned & is a pretty dull way to waste 100 odd minutes of your life so don't do it! Not recommended.","completion":"The sentiment of this review is predominantly negative.

Answer the following question: Two sisters named Mary and Ann went in for a blood test and found out that Mary had sickle cell anemia. Ann was normal. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which sister did not have a disease in which a blood protein called hemoglobin is produced incorrectly? Hint: Another example of incomplete dominance is with sickle cell anemia, a disease in which a blood protein called hemoglobin is produced incorrectly. This causes the red blood cells to have a sickle shape, making it difficult for these misshapen cells to pass through the smallest blood vessels. A person that is homozygous recessive ( ss ) for the sickle cell trait will have red blood cells that all have the incorrect hemoglobin. A person who is homozygous dominant ( SS ) will have normal red blood cells. Answer:","completion":"Answer: Ann Step 1: Identify the question The question asks which sister did not have a disease related to incorrect production of hemoglobin. Step 2: Extract information from the given text The text states that Mary has sickle cell anemia and Ann is normal. Step 3: Determine the sickle cell anemia status According to the hint, sickle cell anemia is a disease where hemoglobin is produced incorrectly, leading to misshapen red blood cells. A person who is homozygous recessive (ss) will have this disease, while a person who is homozygous dominant (SS) will not. Step 4: Identify the sister without the disease Since Mary has sickle cell anemia, she has the disease related to incorrect hemoglobin production. On the other hand, Ann, who is normal, does not have this disease.

Does the word \\"fatigue\\" mean the same thing in \\"He was suffering from museum fatigue.\\" and \\"The American public is experiencing scandal fatigue.\\"?","completion":"Yes, the word \\"fatigue\\" carries a similar meaning in the two sentences, \\"He was suffering from museum fatigue.\\" and \\"The American public is experiencing scandal fatigue,\\" although the contexts differ. In both scenarios, the word \\"fatigue\\" refers to a state of tiredness, weariness, or exhaustion caused by a specific activity or circumstance. However, the causative factors and the way fatigue manifests in each sentence differ. In the sentence, \\"He was suffering from museum fatigue,\\" the term \\"museum fatigue\\" refers to a phenomenon where an individual becomes overwhelmed, tired, or mentally exhausted after spending excessive time visiting a museum, taking in a vast amount of information, and viewing numerous art exhibits or artifacts. It occurs because the brain finds it challenging to process a large amount of new information continuously and to pay attention to every exhibit without any breaks or pauses. This type of fatigue is more related to cognitive overload and the physical tiredness of walking through a large museum. On the other hand, in the sentence, \\"The American public is experiencing scandal fatigue,\\" the term \\"scandal fatigue\\" describes the weariness and emotional exhaustion of the public as they become increasingly disinterested in numerous scandals, especially related to politics, celebrities, or businesses. This phenomenon occurs when people feel bombarded with continuous news stories or revelations of scandals, leading them to become desensitized or indifferent to any new scandal news that emerges. While \\"fatigue\\" in both instances denotes a state of exhaustion, it is crucial to understand that the context determines its manifestation: 1. Museum fatigue: It is a combination of mental and physical exhaustion that results from consuming too much information while visiting a museum. 2. Scandal fatigue: It is emotional exhaustion caused by the overexposure to recurring scandalous news or events, leading to disinterest and desensitization. In summary, the word \\"fatigue\\" signifies a state of tiredness, weariness, or exhaustion in both sentences. However, the type of fatigue - such as cognitive, physical, or emotional - largely depends on the context in which it is being used."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A Purple Heart awarded to a soldier who was killed in Vietnam in 1966 will be returned to his family on Tuesday - two decades after it vanished and turned up in an elementary school playground. Private First Class Thomas McGraw was awarded the Purple Heart after his death in an ambush in Vietnam on February 1, 1966, while serving in the Army's 1st Cavalry Division. He was just 19. His daughter, Robyn DeCuffa, was just a toddler when he died, and when she turned 18, her mother gave her McGraw's Army medals, the flag that had covered his coffin and a photo album from his military service. 'The medal was really all that I did have from my father,' said DeCuffa, now a 51-year-old mother of eight from Cortland in central New York. But years later, the Purple Heart disappeared while she was living outside Syracuse, where her father grew up. She said someone likely stole the medal, but she wouldn't elaborate. 'It was a part of him I could physically hang on to,' she said. 'It was devastating when it was missing.' Then somehow, in the early 1990s, the Purple Heart was found by Jason Galloway on the playground at his Syracuse elementary school. He handed it in to the front office. Although McGraw's name was engraved on the back, apparently no effort was made to return it to its owner. When school ended for the year, the medal was given back to Jason, who brought it home. Karen Galloway, Jason's mother, said the medal mostly sat in a drawer in the kitchen of her family's home in Liverpool. Every now and then, her husband would search the Internet in an effort to locate McGraw and return the medal, but had no luck finding any information. 'We didn't put tons and tons of effort into it,' she said. Then, last Christmas, the now 34-year-old Jason was visiting from Virginia when his wife saw the medal and asked why the family had it since Jason, an Air Force veteran, hadn't been wounded. Reunited: McGraw's daughter Robyn DeCuffa, pictured left, will receive the medal on Tuesday. It was found by Jason Galloway, pictured right, when he was a boy but his family were unable to find its owners. When she learned how it had been found, Jason's wife said it would be 'cool' to find its owner. Weeks later, she called her mother-in-law to say she had seen a local news story on Purple Hearts Reunited, a Vermont-based organization that returns lost or stolen military medals to veterans or their families. Karen Galloway contacted the founder, Zachariah Fike, who traced the medal's origins and located DeCuffa, a manager for Capital Region Off-Track Betting, and her mother Sarah Dallas, who lives in Mexico, New York.

Mr McGuinness referred to dissident republicans as\\" traitors to the island of Ireland\\" after the 2009 murder of a police constable. Stephen Carroll was gunned down by the Real IRA in Lurgan in March 2009. He was the first police officer in Northern Ireland to be killed since the formation of the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) in 2001. Following the murder, Sir Hugh had discussed the idea of First Minister Peter Robinson and Deputy First Minister McGuinness holding a press conference. Mr McGuinness had said the chief constable should address the press as well. \\"I went out and briefed the press and then Martin came up with that statement which had I not been so tired, I think I would have fallen over,\\" Sir Hugh told BBC Talkback. \\"He was clearly very angry and he clearly saw that the violent struggle had ended and the political way forward was the right way and that these people had nothing to do with modern republicanism and political influence and democracy.\\" Sir Hugh described his relationship with Mr McGuinness as \\"professional\\" but admitted they attended the same events several times without speaking. \\"When I took over in 2002, Sinn Féin had not even joined policing... they wouldn't join policing,\\" he said. \\"I had stood opposite him in the White House during a St Patrick's Day event and they (republicans) would not speak to me. \\"I remember on one occasion, probably 2003 when they (Sinn Féin) hadn't joined policing. \\"Desmond Rea, the chair of the police board walked across the floor to say hello and they wouldn't acknowledge me at that point,\\" he said. \\"The world moved on hugely from there.\\" He said a face-to-face meeting did eventually happen. \\"The first time I think was probably at No 10 (Downing Street) when I was asked to go and meet the (Sinn Féin) leadership,\\" he said. \\"It was a courteous meeting. I talked about policing, they talked about demilitarisation. \\"The point was the meeting had taken place and we moved on from there.\\" During his time as chief constable, Sir Hugh was responsible for overseeing the reform of policing in Northern Ireland and winning the support of Catholics and Irish nationalists in the wake of 1998's Good Friday Agreement. The PSNI replaced the Royal Ulster Constabulary in November 2001 following recommendations contained in the Patton Report on policing. The Patten recommendations aimed to make the police service more welcoming to the Catholic community and more representative of Northern Ireland. Sir Hugh said that over time, Mr McGuinness \\"became persuaded it was the right thing to do\\" for Sinn Féin to support policing. \\"The officers on the ground persuaded the communities we were protecting them and being effective and he then engaged with us in a very professional and indeed positive way,\\" he said. \\"I met him many times and it was extraordinary as chief constable briefing the first minister and deputy first minister on policing and security issues mindful of his background.\\" The former chief constable said he always found Mr McGuiness easy to deal with. \\"History will judge him fairly and therefore will remind those who are interested of his violent past and his transition from that violent past through the peace process to a highly effective politician,\\" he said. \\"Indeed, many senior civil servants told me what an effective minister he was. He knew how to work within government. \\"He was a man of stature in his later years but I think they will provide a fair and balanced view.\\" Martin McGuinness died early on Tuesday in a Londonderry hospital with his family by his side.

Article: It's interesting to see how people make use of the time they spend on public transport in Indian cities like Delhi and Mumbai. In crowded buses and trains people manage to take a short nap and some even reach the snoring stage. Or they spread out a newspaper over multiple knees and arms to read about the latest sport results or political crisis. Then there are the experienced travellers who have been playing cards with the same group over the last decade or so. They even have their specific seats so well-worn that you can make out the shape of their backsides. There is no doubt about it. Travelling by public transport is being in the thick of the seasons of life -- a sweaty life in summer where people, blissfully unaware of the rivers of sweat running down their brows and inside their clothes. At the first smell of a perfumed man or woman boarding the stuffy bus or train, most people feel they are reborn. During the rains you can't avoid getting wet or muddied. The windows, almost always, are not a perfect fit and if you're not drenched by a sudden, heavy rain shower then you are bound to catch a jet spray of muddy water caused by a fellow motorist driving fast through a puddle. Rains are a perfect time for people to switch their old umbrellas for new ones. Since there are so many that look alike, it's impossible to tell whose is whose. Winter is the time when it feels good -- or at least warm -- to be part of a crowd. It is amazing how much the collective breaths of a 100 or so people can raise the freezing temperature inside. Looking at the masses dressed in their bright red pullovers or green coats, it's fun to imagine what faces lie beneath their dark woolen hats. The cold winter passes, making way for spring. It is impossible not to see every little flower by the wayside blooming proudly. And the warm sun manages to transmit some of their pleasantness to the inside of a bus or train. Now, wouldn't it be perfect if we had a public transport worth the name in all our cities? Question: If you see people in colourful clothing and breathing heavily, you are probably travelling during the _ .

Question: What was the third alcoholic beverage listed Context: In May 1985, Gorbachev delivered a speech in Leningrad advocating reforms and an anti-alcohol campaign to tackle widespread alcoholism. Prices on vodka, wine, and beer were raised in order to make these drinks more expensive and a disincentive to consumers, and the introduction of rationing. Unlike most forms of rationing intended to conserve scarce goods, this was done to restrict sales with the overt goal of curtailing drunkenness. Gorbachev's plan also included billboards promoting sobriety, increased penalties for public drunkenness, and to censor drinking scenes from old movies. Although this program was not a direct copycat of Tsar Nicholas II's outright prohibition during World War I, Gorbachev faced the same adverse economic reaction as did the last Tsar. The disincentivization of alcohol consumption was a serious blow to the state budget according to Alexander Yakovlev, who noted annual collections of alcohol taxes decreased by 100 billion rubles. Alcohol production migrated to the black market, or through moonshining as some made \\"bathtub vodka\\" with homegrown potatoes. Poorer, less educated Russians resorted to drinking unhealthy substitutes such as nail polish, rubbing alcohol or men's cologne, which only served to be an additional burden on Russia's healthcare sector due to the subsequent poisoning cases. The purpose of these reforms, however, was to prop up the existing centrally planned economy, unlike later reforms, which tended toward market socialism.

Yes, these two questions are paraphrases of each other as both are seeking ways to improve the downloading speed of Jio. In order to increase Jio downloading speed, you can try several methods and settings. Before we dive into them, it's crucial to note that the results may vary based on your Jio network coverage, device performance, and network congestion. Here are some steps you can follow: 1. Check your data balance: Insufficient data balance or crossing daily data limit can result in reduced speed. Please ensure that you have enough data balance by checking it on the MyJio app. 2. Testing your speed: The first step to improve your Jio internet speed is to test your current connection speed by using popular speed testing websites like Speedtest.net or Fast.com. Comparing your current speed with your advertised plan will give you a better understanding of whether you are getting the appropriate internet speed or not. 3. Network selection: Sometimes, your device may switch between 4G and other networks, causing fluctuations in your internet speed. The best way to address this is by selecting the preferred network. Go to Settings > Network & Internet > Mobile Network > Preferred Network Type > Choose \\"4G (LTE) only\\" or \\"4G/3G/2G (Auto Connect)\\". 4. APN settings: You can try changing your Access Point Names (APN) settings. Go to Settings > Network & Internet > Mobile Network > Advanced > Access Point Names (APN). Create a new APN with the following settings: * Name: Jio High Speed * APN: jionet * Proxy: (Leave blank) * Port: (Leave blank) * Username: (Leave blank) * Password: (Leave blank) * Server: www.google.com * MMSC: (Leave blank) * MMS Proxy: (Leave blank) * MMS Port: (Leave blank) * MCC: 405 * MNC: 857 or 863 or 874 * Authentication type: None * APN Protocol: IPv4/IPv6 * Bearer: LTE * APN roaming protocol: IPv4 Once done, save the new APN settings and set it as the default APN. 5. Clear cache: To enhance the performance of your device and reduce the load on the processor, it's a good idea to regularly clear cache and browsing history. 6. Update apps: Update your apps and device software to the latest version available. Older versions of apps may not work efficiently with your device's hardware and consume more data, resulting in slow speeds. 7. Use a download manager: Using a download manager app, like IDM, can help improve your downloading speed by breaking files into smaller parts and downloading them concurrently. This method is more efficient than downloading files sequentially. 8. Change location: If you are experiencing slow internet speed due to poor network coverage, try moving to a different area with better network signals. 9. Monitor background app usage: Disable auto-updates and background sync of apps that consume data extensively in the background. These activities can impact your overall downloading speed. 10. Contact customer support: If, after trying all these methods, your Jio downloading speed is still slow, you can contact Jio's customer support to register a complaint or get more information on what may be causing the issue."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Premise: - A casually dressed man - Gazes confused - Pile of ingredients - Kitchen counter Hypothesis: - Person (not specifically man or woman) - Looking - Pile of groceries Step 2: Compare the elements of the premise and hypothesis to see if they align. 1. \\"A casually dressed man\\" in the premise aligns with the \\"person\\" in the hypothesis, since a man is a person. The clothing description is not relevant to the hypothesis. 2. \\"Gazes confused\\" in the premise aligns with \\"looking\\" in the hypothesis, since gazing is a form of looking. The emotional state of confusion is not relevant to the hypothesis. 3. \\"Pile of ingredients\\" in the premise is similar to \\"pile of groceries\\" in the hypothesis, as ingredients can be considered a subset of groceries or items found in a grocery store. While not an exact match, these concepts are related. 4. The location of the event in the premise is on a kitchen counter, which, while not mentioned in the hypothesis, does not detract from its accuracy. Step 3: Draw a conclusion based on the alignment of the premise and the hypothesis. Based on the elements of the premise, we can conclude that the hypothesis is mostly true. The premise does tell us about a person (a man) who is looking at a pile of items (ingredients) which can be considered a subset of groceries."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: I was a waitress at the New England regional chain Newport Creamery for seven years in Jr. High, High School, and College. In college, I needed money for school supplies, so in addition to slinging ice cream cones and “Awful Awfuls” at the Creamery, I picked up a few more jobs: working the dinner shift at a family restaurant, heaving trays of cocktails at a bar until 3AM, and cleaning houses. Needless to say, I was a wreck, and a big time abuser of coffee and cigarettes. One day just before my shift at the Creamery began, I slung back a huge coffee and hauled on a Newport cigarette in the kitchen (this was when you could do things like smoke in a restaurant kitchen.) I then went out to the dining floor and approached my first table, who had been given menus and was waiting for me to take their order. “Hi, How are you today?”, I cheerfully asked the mother and her three daughters, all looking under 12. “What may I get you?…..” Then, fade to black as a huge swooshing sound took over my head. Next thing I know, I’m on the floor, covered in blood, the girls are screaming blue murder, and my manager is shaking like a leaf as he coddles me. Apparently, I passed out right onto the table of the nice family I was waiting on, then fell back and whacked my head on the corner of a wall. I remember noticing that my kelly green polyester dress was an awful shade of bloodied brown. My main concern was that I had a hot date that night, and now I had to go to the emergency room! The ER doctor was able to sew my head up, and sent me home with a diagnosis of “syncope, unknown origin”. After a few hours, I still felt spacey, but insisted on going on the date. I remember we went to a nice Italian place on Federal Hill! Here’s the Garden City location, where I worked. What did the waitress have to eat on her date?

Write an article based on this summary: People who watch BBC programmes only on iPlayer will be required to buy a TV licence to view the content from 1 September.","completion":"Title: Mandatory TV Licence for BBC iPlayer Viewers Coming into Effect from September 1 Introduction As of 1 September, viewers of BBC programmes, who solely use iPlayer to watch their favourite shows, will be required to purchase a TV licence to access content on the platform. This change has been implemented to ensure that all audiences contribute fairly to the cost of the UK's public service broadcaster, reflecting the growing use of iPlayer. Reason for the change in TV licence policy In recent years, the way people consume content has shifted significantly, with more individuals relying on online platforms like iPlayer to watch TV programmes. This has led the UK government to amend the legislation, requiring the purchase of a TV licence for those who only watch content online. The ultimate goal is to ensure that those who benefit from the BBC's programming share the financial burden of supporting the broadcaster. Cost and impact of a TV licence The current cost of a TV licence is £159 per year, which fund the public service broadcaster's operations. Until now, users who exclusively watch content on iPlayer were not required to obtain a licence. However, with these new changes, it is estimated that approximately two million more viewers will be required to pay the fee. Penalties for not holding a valid TV licence Viewers who fail to purchase a TV licence while watching content on BBC iPlayer may face penalties. These penalties can range from receiving a warning letter to being fined up to £1,000. To avoid any legal consequences, users are encouraged to check the updated regulations and acquire a TV licence when necessary. How to obtain a TV licence To secure a TV licence, viewers can visit the official website (tvlicensing.co.uk) and follow the step-by-step process. Payment can be made in one lump sum or divided into monthly or quarterly instalments. Additionally, discounts are available for individuals aged over 75 or those with certain disabilities. Conclusion The new requirement for BBC iPlayer viewers to obtain a TV licence marks a significant change in the way people contribute to the UK's public service broadcaster. The measure aims to ensure that all audiences who enjoy BBC content contribute fairly to funding its operations. As online platforms continue to grow in popularity, it is essential that the financial support for the broadcaster remains consistent, allowing the BBC to deliver its much-loved programming to audiences for years to come."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

This particular note was introduced as a new denomination following the demonetization of ₹500 and ₹1000 notes, aimed at combating corruption, black money, and counterfeit currency. This note is part of the Mahatma Gandhi (New) Series and has several distinct features for identification and security purposes: 1. Size: The ₹2000 note measures 166 x 66 mm, making it slightly larger than smaller denomination notes and aiding in the easy identification. 2. Design elements: It features a portrait of Mahatma Gandhi on the front side and the motif of Mars Orbiter Mission (Mangalyaan) on the reverse, symbolizing India's scientific and technological advancements. The denomination numeral '2000' is written in Devanagari script. 3. Colour scheme: As mentioned earlier, the note has a magenta base colour along with additional colours for intricate patterns and designs. 4. Security features: Multiple security features are in place to ensure the prevention of counterfeiting. These include a see-through register with the denomination numeral (2000), latent images, and a color-shifting security thread, which changes colour from green to blue when the note is tilted. Additionally, a microprinted numeral (2000), a numeral panel with numerals in ascending font size, intaglio printing, and a watermark of Mahatma Gandhi's portrait are present as well. For visually impaired individuals, there are raised printing elements, such as the portrait of Mahatma Gandhi, Ashoka Pillar emblem, and bleed lines.

Write a text based on \\"uproar over proposed mosque shatters calm of a chicago suburb\\" Text:","completion":"Title: \\"Chicago Suburb Divided as Proposed Mosque Creates Controversy\\" In the quiet, seemingly peaceful Chicago suburb, tensions have recently risen as the proposal for the construction of a mosque has left the community divided. What once was an idyllic haven for many residents is now the center of a heated and controversial debate that is shaking the very core of the town. The uproar began with a local faith group's plan to construct a mosque and community center on a piece of land that was formerly a public park. This religious congregation's goal was simple: to create a space where members could worship, socialize, and engage in community services. For some residents, the proposal was seen as an opportunity to embrace diversity and promote understanding among different cultures and belief systems. However, for others, it has revealed deep-seated fears and prejudices that stand between the town's serene calm and a future that fosters inclusion. Opponents of the mosque have cited concerns about traffic congestion, noise, and a potential decline in property values as reasons to halt the project. These concerns, while valid, have not always been expressed respectfully. Some opponents have used derogatory language or made baseless accusations that veer dangerously into the realm of bigotry. Meanwhile, supporters of the mosque have accused the opposition of intolerance, xenophobia, and discrimination. This unfortunate circumstance is creating rifts among neighbors and friends as lines are drawn and viewpoints clash. Despite the controversy, local government officials have started to evaluate the proposal meticulously, following all necessary legal and regulatory channels. They must consider all aspects of the proposed mosque, along with the potential impact on town resources, land use, and public safety. Impartiality and fairness must guide their decision-making, keeping in mind the values of freedom of religion and the right to gather for worship. As this suburban Chicago community continues to grapple with the prospect of a mosque in their neighborhood, one thing remains certain - this situation has exposed cracks in the façade of unity and acceptance that the town may have once taken for granted. It is now up to the residents, community leaders, and elected officials to navigate this delicate situation, striving for a resolution that fosters harmony, promotes understanding, and upholds the core values that bind us all together. The future of the suburb now hangs in the balance, as its people seek the path to healing and togetherness while facing the challenge of change."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

She leaves, and he submerges in his bath water for a moment. Only then is there music as background to his shaving the moustache and thoroughly washing it down the drain. Later, there is a ring, and he starts for the door. She comes in asking \\"why didn't you let me in?\\". He waits in vain for her to notice his clean lip. Instead, she says he hasn't commented on her \\"tarty look\\". They drive to their friends Serge (Mathieu Amalric) and Nadia's (Macha Polikarpova) house, and he says to go in while he parks. Even Serge's little girl doesn't notice the missing moustache.Marc overhears Serge call Agnes two-faced, and insists on hearing the story. About 10 years ago, Serge and Agnes (Serge's ex) spent a weekend with two other couples. Serge insisted that it was clear that Agnes arranged to hog the heat, and Agnes still adamantly maintains that she didn't. This suggests Agnes might be a liar.

Summarize: Check all product labels for safety instructions before you begin. Gloves, work clothing, and protective eyewear are all recommended. If you have single cracks less than ¼\\" (6mm) wide, use asphalt crack filler. Check the label for application instructions or apply as follows: Shake the bottle to mix the product evenly. Cut off the top of the nozzle so the opening is narrower than the crack. (If there is no nozzle, load the product into an asphalt caulk gun instead.) Squeeze the filler directly into the crack until it is flush with the driveway. Let dry for 24 hours. If the filler has sunk below the driveway surface level, apply an additional coat. Wait at least 24 hours after the final coat before walking or driving over the repair. This material is intended for \\"alligator scale\\" or \\"spiderweb\\" crack patterns, single cracks wider than ¼\\" (6mm), and small depressions shallower than 2\\" (5cm). If the alligator cracks are severe, chunks of the asphalt may be fully separated from the driveway. You may achieve a stronger repair if you remove these entirely, then refill the hole using the pothole method above. Pour a little of the material onto the center of the damage. Spread it out with an asphalt squeegee (or an asphalt brush) until the damage is covered with ⅛ to ¼\\" (3 to 6 mm) of material. Check the label instructions first. Some products may need to be mixed in a bucket before application. Spread on additional alligator patching material until the cracked area or depression is level with its surroundings. For a more even transition, squeegee out a thin layer one or two feet (0.3 to 0.6m) in each direction. The material will harden over the course of a few hours, depending on climate and depth of the repair. Thick repairs may crack slightly over the course of a few days.

Her Aunt Em and Uncle Henry take her to Dr. Worley, known for his electrotherapy treatments, and leave her under the care of Nurse Wilson. During a thunderstorm, the lab suffers a blackout and Dorothy is saved by a mysterious girl. They escape with Nurse Wilson in pursuit, and fall into a river.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Q:Information: - Statistics is the study of the collection, analysis, interpretation, presentation, and organization of data. In applying statistics to, e.g., a scientific, industrial, or social problem, it is conventional to begin with a statistical population or a statistical model process to be studied. Populations can be diverse topics such as \\"all people living in a country\\" or \\"every atom composing a crystal\\". Statistics deals with all aspects of data including the planning of data collection in terms of the design of surveys and experiments. - An experiment is a procedure carried out to support, refute, or validate a hypothesis. Experiments provide insight into cause-and-effect by demonstrating what outcome occurs when a particular factor is manipulated. Experiments vary greatly in goal and scale, but always rely on repeatable procedure and logical analysis of the results. There also exists natural experimental studies. - Analysis is the process of breaking a complex topic or substance into smaller parts in order to gain a better understanding of it. The technique has been applied in the study of mathematics and logic since before Aristotle (384322 B.C.), though \\"analysis\\" as a formal concept is a relatively recent development. - In statistics , a generalized additive model ( GAM ) is a generalized linear model in which the linear predictor depends linearly on unknown smooth functions of some predictor variables , and interest focuses on inference about these smooth functions . GAMs were originally developed by Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani to blend properties of generalized linear models with additive models . The model relates a univariate response variable , Y , to some predictor variables , xi. An exponential family distribution is specified for Y ( for example normal , binomial or Poisson distributions ) along with a link function g ( for example the identity or log functions ) relating the expected value of Y to the predictor variables via a structure such as g ( operatorname ( E ) ( Y ) ) = beta_0 + f_1 ( x_1 ) + f_2 ( x_2 ) + cdots + f_m ( x_m ) . , ! The functions fi ( xi ) may be functions with a specified parametric form ( for example a polynomial , or a coefficient depending on the levels of a factor variable ) or may be specified non-parametrically , or semi-parametrically , simply as ' smooth functions ' , to be estimated by non-parametric means . So a typical GAM might use a scatterplot smoothing function , such as a locally weighted mean , for f1 ( x1 ) , and then use a factor model for f2 ( x2 ) . This flexibility to allow non-parametric fits with relaxed assumptions on the actual relationship between response and predictor , provides the potential for better fits to data than purely parametric models , but arguably with some loss of interpretability . - In statistics, a population is a set of similar items or events which is of interest for some question or experiment. A statistical population can be a group of actually existing objects (e.g. the set of all stars within the Milky Way galaxy) or a hypothetical and potentially infinite group of objects conceived as a generalization from experience (e.g. the set of all possible hands in a game of poker). A common aim of statistical analysis is to produce information about some chosen population. - Debt, AIDS, Trade, Africa (DATA) was a multinational non-government organization founded in January 2002 in London by U2's Bono along with Bobby Shriver and activists from the Jubilee 2000 Drop the Debt campaign. - A statistical model is a class of mathematical model, which embodies a set of assumptions concerning the generation of some sample data, and similar data from a larger population. A statistical model represents, often in considerably idealized form, the data-generating process. - In statistics, multicollinearity (also collinearity) is a phenomenon in which two or more predictor variables in a multiple regression model are highly correlated, meaning that one can be linearly predicted from the others with a substantial degree of accuracy. In this situation the coefficient estimates of the multiple regression may change erratically in response to small changes in the model or the data. Multicollinearity does not reduce the predictive power or reliability of the model as a whole, at least within the sample data set; it only affects calculations regarding individual predictors. That is, a multiple regression model with correlated predictors can indicate how well the entire bundle of predictors predicts the outcome variable, but it may not give valid results about any individual predictor, or about which predictors are redundant with respect to others. - The curse of dimensionality refers to various phenomena that arise when analyzing and organizing data in high-dimensional spaces (often with hundreds or thousands of dimensions) that do not occur in low-dimensional settings such as the three-dimensional physical space of everyday experience. The expression was coined by Richard E. Bellman when considering problems in dynamic optimization. - Nonparametric regression is a category of regression analysis in which the predictor does not take a predetermined form but is constructed according to information derived from the data. Nonparametric regression requires larger sample sizes than regression based on parametric models because the data must supply the model structure as well as the model estimates. - Model selection is the task of selecting a statistical model from a set of candidate models, given data. In the simplest cases, a pre-existing set of data is considered. However, the task can also involve the design of experiments such that the data collected is well-suited to the problem of model selection. Given candidate models of similar predictive or explanatory power, the simplest model is most likely to be the best choice. - A statistic (singular) or sample statistic is a single measure of some attribute of a sample (e.g., its arithmetic mean value). It is calculated by applying a function (statistical algorithm) to the values of the items of the sample, which are known together as a set of data. - In statistics and machine learning, one of the most common tasks is to fit a \\"model\\" to a set of training data, so as to be able to make reliable predictions on general untrained data. In overfitting, a statistical model describes random error or noise instead of the underlying relationship. Overfitting occurs when a model is excessively complex, such as having too many parameters relative to the number of observations. A model that has been overfit has poor predictive performance, as it overreacts to minor fluctuations in the training data. - In statistics, an additive model (AM) is a nonparametric regression method. It was suggested by Jerome H. Friedman and Werner Stuetzle (1981) and is an essential part of the ACE algorithm. The \\"AM\\" uses a one-dimensional smoother to build a restricted class of nonparametric regression models. Because of this, it is less affected by the curse of dimensionality than e.g. a \\"p\\"-dimensional smoother. Furthermore, the \\"AM\\" is more flexible than a standard linear model, while being more interpretable than a general regression surface at the cost of approximation errors. Problems with \\"AM\\" include model selection, overfitting, and multicollinearity. - In statistics, the generalized linear model (GLM) is a flexible generalization of ordinary linear regression that allows for response variables that have error distribution models other than a normal distribution. The GLM generalizes linear regression by allowing the linear model to be related to the response variable via a \\"link function\\" and by allowing the magnitude of the variance of each measurement to be a function of its predicted value. What is the relationship between 'generalized additive model' and 'statistical model'? A:","completion":"The relationship between a generalized additive model (GAM) and a statistical model lies in the fact that a GAM is a specific type of statistical model. In other words, the generalized additive model is a subcategory within the broader range of statistical models. A statistical model is a class of mathematical models that represents a set of assumptions concerning the generation of sample data from a larger population. It captures the data-generating process in an idealized form to enable statistical inferences, predictions, and descriptions of the relationships between variables. A generalized additive model (GAM), on the other hand, is a specific kind of statistical model that blends properties of generalized linear models with additive models. In a GAM, the linear predictor depends on unknown smooth functions of predictor variables. It allows for more flexible and non-parametric relationships between the response and predictor variables, which can potentially lead to better fits to data than purely parametric models. This flexibility comes at the cost of some interpretability. In summary, the relationship between a GAM and a statistical model is that the GAM falls under the broader category of statistical models, where it represents a specific type of model that allows more flexibility in capturing relationships between variables."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The system, called Driver Alert, aims to reduce deadly road accidents by 20% - 40% that are caused by tiredness. Airline pilots can also use it to reduce the 30% of all pilot-error accidents that are related to fatigue. Driver Alert is based on a computerized wristband. The device, worn by drivers or pilots, gives out a sound about every four minutes during a car journey. After each sound the driver must respond by squeezing the steering wheel. A sensor in the wristband detects this pressing action and measures the time between the sound the driver's response. Tiredness is directly related to a driver's response time. Usually, a watchful driver would take about 400 milliseconds to respond, but once that falls to more than 500 milliseconds, it suggests that the driver is getting sleepy. In such cases the device gives out more regular and louder sounds, showing that the driver should open a window or stop for a rest. If the driver's response continues to slow down, the sounds become more frequent until a nonstop alarm warns that the driver must stop as soon as possible. The device has been delivered to the department's laboratories for testing. If these tests, scheduled for six months' time, are successful, the makers will bring the product to market within about a year. According to the text, Driver Alert _ .

Having brought home to Athens the Olympic victor's laurel crown, Phillippides becomes commander of the Sacred Guard, which is expected to defend the city-state's liberty, a year after the expulsion of the tyrant Hippias. Athenian supporters of Hippias conspire, hoping to sideline Phillippides with a marriage to Theocrites' expensive servant Charis, and thus neutralize the guard.

But new data suggest that school soft drink sales may not be an important factor in how much soda kids drink. In the current issue of The Journal of Nutrition Education and Behavior, researchers compared soda consumption among nearly 500 students inprefix = st1 /Mainewho attended seven schools over two school years. Four of the schools cut back on soft drink availability at the schools, while three of the schools made no changes. All the students were drinking less soda by the end of the study period, but there were no meaningful differences in overall soft drink consumption among the different schools. The data suggest that limiting soft drink availability at school doesn't result in meaningful changes in drink consumption patterns.

This is due to the fact that higher temperatures provide more kinetic energy to the reacting particles (atoms or molecules). With this added energy, particles move faster and collide more frequently, thus resulting in an increased probability of successful collisions that lead to the formation of product molecules. On the other hand, at lower temperatures, particles have less kinetic energy, and therefore move more slowly and collide with less frequency and force. This means that the rate of successful collisions that could lead to the formation of the product molecules decreases, resulting in a slower reaction rate overall. Given this understanding of the relationship between temperature and reaction rates, we can deduce that Paul, who studied reactions at lower temperatures, focused on the reactions with slower reaction rates. This is because lower temperatures lead to decreased kinetic energy and slower movement of particles, resulting in a reduced rate of successful collisions between reacting particles and, consequently, a slower rate of chemical reactions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: What is great art? On the one hand, we can all see that great art is old art which is called great. But how do we know which art of our own times is great, and which will be forgotten? And who decides? These are important questions, for the great art of the past often was not considered great during its own time. When Shakespeare and Charles Dickens were writing, for example, most critics considered them as hack writers with little or no literary ability. Similarly, Van Gogh and many of the other Impressionist painters of the late nineteenth century were not allowed to participate in events involving what were thought to be the \\"real\\" painters of the time, and often they were very poor. Yet today their paintings often sell for millions of dollars, while those so-called \\"real\\" painters are now barely remembered. So what makes great art? Can, for example, rock music be great art? Music videos? Cartoons and comics? Those who call themselves critics of the fine arts often have been the last to recognize great art in the past, and we can probably expect this to be the situation today. Critics often don't recognize great art because they tend to be prejudiced against what is popular. Popular works, whether they are novels, movies, or comics, are usually considered to be produced for the sake of money only, and not for the sake of art. But popularity, it seems to me, is one of the three signs that a present-day work of art may come to be thought of as great. The other two are that it is groundbreaking, and that it is inherently beautiful. Many works have one or even two of these qualities of being popular, unusual, and beautiful. But having all the three often will mean that a work of art will someday be seen to be great, though it may take a good spoonful of time, such as a century or two, to know for sure. Question: What can be inferred from the passage? Options: A: Critics have changed their attitudes to great works. B: Most of the opinions of critics are valueless. C: The work of art itself, not the critics, determines its greatness. D: Works of Impressionist painters will be great one day. The answer is:","completion":"C: The work of art itself, not the critics, determines its greatness. Step-by-step justification: 1. The article discusses the difficulty of determining which present-day art will be considered great in the future. 2. It provides examples of artists such as Shakespeare, Dickens, and Van Gogh, who were not highly regarded during their time but are now considered great artists. 3. The article suggests that critics often fail to recognize great art, as they tend to dismiss popular works as being produced only for money and not for the sake of art itself. 4. It gives three criteria that may indicate a work of art's potential for future greatness – popularity, being groundbreaking, and inherent beauty. 5. Based on the examples and criteria provided, the article implies that it is the work of art itself, rather than critics' opinions, that ultimately determines its greatness."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Use Glass If you want to drink something politely, the most suitable option among the choices given is to use a glass. The use of a glass showcases good manners, respect towards the host and dining etiquette, especially when in a social or formal situation. When choosing an appropriate glass, consider the following factors: 1. Type of drink: Different types of glasses are designed specifically for different beverages. For instance, there are wine glasses, beer mugs, whiskey glasses, champagne flutes, and water goblets, among others. Make sure to pick the correct glass for the beverage you are consuming to emphasize politeness and sophistication. 2. Size and shape: The size and shape of a glass may vary depending on its intended use. For example, if you're drinking water, choosing a water goblet or a standard tumbler would be appropriate. Whereas for wine, you should choose between red and white wine glasses, as they have distinct shapes that cater to the different aroma and flavor profiles of the wines. 3. Formality of the event: Different occasions call for different levels of formality. If you're at a casual gathering, a standard tumbler, or a casual wine or beer glass is acceptable. In a more formal setting, however, you may need to choose stemware that complements the tableware and the overall atmosphere of the event. 4. Matching the glassware: If you're in a situation where there is a variety of beverages being served, try to choose a glass that complements the other glass options on the table.

If we are discussing a situation or context that relates to Azay-le-Rideau, we can indeed conclude that \\"It's Azay-le-Rideau.\\" However, it's essential to analyze the context in which the term arises and ensure that it is applicable and relevant. The phrase \\"It's Azay-le-Rideau\\" can be interpreted from various perspectives, including geographical, historical, cultural, and architectural standpoints. 1. Geographical context: Azay-le-Rideau is situated in the Loire Valley, which is famous for its numerous magnificent chateaus. The area's landscape is characterized by vineyards and forests and is a popular tourist destination. If the discussion pertains to identifying a location within this region or highlighting spectacular landmarks, we can conclude that \\"It's Azay-le-Rideau.\\" 2. Historical context: The Château d'Azay-le-Rideau, built during the early Renaissance, represents a significant piece of French history. It was constructed under King Francis I's reign in the 16th century, following a complex historical succession of owners and architectural changes. Therefore, if the topic revolves around historical elements linked to this period or notable French chateaus, stating \\"It's Azay-le-Rideau\\" makes sense. 3. Cultural context: Azay-le-Rideau showcases French Renaissance culture, art, and architecture. The chateau is adorned with elaborate sculptures, connecting it to French cultural heritage. Additionally, the surrounding commune hosts various cultural events and boasts traditional French culture, evidenced by local food and wine.

In Great Britain, painted strips on the road to show where pedestrians should cross is named after which animal?","completion":"In Great Britain, painted strips on the road to show where pedestrians should cross are named after the animal \\"zebra.\\" This specific type of pedestrian crossing is called a \\"zebra crossing.\\" Zebra crossings are characterized by their alternating black and white stripes on the road, which resemble the pattern of a zebra's coat. The crossing's design ensures high visibility for both motorists and pedestrians, as it is more easily noticeable than regular crossings. Moreover, at a zebra crossing, pedestrians have priority, and vehicles are required to stop for people waiting to cross or for those already crossing. The origins of the zebra crossing in the UK date back to the early 1940s when several proposals for pedestrian road safety were considered. The zebra crossing was officially introduced in the United Kingdom in 1951, following a period of testing to evaluate its effectiveness in reducing pedestrian accidents on the roads. The name \\"zebra crossing\\" derived from a journalist who, during a discussion on the predecessor of zebra crossings called \\"panda crossings\\" at the Ministry of Transport, suggested to replace pandas with zebras. In addition to the painted stripes, zebra crossings feature several other distinctive elements. For instance, Belisha beacons—globular orange lights mounted on black and white striped poles—are placed on either side of the crossing to alert drivers and enhance the crossing's visibility. These beacons were named after Leslie Hore-Belisha, a British politician and Minister of Transport who implemented them in 1934. Furthermore, there are zigzag lines on the road adjacent to the crossing to indicate that parking, stopping, and overtaking are prohibited in the vicinity. Zebra crossings are one of many crossing types used in the UK and around the world. Some other common variants include pelican crossings, puffin crossings, and toucan crossings, each designed to cater to specific traffic and pedestrian conditions. In summary, the zebra crossing is named after the animal \\"zebra\\" due to the black and white stripes on the road that resembl the pattern of a zebra's coat. This particular crossing format was officially introduced in 1951, and it has been widely used ever since to ensure pedestrian safety across the UK."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

She worked as a governess while undertaking studies in art, and first took classes at the National Gallery of Victoria Art School in 1883, then again for a further term of study in 1888. During this period she was a student of Jane Sutherland, referred to in the Australian Dictionary of Biography as \\"the leading female artist in the group of Melbourne painters who broke with the nineteenth-century tradition of studio art by sketching and painting directly from nature\\".Fuller's uncle was Robert Hawker Dowling, a painter of orientalist and Aboriginal subjects, as well as portraits and miniatures. British-born, he had grown up in Tasmania and made a living there as a portraitist, before returning to his native England at age thirty. For the next two decades, his works were frequently hung at the Royal Academy. He returned to Australia in 1885, and Fuller became his pupil. In that year, aged eighteen, Fuller received a commission from Ann Fraser Bon, philanthropist and supporter of Victoria's Aboriginal people. The commission was for Barak–last chief of the Yarra Yarra Tribe of Aborigines, a formal oil on canvas portrait of the Indigenous Australian leader, William Barak. Ultimately, that painting was acquired by the State Library of Victoria.

Cheese’s employees attacked by ‘mob’ of birthday party attendees, police say Party-goers at an Ohio Chuck E. Cheese attacked employees on Sunday after complaining about a malfunctioning photo booth, according to police. These two 911 calls detail the chaos. (Parma Police Department) A complaint over a malfunctioning photo booth at an Ohio Chuck E. Cheese’s escalated into a terrifying attack involving a dozen birthday party-goers on Sunday — an incident that left two employees seriously injured, according to police. Police say a female patron complained to Chuck E. Cheese’s employees in Parma, Ohio, about the photo booth not working, and that a manager told her she had to wait. Then, police said, one of the male party attendees followed the manager into the kitchen, threatened to kill him and began to attack. Other employees tried to help their manager, and soon other party attendees joined the fracas and attacked the employees, police say. The brawl, which police say appears to have been one-sided, spilled into the dining room area, where children were present. At least five men from the party are believed to have been directly involved in the attack, with up to a dozen party attendees egging on those fighting. “I’m characterizing this as an attack on the employees of the restaurant by a mob of people,” Parma Police Lt. Kevin Riley told The Post. “There is no evidence at this point to show otherwise. This was an unprovoked attack on a bunch of employees trying to do their job.” Two managers were seriously injured and taken to the hospital but have since been released, according to police. A total of six employees were injured, including one girl under the age of 18 who was struck in the face when she tried to call 911. Those involved in the attack appear to be adults, police said, but they fled the scene before police arrived. Police are planning to release surveillance footage in an effort to track down the attackers, Riley said. “We are anxious to bring these individuals to justice and are actively working with Parma police to provide information that will lead to their arrest,” Chuck E. Cheese’s said in a statement. In one 911 call released by police, a male restaurant employee tells the dispatcher: “I need cops, I need ambulances, I need everything.” “I was standing back here, we had one manager come through being assaulted by a man,” the caller says. “I don’t know the backstory on it. And then the next thing I see several people crowding around the entrance of the kitchen, and I see a large fight breaking out.” A female employee called 911 from the break room, where she told the dispatcher “everybody’s freaking out.” “My managers, both of them, were attacked,” she said. “I don’t know if they had weapons.” Several years ago, The Wall Street Journal published a story about violence at the pizza parlors, reporting: “Chuck E. Cheese’s bills itself as a place ‘where a kid can be a kid.’ But to law-enforcement officials across the country, it has a more particular distinction: the scene of a surprising amount of disorderly conduct and battery among grown-ups.” Fights among guests are an issue for all restaurants, but security experts say they pose a particular problem for Chuck E. Cheese’s, since it is designed to be a haven for children. Law-enforcement officials say alcohol, loud noise, thick crowds and the high emotions of children’s birthday parties make the restaurants more prone to disputes than other family entertainment venues. In a statement following the attack in Ohio, Chuck E. Cheese’s said: “We take any incident in our stores very seriously and have spent more than 15 million to date on measures to help ensure the safety of our guests. With an environment dedicated to serving young children and families, we will not tolerate violence of any kind in our stores. “As a company, the safety of our guests and employees is always a top priority and we will continue to endeavor to the protect the experience families have in our locations so parents are able to trust that their time in Chuck E. Cheese’s will be clean, safe, wholesome family fun.” According to the company, there are more than 580 Chuck E. Cheese’s restaurants around the world.

Liam found out he has high cholesterol, while Rudy found out his triglycerides and cholesterol are within normal parameters. and a hint : Cholesterol has been implicated in heart disease for decades. Atherosclerosis is a disorder of the arteries in which cholesterol and other materials are deposited on the interior of the arterial wall. These deposits lead to the formation of plaques that can restrict or even block the flow of blood through these blood vessels (see Figure below ). A decrease in the flow of blood can lead to high blood pressure and a lowered oxygen supply to the heart muscle. A complete blockage of blood flow to parts of the heart (a heart attack) can cause significant damage due to oxygen deprivation, in some cases leading to death. Please answer this question : Which brother was more at risk for heart disease? Answer:","completion":"Based on the given information and the hint provided, Liam, who has high cholesterol, is more at risk for heart disease. The hint explains that cholesterol has been implicated in heart disease for decades and that it plays a role in the development of atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis can lead to restricted blood flow, high blood pressure, a lowered oxygen supply to the heart muscle, and even complete blockages that cause heart attacks.

White team warmed up before the race, but Blue team arrived with a bus late and didn't have time to warm up properly before the race. Which team's racers didn't have their muscles prepared for an activity? Hint: Sometimes muscles and tendons get injured when a person starts doing an activity before they have warmed up properly. A warm up is a slow increase in the intensity of a physical activity that prepares muscles for an activity. Warming up increases the blood flow to the muscles and increases the heart rate. Warmed-up muscles and tendons are less likely to get injured. For example, before running or playing soccer, a person might jog slowly to warm muscles and increase their heart rate. Even elite athletes need to warm up ( Figure below ).

Article: George Gershwin, born in 1998, was one of America's greatest composers. He published his first song when he was eighteen years old. During the next twenty years he wrote more than five hundred songs. Many of Gershwin's songs were first written for musical plays performed in theatres in New York City. These plays were a popular form of entertainment in the 1920s and 1930s. Many of his songs have remained popular as ever. Over the years they have been sung and played in every possible way -- from jazz to country. In the 1920s there was a debate in the United States about jazz music. Could jazz, some people asked, be considered serious music? In 1924 jazz musician and orchestra leader Paul Whiteman decided to organize a special concert to show that jazz was serious music. Gershwin agreed to compose something for the concert before he realized he had just a few weeks to do it. And in that short time, he composed a piece for piano and orchestra which he called Rhapsody in Blue. Gershwin himself played the piano at the concert. The audience were thrilled when they heard his music. It made him world-famous and showed that jazz music could be both serious and popular. In 1928, Gershwin went to Paris. He applied to study composition with the well-known musician Nadia Boulanger, but she rejected him. She was afraid that classical study would ruin his jazz-influenced style. While there, Gershwin wrote An American in Paris. When it was first performed, critics were divided over the music. Some called it happy and full of life, to others it was silly and boring. But it quickly became popular in Europe and the United States. It still remains one of his most famous works. George Gershwin died in 1937, just days after doctors learned he had brain cancer. He was only thirty-nine years old. Newspapers all over the world reported his death on their front pages. People mourned the loss of the man and all the music he might have still written. Question: What did Gershwin do during his stay in Paris? Options: A: He created one of his best works B: He studied with Nadia Boulanger C: He argued with French critics D: He changed his music style Answer:","completion":"A: He created one of his best works Reasoning: During Gershwin's stay in Paris, he wrote \\"An American in Paris,\\" which is mentioned in the article as one of his most famous works.

Structurally, the two sentences are highly similar. Both sentences follow a clear subject-verb-object (SVO) format with a woman being the subject, who performs an action on a type of food. However, it is important to look at the actions and the objects to determine their semantic similarity. In the first sentence, the action performed is \\"peeling,\\" while in the second sentence, the action is \\"slicing.\\" Although both of these actions involve cutting or altering the object, they differ from each other. Peeling primarily means removing the skin or outer layer of the object, while slicing refers to cutting it into thin, flat pieces. These differences suggest that the actions described in the sentences are not identical, indicating a lower level of similarity. Next, we will consider the objects of the sentences: a potato in the first one and a tomato in the second one. Both potatoes and tomatoes are commonly used vegetables and share some commonalities in terms of their culinary uses. However, they still have significant differences in taste, texture, and application in various dishes. This distinction further reduces the similarity between the two sentences. Given the structured similarity and the degree of difference in both actions and objects, I would rate the similarity between these two sentences as a 2 (c) on a scale from 0 to 5. They share a common structure and topic regarding a woman and food preparation, but the specific actions and objects still differ significantly."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a title for this article: FORTUNE — While I was living in Dallas in the late 1980s, researching and writing A Payroll to Meet: A Story of Greed, Corruption and Football at SMU, I read a memorable essay by a native son, Lawrence Wright, published in Texas Monthly, called “Why Do They Hate Us So Much?” One of the stories Wright tells took place during a family road trip in the summer of 1964, when he was a teenager. Somewhere in Florida, they stopped for gas. The attendant noticed the license plate. “Where from in Texas?” he asked, and when Wright’s father said, “Dallas,” the attendant “stuck his face up to the window to get a closer look at us.” And then he said, “You all killed our president.” “That reaction endured … for years” Wright wrote, “even after Memphis and Los Angeles had their own tragedies. Dallasites always begrudged the fact that those cities were never taken down, the way Dallas was, and made to feel at one with Birmingham and Selma.” At Southern Methodist University in Dallas, they know the feeling. More than a quarter-century has passed since the SMU Mustangs football team received the NCAA’s so-called death penalty for repeated, egregious violations of recruiting rules, yet the story still shocks and amazes. It was the subject of a powerful 2010 film, Pony Excess, that was the highest-rated premiere in ESPN’s Peabody Award winning 30 for 30 documentary series (I appeared on camera) and prompted the reissue of my book this fall by University of Nebraska Press. MORE: Fast cars and furious data No reasonable person disputes that SMU got what it deserved. SMU boosters were paying players; SMU coaches knew all about it; and numerous SMU officials — all the way up to Bill Clements, a two-time Texas governor and chairman of the university’s board — were actively involved. It was an outrageous scandal, and it earned SMU what is still the harshest penalty ever levied against a major college football program: a complete one-year ban on competition, followed by a partial ban in year two. (SMU could have played an away-games-only schedule the second year but chose not to, partly out of fear for the safety of the few undersized players who remained.) Some would argue that paying athletes to perform in contests that are otherwise thoroughly professional shouldn’t be a crime in the first place, and they’d have a point. But there was something profoundly dispiriting and exploitational in the whole sordid SMU affair. Two of the players who were paid the most gained nothing from their association with SMU, and more likely were scarred by it. Offensive lineman Stopperich never played a single down for the Mustangs. He died of a cocaine overdose in 1995 at age 29. Linebacker David Stanley did take the field for the Mustangs, however briefly, but he wound up in drug rehab, paid for — out of compassion, perhaps, or maybe just because Stanley knew too much — by his SMU sugar daddy. After battling substance abuse for years, Stanley died in his sleep in 2005. He was 41. But shouldn’t the dark cloud have dissipated by now, as it has for other bad actors, including some whose transgressions dwarf SMU’s? Southern Cal seems to have recovered. Yes, running back Reggie Bush had to give back the Heisman Trophy he won in 2005 after he and his family were found to have accepted payments totaling hundreds of thousands of dollars from an agent. And yes, the Trojans forfeited all the games they won that year, and gave up 30 scholarships, but otherwise? USC still plays to big Saturday afternoon crowds at the Coliseum, still wins more games every year than it loses, and last fall (after a two-year bowl ban expired) collected 2 million for playing in the Sun Bowl. USC is still USC. MORE: Old athletes never die. They just move to your iPhone And Penn State? It doesn’t get any worse than what happened at Penn State, where a special investigation led by former FBI Director Louis Freeh found that the head coach, the athletic director and the president of the university knew of allegations against assistant coach Jerry Sandusky involving child sex abuse and failed to take appropriate action. (Sandusky was ultimately convicted on 45 of 48 counts.) Penn State was fined 60 million by the NCAA (the Big Ten Conference tacked on 13 million), forfeited from 1998 through 2011, and lost 60 scholarships and the right to play in a bowl game for four years. Practically speaking, that was a harsher set of sanctions than SMU endured, even if it wasn’t the death penalty. But Penn State still drew an average of more than 100,000 fans to its seven home games last fall, still had a winning season, and still appeared regularly on national TV, where announcers routinely heaped praise on the loyal Nittany Lion players who could have gone elsewhere to finish their college careers but stayed behind to help rebuild a storied program. Penn State is still Penn State. The NCAA’s stated purpose in punishing SMU so severely was to give other potential cheaters something to think about. The theory being, as with the actual death penalty — the one involving lethal injection or an electric chair — that SMU’s example would serve as a general deterrent. It didn’t turn out that way. The dismal parade of recruiting violations, academic fudging, and general bad behavior by athletes, agents, boosters, coaches, and administrators continues unabated. One way SMU might have responded in the wake of the scandal was by scaling back its program, or simply opting out of football altogether. There are precedents for that. The University of Chicago, a founding member of the Big Ten Conference and winner of two national championships in 1905 and 1913, quit playing in 1939 after President Robert Maynard Hutchins decided that the whole bloody spectacle had gotten out of hand. College football, Hutchins wrote, had become an “infernal nuisance,” incompatible with the university’s larger academic mission. Decades later, Chicago did return to the field, but now it competes against colleges like Beloit, Elmhurst, and Rhodes in the NCAA’s Division III, which doesn’t allow athletic scholarships. MORE: Did two guys from Philly just create the best fantasy football platform? A few lonely voices suggested a similar course for SMU, among them, oddly, Governor Clements. Instead, SMU hired Hall of Famer Forrest Gregg as its new coach, with a mandate to bring SMU back from the dead. Gregg promised a fast fix and a return to gridiron glory, but it was not to be. Over the next 20 years, SMU suffered 18 losing seasons, including six when it won just one game, and one, in 2003, when it didn’t win any. SMU’s demise coincided with the breakup of the storied Southwest Conference. The strongest programs, chasing TV-network millions, migrated to the Southeastern Conference and the Big 12. The weakest, SMU among them, bounced from one lesser conference to another and dropped off the big-time college football map. In recent years, however, football has undergone a quiet revival on the SMU campus. Coach June Jones has taken the Mustangs to four straight bowl games, and won three. They play their home games on campus now in Ford Stadium, a tidy, red-brick horseshoe on Mockingbird Lane. This year’s season opener at home against Texas Tech — Friday night, August 30, at SMU’s Ford Stadium — will be televised nationally by ESPN. If you were to go, you might see some familiar faces: Lance McIlhenny, who quarterbacked the Mustang’s lethal option offense in the early 1980s, attends often, as does Eric Dickerson, one half (with Craig James) of SMU’s famed Pony Express backfield, who went on to a Hall of Fame career in the NFL; and so, occasionally, does former head coach Ron Meyer, the architect of SMU’s disgrace. Coach Meyer left SMU for the NFL in 1982, where he won two AFC coach of the year awards and finished with a career record four games over .500. Later he teamed up with SMU’s most notorious bagman turned player agent, Sherwood Blount, representing some of the same players he had once recruited. Now he’s mostly on TV, doing NFL commentary for a Canadian sports network. You might think Meyer would not be welcome anymore on the SMU campus. But only if, after all these years, you still haven’t forgotten.

A former slave who helped free those still in bondage, she’s a perfect choice to replace murderous Andrew Jackson. And that’s the problem. Nowadays, it’s impossible to honor many true giants because their line of work itself has become suspect. The blame for this lies almost entirely with the right wing, which vilifies, belittles or simply defunds environmentalists, women’s health-care champions, seekers of urban justice, defenders of proper city planning and even honest scientists. 'HAMILTON' CREATOR THRILLED ABOUT 'TUBMAN' ON THE 20 So here are the greatest American heroines who will never be on a bill — entirely because the radical right has turned their work from something essential into something controversial. Sanger probably did more for American women than any other person. Radicalized by federal laws banning contraception, she began her career as a women’s health care activist by caring for women after botched “back-alley” abortions. Eventually, she turned her attention to preventing unwanted pregnancies, coining the term “birth control” in 1914, getting arrested for distributing diaphragms, and creating the precursor to Planned Parenthood. Later in life, she pressured scientists to create an oral contraceptive, which we all know today as The Pill. And just before her death, the Supreme Court struck down the anti-contraception laws that Sanger spent her life fighting. Today, her pioneering work is marginalized in the debate over abortion, thanks to the terminations performed by Planned Parenthood today. Carson basically founded the environmental movement with her 1962 book, “Silent Spring,” which Gladwelled the idea that pesticides were hurting the environment. The chemical companies and their right-wing enablers hated her, but her work led to bans on DDT and other toxins — and even led to the creation of the Environmental Protection Agency under President Nixon, a Republican when being Republican meant caring for the environment. Funny how the one agency that almost every GOP candidate demonizes on the campaign trail is the one Nixon created. Jacobs in no small part saved urban America, thanks to her book, “The Death and Life of Great American Cities” in 1961. Jacobs’ targets in the book — suburbanification, mallification and anti-city superstition — are the basics of Republican urban policy these days. She was way ahead of her time in opposing Robert Moses’ vision of highway-cluttered cities, and her notion that sidewalks, not cars, are the key to urban vitality still makes the SUV-loving GOP crazy. Plus, her fight against Moses’ proposed Lower Manhattan Expressway saved Greenwich Village, that hotbed of liberalism. Cammermeyer was, in essence, the first gays-in-the-military activist, albeit an unwitting one. After a 15-year marriage to a man, Cammermeyer, a long serving National Guard vet who had won a Bronze Star in Vietnam, began a relationship with a woman. During a routine security clearance hearing in 1989, she chose not to lie about it, admitting that she was a lesbian. She was drummed out of the service for it — the highest ranking person to be discharged because of her sexual orientation. She fought the discharge and won — leading to the end of the ban on homosexuals serving in the military and also the end of the equally discriminatory “Don’t ask, don’t tell” policy.” The work of Mead, an anthropologist, helped bring about the Sexual Revolution, which continues to horrify the right wing to this day. Mead criticized Victorian values as stunting American children’s transition to adult sexuality, and championed biology over social conventions. In the later part of her career, she urged Americans to get comfortable with sexual orientations different from their own. She was widely criticized for bringing her own “pansexual” agenda into her research, but most credible scientists support her findings. Another reason why she’ll never get on a bill: Jimmy Carter gave her the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Still another? She’s credited with the famous activist creed: “Never doubt that a small group of committed people can change the world. Indeed, it is the only thing that ever has.” That kind of talk scares some people.

Negative Yelp Review Title: Disappointing experience at Famous Delights Restaurant I am an ardent food lover, and ever since Famous Delights opened in our area, I was excited to give it a try. Finally, my friends and I decided to dine there last Saturday, but sadly, our experience was far from being delightful. As soon as we entered the restaurant, we sensed an air of unprofessionalism. We had a reservation at 7:30 PM, but the hostess took nearly 15 minutes to find a suitable table for us. Although the place was spacious and well-lit, the tables were quite close to each other, making it difficult for us to have private conversations. Our evening was off to a rough start, but we still pinned our hopes on the food to salvage the experience. The server took our orders after an excruciatingly long wait of 20 minutes, and he seemed overwhelmed and careless when jotting down our choices. The menu had an impressive variety, but the actual food failed to match up. The Famous Delights Chicken that came highly recommended was greasy and lacked essential seasoning. The vegetables in our salad seemed old and the dressing tasted overpoweringly of vinegar. On top of that, our side dish, the garlic mashed potatoes, had hardly any garlic flavors. We tried addressing these concerns with our server, but he was visibly disinterested and dismissive of our feedback. Our drinks were refilled only once, and one of my friends never received her beverage. As the meal proceeded, we observed how the staff was ignoring other patrons—helping us understand that our experience was not an isolated incident. People at neighboring tables were voicing their dissatisfaction, and unfortunately, nobody seemed to care about their concerns. The overall ambiance suffered from the lackadaisical attitude of the staff. The entire evening was marred by poor food quality, unresponsive staff, and an intrusive atmosphere. My friends and I left feeling disappointed and frustrated with the whole experience. I rarely write reviews, but I felt the need to share our experience to give others a heads-up before visiting Famous Delights. In conclusion, Famous Delights seems to have dropped the ball when it comes to meeting the basic expectations of any food enthusiast. I hope the management takes the necessary steps to improve their service and food quality. Until then, I cannot recommend this restaurant to anyone, and my friends and I will not be returning."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Run-down and left to the elements, these abandoned buildings offer a sometimes macabre, often poignant insight into their history - as a leper colony. The centuries-old institution on the Greek island of Chios once housed dozens of outcasts who had contracted the disease, which is still often misunderstood today. These evocative photos by Kelly Katsarou vividly reveal the environment in which the lepers were forced to live out their lives. Scroll down for video. Welcoming? The gates to the leper colony situated on the Greek island of Chios. Cruel: But parts of the archaic colony can also be unexpectedly beautiful, as these pictures show. Isolated: The building is shut off from the rest of the island to prevent the infection spreading. Left to suffer: This woman shows the affects of. leprosy to her hands and face. Greek leper colonies are the subject of. Victoria Hislop's best-seling debut novel The Island. Leprosy, also known as Hansen's disease after physician Gerhard Armauer Hansen, is a chronic disease caused by the bacteria Mycobacterium leprae and Mycobacterium lepromatosis. Left untreated, the disease can cause permanent damage to the skin, nerves, limbs and eyes. A common myth is that body parts can fall off, but it can cause limbs to become numb or diseased from secondary infections. Although the form of transmission remains uncertain, it is thought to be through respiratory droplets. The World Health Organization estimated that in 1995 between two and three million people were permanently disabled because of leprosy. In the past 20 years, 15 million people have been cured of leprosy worldwide. The colony, called Lovokomeio, opened in 1378 as the first leper colony in Greece and one of the first in all of Europe. It. was intended to isolate those suffering from leprosy and other. contagious skin diseases from the rest of society in order to avoid. infecting others. The origins of leprosy, now known to be caused by a bacterium, were then unknown, adding to the stigma placed on its sufferers. As the disease was so poorly understood, many of the 'lepers' sent to the colony did not even suffer from it - rather, they had other skin diseases or fungal infections. Such was the fear and stigma, settlements were usually built in. isolated locations such as islands. Sometimes, however, they. were deliberately set up to be accessible so that they were kept in the public eye, and thus received a steady flow of. donations. Lovokomeio was no such colony. Fitting with the commonly held belief of the time that the disease was a punishment from God, there was a church dedicated to St Lazarus, the patron saint of lepers. Step inside: The abandoned leper colony is now a tourist attraction since being shut down in 1957. Picturesque: Some of the photographs make you forget the sinister past of the buildings. Eerie: Other images bring home the horror of what used to happen at the institution. Outdated: Lepers were made to live with one another and forbidden from mixing with their families. It is just one of the run-down buildings on the colony photographed by Kelly Katsarou, where children’s. notebooks and medicines lie scattered alongside open tombs. Doors are smashed, stripped beds lie. rusting, and rotting floorboards give an ominous creak whenever someone. is foolhardy enough to put their weight on them. While it would of course have been. miserable to be separated from one's family and placed in a. colony, these pictures show that there were positives to be found in life at the colony. Ancient: The colony opened in 1378 as one of the first homes for lepers in the whole of Europe. Beautiful: Photographer Kelly Katsarou managed to transform the creepy colony into these stunning images. Decline: The 19th century brought warfare and natural disasters to Chios. Sign: A Greek poster advertising 'The leper colony of Chios' to would-be visitors. Some areas of the complex are undeniably beautiful, and it could have been a consolation to spend time with fellow sufferers who could empathise with each others' plight. The colony at Chios began to decline during the 19th century, when the island was the centre of fierce fighting in the Greek War of Independence. By the middle of the century Chios was largely deserted, and the situation was worsened by an 1881 earthquake which killed nearly 8,000 people. The colony was finally shut down for. good in 1957, by which time a cure had been found for leprosy and much. of the stigma had disappeared in the West. However, there are still hundreds of leper colonies open around the world, particularly in India. Storeroom: Old furniture from the colony stacked up in a room since it closed down. Mystery: The cause of leprosy was unknown until it was discovered to be a bacterium in the late 19th century. Stigma: Many believed that the illness was a curse from God due to references to it in the Bible. Relic: But hundreds of leper colonies are still operating around the world, particularly in India. Back in time: The building has been left just as it was and is now a valuable historical exhibit. Grim: But some leprosy sufferers may have been able to enjoy a reasonable quality of life.

Answer:","completion":"Gérard Ouellet was born on February 17, 1913, in East Hartford, Connecticut, United States. Despite being born in the United States, his life and career were deeply rooted in Canada as he and his family eventually moved to Rimouski, Quebec. He dedicated his life to public service, which was evident through his lengthy involvement as a politician and a devoted family man. Before embarking on a political career, Ouellet pursued the humble profession of farming. This provided him with a deep understanding of the struggles and challenges faced by the agricultural sector, which became a key component of his political platform later in life. Ouellet's political affiliations and beliefs were with the Progressive Conservative Social Credit party. This political party had a complex blend of ideologies, combining conservative fiscal values with aspects of social welfare and equitable distribution of resources. His party membership signified that he was a firm believer in responsible, sustainable economic policies, as well as the importance of addressing social issues faced by everyday individuals. This dedication to balance and equitable opportunity made him a popular figure among his constituents. In April 1963, at the age of 50, Ouellet was elected to represent the riding of Rimouski in the Canadian Federal Parliament. Upon taking office, he actively participated in the process of shaping policies not only for the residents of Rimouski, but for all Canadians, demonstrating his ongoing commitment to public service. In his capacity as a Member of Parliament he sought to improve policies that affected the local agricultural industry using the valuable knowledge he gained as a farmer. Ouellet's term in office lasted until September 1965. Although his tenure was relatively brief compared to other politicians, he left his mark on the political landscape of the time. During his tenure, he advocated for policies and legislation that would reinforce the agricultural sector and improve the quality of life for everyday Canadians. Parallel to his political career, Ouellet maintained a fulfilling personal life with his spouse Germaine Parent. Their partnership and unwavering support for one another no doubt contributed to Ouellet's dedication and perseverance in his political and professional pursuits. Gérard Ouellet passed away on April 3, 1975, in Rimouski, Quebec – a testament to his deep connection to the region he served loyally throughout his life. His passion for addressing social and economic issues, coupled with his career as a farmer and his time in office, left an indelible mark on the political fabric of his time. Ouellet's life remains a shining example of an individual who devoted their life to public service and bettering the lives of their fellow citizens."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

If I tell you that Windpower can convert energy into electricity, and ask you the question \\"what does windpower get converted into?\\", is the correct answer \\"magnet\\"? Answer:","completion":"No, the correct answer is not \\"magnet\\". When discussing wind power, the conversion of energy usually refers to the conversion of kinetic energy from wind into electrical energy. This process takes place within a wind turbine, where the wind's kinetic energy turns the turbine's blades, which spins a generator to create electricity. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the process: 1. Wind blows and pushes against the blades of a wind turbine. 2. The blades, being carefully shaped and angled, are set into motion by the force of the wind. 3. The rotation of the blades turns a central shaft, usually with the help of a gearbox to increase the rotational speed. 4. The central shaft is connected to a generator, which is comprised of magnets and coils of wire. 5. The spinning shaft causes the magnets to rotate around the coils of wire, generating an electrical current. 6. The generated electrical current is then transmitted through power lines to be distributed and used for various applications. So, in summary, wind power gets converted into electrical energy, not a magnet. The magnets are a component of the generator within the wind turbine, which plays a crucial role in converting the wind's kinetic energy into electricity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The race pits controversial Republican Roy Moore, who is battling sexual harassment allegations, against Democrat Doug Jones, a former prosecutor. The outcome of the race could have national implications for both political parties and for President Donald Trump. Moore has denied several allegations of sexual misconduct when he was in his 30s involving women who were teenagers at the time, including one who was 14. \\"I do not know them. I had no encounter with them. I never molested anyone,\\" Moore said in a televised interview Sunday with the Voice of Alabama Politics. Jones says the accusations make Moore unfit to serve in the Senate. \\"It is crystal clear that these women are telling the truth and Roy Moore is not!\\" Jones said. Trump recorded a get-out-the-vote phone message for Moore and spoke on his behalf at a rally in neighboring Florida on Friday. \\"And we want jobs, jobs, jobs. So get out and vote for Roy Moore. Do it. Do it,\\" he said. Trump held off on endorsing Moore for several weeks in the wake of the sexual misconduct allegations, but now says electing Moore is a priority for him. \\"We certainly don't want to have a liberal Democrat who is controlled by Nancy Pelosi and controlled by Chuck Schumer. We don't want to have that for Alabama,\\" Trump said. In the final days of the campaign, Moore is highlighting his support for the president's agenda. \\"We are going to see if the people of Alabama will support the president and support his agenda in Washington by electing somebody that is not part of the establishment there,\\" Moore said.

To provide a detailed answer: Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria was assassinated on June 28, 1914, in Sarajevo, Bosnia, by Gavrilo Princip, a Bosnian Serb member of the nationalist secret society known as the Black Hand. This assassination is considered one of the main triggers for the beginning of World War I. At that time, Bosnia was under the administration of Austria-Hungary, and the Archduke's visit was seen as a provocation by the nationalist groups who sought independence from Austro-Hungarian rule. After a failed attempt to kill the Archduke with a bomb earlier in the day, Gavrilo Princip took advantage of a wrong turn made by Archduke's driver and shot both Franz Ferdinand and his wife, Sophie, at a close distance.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"Yes, the supposed perturbation has an indirect effect on the process. If the pancreas releases more insulin than necessary, it will cause blood sugar levels to decrease more than normal, potentially leading to hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). As a result, cells in the pancreas will need to release more glucagon to counteract the excess insulin and help bring blood sugar levels back to normal. The liver will then convert more stored glycogen into glucose and release it into the blood.

But, as they say, love knows no age or boundaries. And so, Prince Harland and Queen Gran's love story continued to mystify those who knew them. In the large room full of people, the queen's presence didn't go unnoticed. In her modest attire, tending to the needs of her kingdom and people, she transcended the pomp and circumstance of the typical royal demeanor. Queen Gran could have chosen a life of luxury, opulence, and indulgence, but instead, she valued simplicity and the contentment it brought. As the unlikely couple stood side by side, their love and affection for each other warmed the hearts of those around them. It was evident that love isn't just about physical allure or elaborate gestures; true love is based on connection, understanding, and a shared life built on trust and respect. Jared couldn't help but be slightly envious of the emotional bond that Prince Harland and Queen Gran shared. While he had always seen the queen as an authoritative figure who commanded respect and submission, Prince Harland's tales of laughter, whispered secrets, and the simple joys they shared as a couple painted an entirely different picture. Looking around the room, Jared realized that if a humble woman like the queen could find such immense happiness and fulfillment in her unconventional love story, perhaps there was hope for everyone. It challenged the stereotypes that came with royalty and the expectations society held for members of the royal family. As the evening progressed, the lively chatter in the room grew louder; with both young and old sharing stories of love, listening to one another, and finding solace in the hope that true companionship isn't reserved only for those deemed picture-perfect by society's standards. The queen's unpretentious nature reminded everyone that, beneath the crown, she was still a woman with feelings, desires, and dreams, just like them. As the room emptied and the guests bid their farewells, Jared found himself contemplating the beauty of love and its power to break through social constructs. The genuine connection between Prince Harland and Queen Gran left an indelible mark on his notions of love, prompting him to redefine what he had previously believed. In the end, this simple evening had brought forth a profound lesson for all who were present: a queen is a queen, no matter what she wears – or does. It's not about the garments or the adornments; instead, it's about the heart within and the genuine love she shares with her consort, her people, and herself. And perhaps, if we look deeper, we'll see that in every woman – queen or not – there lies the same desire to love and be loved, and to find happiness in the arms of those who truly matter."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What was the last year Boult taught at the Royal College of Music? Boult, unlike many of his contemporaries, preferred the traditional orchestral layout, with first violins on the conductor's left and the seconds on the right. Of the practice of grouping all the violins together on the left, he wrote, \\"The new seating is, I admit, easier for the conductor and the second violins, but I firmly maintain that the second violins themselves sound far better on the right. ... When the new fashion reached us from America somewhere about 1908 it was adopted by some conductors, but Richter, Weingartner, Walter, Toscanini and many others kept what I feel is the right balance.\\"This care for balance was an important feature of Boult's music-making. Orchestral players across decades commented on his insistence that every important part should be heard without difficulty. His BBC principal violist wrote in 1938, \\"If a woodwind player has to complain that he has already been blowing 'fit to burst' there is trouble for somebody.\\" The trombonist Ray Premru wrote forty years later, \\"One of the old school, like Boult, is so refreshing because he will reduce the dynamic level – 'No, no, pianissimo, strings, let the soloist through, less from everyone else.' That is the old idea of balance.\\"As an educator, Boult influenced several generations of musicians, beginning with his conducting class at the Royal College of Music, London, which he ran from 1919 to 1930. As no such classes had been held before in Britain, Boult \\"created its curriculum from out of his own experience. ... From that first small class has come all the later formal training for conductors throughout Britain.\\" In the 1930s Boult ran a series of \\"conferences for conductors\\" at his country house near Guildford, sometimes helped by Vaughan Williams who lived a few miles away. From 1962 to 1966 he again taught at the Royal College of Music. In later life, he made time for young conductors who sought his counsel.

If the realm of Outworld wins Mortal Kombat ten consecutive times, its Emperor Shao Kahn will be able to invade and conquer the Earth realm. Shaolin monk Liu Kang and his comrades, movie star Johnny Cage and military officer Sonya Blade were handpicked by Raiden, the god of thunder and defender of the Earth realm, to overcome their powerful adversaries in order to prevent Outworld from winning their tenth straight Mortal Kombat tournament.

At Shang Tsung's island, Liu is attracted to Princess Kitana, Shao Kahn's adopted daughter. Aware that Kitana is a dangerous adversary because she is the rightful heir to Outworld and that she will attempt to ally herself with the Earth warriors, Tsung orders the creature Reptile to spy on her. Liu defeats his first opponent and Sonya gets her revenge on Kano by snapping his neck. Cage encounters and barely beats Scorpion.

Completed in 1858, the line came under the control of the later Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) in 1861, when the PRR acquired a controlling interest in the Northern Central's stock to compete with the rival Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&O). For eleven decades the Northern Central operated as a subsidiary of the PRR until much of its Maryland trackage was washed out by Hurricane Agnes in 1972; after which most of its operations ceased as the Penn Central declined to repair sections. It is now a fallen flag railway, having come under the control of the later Penn Central (merger of the PRR and the New York Central), Conrail, and then broken apart and disestablished. The southern part in Pennsylvania is now the York County Heritage Rail Trail which connects to a similar hike/bike trail in Northern Maryland down to Baltimore, named the Torrey C. Brown Rail Trail. Only the trackage around Baltimore remains in rail service. - The Baltimore Light Rail is a light rail system serving Baltimore, Maryland, United States, as well as its surrounding suburbs. It is operated by the Maryland Transit Administration (MTA Maryland). In downtown Baltimore, it uses city streets. Outside the central portions of the city, the line is built on private rights-of-way, mostly from the defunct Northern Central Railway, Baltimore and Annapolis Railroad and Washington, Baltimore and Annapolis Electric Railway. The line is sometimes referred to the \\"Blue Line\\", or less commonly as the \\"Central Light Rail Line\\", even though the line carries three different routes on the same system: Hunt Valley-BWI (Blue), Hunt Valley-Cromwell (Yellow), and Penn Station-Camden Yards (Red). - The Washington, Baltimore and Annapolis Electric Railway (WB&A) was an American railroad of central Maryland and Washington, D.C., built in the 19th and 20th century. The WB&A absorbed two older railroads, the Annapolis and Elk Ridge Railroad and the Baltimore & Annapolis Short Line, and added its own electric streetcar line between Baltimore and Washington. It was built by a group of Cleveland, Ohio, electric railway entrepreneurs to serve as a high-speed, showpiece line using the most advanced technology of the time. It served Washington, Baltimore, and Annapolis, Maryland, for 27 years before the Great Depression and the rise of the automobile forced an end to passenger service in 1935. Only the Baltimore & Annapolis portion continued to operate. Today, parts of the right-of-way are used for light rail, rail trails and roads. - The Maryland Transit Administration (MTA) is a state-operated mass transit administration in Maryland, and is part of the Maryland Department of Transportation. It is better known as MTA Maryland to avoid confusion with other cities' transit agencies who share the initials MTA. The MTA operates a comprehensive transit system throughout the Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area. There are 80 bus lines serving Baltimore's public transportation needs, along with other services that include the Light Rail, Metro Subway, and MARC Train. With nearly half the population of Baltimore residents lacking access to a car, the MTA is an important part of the regional transit picture.

The state is named after Henrietta Maria of France, the wife of Charles I of England. - Light rail, light rail transit (LRT) or fast tram is urban public transport using rolling stock similar to a tramway, but operating at a higher capacity, and often on an exclusive right-of-way. - Gilroy Road is a stop on the Baltimore Light Rail . Northbound trains leave this station for Hunt Valley ; southbound trains leave for BWI Airport , and , during off - peak hours , Cromwell Station / Glen Burnie . There is currently no free public parking and no bus service at this station . The Gilroy Road stop is one of four stops along the Baltimore Light Rail line in Hunt Valley , and is the southernmost on the line within Hunt Valley . - The Baltimore & Annapolis Railroad was an American railroad of central Maryland built in the 19th century. The railroad, the second to serve Annapolis, ran between Annapolis and Clifford along the north shore of the Severn River. From Clifford, just north of the present day Patapsco Light Rail Stop, it connected with the B&O's Curtis Bay branch so that trains could travel to Baltimore. In 1921, when it was called the Annapolis and Baltimore Short Line, it was purchased by the larger Washington, Baltimore and Annapolis Electric Railway (WB&A), and then emerged from the WB&A's 1935 bankruptcy and closure as the Baltimore & Annapolis Railroad. B&A electric passenger operation between the two cities continued until 1950, at which time the rail line became solely a freight carrier, operating buses for passenger service. Freight service to Annapolis continued until June 1968 when the Severn River Trestle was declared unsafe. In the 1980s the line was completely shut down. The right-of-way now serves as part of Baltimore's light rail system and as the Baltimore & Annapolis Trail.

Does \\"Through their correspondence European scientists first learned about the Chinese science and culture.\\" contain the correct answer to \\"Who was the Needham Research Institute named after?\\"","completion":"No, the statement \\"Through their correspondence European scientists first learned about the Chinese science and culture\\" does not contain the correct answer to \\"Who was the Needham Research Institute named after?\\" The Needham Research Institute is named after the British biochemist, historian, and sinologist Joseph Needham (1900-1995). Joseph Needham made significant contributions to the study of Chinese history, science, and technology. He is best known for his work on the history of Chinese science and civilization, particularly through his monumental series \\"Science and Civilisation in China\\". Joseph Needham's interest in Chinese science and culture began during his time at Cambridge University in the 1930s when he collaborated with several Chinese colleagues. His fascination grew, and during World War II, he was sent to China as the British scientific attaché. There, he built strong relationships with Chinese scholars and collected valuable information on ancient Chinese innovations, achievements, and scientific discoveries. Needham's research led him to explore the reasons behind the decline of science in China and the reasons for the West's scientific and industrial revolution. This culminated in what is known as \\"Needham's Grand Question\\" or \\"The Needham Question\\": Why did modern science, which developed from roots in ancient Greek and Hellenistic civilizations, eventually thrive in Western Europe but stagnate in China, despite China's advanced civilization and technological achievements during various periods of its history? In 1948, Needham founded the East Asian Institute at Cambridge University, which later became the Needham Research Institute. The institute is dedicated to the research and study of Chinese and East Asian science, technology, and medicine with a focus on their historical context. In summary, while there are links between European scientists learning about Chinese science and culture through correspondence and Joseph Needham's work, the statement does not specifically mention Joseph Needham or the institute named after him."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I should have known when I looked at the box in the video store and saw Lisa Raye - to me, she's the female Ernie Hudson A.K.A. \\"Le Kiss of Death\\" for *ANY* movie. Its almost *guaranteed* the movie will be bad (e.g. Congo)if Hudson is in it (with the exception of the Ghostbusters films, which were intentionally campy and bad). Despite my instincts, and the fact that I just saw Civil Brand, yet another cinematic \\"tour de force\\" starring Lisa Raye, I rented it anyway. After all, I ignored my \\"Hudson instinct\\" on OZ and ended up watching a very quality series so I figured I'd give this movie a chance. If you are a lover of bad movies, this is a definite must see! This has got to be the most unintentionally funny movie I've seen in a loooong time. The plot is fairly straightforward: Racheal's (Monica Calhoun) sister is killed by a band of brigands (Led by Bobby Brown!) and, like many an action movie before this, she straps on her guns ONE LAST TIME and vows to avenge her sisters death. To do this, she reassembles the titular Gang of Roses (supposedly based on a true story of a female gang) and they go out and exact revenge and, along the way, there's some subplot or something or other about some gold that might be buried in the town. One nice thing I will say about this movie is that from what I could tell, the stars did their own riding and they looked GREAT galloping. The funniest (albiet unintentionally funny) scenes? Look for when they introduce Stacy Dash's character or when Calhoun's character rescinds her vow not to strap on her guns (replete with a clenched fisted cry to the heavens) or Lil' Kim's character joking with Lisa Raye's character or Stacy Dash's character being killed or Lil' Kim's character convincing Lisa Raye's character to rejoin the gang or the Asian Chick or Macy Grey's character talking bout \\"The debt is paid\\", etc. With the exception of Calhoun's Racheal and Bobby Brown's Left-Eye, I can't even remember the names of the other characters cuz I was laughing so hard when they were introduced.

Let's analyze each statement in detail to understand the difference. 1. Most of what followed seems like a nightmare still: This statement suggests that the majority of events or circumstances that occurred after a certain point in time had a nightmarish quality. It implies that these events were unpleasant, distressing, or frightening in some way, and that their effects or memories may still be haunting to the person experiencing them. The use of the word \\"most\\" indicates that not all the events were nightmarish, meaning that some potentially neutral or positive events may have taken place as well. 2. Nothing that followed was nightmarish: Contrary to the first statement, this one expresses a completely different idea. It denies any nightmarish qualities to the events or circumstances that took place after a certain point in time. By stating that \\"nothing\\" was nightmarish, it suggests that everything that happened was either neutral or positive in nature, with no negative or distressing aspects at all. This statement exudes a sense of relief or satisfaction, as it implies the absence of any frightening or troubling experiences. Given the differences in meaning between the statements, it is clear that we cannot conclude that \\"Nothing that followed was nightmarish\\" based on the statement \\"Most of what followed seems like a nightmare still.\\" Instead, we can understand that the majority of events that occurred were nightmarish, but not all of them.

Let's combine the coefficients of j, then isolate j, and finally, solve for j. 1. Combine the coefficients of j: The coefficients of j are -237, -289, and 450. We need to add these together to get the combined coefficient for j. -237 + (-289) + 450 = -526 + 450 = -76 Now, we have the equation: -76*j + 1064 = 0 2. Isolate j: The next step is to get j by itself on one side of the equation. To do this, we will move the constant, 1064, to the other side of the equation by subtracting it from both sides. -76*j + 1064 - 1064 = 0 - 1064 -76*j = -1064 3. Solve for j: To find the value of j, we need to divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of j, which is -76. -76*j / -76 = -1064 / -76 j = 14 So, the solution for the given equation is j = 14."},{"prompt":"Title: THE PREVIOUS FIVE STAR REVIEWER CAN BEND OVER AND TAKE IT LIKE A MAN Review: PLEASE IGNORE THE PREVIOUS REVIEWER WHOSE ONLY WORK IN LIFE IS TO SLAM GREAT CLASSIC ROCK BANDS AND HE THEN CRIES WOLF WHEN OTHER PEOPLE SLAM THE TRASH (JUSTIN,BRITNEY,ASHLEE,JENNIFER LOPEZ,BACKSTREET BOYS)THAT HE LISTENS TO.N STYNC ARE HISTORY AND THEIR ALBUMS HAVE BOMBED THE WORLD OVER.THE BOY BAND ERA IS OVER SO DONT BE SEEN WITH THIS AWFUL CD.REVIEW OVER.OVER AND OUT Does this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment?","completion":"This product review conveys a negative sentiment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The short review states that the movie is \\"really funny,\\" which implies that the critic enjoyed its comedic aspects and found humor in the film. This positive reaction shows that the critic had a good time watching the movie and would likely encourage others to watch it for its entertainment value. When interpreting reviews, it's essential to look for keywords and phrases that convey the overall sentiment toward the subject. In this case, the critic used words like \\"really funny\\" to express their amusement, suggesting a positive mindset. In contrast, if the reviewer had used words such as \\"boring\\" or \\"tedious,\\" these would have indicated a negative opinion. A positive outlook on a film, especially when it comes to comedy, is important because the effectiveness of humor can be subjective. What one person finds funny, another may not. Therefore, when someone openly shares their positive enjoyment of the movie, it sets a positive tone for potential viewers who share a similar sense of humor. Additionally, a positive review can boost the morale of the creators, cast, and crew and inspire them to continue producing quality work.

R.i.c.e. stands for rest, ice, compression, and elevation. This principle can be used at home to treat forearm tendinitis and should be practiced on a daily basis for the best results. Rest the your forearm. Possible answers: 1). If you walk or drive on your elbow, your forearm joint should stay elevated. If your elbow is loose and inflamed, rest it for approximately two or three weeks so any swelling goes down and you can recover. 2). Get your skin soaked in water by curling it under a shower or by stopping the water from running completely cold on your forearm. The cold water will encourage blood to flow to and from the ligaments and tendons helping them firm up. 3). Resting the forearm is crucial to safely treat wrist tendinitis. If you are injured, immobilize the affected arm with an ice pack or splint to stop swelling and degeneration. 4). Resting the muscles in the affected tendons is crucial to treating tendinitis, especially in athletes. Athletes who continue to push through tendon pain risk escalating their injury from the acute inflammation phase to chronic tendinitis, which is much harder to treat.","completion":"The paragraph would end with option 4: \\"Resting the muscles in the affected tendons is crucial to treating tendinitis, especially in athletes.

Option 1 is inconsistent with the subject; we don't 'walk or drive on our elbows'. Moreover, it doesn't address the role of resting to treat forearm tendinitis. Option 2 advocates for using cold water to relax the forearm tendons, which isn't aligned with the rest concept emphasized previously in the paragraph.

Q:I can use this background: The ionization energies of the representative elements generally decrease from top to bottom within a group. This trend is explained by the increase in size of the atoms within a group. The valence electron that is being removed is further from the nucleus in the case of a larger atom. The attractive force between the valence electron and the nucleus weakens as the distance between them increases and as the shielding effect increases, resulting in a lower ionization energy for the larger atoms within a group.

Today he is focusing on the elements that all belong to the alkali metals group. He is especially focused on learning about lithium, which is at the top of the group, and cesium, which is at the bottom of the alkali metals group. Answer this question please: In which element is the shielding effect larger? A:","completion":"In the given situation, the shielding effect is larger in cesium compared to lithium. To understand why, let's first recall what the shielding effect is: The shielding effect refers to the ability of inner electrons in an atom to shield the valence electrons from the attractive force of the positively charged protons in the nucleus. This reduces the effective positive charge experienced by the outer electrons. Now, let's look at lithium (Li) and cesium (Cs), both alkali metals: 1. Lithium (Li) has an atomic number of 3, meaning it has 3 electrons. The electron configuration is 1s² 2s¹. It has two inner electrons and one valence electron. 2. Cesium (Cs) has an atomic number of 55, meaning it has 55 electrons. The electron configuration is [Xe] 6s¹. It has 54 inner electrons and one valence electron. As you move down a group in the periodic table, the number of energy levels (shells) increases, and so does the number of inner electrons. In the case of Cs, there are more inner electrons than in Li. These inner electrons provide more shielding for the valence electron in Cs than those in Li. This increased shielding weakens the attraction between the valence electron and the nucleus in Cs, leading to a larger shielding effect in cesium compared to lithium."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Gu Kailai murder trial begins, as China's leaders hope for an end to Bo Xilai saga The much-anticipated trial opened Thursday under tight security at the intermediate court in Hefei, the capital of Anhui province. Police barricaded the street leading to the courthouse, turning back all cars and buses. And the courthouse itself was ringed by police standing every few feet, and shoulder to shoulder up the main steps. A throng of journalists and onlookers was kept outside in a driving rainstorm. Around 9 a.m., two apparent supporters of Bo were quickly hustled away by police when they began shouting slogans. Gu and a household aide, Zhang Xiaojun, have been charged with murder in the poisoning death of a British businessman, Neil Heywood, with whom Gu allegedly had a business dispute. Bo has not been charged with any crime but was removed from all his party posts in the spring for unspecified “discipline violations.” Gu’s conviction is considered a foregone conclusion in China, where the police, courts and prosecutors operate under the party’s tight control and largely according to script. But the evidence presented in court, any witnesses allowed to speak and the severity of the eventual sentence that Gu receives will all signal how the party intends to handle Bo. Bo, the charismatic son of a Mao-era revolutionary hero, is still thought to command a following in China, particularly among the “new leftists” disenchanted with the country’s growing income disparity and the loss of socialist ideals. Some analysts say that the party’s senior leaders, who are meeting now for their annual summer retreat at the Beidaihe seaside resort, remain deeply divided over what punishment Bo should face. On the one hand, observers say, some want Bo not only stripped of his party positions but also jailed on criminal charges, to preclude any chance of a comeback by a figure who had become a danger because of his populist appeal. “He may come back to politics,” said Cheng Li, a China scholar with the Brookings Institution in Washington. “It’s in everyone’s interest to punish Bo severely.” But Bo is said to still have allies, who think he should face a milder internal party discipline, equivalent to a censure, particularly if there is no evidence that he had a hand in Heywood’s slaying or knew anything about it. “It’s a question of how to settle this problem after ousting him,” said Bo Zhiyue, who is a senior researcher with the National University of Singapore and not related to Bo Xilai. “It’s not just him. He represents a trend of thought in society,” such as favoring a more equitable distribution of wealth. “A lot of senior party members agree with this idea. Bo Xilai still has a lot of political resources, like his personal relationships among the princelings and in the army. . . . He still has a lot of influence, and supporters in the party.

Vere Gordon Childe (14 April 1892 – 19 October 1957) was an Australian archaeologist who specialized in the study of European prehistory. He spent most of his life in the United Kingdom, working as an academic for the University of Edinburgh and then the Institute of Archaeology, London, and wrote twenty-six books during his career. Initially an early proponent of culture-historical archaeology, he later became the first exponent of Marxist archaeology in the Western world. Born in Sydney to a middle-class English migrant family, Childe studied classics at the University of Sydney before moving to England to study classical archaeology at the University of Oxford. There, he embraced the socialist movement and campaigned against the First World War, viewing it as a conflict waged by competing imperialists to the detriment of Europe's working class. Returning to Australia in 1917, he was prevented from working in academia because of his socialist activism, instead working for the Labor Party as the private secretary of the politician John Storey. Growing critical of Labor, he wrote an analysis of their policies and joined the far-left Industrial Workers of the World. Emigrating to London in 1921, he became librarian of the Royal Anthropological Institute and journeyed across Europe to pursue his research into the continent's prehistory, publishing his findings in academic papers and books. In doing so he introduced the continental European concept of an archaeological culture—the idea that a recurring assemblage of artefacts demarcates a distinct cultural group—to the British archaeological community.

(CNN) -- The U.S. space shuttle program retired in 2011, leaving American astronauts to hitchhike into orbit. But after three long years, NASA's successor is almost ready to make an entrance. Orion, the agency's newest manned spaceship, is being prepared for its first mission in December. In future missions, it will journey into deep space -- to Mars and beyond -- farther than humans have ever gone before. Orion comes loaded with superlatives. It boasts the largest heat shield ever built and a computer 400 times faster than the ones on the space shuttles. It will be launched into space on the most powerful rocket NASA has ever made. No astronauts will be aboard the December flight, which will test the spacecraft's systems for future manned missions. Final work on the spacecraft is under way at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Orion came one step closer to completion this month with the stacking of the crew module atop the service module. \\"Now that we're getting so close to launch, the spacecraft completion work is visible every day,\\" Orion Program Manager Mark Geyer said in a statement. A 3,600-mile journey When complete, the Orion capsule will resemble a fencing foil, with a tall spire shooting up from a rounded base. At the top will sit a launch abort system, with downward-facing thrusters that would save the crew from a jarring crash in the event of a rocket malfunction. The bottom portion, the service module, will perform various functions such as in-space propulsion and cargo storage. Nestled between the two will be the crew module, capable of supporting human life from launch until recovery. Attached to the service module will be a United Launch Alliance Delta IV Heavy rocket. For the first time since the space shuttle's debut launch in 1981, the crew compartment will ride on the tip of the rocket rather than hanging onto its side, evoking the configuration of the famous Apollo or Gemini missions. Question: \\"How much faster is Orion's computer to the space shuttle's computer?\\" Answer: \\"400 times\\" Is this answer to the question correct?","completion":"Yes, the answer to the question \\"How much faster is Orion's computer to the space shuttle's computer?\\" is correct.

A:","completion":"A: The first declaration of World War 1, also known as the Great War, can be traced back to the Austro-Hungarian Empire. The roots of the conflict, however, can be found in the complex web of alliances and tensions created as a result of various military, political, and economic factors. These factors contributed to the overall instability in Europe during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The event that triggered the formal declaration of war was the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, on June 28, 1914. This assassination took place in Sarajevo, which was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and is now the capital of modern-day Bosnia and Herzegovina. The assassin, Gavrilo Princip, was a member of the Serbian nationalist group called the Black Hand. Following the assassination, Austria-Hungary sent an ultimatum to Serbia, making several demands which, if not met, would lead to war. Serbia agreed to most of the demands but did not fully comply with the ultimatum. Consequently, the Austro-Hungarian government deemed this response unsatisfactory, and on July 28, 1914, Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia. This declaration marks the beginning of the devastating four-year global conflict known as World War 1. As a direct result of the assassination and the subsequent declaration of war, the intricate network of alliances that existed between the European powers began to activate. These alliances included the Triple Entente (consisting of Russia, France, and the United Kingdom) and the Triple Alliance (including Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Italy). The Triple Entente pledged their support to Serbia, while the Triple Alliance stood by Austria-Hungary. Ultimately, this led to the spiraling of the conflict into a full-blown world war. Other countries and empires, such as the Ottoman Empire and Japan, joined the conflict later on, serving only to further exacerbate the bloodshed and destruction. In summary, the first declaration of war within the context of World War 1 was made by the Austro-Hungarian Empire against Serbia on July 28, 1914. This declaration was in response to the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand and Serbia's perceived failure to comply with the Austro-Hungarian ultimatum. The declaration of war set in motion a chain of events that ultimately embroiled much of the world in a costly and devastating conflict."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Seth Shostak and Alexandra Barnett are astronomers. They believe intelligent life exists somewhere in the universe. They also think we will soon contact these beings. Why do Shostak and Barnett think intelligent life exists on other planets? The first reason is time. Scientists believe the universe is about 12 billion years old. \\"This is long enough for other planets to have intelligent life,\\" say Shostak and Barnet. The second reason is size--the universe is huge. \\"Tools like the Hubble telescope have shown that there are at least 100 billion galaxies,\\" says Shostak. \\"And our galaxy, the Milk Way, has at least 100 billion stars. Some planets going around these stars might be similar to Earth.\\" In the past, it was hard to look for signs of intelligent life in the universe. But now, powerful telescopes allow scientists to discover smaller planets--the size of Mars or Earth in other solar systems. These planets might have intelligent life. Have beings from space already visited Earth? \\"Probably not,\\" says Shostak. \\"It's a long way away. However, intelligent beings may contact us in other way, such as radio signs.

Q:Information: - George Roger Waters (born 6 September 1943) is an English singer, songwriter, bassist, and composer. In 1965, he co-founded the progressive rock band Pink Floyd with drummer Nick Mason, keyboardist Rick Wright and guitarist, singer, and songwriter Syd Barrett. Waters initially served as the group's bassist, but following the departure of Barrett in 1968, he also became their lyricist, conceptual leader and co-lead vocalist. - A comprehensive world view or worldview is the fundamental cognitive orientation of an individual or society encompassing the entirety of the individual or society's knowledge and point of view. A world view can include natural philosophy; fundamental, existential, and normative postulates; or themes, values, emotions, and ethics. The term is a calque of the German word Weltanschauung , composed of \\"Welt\\" ('world') and \\"Anschauung\\" ('view' or 'outlook'). The German word is also used in English. - A rock opera is a collection of rock music songs with lyrics that relate to a common story. Rock operas typically are released as concept albums and are not scripted for acting, which distinguishes them from operas, although several have been adapted as rock musicals. The use of various character roles within the song lyrics is a common storytelling device. The success of the rock opera genre has inspired similar works in other musical styles, such as rap opera. - The Jeff Beck Group was an English rock band formed in London in January 1967 by former The Yardbirds guitarist Jeff Beck. Their innovative approach to heavy-sounding blues and rhythm and blues was a major influence on popular music. - Eric Patrick Clapton, (born 1945), is an English rock and blues guitarist, singer, and songwriter. He is the only three-time inductee to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame: once as a solo artist and separately as a member of the Yardbirds and Cream. Clapton has been referred to as one of the most important and influential guitarists of all time. Clapton ranked second in \\"Rolling Stone\\" magazine's list of the \\"100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time\\" and fourth in Gibson's \\"Top 50 Guitarists of All Time\\". He was also named number five in \\"Time\\" magazine's list of \\"The 10 Best Electric Guitar Players\\" in 2009. - Progressive rock (shortened as \\"prog\\"; sometimes \\"art rock\\", \\"classical rock\\" or \\"symphonic rock\\") is a broad subgenre of rock music that developed in the United Kingdom and United States throughout the mid to late 1960s. Initially termed \\"progressive pop\\", the style was an outgrowth of psychedelic bands who abandoned standard pop traditions in favour of instrumentation and compositional techniques more frequently associated with jazz, folk or classical music.

A debt-collection company in Buffalo used lies and trickery to fraudulently collect more than 31 million from thousands of people across the country, the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Manhattan said Tuesday in announcing guilty pleas by four participants and charges against 11 others. U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said in a statement that the millions of dollars involved could make it the largest fraudulent debt-collection scheme ever prosecuted. The collectors, he said, took “ruthless advantage of the desperate situation in which the victims found themselves” by threatening them with arrest and coercing some into paying more than they owed. Court papers describe orchestrated lies. Victims were told, for example, that they had committed a felony by failing to pay debts, that their driver’s licenses would be suspended and they would be referred to an “attorney network.” One collector told the mother of a debtor undergoing dialysis that he was a “legal investigator’’ with a law firm, not a collection agency, and that he was calling about check fraud, according to court papers. In a third example, a collector told victims that they had committed fraud and that he was “in contact with the magistrate. …” “They are en route right now,” he reportedly continued. “Within 46 minutes, they will be there to serve you.” Prosecutors say that company owners Travell Thomas, 37, of Orchard Park, and Maurice Sessum, 39, of Buffalo, instructed employees to “juice” balances to trick people into thinking they owed greater sums than they might have believed. The prosecutors said Thomas spent some of his resulting fortune to gamble and pay for sports tickets, his wedding reception, jewelry and cosmetic surgery for his wife. While court papers and prosecutors do not name the debt-collection company, Thomas and Sessum were named as the principals of an assortment of debt-collection companies that the Federal Trade Commission and State Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman sought to shut down in February because of allegedly abusive practices. In that case, Thomas and Sessum are named as principal managers and officers of 4 Star Resolution LLC, Profile Management Inc. and International Recovery Service LLC, among others. Attorney Michael A. Benson, of Springville, represents Thomas and is one of the lawyers representing 4 Star. He said he does not yet know whether he also will represent Thomas on the criminal charges. But he said Thomas was en route to Benson’s office Tuesday morning and would have surrendered to the authorities had they not arrested him at his home. Thomas and the other defendants all pleaded not guilty in U.S. District Court in Buffalo. Benson said the FTC and now the U.S. Attorney’s Office set the fraudulently obtained figure at 31 million, but they ignore the fact that legitimate debts were being collected and that the company’s principals had payroll and other business expenses to pay from the proceeds, which were collected over seven or eight years. “They make it look in the indictment that they unsealed today that these gentlemen took the money and ran,” Benson said. “That is completely not true.” He went on to say that it will be difficult and expensive for the defendants to face charges in New York City and that he expected their lawyers to attempt to move the case to Buffalo. Asked why the criminal matter was begun in New York City and not Buffalo, a spokeswoman for Bharara said the FTC referred the case to the U.S. Attorney’s office for the Southern District. The charges are wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud. The prosecutors announced that four company employees have pleaded guilty to the conspiracy charge, a crime punishable by up to 20 years in prison. The four are: Mark Lavin, 45, of Buffalo; John Salatino, 34, of Amherst; Jessica Mann, 30, of Dunkirk; and Jennifer Sherk, 27, of Buffalo. Others facing the charges are: Anthony Brzezowski, 49, of Buffalo, the company’s director of operations; company managers Jimmy Stokes, 38, of Buffalo; Heather Gasta, 41, of Buffalo; and Tacoby Thomas, 37, of Orchard Park; and debt collectors Anthony Caba, 25, of Buffalo; Columbus Simmons, 46, of Buffalo; Charles Starks, 32, of Buffalo; William Clark, 30, of Buffalo; and Michael Calandra, 31, of Angola. email: citydesk@buffnews.com ||||| Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

Some of the money was used to pay for the company co-owner's gambling expenses and wedding reception, as well as cosmetic surgery for his wife, according to court papers. The company based in Buffalo, New York, had an \\"elite team\\" that used \\"particularly aggressive and egregious tactics in attempting to trick consumers into paying debts,\\" the indictment charged. The collectors claimed to be tied to government offices — even prosecutors — and told their targets that they would face arrest warrants, driver's license suspensions and civil suits if they didn't fork over what they owed and more, Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara charged.

While the information provided suggests that Downtown LA's Children's Museum is closed pending the construction of two new sites, it does not provide a comprehensive explanation for the closure. There could be several reasons why the original Children's Museum in Downtown LA is closed, and the opening of new facilities might just be one part of the story. The closure could be due to financial constraints, maintenance issues, or a strategic decision by the city to revamp its approach to children's educational and cultural resources. The opening of two new sites, one in the San Fernando Valley and one in Little Tokyo, could indicate that the City of Los Angeles has recognized the need for additional venues for children's learning and engagement. The new facilities may be better equipped to address changing demographics, harness new technologies, and provide improved accessibility to diverse communities across the region. The intent could be to upgrade the city's offerings for children by creating enhanced, modern, and dynamic spaces to foster learning and creativity. There is no doubt that the opening of these new facilities will provide better resources for the city's younger generation. However, without additional details and context regarding the closure of the Downtown LA Children's Museum, concluding that it is solely due to the opening of new facilities would be an incomplete analysis.

Los Angeles (CNN) -- A man convicted of stalking singer Madonna, and who once threatened to knife her, was arrested Friday, a week after he escaped from a Southern California mental hospital, police said. Robert Dewey Hoskins, 54, had walked away from Metropolitan State Hospital in the Los Angeles suburb of Norwalk on February 3, police said. He had served a 10-year prison sentence for stalking the \\"Material Girl,\\" police said, and a court order requires him to be in a facility receiving mental health treatment until the end of August 2012. Los Angeles Police Sgt. Mitzi Fierro told HLN's Nancy Grace that she hadn't been told whether any new charges will be filed against Hoskins. Prior to his arrest Friday, OPTIONS: - CNN police issued a warning to the public saying Hoskins \\"is highly psychotic when not taking his medication and has very violent tendencies.\\" - HLN police issued a warning to the public saying Hoskins \\"is highly psychotic when not taking his medication and has very violent tendencies.\\" - Hoskins police issued a warning to the public saying Hoskins \\"is highly psychotic when not taking his medication and has very violent tendencies.\\" - Los Angeles police issued a warning to the public saying Hoskins \\"is highly psychotic when not taking his medication and has very violent tendencies.\\" - Los Angeles Police police issued a warning to the public saying Hoskins \\"is highly psychotic when not taking his medication and has very violent tendencies.\\" - Madonna police issued a warning to the public saying Hoskins \\"is highly psychotic when not taking his medication and has very violent tendencies.\\" - Material Girl police issued a warning to the public saying Hoskins \\"is highly psychotic when not taking his medication and has very violent tendencies.\\" - Metropolitan State Hospital police issued a warning to the public saying Hoskins \\"is highly psychotic when not taking his medication and has very violent tendencies.\\" - Mitzi Fierro police issued a warning to the public saying Hoskins \\"is highly psychotic when not taking his medication and has very violent tendencies.\\" - Nancy Grace police issued a warning to the public saying Hoskins \\"is highly psychotic when not taking his medication and has very violent tendencies.\\" - Norwalk police issued a warning to the public saying Hoskins \\"is highly psychotic when not taking his medication and has very violent tendencies.\\" - Robert Dewey Hoskins police issued a warning to the public saying Hoskins \\"is highly psychotic when not taking his medication and has very violent tendencies.\\" - Southern California police issued a warning to the public saying Hoskins \\"is highly psychotic when not taking his medication and has very violent tendencies.\\"","completion":"Remember this a story about a man named Robert Dewey Hoskins, who did some very bad things like bothering and scaring a famous singer, named Madonna. After he caused a lot of trouble, he was put in a special care place called a mental hospital where people could take care of him and make sure he didn't do anything naughty. But one day, he managed to leave this care place without anyone's permission, which is a very big no-no. So, the police got involved to help find him and make sure he go back to his care place. Now you're asking, how should the story continue? Let's see. This man, Hoskins, may get very angry and do hurtful things when he's not taking his special medicine. So, the best choice here would be: - Los Angeles police issued a warning to the public saying Hoskins \\"is highly psychotic when not taking his medication and has very violent tendencies.\\" Los Angeles is the city where all these things are happening, and it's the place where the police are working hard to make sure everyone stays safe from Hoskins.

Greg Tenorly and Cynthia Blockerman had been through quite an ordeal together--being hunted by police for the murder of her abusive husband while they ran from the real killer. But all that was behind them now. All charges against them had been dropped, and Cynthia's husband had been buried. And the rumors would have died down eventually if they had gone their separate ways. They could feel the stares as they walked to their table. Greg had requested the most private booth, way in the back. Coreyville Pasta House was the oldest Italian restaurant in town. And still the best. Mama Castilla had run the place for over thirty years. She had taken over for her grandfather in 1973. A sign on the wall said so. Cynthia ordered the Fettuccini Alfredo. Greg went with his favorite, the Chicken Parmesan. Both ordered iced tea and salad. The bread and olive oil with roasted garlic and pepper came with every meal. Greg could not resist great bread. And this was the best. He tore off a chunk as soon as the waitress delivered it. Cynthia would wait for the salad. \\"So we're finally on a real date,\\" said Greg. \\"Yeah. So how does it feel?\\" \\"Kinda weird and scary and...wonderful.\\" Cynthia smiled and Greg momentarily forgot all about the amazing aroma in the restaurant. All he wanted to do was kiss her.

Please answer the following question: Given the following context: The house has been restored and preserved as it looked in the 1920-30s; at the time of the Trust's purchase, Churchill committed to leave it, \\"garnished and furnished so as to be of interest to the public\\". Rooms are decorated with memorabilia and gifts, the original furniture and books, as well as honours and medals that Churchill received. Lady Churchill's long-time secretary, Grace Hamblin, was appointed the first administrator of the house. Earlier in her career, Miss Hamblin had undertaken the destruction of the portrait of Churchill painted by Graham Sutherland. The picture, a gift from both Houses of Parliament on Churchill's 80th birthday in 1954, was loathed by both Churchill and Lady Churchill and had been stored in the cellars at Chartwell before being burnt in secret.The opening of the house required the construction of facilities for visitors and a restaurant was designed by Philip Jebb, and built to the north of the house, along with a shop and ticket office. Alterations have also been made to the gardens, for ease of access and of maintenance. In 1987, the Great Storm caused considerable damage, with some twenty-three trees being blown down in the gardens. Greater loss occurred in the woodlands surrounding the house, which lost over 70% of its trees.Chartwell has become among the National Trust's most popular properties; in 2016 some 232,000 visitors came to the house. In that year, the fiftieth anniversary of the house's opening, the Trust launched the Churchill's Chartwell Appeal, to raise £7.1M for the purchase of hundreds of personal items held at Chartwell on loan from the Churchill family. The items available to the Trust include Churchill's Nobel Prize in Literature awarded to him in 1953. The citation for the award reads, \\"for his mastery of historical and biographical description as well as for brilliant oratory in defending exalted human values\\". The medal is displayed in the museum room on the first floor of Chartwell, at the opposite end of the house to the study, the room where, in... answer the following question: What is the full name of the person earlier in whose career had undertaken the destruction of the portrait of Churchill?

Article: Our voice gives away a lot of information about ourselves. It can tell us our gender and age. And now, scientists say that it can also tell us our height. Scientists at Washington University, Indiana University and University of California found that listeners could accurately tell the height of speakers, just by their voices. And the key to this mystery is a sound known as the subglottal resonance . It _ with height and helps us build a mental picture of a person. \\"The best way to think about subglottal resonances is to imagine blowing into a glass bottle with water. The less water in the bottle, the lower sound,\\" said John Morton, a scientist at Washington University. And it's the same for humans. The frequency of the subglottal resonance depends on the height. The taller we are, the deeper the resonance frequency is. In order to find out whether people could identify the resonance, scientists did experiments. A number of same-sex pairs of different heights were told to read the same sentence aloud. It was played back to listeners who had to choose which one of the pairs was taller. Then, other listeners had to rank the speakers from the shortest to the tallest. The listeners were able to identify the tall people 62.17% of time, much higher than a lucky guess. Why not try the experiment yourself? Find out if your tall friends have deeper voices.

It was one of those nights where the soft hum of the air conditioner and the faint glow of the streetlight outside their bedroom window simply couldn't soothe her to sleep. Gary, looking so peaceful, snuggled up in their cozy, comfortable bed, had a snoring problem that had lately been reaching unprecedented volumes. Despite a deep love that Jennifer had for her husband, she found herself unable to fall asleep, her eyes wide open as she stared at the ceiling, listening to the ceaseless chorus of Gary's snoring. It seemed as if she had tried everything to help him with this situation – from nasal strips to white noise machines – but nothing had made a lasting impact. It was on nights like these that she felt like her only choice was to seek solace on the couch. As Jennifer gently rolled out of their bed, grasping carefully for her pillow and an extra blanket in the dark, she tiptoed out of the bedroom in an effort not to disturb Gary's peaceful slumber. The wooden floors felt cool under her bare feet, and she could hear the rhythmic ticking of the large wall clock down the hall, a reminder that the night hours were slowly ticking away. Arriving in the living room, Jennifer was confronted with the cold, uninviting couch. The living room's dim lighting cast eerie shadows over the various knick-knacks they had collected together over the years, giving the room an almost haunted appearance. Suppressing a brief shiver, Jennifer shrugged off any fear and began to rearrange the cushions and throw blankets, turning the couch into a temporary haven for the night. Although not nearly as comfortable as their bed, the couch was a quiet respite in comparison, and Jennifer could feel herself gradually starting to unwind. As the minutes turned into hours, she found her thoughts wandering – from happy memories of their honeymoon in Greece to concerns about her upcoming project at work. Slowly, the soothing sound of silence began to lull her into a much-needed sleep, her weariness gradually overtaking any lingering discomfort from her unconventional choice of resting place. Meanwhile, in their bedroom, Gary's peaceful face suddenly creased into a slight frown, his subconscious mind aware that something was missing. The comforting warmth and familiar scent of his wife was gone, and though his conscious mind could not quite grasp it, he felt an undeniable void on the otherwise crowded bed. As dawn began to creep through the cracks in the curtains, washing the living room with a soft, almost ethereal light, Jennifer awoke with a start. The stiffness in her back and neck told her that while her night on the couch had been a temporary solution, it was not one that could become a habit. As Gary roused himself from sleep, rubbing the sleep from his eyes and instinctively reaching for his wife, he found her side of the bed cold and empty. Realizing the cause of her absence, a quiet determination settled in his heart. Together they decided to seek help – from sleep specialists, to couples therapy, to exploring alternative remedies – to regain not only a good night's rest but also the emotional closeness that comes with sharing a peaceful slumber. With a renewed commitment to overcoming their nighttime hurdle, Gary and Jennifer embarked on a journey to rebuild their shared sanctuary, rediscovering the support and love they had for one another beneath the once deafening sound of Gary's snoring."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The context states that Rory McIlroy shot a bogey-free 66 (-6) final round, securing his second major title. The difference between his score and the runner-up, David Lynn, was eight strokes. This information supports the hypothesis that Rory McIlroy was victorious in this particular tournament by a significant margin of eight strokes. Furthermore, we can expand on this hypothesis by discussing some additional context. The 2012 PGA Championship was held at the Ocean Course of the Kiawah Island Golf Resort, a challenging and picturesque course situated in Kiawah Island, South Carolina, southwest of Charleston. The competition took place over four days, from August 9th to 12th. Rory McIlroy, a professional golfer from Northern Ireland, had already established himself as a formidable competitor within the golfing world by this time. This win at the 2012 PGA Championship marked his second major title, further solidifying his status as an elite golfer. His outstanding performance in the final round, which consisted of a bogey-free 66 (-6) score, demonstrates his skill, focus, and determination during this high-stakes event. Meanwhile, David Lynn, the runner-up in this tournament, also displayed impressive abilities on the golf course, finishing with a commendable result of eight strokes behind McIlroy. Though he did not secure the top spot, Lynn's performance in the 2012 PGA Championship demonstrates his potential and capabilities as a golfer.

Say your name, and if it’s an unusual name you might add spelling or a rhyme that the person can use to help remember your name. If appropriate, add a detail about the reason you’re at the party. For example, “I’m Pam’s daughter,” if the people at the party are friends of your mother, or “I’m an anthropology major,” if this is a college department party. You can follow up by asking the other person to say his own name, but most of the time people respond by introducing themselves without being asked. People always like to hear nice things said about themselves. To have a great conversation with someone you’ve just met, say something nice about something the person is wearing. At most parties, other guests will have taken care with their appearance and will appreciate the attention. You can also use a compliment to start a conversation by pairing it with a question. For example, you might say, “That’s a really cool scarf. Where did you get it?” Avoid compliments about the person’s appearance, as this might make her uncomfortable. If you don’t know anyone at the party, it’s okay to say so. This is easily done as you introduce yourself. For example, “Hi, I’m Mike. I hope you don’t mind, but I don’t know anyone here and you seemed nice.” If the person is an extrovert, they may be happy to chat with you and introduce you to others in the group. Chances are, others may be in a similar situation. If you’re both newcomers to the group, you can laugh and talk about the challenges of being in this situation. There are certain topics that are likely to be met with awkward silence. If you don’t already know the political orientation of the party-goers, for example, never bring up the topic of politics or you might find yourself unintentionally offending others. Don’t bring up overly personal details, whether of money, sex, illness or intimacy. Save these topics for people you know well. Making judgmental comments isn’t likely to be appreciated. For example, “You’d think she would know better than to wear that color with her complexion,” may not be appreciated. Never ask a woman if she’s pregnant. If she’s gained weight, she may feel embarrassed. Make brief eye contact with other people. A slight smile will help others know that you’re open to conversation. When someone speaks to you, look at them attentively at least 70% of the time. Angle the front of your body towards the person who’s talking, which will help the person know you’re listening. You don’t want to maintain eye contact for too long, as this might seem aggressive or overly flirtatious. Instead, limit the eye contact for 4-5 seconds, before looking away, then looking again. If you don’t know anyone at the party, no one will have heard you tell your favorite funny anecdotes. Think about sharing a funny thing that happened to you. This will make you seem more relatable and friendly. Be careful not to tell a story that may offend others. After all, humor is sometimes different across different groups of people. If you have a good story, it can fill in a conversational lull. Or you can connect your story to someone else’s statement, saying, “That reminds me of something that happened to me one time…” Making small talk is a way of sharing general information with another person as a means to learn what you might have in common. For example, asking about favorite movies is often a good way to find mutual interests. Something as simple as asking about the recent blockbuster can lead into multiple conversational paths. Making small talk might lead to deeper conversations, or it might not. Small talk is often less about the information shared than the good feelings that it provides. You’ll want to stick to non-intimate, non-controversial topics to keep your conversation on a light note. One of the things you’ll have in common with everyone else at the party is that you’re both there. Perhaps you all had to battle traffic to get to the party. Use this as a means to get to know other people, whether through questions, comments, or observations. Be unfailingly complimentary in your comments. This would be the wrong time to complain about the lack of your favorite drink, or how you’ve always hated evening gatherings. You could ask other people how they know the hostess, or if this is their first time among the group also. When you're nervous about not knowing anyone at a party, it might be difficult to concentrate on the conversations that come up. It will help your focus to repeat parts of what another person has said to assure them you've heard what was said. Use nonverbal cues, such as nodding, eye contact, and leaning towards the person, to let the other guest know that you're actively listening to what she has to say. Try to avoid talking over the other person while she’s talking, even if she’s talking about a topic you’re interested in. Ask plenty of open-ended questions about topics the other guest has brought up in order to keep the conversation going. Be sensitive to the emotions that the conversation is bringing up in the person. Generally, party conversations tend to be fun and light. If you find your conversation getting too intense or emotional, it's okay to back off a little. Look for subtle signals in body language to help you gauge whether you should change the topic or find someone new to talk with. Be observant--these are signs you should be able to notice in almost everyone you meet. For example, if someone is making eye contact with you and nodding, they're interested in the conversation. Keep talking to them and doing what you're doing! If they're facing partially away from you or glancing around the room, they're not very engaged. Change the topic back to them with a question or find another person you haven't yet introduced yourself to. gracefully. Conversations at parties start and end rapidly, and if you’re talking with someone you’ve just met, it’s a good idea not to keep the conversation going on too long. Have an excuse prepared for needing to leave. This is a time when it’s okay not to tell the truth. You can always say, “I have to get up early tomorrow,” or even just, “Please, excuse me. I need to find the ladies’.” You can say, “It was nice to meet you,” or “Great talking to you!” Some people like to shake hands, but at some parties this might be too formal. If you like, you can include an excuse for breaking off the conversation. For example, you can say, “I don’t want to dominate your evening,” or “I should probably let you talk to other people here.”","completion":"This article gives tips for making a good impression at parties, including introducing yourself, giving compliments, avoiding controversial topics, making small talk, being observant of body language, and knowing when to end a conversation gracefully."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Thinking positive thoughts can increase your motivation and energy levels. Negative thoughts, on the other hand, can lead to behaviors such as emotional eating and skipping a workout. Avoid negativity. Try to not get angry at yourself if you slip up and reach for pizza instead of a healthier option. Instead, get back on track the next day. Some days it can be hard to feel comfortable in your own skin. It doesn't help when you're surrounded by images in the media of exceedingly thin celebrities; however, a positive body image is very important to your overall health and wellness. It will increase your confidence and make you more likely to make healthy choices. Focus on the good things. If you really like your arms, tell yourself that when you look in the mirror. Make it a habit to compliment yourself at least once a day. Tape a positive affirmation or quote to the mirror. Seeing encouragement each day will help you gain a more positive body image over time. . Stop beating yourself up. Research shows that if you are kinder to yourself you will be more successful in your fitness goals. When you have a negative thought, try to acknowledge it and then let it go. There's really no point in berating yourself for skipping the gym. It's much more effective to forgive yourself and move on. Tell someone (or everyone) that you're dieting. Making a public declaration can increase your chances of success by holding you accountable to others. It can also engender the support you need from family members and friends who can cheer you on to your goal. Join a support group. This could be formal group such as Weight Watchers or simply a group you organize yourself. Post an ad on Craigslist looking for weight-loss partners or organize or join a Meetup group dedicated to healthier eating. Post inspirational sayings on your fridge. Having mood-boosting words-of-wisdom close at hand can help you handle a difficult diet day. Do things that make you feel good. Get a pedicure, have your hair done, buy a new perfume. Little things that make you feel special and pampered can offset the feeling of deprivation that can sometimes creep in when you're dieting.

Even if you’re working on winning back her trust, you don’t have to completely give in to her every single time, or she’ll think you don’t have a backbone. Instead, work on having productive conversations that weigh the pros and cons of a decision, and on finding a way that can make both of you happy. She’ll see that she can trust you if it looks like you really take her thoughts and feelings into account instead of just always wanting to get your way. Sometimes, you should just give in and let her see the movie she wants to see or go to the restaurant she’s been craving; this is okay as long as sometimes, she gives in to you as well. You may think that, if you want the girl to trust you, that you have to be Mr. Perfect all the time, and that you can’t possibly ever disappoint her. While you should be loyal and reliable, you shouldn’t put too much pressure on yourself to be absolutely perfect. Make an effort to be the best person you can be, and she’ll feel like she can really trust you because of it. That said, this is no excuse for cheating. Cheating is never acceptable. If you show up late to a date, just apologize and show her how sorry you are. As long as you don’t make a habit of it, she’ll appreciate the fact that you’re willing to admit you made a mistake. You should also be okay with saying, “I don’t know”. You don’t always have to act like you know exactly what to do if you want her to trust you. In fact, she may be even more eager to trust you if she knows you’re honest about your feelings. Another thing you can do to make her trust you is to be open about your feelings. Let her see that you want to confide in her, to be frank with her, and that you’re willing to tear down those walls for her. While you don’t have to reveal every single secret you have to her, you should work on being open and honest when you’re talking to her, whether you’re telling her what you did this past weekend or you’re talking about your concerns about your college major. If you’re open on a regular basis, she’ll see that she’s able to trust you in the long term. If something is troubling you, you should be comfortable enough to open up to her about it, even if it’s a little bit embarrassing or you worry it’ll make her think less of you. If you never tell her about your problems, then she’ll feel like she should never open up to you, either. If you’re having a bad day, you can be honest with her about it, explaining what’s going on. You don’t want her to think you have to hide everything from her. If you hide things from her, then she’ll hide things from you, too. To maintain a meaningful relationship with a girl who trusts you, you have to be open and willing to communicate with her. You can’t brush her off every time she wants to have a talk, and you have to make her feel comfortable with bringing up issues to you. When she talks to you, make sure you’re open to having a conversation and that you really stop and listen. If you have something to say to her, don’t put it off or be passive aggressive instead of hashing it out. Communication is key in any healthy relationship. If you want the girl to trust you in the long run, then you have to make her feel like you’re open to talking about your relationship and sharing your feelings with her. If she feels scared about sharing her feelings with you because she thinks you’ll be angry or dismissive, then she won’t be able to really trust you. If you want to make your relationship with the girl work and really want her to trust you, then you have to be able to make time for her and to show her that she’s a priority. If you spend too much time with your buddies or don’t answer your phone for hours, then she’s likely to not trust you because she won’t know what you’re doing when you’re not around. Make an effort to be there for her, to have a regular hangout routine, and to let her know what you’re doing when you’re not together. Putting in a time commitment is essential to making her trust you. If you know you won’t have your phone on for a few hours, because you’ll be in a long meeting or watching a movie, you can text her before to say hi and let her know what’s up. Of course, you don’t have to be accountable for every minute of your life and that can get exhausting, but letting her generally know how you spend your time can really help her trust you. Making time for her shows that she’s central to your life. This is crucial for making her trust and believe in you.","completion":"This article emphasizes the importance of building trust in a meaningful relationship with a girl through open communication, showing care and affection, valuing her thoughts and feelings, being open about one's own emotions, admitting mistakes, being reliable without aiming for perfection, spending time together, and making her a priority in one's life."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Plot title: Les Diaboliques Movie plot: The story takes place in a second-rate boarding school run by the tyrannical and mean Michel Delassalle (Meurisse). The school, though, is owned by Delassalle's teacher wife, the frail Christina (Clouzot), and Delassalle flaunts his relationship with Nicole Horner (Signoret), a teacher at the school. Rather than antagonism, the two women are shown to have a somewhat close relationship, primarily based on their apparent mutual hatred of Michel, who is physically and emotionally abusive to both.Unable to stand his mistreatment any longer, Nicole devises a plan. Though hesitant at first, Christina ultimately consents to help Nicole. Using a threatened divorce to lure Michel to Nicole's apartment building in a remote village several hundred kilometers away, Christina sedates him. The two women then drown him in a bathtub and dump his body in the school's neglected swimming pool. When his corpse floats to the surface, they think it will appear to have been an accident. Almost everything goes according to their plans until the body fails to surface, and Michel's corpse is nowhere to be found when the pool is drained.Nicole sees in the paper that the police found the corpse. Christina goes to the morgue and learns it is not Michel's body. There she meets Alfred Fichet (Vanel), a retired private detective. He gets involved in the case, much to Nicole's chagrin.When Christina and Alfred come back, a boy is punished for breaking a window; the boy says Michel punished him. After hearing this Christina becomes very sick. She is unable to be photographed for the school photo; however, it seems that Michel is in it, in the back next to a window. Nicole becomes worried and leaves the school. Christina, overcome by fear, tells Alfred everything. He does not believe her, but he investigates the pool. Christina hears some noises and wanders the school. She concludes that someone is in the school and she runs back to her room. She finds Michel's corpse in the bathtub.

Here is a news article: The United Nations observer mission in Syria will expire this weekend and will not be extended, France's Ambassador to the UN, Gerard Araud, told reporters Thursday. The news comes as the Syrian government pounded the country's largest city Thursday, using aerial forces to shell neighborhoods and intensifying the siege that has become a focal point of the country's civil war. CNN inside Syria: Nobody imagined it would turn into this Meanwhile, in neighboring Lebanon, another person was kidnapped in an incident believed to be linked to the violence in Syria. At least 158 new deaths were reported across Syria on Thursday, according to the opposition Local Coordination Committees in Syria. The deaths include 50 in Aleppo. They also include 60 unidentified bodies found in Qatana, a Damascas suburb, the LCC said. The bodies, found in a landfill, \\"seem to have been executed in a massacre by the regime's army,\\" the group said. At least eight people were killed and more than 50 wounded when shells struck near an Aleppo bakery where people had lined up to buy bread, said Ahmad al-Zaeem, a commander in the rebel Free Syrian Army. At least 150 people have been wounded in the latest violence in Aleppo, he said. ||||| The Security Council will let the U.N. military observer mission's mandate in Syria expire Sunday and will back a new civilian office there to support U.N. and Arab League efforts to end the country's 18-month conflict. France's U.N. Ambassador Gerard Araud, the current Security Council president, said Thursday that members agreed to U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon's proposal for a liaison office. Araud said the council agreed that conditions set for possibly extending the mission of the unarmed observers past Sunday were not met. He says there was no halt to the Syrian government's use of heavy weapons and no significant reduction in violence. Russia invited U.N. ambassadors from key world powers that met in Geneva in June and agreed on guidelines for a political transition in Syria to meet in New York on Friday and call on all sides to end the violence. \\"More than 18,000 people have been killed during the last 18 months,\\" Ban told reporters in East Timor on Wednesday. \\"The Syrian people have suffered too much too long.\\" In a letter to the council last Friday, Ban said, \\"it is imperative for the United Nations to have a presence in Syria\\" aside from its humanitarian operation in order to support U.N. and Arab League efforts \\"in mediating and facilitating a peaceful resolution to the crisis.\\" The Security Council initially authorized the 300-strong observer mission to deploy to Syria for 90 days to monitor implementation of a six-point peace plan brokered by U.N.-Arab League envoy Kofi Annan. The plan was to start with a cease-fire and withdrawal of the government's heavy weapons and culminate with Syrian-led political talks. Assad's government and opposition forces agreed to the plan, but it was never implemented. Because of the worsening bloodshed and insecurity, the observers have been mainly confined to their hotels since June 15, and their numbers have been cut by about two-thirds. The U.N. said Wednesday that 110 observers remain in Syria, mainly in Damascus. A bomb exploded Wednesday outside their hotel, wounding three people, but no observers were hurt. Frustrated at the escalating conflict and the failure of world powers on the Security Council to unite to stop the chaos, Annan announced last month that he was resigning effective Aug. 31. Russia and China have vetoed three Western-backed Security Council resolutions that would have stepped up pressure especially against the Syrian government by threatening sanctions if the fighting didn't stop. ||||| A powerful Shiite Muslim clan in Lebanon on Thursday claimed to have abducted more Syrian nationals and vowed further kidnappings in retaliation for the seizure of a family member by rebels in Syria this week, as Syria's civil war threatened to break open violent rivalries in its neighbor Lebanon.

Masked Lebanese believed to be from... (Associated Press) The wave of kidnappings raises the dire scenario that the battle for control over Syria will ignite tensions in Lebanon, a country with its own history of civil war, an explosive sectarian mix and deep divisions between pro- and anti-Syrian factions _ many of them armed. Already, the abductions have brought gunmen from both the Shiite and Sunni communities into the streets. On Wednesday, Shiite supporters of the al-Mikdad clan went on a rampage in a Beirut neighborhood, vandalizing dozens of Syrian-run stores, and then blocked the road to the airport, setting tires on fire and wandering the road with guns. Travelers were forced to walk from their cars to the airport, and at least one flight was cancelled. The road was only reopened early Thursday morning. The tensions emerged Thursday in the eastern Bekaa Valley, near the Syrian border. Masked men believed to be from the Bekaa town of Majdal Anjar _ a Sunni stronghold _ burned tires and set up roadblocks on the main highway leading to the Masnaa border crossing between Lebanon and Syria. They stopped cars going either way and checked passengers' IDs before deciding whether to let them pass, apparently looking for Shiites or Mikdad supporters. In the nearby town of Chtoura, four gunmen abducted Syrian businessman Hossam Khasroum, pulling him from his car as he was driving and taking him to an unknown location, security officials said. Khasroum, the offficials said, is known to be a support of Assad's regime. In a separate incident, gunmen attacked a car driven by pro-Syrian Lebanese politician, Joseph Abu-Fadel, breaking his car windows with stones as he was driving to Syria. He and three others were lightly injured. On Wednesday, armed members of the al-Mikdad clan said they had kidnapped more than 20 Syrian nationals and a Turk in Lebanon in retaliation for the abduction of their relative, Hassane Salim al-Mikdad, who was captured in Syria this week. Rebels who kidnapped al-Mikdad claimed he was a member of the Shiite militant group Hezbollah, a staunch supporter of President Bashar Assad's regime. Hezbollah and his family deny this. Maher al-Mikdad, a family spokesman, warned on Thursday that \\"if anything happens to Hassane, we will kill the Turkish hostage we have and many others. But we will start with the Turks.\\" Speaking to The Associated Press, he said the clan has snatched more Syrians and warned that it would go on with further kidnappings until their clansman is released. He could not give an exact number but said the clan was now holding more than 20 captives. Lebanon's government appeared largely unable or unwilling to stop the kidnapping spree and escalating violence. Hezbollah and its allies hold a majority in the Cabinet, which has adopted a policy of \\"disassociation\\" from the events in Syria, trying to remain neutral. Hezbollah critics say it is assisting Assad in moving the conflict to Lebanon to divert attention from the deadly civil war raging in Syria. The al-Mikdad family is a powerful Shiite Muslim clan that originally comes from the eastern Bekaa Valley, an area where state control is limited and revenge killings are common. Like most tribes in this area, they have their own militia, and security officials say many of its members are outlaws wanted on arrest warrants. The family reach also extends to the capital. A south Beirut neighborhood with strong al-Mikdad ties, Rweis, is often avoided by outsiders who fear any possible offense that could put them at odds with the clan. The al-Mikdad's power often put them at odds with Hezbollah, the main power broker in the area, although many observers believe the appearance of armed groups Wednesday claiming to be members of the \\"military wing\\" of al-Mikdad family could not have happened without at least tacit Hezbollah support. The wave of hostage-taking prompted Gulf countries to call on all their citizens in Lebanon to leave immediately. Sunni regional powerhouses Saudi Arabia and Qatar, who back the Syrian rebels, were the first, followed by the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Kuwait. Lebanon is a popular summer destination for Gulf residents trying to escape the searing heat. Al-Mikdad backed off an earlier threat to abduct Gulf nationals. He said Thursday that only Syrians and Turks would be targeted. \\"Our problem is with the Syrians who have abducted our son and Syrian opponents of the region,\\" he said. \\"And why Turkey? Because Turkey is an operation theater for the Free Syrian Army,\\" he added. Turkey shelters thousands of Syrian refugees along with the leadership and members of the Free Syrian Army rebel group. The conflict in Syria has a sharply sectarian tone. The rebels are predominantly Sunni, whereas President Bashar Assad and his inner circle come mainly from the Alawite sect, an offshoot of Shiism. Similarly, Lebanon has had long rivalries between its own Sunni and Shiite communities. Throughout Syria's conflict, Lebanese Sunnis have largely been sympathetic to the Syrian rebellion, while Hezbollah _ the main Shiite political power _ has backed Assad. ||||| Launch Gallery Expand A residential area in Azaz, hit by at least two bombs from a Syrian fighter jet on August 15, 2012. © 2012 Rachel Beth Anderson for Human Rights Watch (Azaz) – A Syrian government fighter jet bombed a residential neighborhood, killing more than 40 civilians and wounding at least 100 others in the town of Azaz, including many women and children, Human Rights Watch said today after visiting the town. In the attack on August 15, 2012, at least two bombs destroyed an entire block of houses in the al-Hara al-Kablie neighborhood of Azaz, in Syria’s northern Aleppo province. Human Rights Watch investigated the site of the bombing two hours after the attack and interviewed witnesses, victims, medical personnel, and relatives of those killed. “This horrific attack killed and wounded scores of civilians and destroyed a whole residential block,” said Anna Neistat, acting emergencies director at Human Rights Watch. “Yet again, Syrian government forces attacked with callous disregard for civilian life.” Azaz residents told Human Rights Watch that, at around 3 p.m., they saw a fighter jet drop at least two bombs on the residential area. Within seconds, dozens of houses in an area of approximately 70-by-70 meters – more than half a football field – were flattened. Houses on the surrounding streets were significantly damaged, with collapsed walls and ceilings. On the streets around the bombed area, windows were broken and some walls had collapsed. Two opposition Free Syrian Army facilities in the vicinity of the attack might have been targets of the Syrian aircraft, Human Rights Watch said. One was the headquarters of the local Free Syrian Army brigade, in the former building of the Baath party, two streets away from the block that was hit. The other was a detention facility where the Free Syrian Army held “security detainees” – government military personnel and members of pro-government shabeeha militia. Neither of these facilities was damaged in the attack. Rescuers used two bulldozers to retrieve the dead and wounded from the ruins. By 7 p.m., medical personnel at the scene said they had recovered 25 bodies, and were looking for more in the rubble. A man helping to bury the bodies said that by midnight 33 people had been buried in Azaz. The exact number of victims is difficult to verify. Most of the wounded were transported to hospitals across the nearby Turkish border. A hospital volunteer in the Turkish town of Kilis, about 20 kilometers north of Azaz, told Human Rights Watch that 61 wounded people from Azaz had been brought to the hospital, and another 13 people had died either on the way to Kilis or shortly after arrival, among them seven men, two women and four children. At least another 16 severely wounded people were brought to a hospital in the Turkish town of Gaziantep, about 80 kilometers from Azaz, a doctor in that hospital told Human Rights Watch. One Azaz resident, “Ahmed,” told Human Rights Watch that the bombing had killed at least 12 members of his family in their home. He believed that four other family members were still under the ruins. He said: I was about 100 meters away from the house when I saw the airplane and heard the sound of the bombing and destruction. My three brothers lived here. I buried 12 of my family members today, including my father, my mother, and my sister – my brother’s wife as well. Walid, my brother, was cut into pieces. We didn’t recognize him at first. We buried my brothers’ children also. The youngest was 40 days old. “Ali” was weeping on the ruins of his house. He told Human Rights Watch: I was on the roof, making tomato soup, when I suddenly heard the plane. I heard several loud bangs, and was thrown to the floor. When I got up, I saw my wife who was injured – hit in the chest by shrapnel or debris. She was taken to the hospital – I still do not know what happened to her. “Ayman” told Human Rights Watch: My brother, sister and my father’s wife were killed today. What was Bashar al-Assad looking for in this area? …There were no weapons here. I live far away from my family, but when I heard the sounds of the explosion I came here and saw all this destruction. I was here when they removed the bodies of my family from under the rubble. Two of my killed relatives were 9 and 6 years old. International humanitarian law, or the laws of war, applies to all Syrian government and armed opposition forces in Syria. The laws of war prohibit direct attacks on civilians. Homes, apartments, and other civilian structures are also to be protected from attack, unless they are being used for military purposes. Where there is doubt about whether a target is military or civilian, it must be presumed to be civilian. The laws of war also prohibit attacks that strike military targets and civilians indiscriminately, such as those that are not directedat a specific military target.Attacks are also prohibited that may be expected to cause incidental civilian loss that would be disproportionate to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated from the attack. Military commanders must choose the means of attack that can be directed at military targets and will minimize incidental harm to civilians. If the weapons used are so inaccurate that they cannot be directed at military targets without imposing a substantial risk of civilian harm, then they should not be deployed. Weapons, such as aerial bombs with a large blast radius may be considered indiscriminate when used in populated areas. The laws of war do not prohibit fighting in urban areas, although the presence of many civilians places greater obligations on all warring parties to take steps to minimize harm to civilians. All forces need to take constant care during military operations to spare the civilian population, and take all feasible precautions to avoid loss of civilian life and property. These precautions include doing everything feasible to verify that the objects of attack are military targets and not civilians or civilian objects, and giving \\"effective advance warning\\" of attacks when circumstances permit. All forces must also avoid deploying near densely populated areas, and strive to remove civilians from the vicinity of their forces. At the same time, attacking forces are not relieved from their obligation to take into account the risk to civilians simply because they consider the defending forces responsible for locating military targets within populated areas. Governments have an obligation to investigate allegations of serious laws-of-war violations by their military forces. Those committed with criminal intent – deliberately or recklessly – are war crimes. Governments are obligated to identify and prosecute the individuals responsible for war crimes according to international fair-trial standards. Human Rights Watch called on United Nations Security Council members to impose an arms embargo on the Syrian government and targeted sanctions on government officials responsible for abuses, and refer the Syrian conflict to the International Criminal Court. “Syrian forces in northern Aleppo are using heavy artillery and aerial bombing in populated areas that kill and maim civilians every day,” Neistat said. “All Security Council members should show that protection of civilians means more than empty words.” ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"The United Nations observer mission in Syria is set to expire and will not be extended, according to France's Ambassador to the UN, Gerard Araud.

On the positive side, the app does a fairly good job of emulating PSP games, providing a nostalgic experience for fans of the console. The interface is user-friendly, allowing gamers to navigate quickly with minimal fuss. Plus, the app's compatibility with various games is impressive, which means users have a diverse library to choose from. However, there are a couple of drawbacks that I encountered while using the app. Firstly, I noticed the sound and graphics quality was not always up to par, compromising the overall gaming experience. Some games were even quite laggy, making it challenging to play them smoothly. Additionally, while the app is free, the presence of ads can be quite intrusive and distracting while engaging in gameplay. I understand the need for ad revenue, but I feel there could be a better balance to ensure the ads are not too disruptive. In conclusion, the org.ppsspp.ppsspp app is a satisfactory choice for PSP emulation, but it falls short in some aspects, such as sound and graphic quality, and the intrusive ads. With some improvements, I believe this app has the potential to become a top-notch emulator. For now, it earns a solid 3 stars in my book."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: Birds that employ many strategies to obtain food or feed on a variety of food items are called generalists, while others that concentrate time and effort on specific food items or have a single strategy to obtain food are considered specialists. Birds' feeding strategies vary by species. Many birds glean for insects, invertebrates, fruit, or seeds. Some hunt insects by suddenly attacking from a branch. Those species that seek pest insects are considered beneficial 'biological control agents' and their presence encouraged in biological pest control programs. Nectar feeders such as hummingbirds, sunbirds, lories, and lorikeets amongst others have specially adapted brushy tongues and in many cases bills designed to fit co-adapted flowers. Kiwis and shorebirds with long bills probe for invertebrates; shorebirds' varied bill lengths and feeding methods result in the separation of ecological niches. Loons, diving ducks, penguins and auks pursue their prey underwater, using their wings or feet for propulsion, while aerial predators such as sulids, kingfishers and terns plunge dive after their prey. Flamingos, three species of prion, and some ducks are filter feeders. Geese and dabbling ducks are primarily grazers.

Premise: We have reclaimed as revolutionary heroes George Orwell and Lionel Trilling. Hypothesis: George Orwell and Lionel Trilling are not to us revolutionary heroes. Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?","completion":"No, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise. Step-by-step: The task involves understanding if the hypothesis is entailed by the premise. Step 1: Understand the premise. The premise is stating that George Orwell and Lionel Trilling have been reclaimed as revolutionary heroes. Step 2: Consider the hypothesis. The hypothesis is stating that George Orwell and Lionel Trilling are not to us revolutionary heroes. Step 3: Compare the statements. The premise and the hypothesis are making contradictory statements about the same subject - George Orwell and Lionel Trilling being revolutionary heroes. Step 4: Conclusion.

But fans -- or \\"Marshmallows\\" as they're known -- wouldn't let executives keep their beloved characters from them a second time and saved the project by donating more than 5.7 million to a Kickstarter campaign for the film earlier this year, reaching far more than the 2 million Warner Bros. required to make the movie.

Liam started reading about apex predators, while Fox read about grazers and large herbivores. Which cousin learned more about predators with no natural predators? Hint: An apex predator, also known as an alpha predator or top predator, is a predator at the top of a food chain, with no natural predators.Apex predators are usually defined in terms of trophic dynamics, meaning that they occupy the highest trophic levels. Food chains are often far shorter on land, usually limited to being secondary consumers – for example, wolves prey mostly upon large herbivores (primary consumers), which eat plants (primary producers). The apex predator concept is applied in wildlife management, conservation and ecotourism. Answer:","completion":"Based on the description and hint provided, Liam, who focused on reading about apex predators, would have learned more about predators with no natural predators.

Pelecanos is more interested in working families struggling to get by, the racial tensions in its ethnic neighborhoods and the low-lifes on the edges. His crime-writing peers call Pelecanos the \\"undisputed poet\\" of Washington's gritty side. The best-selling and award-winning author is out this week with his 17th and latest novel, \\"The Cut.\\" It's the first in a new series featuring Iraq war veteran and private investigator Spero Lucas. When he's not working for a Washington defense attorney, Lucas recovers stolen property for a 40% cut. Now, a high-profile crime boss hires Lucas to find out who's been stealing from him, and it could turn out to be Lucas' biggest payday or an untimely end. While Pelecanos made his bones in the noir tradition, there's a definite \\"Western\\" feel to \\"The Cut.\\" The new novel takes place in a morally gray and often violent world.

Abstract: PURPOSE Minimal (< 10 mm thick) pleural effusion (PE) may represent an early phase of malignant PE, but its clinical relevance has rarely been studied. Therefore, we examined the proportion of minimal PE in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and its impact on survival. We also considered possible accumulation mechanisms in our data set. PATIENTS AND METHODS On the basis of PE status from chest computed tomography scans at diagnosis, 2,061 patients were classified into three groups: no PE, minimal PE, and malignant PE. Twenty-one variables associated with four factors-patient, stage migration, tumor, and treatment-were investigated for correlation with survival. RESULTS Minimal PE presented in 272 patients (13.2%). Of 2,061 patients, the proportion of each stage was the following: 5.2% stage I, 10.9% stage II, 13.2% stage IIIA, 23.8% stage IIIB, and 13.9% stage IV. Minimal PE correlated significantly with shorter survival time than did no PE (median survival time, 7.7 v 17.7 months; log-rank P < .001), even after full adjustment with all variables (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.21 to 1.62). Prognostic impact of minimal PE was higher in early versus advanced stages (Pinteraction = .001). In 237 patients (87.8%) with minimal PE, pleural invasion or attachment as a direct mechanism was observed, and it was an independent factor predicting worse survival (P = .03). CONCLUSION Minimal PE is a commonly encountered clinical concern in staging NSCLCs. Its presence is an important prognostic factor of worse survival, especially in early-stage disease..

When Highway finally arrives at the base, more bad news awaits. His new Operations Officer, Major Malcolm Powers (Everett McGill), is an Annapolis graduate who transferred over from Supply and has not had \\"the privilege\\" of combat. He sees Highway as an anachronism in the \\"new\\" Marine Corps, and assigns him to shape up the reconnaissance platoon. \\"Recon\\" is made up of undisciplined Marines who had been allowed to slack off by their previous platoon sergeant. Among his new charges, Highway finds none other than a dismayed Corporal Stitch Jones. Highway quickly takes charge and starts the men on a rigorous training program. They make a last-ditch attempt to intimidate Highway with \\"Swede\\" Johanson (Peter Koch), a gigantic, heavily-muscled Marine just released from the brig, but their plan fails miserably after Highway defeats him easily, and they eventually begin to shape up and develop esprit de corps. Highway repeatedly clashes with Powers and Staff Sergeant Webster (Moses Gunn) over his unorthodox training methods (such as firing live ammunition from an AK-47 over his men's heads to familiarize them with the weapon's distinctive sound); Powers makes it clear that he views Highway's platoon as only a training tool for his own elite outfit. Major Powers goes so far as to script and make the Recon platoon lose in every field exercise. However, Highway is supported by his old comrade-in-arms, Sergeant Major Choozhoo (Arlen Dean Snyder), and his nominal superior officer, the college educated but awkward and inexperienced Lieutenant Ring (Boyd Gaines). After Highway's men learn that he had been awarded the Medal of Honor in the Korean War, they gain...

Please write a short summary for the following article: How to set up your new HDTV Geoff Morrison , HD Guru It’s not possible for a TV to be set at the factory with the best settings possible for your home. Take 20 minutes or so on your end, and you can drastically improve the picture quality. If you just bought a TV, or just haven't found the time to mess around with your set, here are tips for doing it right. If you really want to nail it, we suggest a setup Blu-ray. They’re cheap, and the Disney WOW disc is especially helpful and easy to follow. (A step-up from that would be the 30 ISF HDTV Calibration Wizard.) Straight out of the boxAll HDTVs generally have a start-up screen that lets the user to choose between a home mode and a store demo mode. This is extremely important. The store mode is designed to produce the brightest image — at the expense of black level, contrast ratio and energy efficiency. To obtain the best picture select the home mode. You will still be able to make fine-tuning adjustments to maximize image quality. The screen will also ask you to choose your language, and will ask about using over-the-air antenna or cable/satellite. If you don’t use an antenna, make sure you select cable/satellite. You don’t want the TV to go into the tuner mode, because you won't see an image. Special instructions for smart TVsIf your new HDTV has Internet connectivity for streaming movies and other content, the next step should be connecting to the Internet. All smart TVs have an Ethernet connection if you want to wire the TV directly. Many also have Wi-Fi for wireless set-up. Follow the on-screen instructions or the owner’s manual for the proper steps. Once completed, you should make sure you have the latest version of the TV's software, by performing a firmware update as per your TV's instructions. The update may add new features, Internet services and even apps, and will assure you have the latest and best version of your new HDTV. Don't skip this: Nearly every TV we test has newer firmware waiting for it when we connect it to the Internet. Picture modesNearly all TVs have picture modes that adjust multiple settings to create a certain look to the image. The best idea is to start with the most accurate setting, then adjust as you see fit. With nearly all TVs, this mode is called “Movie,” “Cinema,” or something similar. If these aren’t options, “Standard” is likely closest. If you’ve already been watching your TV for more than a few minutes, switching to one of these modes is going to be a shock. It will seem red (warm) and soft. It isn’t, which I’ll explain as we go. ContrastThis control adjusts the bright parts of the image: Clouds, white shirts, snow, etc. The idea is to set this control high enough that the image “pops,” but not so high as to mask detail, like cloud textures or shirt wrinkles. All TVs have a maximum contrast setting, above which you’re not making the image any brighter, you’re just making near-white objects totally white. If you’re using a setup disc, the contrast pattern will have a ramp of progressively whiter bars. The idea is to be able see most of these (but not those labeled “above white”). If you’re not using a setup disc, find a TV show (ideally a live sporting event) that takes place outside. Skiing works great for this, though baseball does as well (fly balls, any shot of the sky). The idea is to be able to set the control so that you can still see detail in bright white objects. There should almost never be bright white blobs on the screen. If there are, turn the contrast control down until those blobs get their detail back. There is no average number to use as a guideline for setting contrast, but it’s almost never 100 percent, or anything close. Start somewhere around 80 percent and go from there. BrightnessThis is the opposite of the contrast control. Despite its name, brightness control adjusts the dark parts of the image: Shadows, black hair, black leather jackets. The idea here is to set it low enough that the picture has lots of contrast (as in, the difference in the light and dark parts of the image), but not so far that there’s just huge swaths of blackness on screen during any night scene. If you’re using a setup disc, the brightness pattern will have a ramp of progressively darker black bars. The idea is to be able see most of these (but not those labeled “below black” or similar). If you’re setting this by eye, any night or darkly lit scene will do. Set the control fairly low, down past the point where you lose detail. Now gradually increase it until you see detail in the darkness. If the picture looks gray or washed out, you’ve brought your brightness too far up. Color and tintGenerally speaking, you shouldn’t have to adjust these at all. These are holdovers from the old tube (CRT) TV days. With component and HDMI connections, the TV shouldn’t need adjustment to color or tint. But so you know, color is color saturation. Set too high, people will look sunburned, and everything will seem cartoony. Tint adjusts the green/red in the image (Martian/lobster). Without specific color filters (that usually come with setup discs), you can’t adjust either of these settings these correctly. Skip. SharpnessThis is a highly misleading control. Generally speaking, sharpness control adds enhancement to the image to make it appear sharp. Ironically, by doing so, it’s actually masking true fine detail in the image. This setting should be set as low as possible. Some TVs actually soften the image if you set it too low (bizarre, to be sure), so watch out for that. Look for dark lines on a bright background, like the edges of buildings for instance. Lower this setting so there isn’t any ghost line next to the dark edge. This ghost line is called “edge enhancement,” and goes a long way in making the image look artificial. Once you get used to the naturalness of the image without edge enhancement, you’ll never go back. Color temperatureThis one is going to be tough. Not because it requires any labor on your part, it’s just going to do something to the image that at first is going to seem bad. Color temperature is how bluish or reddish the image looks. Picture a typical scene of people walking down a street. Set the color temp too cool, and it will look like they’re walking down the street in winter, with that season’s normal bluish tones. Set the color temp too warm, and it will be a reddish warm day instead. With most TVs, the ideal setting is “warm” or “low.” In some cases, this is too warm, and “normal” is closer. If you’re changing the settings for the first time, and the TV was set in the “cool” color temp mode, everything will look wrong, and even “normal” will appear to your eye as too warm. Give your eyes time to adjust. Watch on “normal” for a few hours, and then “cool” will seem incredibly blue. BacklightThis is an LCD-specific control — plasma TVs don’t have backlights. Think of the backlight setting as a volume control for the image. Turn it up, and the entire picture (bright whites and dark blacks alike) get brighter. Turn it down, and everything gets darker. If you leave this turned all the way up, not only are you wasting energy, but at night your TV can be hard to watch. Modern LCDs are extremely bright, and watching such a small bright object in a dark room can create severe eye fatigue. For critical viewing, or watching at night, the idea is to get the best black levels, while still creating a watchable image. Once you set contrast and brightness correctly, turn the backlight control all the way down. This will likely be too dark for most viewing. Turn it up to the point where it looks the best. Often, at night, this could be as low as 20 percent, depending on the TV. During the day, you can set this as high as you want. Interestingly, no setup disc offers instructions on how to set this control. Read more on this in our buyer-beware article on TV backlights. For more on what your HDTV’s controls do, read our Guide to HDTV Settings. You can catch up with Geoff Morrison on Twitter at @TechWriterGeoff. His novel, \\"Undersea,\\" is now in paperback. Summary:","completion":"Setting up a new HDTV requires about 20 minutes of your time to drastically improve picture quality. First, choose the home mode when starting up, connect your smart TV to the internet, check for firmware updates, and select the most accurate picture mode. Then, adjust the contrast control to ensure the image pops while maintaining detail, set brightness low enough to provide contrast without losing detail, and set sharpness as low as possible without softening. Next, adjust the color temperature for natural tones and optimize the backlight depending on whether you mostly watch TV during the day or at night."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: Joan Crawford (Faye Dunaway) is a driven actress and compulsively clean housekeeper who tries to control the lives of those around her as tightly as she controls herself. To prepare for a work day at MGM Studios, she rises at 4:00 a.m. and engages in a strict morning ritual: scrubbing her face and arms with soap and boiling hot water, then plunging her face into a bowl of rubbing alcohol and ice to close the pores. When Helga (Alice Nunn), a new maid, thinks she has Joan's living room in spotless condition, Joan finds one minor detail that she overlooked and loses her temper. Joan is in a relationship with Hollywood lawyer Gregg Savitt (Steve Forrest), but her career is in a bit of a downswing. Despite desperately wanting a baby, she is unable to get pregnant: seven pregnancies when she was married to actor Franchot Tone have all ended in miscarriages. When she is denied an application for adoption, she enlists Gregg's help to secure a baby. Joan adopts a girl whom she names Christina (Mara Hobel), and later a boy, Christopher (Jeremy Scott Reinholt). Joan sometimes lavishes Christina with attention and luxuries such as an extravagant birthday party, but also enforces a very stern code of denial and discipline. When Christina is showered with gifts, Joan allows her to choose only one she likes best that she can keep, then donates the rest to charity. As Christina rebels against her mother, confrontations ensue. Joan overtakes Christina in a swimming-pool race and laughs at the child. Joan becomes enraged when Christina reacts with anger and locks her in the pool house. Later, Joan discovers Christina wearing her makeup and imitating her. Even though Christina openly denies it and despite her protests, Joan - thinking that Christina is making fun of her, always rummaging through her drawers, trying to find a way to make people look at her, and always looking at herself in the mirror - hysterically cuts off chunks of Christina's hair to humiliate her.

Article: Ceiling fans are very effective because they move the air around the room and create a draft. They also pull air up when circulating it, and since hot air rises, this will help to cool the room down faster. If the ceiling fan isn’t already on in the room, turn it on immediately. If your ceiling fan has settings of low, medium and high, put the fan on the highest setting. Check the ceiling fan blades to see if they’re rotating counterclockwise (if viewing them from below) – if they aren’t, adjust the settings. Setting the blades to rotate counterclockwise and turning the fan on a higher speed will substantially increase airflow. Table fans, box fans, oscillating fans and mounted fans will all help to contribute to air circulation in the room and create a wind-chill effect. A medium-sized oscillating fan placed on a desktop is very efficient at moving around stagnant hot air quickly. Keep multiple fans set up in the room during the summer so you can turn them on as soon as you walk in. Turn on your bathroom ventilation fan, too. The ventilation fan can help suck hot air out of the room, just as it does when you take a steamy shower. Create a makeshift air conditioner by filling up a shallow pan, tray or mixing bowl with ice and positioning it in front of one of the fans. This will get cold, slightly misty air circulating the room very quickly. You could also use icepacks or, if you’re all out of ice, you can effectively improvise with something similarly cold, like a bag of frozen vegetables. Position the bowl at a slight angle, tilted up, if the fan doesn’t seem to be blowing across the ice effectively. The fan will pull hot air out of the room and transfer it outside. It will also bring in cooler air. Put the fan in the window that gets the most shade – this will provide the coolest intake air. Close any other windows nearby tightly. Open a few windows on the other side of your house. This will create a house-wide draft and cool things down quickly.

Ace eventually apologizes, then agrees to be Joe's best man at the wedding. Ace falls in love with a Japanese entertainer, Hana-ogi, who is a performer for a Takarazuka-like theater company, whom he meets through Katsumi. Eileen realizes that Ace's attentions are no longer focused on her and begins a friendship with a famous Kabuki performer, Nakamura. When she overhears that Joe's house has been under surveillance by the Army, she believes that Ace is in danger and goes there to warn him, where she realizes he is seeing a local woman. Joe suffers further prejudice at the hands of a particularly nasty colonel, pulling extra duty and all the less attractive assignments. When he and many others who are married to Japanese are targeted for transfer back to the States, Joe realizes that he will not be able to take Katsumi, who is now pregnant. Ace goes to General Webster and pleads Joe's case, asking that he be allowed to remain in Japan. When the General refuses on the grounds that he cannot allow an exception, Ace tells him that he will be in the same situation, since he intends to marry Hana-Ogi. Eileen and her mother are present for the exchange and when Ace apologizes for hurting her, she realizes Ace never loved her the way he loves Hana-Ogi and she leaves to see Nakamura. The answer is:","completion":"Ace Gruver is introduced to Hana-ogi by Katsumi."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

McDonald's placed this billboard near Starbucks' corporate headquarters in Seattle, Washington. Residents in Seattle, Washington, the birthplace of Starbucks, can now see approximately 140 McDonald's billboards emblazoned with \\"large is the new grande\\" or \\"four bucks is dumb.\\" In a statement released Thursday, McDonald's called it \\"a light-hearted, fun approach to our brand,\\" aimed at promoting the company's McCafe coffee products. However, Starbucks is not finding the ad campaign funny. \\"Comparative campaigns are all well and good but only when they're credible and authentic. If the claim is not supportable or the tone is off, you risk losing credibility,\\" Deb Trevino, director of global communications for Starbucks, told CNN. A 12-ounce cup of coffee at Starbucks in Seattle costs just 1.40, only a penny more than the average price for a same size cup at McDonald's. Credibility is something that Starbucks claims it is not short on. A portion of coffee sales currently goes towards health care for Starbucks' baristas, while another goes towards helping AIDS victims in Africa, according to the company. \\"We will not enter into a tit-for-tat,\\" Trevino said. \\"Our customers are interested in more than just the coffee, they come for the experience.\\" For now, McDonald's said it does not plan to take its \\"four bucks is dumb\\" campaign nationwide.

The NSA later confirmed the existence of the surveillance scheme as well as a separate phone records programme which it said had helped it thwart terrorist plots in the US and more than 20 other countries. US spy chief James Clapper has also stated that the NSA's communications-collection efforts were designed to help acquire information about \\"non-US persons located outside the United States\\" and the agency could not \\"intentionally target any US citizen, any other US person, or anyone located within the United States\\". However, privacy activists and some politicians have raised concerns that the agency's actions still went beyond what was intended under powers granted by the Patriot Act following the 11 September 2001 terror attacks. Following the revelations, several of the tech firms involved said they had asked the US government to allow them to disclose information which would help them address concern about the scale of information that had been handed over. On Friday, Facebook and Microsoft announced they had been given permission to reveal the number of data requests from US officials in aggregate, and Apple has now followed with its own statement. \\"We first heard of the government's 'Prism' program when news organisations asked us about it on June 6,\\" it said. \\"We do not provide any government agency with direct access to our servers, and any government agency requesting customer content must get a court order.\\" The firm added that between 1 December 2012 and 31 May 2013 it received between 4,000 and 5,000 requests from US law enforcement for customer data, involving between 9,000 and 10,000 accounts or devices. It did not say with how many it had complied. It said the \\"common form of request\\" came from police who were investigating crimes such as robberies, trying to find missing children and patients with Alzheimer's disease, or hoping to prevent suicides. It noted that it would not have been able to decode encrypted conversations which took place over its iMessage or Facetime chat software on behalf of the authorities, nor did it store \\"identifiable\\" data related to Apple Map searches or requests made to its voice-controlled Siri service. \\"Regardless of the circumstances, our legal team conducts an evaluation of each request and, only if appropriate, we retrieve and deliver the narrowest possible set of information to the authorities,\\" it added. Apple's disclosure covers a different period from that disclosed by Facebook and Microsoft, which both published data for the last six months of 2012. Microsoft said it received between 6,000 and 7,000 requests from US government agencies affecting between 31,000 and 32,000 customer accounts. Facebook said it received between 9,000 and 10,000 requests covering between 18,000 and 19,000 accounts.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person whose father settled in London with his wife? ? Giovanni Battista Barbirolli was born in Southampton Row, Holborn, London, the second child and eldest son of an Italian father and a French mother. He was a British national from birth, and as Southampton Row is within the sound of Bow Bells, Barbirolli always regarded himself as a Cockney. His father, Lorenzo Barbirolli (1864–1929), was a Venetian violinist who had settled in London with his wife, Louise Marie, née Ribeyrol (1870–1962). Lorenzo and his father had played in the orchestra at La Scala, Milan, where they had taken part in the première of Otello in 1887. In London they played in West End theatre orchestras, principally that of the Empire, Leicester Square. The young Barbirolli began to play the violin when he was four, but soon changed to the cello. He later said that this was at the instigation of his grandfather who, exasperated at the child's habit of wandering around while practising the violin, bought him a small cello to stop him from \\"getting in everybody's way\\". His education at St. Clement Danes Grammar School overlapped, from 1910, with a scholarship at Trinity College of Music. As a Trinity student, he made his concert debut in a cello concerto in the Queen's Hall in 1911. The following year he won a scholarship to the Royal Academy of Music, which he attended from 1912 to 1916, studying harmony, counterpoint and theory under Dr. J. B. McEwen and the cello with Herbert Walenn. In 1914 he was joint winner of the academy's Charles Rube Prize for ensemble playing, and in 1916 The Musical Times singled him out as \\"that excellent young 'cello player, Mr Giovanni Barbirolli.\\" The principal of the Academy, Sir Alexander Mackenzie, had forbidden students to play the chamber music of Ravel, which he regarded as \\"a pernicious influence\\". Barbirolli was keenly interested in modern music, and he and three colleagues secretly rehearsed Ravel's String Quartet in the privacy of a men's lavatory in the Academy.From 1916 to 1918 Barbirolli was a freelance cellist in London. He recalled, \\"My first... Answer:","completion":"The last name of the person whose father settled in London with his wife is Barbirolli.

Make sure that your computer can actually burn DVDs, as older computers may not have the capability. If the AutoPlay window doesn't appear, click the Start menu and select Computer. Right-click on the DVD drive and select \\"Open\\". This can help you identify what's on this disc later. Including the date in the name can help organize your discs. There are two options when it comes to burning a data disc: Live File System or Mastered. Using the Live File System allows you to add, edit, and delete files on the disc as long as you're using it with other Windows computers. If you select this option, the disc will be formatted before you can start adding files to it. This formatting process may take a few minutes. Mastered finalizes the disc when you're done adding files so that it can't be changed, but will allow you to use the disc in any computer or device that supports data DVDs. Once you've selected your disc format, you can start adding files to the disc. Single-layer DVDs can fit 4.7 GB of data. There are a couple of different ways that you can add files to your blank disc: Click and drag files into the blank DVD's window. Right-click on a file or folder and select \\"Send to\\" and then your disc drive. If you're using the Live File System format, the files will be burned to the disc as soon as you copy them. This may take a few moments for larger files. When you're done adding files to your disc, you can finish the process by either closing the session (Live File System) or by burning the disc (Mastered). Live File System - Click the Close session button at the top of the disc's window. This will finalize the disc which allows you to continue using it like a USB drive in other Windows computers. Mastered - Click the Burn to disc button at the top of the disc's window. You'll be given the opportunity to name the disc again and select your recording speed. The burn process may take several minutes to complete. At the end of the burning process, you'll be given the opportunity to burn the same data to another blank disc if you need copies. You can continue to add files to your burned DVDs as long as there is still free space available. You can do this regardless of which format you created the disc in. Follow the processes above to add more files. Live File System - Every time you open a new session on a disc, you lose about 20 MB of usable space. Mastered - Files added to an already-burned disc cannot be deleted. DVD-RW discs are rewritable, and can be erased even if you chose the Mastered format. To erase the disc, insert it and open Windows Explorer. Select your DVD-RW in your list of devices, but don't open it. Click the Erase this disc button at the top of the window.

Write an article based on this summary: A £10m online health project has reached less than a third of the people it set out to, the BBC has learned.","completion":"Title: £10m Online Health Project Falls Short in Reaching Target Audience Introduction: A £10 million online health project, funded by the UK government, aimed at providing support and resources for individuals seeking medical and wellness information, has so far proven to be less effective than initially anticipated. According to data obtained by the BBC, the reach of the project has been significantly lower than its goals, having reached less than 30% of its intended audience. This raises questions about the project's implementation, marketing strategies, and the allocation of funds. Background: The digital health project, launched last year, was designed as a comprehensive online platform to provide quick access to reliable health information, expert advice, and tools that could improve the well-being and self-care of people in the UK. The project set out to reach millions of users and sought to help them make informed decisions about their health by providing critical information on various health conditions, treatment options, and prevention techniques. Findings: Despite the £10m investment, it has been revealed that the online health project has only managed to reach around 30% of its target audience. This disappointing result indicates a need to re-evaluate the project's strategies and potentially make adjustments to the way resources are utilised. Possible Causes: Several factors may have contributed to the project's low reach: 1. Insufficient marketing: The project may have suffered from poor visibility, as adequate marketing efforts may not have been put in place to educate the public about the platform and its goals. Inadequate marketing can reduce the chances of reaching a wider audience. 2. Inaccessible content: The project's content may not have been user-friendly, or it may have contained too much medical jargon, discouraging users from engaging with the platform. Accessible content design is essential to ensure the message reaches both medical professionals and laypeople. 3. Competition from established platforms: The online health project may have struggled to penetrate a crowded market with existing, well-established information sources. Without offering a clear and compelling differentiator, the project may have failed to attract users away from familiar platforms. Recommendations: Going forward, the following steps could potentially improve the reach of the project: 1. Review and enhance marketing strategies: Implementing a stronger marketing campaign can improve the project's visibility and awareness in its target population. This may include partnerships with health organizations, collaborations with public figures, and focusing on targeted marketing techniques. 2. Make content more accessible: Ensuring that the platform's content is approachable and easy to understand can help attract a wider audience. Utilising infographics, videos, and simplified language are some ways to make information more appealing. 3. Establish a unique selling proposition (USP): To compete more effectively with existing platforms, the project should focus on providing features or services that are distinct and offer an advantage over the competition. Identifying the needs and gaps in the current market can offer valuable insight for creating a USP. Conclusion: While the £10m online health project has not reached its intended audience as expected, there is still potential for improvement. By evaluating current strategies and making necessary adjustments, the project can heighten its appeal and accessibility to ultimately fulfil its intended purpose of providing vital health information and support to millions of individuals in the UK."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

This article: Lawrence Morton, in a study of the origins of The Rite, records that in 1907–08 Stravinsky set to music two poems from Sergey Gorodetsky's collection Yar. Another poem in the anthology, which Stravinsky did not set but is likely to have read, is \\"Yarila\\" which, Morton observes, contains many of the basic elements from which The Rite of Spring developed, including pagan rites, sage elders, and the propitiatory sacrifice of a young maiden: \\"The likeness is too close to be coincidental\\". Stravinsky himself gave contradictory accounts of the genesis of The Rite. In a 1920 article he stressed that the musical ideas had come first, that the pagan setting had been suggested by the music rather than the other way round. However, in his 1936 autobiography he described the origin of the work thus: \\"One day [in 1910], when I was finishing the last pages of L'Oiseau de Feu in St Petersburg, I had a fleeting vision ... I saw in my imagination a solemn pagan rite: sage elders, seated in a circle, watching a young girl dance herself to death. They were sacrificing her to propitiate the god of Spring. Such was the theme of the Sacre du Printemps\\".By May 1910 Stravinsky was discussing his idea with Nicholas Roerich, the foremost Russian expert on folk art and ancient rituals. Roerich had a reputation as an artist and mystic, and had provided the stage designs for Diaghilev's 1909 production of the Polovtsian Dances. The pair quickly agreed on a working title, \\"The Great Sacrifice\\" (Russian: Velikaia zhertva); Diaghilev gave his blessing to the work, although the collaboration was put on hold for a year while Stravinsky was occupied with his second major commission for Diaghilev, the ballet Petrushka.In July 1911 Stravinsky visited Talashkino, near Smolensk, where Roerich was staying with the Princess Maria Tenisheva, a noted patron of the arts and a sponsor of Diaghilev's magazine World of Art. Here, over several days, Stravinsky and Roerich finalised the structure of the ballet. Thomas F.

To do this, we'll first move the constant term (+84) to the other side of the equation by subtracting it from both sides. 12*h + 84 - 84 = 0 - 84 12*h = -84 Step 3: Solve for h. To completely isolate h, we now need to divide both sides of the equation by 12, which is the coefficient of h.

Two farmer's associations used different agricultural methods when growing crops. Bold farm used lots of fertilizers over the years, while Shallow farm used organic methods combined with methods from permaculture. Which farm contributes less to the consumption of oxygen in the water? Hint: Rain dissolves fertilizer in the soil. Runoff carries it away. The fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, from ponds to oceans. Nitrogen is a fertilizer in the water. Since there is a lot of nitrogen, it causes algae to grow out of control. Pictured below is a pond covered with algae ( Figure below ). Algae use up carbon dioxide in the water. After the algae die, decomposers break down the dead tissue. The decomposers use up all the oxygen in the water. This creates a dead zone. A dead zone is an area in a body of water where nothing grows because there is too little oxygen. There is a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico ( Figure below ). The U.S. states outlined on the map have rivers that drain into the Gulf of Mexico. The rivers drain vast agricultural lands. The water carries fertilizer from these areas into the Gulf. Answer:","completion":"Based on the given information, Shallow farm, which used organic methods combined with permaculture methods, contributes less to the consumption of oxygen in the water. This is because Bold farm used lots of fertilizers, which, when carried away by rain and runoff, can lead to an increase in nitrogen in the water and eventually cause algae blooms.

Sidney removes the body but still has to convince Myra to conspire with him. She reveals nothing when they receive an unexpected visit from the psychic Helga Ten Dorp (Irene Worth), a minor celebrity who is staying with the Bruhls' neighbors. Helga senses pain and death in the house; before she leaves she warns Sidney about a man in boots who will attack him. As she prepares for bed, Myra is beginning to come to terms with what Sidney has done. All is calm until Clifford bursts through the bedroom window and beats Sidney with a log. Clifford chases Myra through the house until her weak heart gives out; she collapses and dies. Sidney calmly descends the stairs, uninjured, and sidles unperturbed to Clifford's side. They exchange a few words about what to do with Myra's body, then exchange a passionate kiss. Clifford moves in with Sidney. The two work together at a partner's desk, Sidney suffering from writer's block but Clifford busily typing page after page of a new play that he keeps suspiciously under lock and key.

Question: Generate a question that has the following answer: Bergman. for the following movie plot: A prologue establishes the courage and journalistic integrity of Bergman (Pacino) and Mike Wallace (Plummer) as they prepare to interview Sheikh Fadlallah for 60 Minutes. In Louisville, Kentucky, Dr. Jeffrey Wigand (Crowe) arrives home from his office at the Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Company, reluctantly telling his wife Liane (Venora) that he has been fired. Bergman approaches Wigand for help translating technical documents. Wigand agrees, but Bergman is intrigued when he cites a corporate confidentiality agreement and refuses to discuss anything further. Wigand is later summoned to a meeting with the B&amp;W CEO, who threatens legal action and cessation of severance benefits if he does not sign a more restrictive confidentiality agreement. Wigand angrily leaves, and accuses Bergman of betraying him. Bergman visits Wigand's home and vigorously defends himself. Wigand is reassured but hesitant to reveal anything that might threaten his family's medical coverage, apparently possessing very damaging information. The Wigand family move into a more modest house, Wigand now working as a teacher. One night his younger daughter Barbara sees someone outside. Wigand finds a fresh footprint in the garden, and receives a sinister phone call. Knowing that Wigand's confidentiality agreement obstructs any potential story, Bergman contacts Richard Scruggs (Feore), an attorney representing the State of Mississippi in a lawsuit against the tobacco industry, believing that Wigand could be shielded from legal sanction if he were compelled to break confidentiality and testify. Scruggs expresses interest. Some time later Wigand receives an emailed death threat against him and his family, and finds a bullet in his mailbox. He contacts the FBI, but the agents who attend are hostile, confiscating his computer. Wigand, furious over the threats, demands Bergman arrange an interview. In the interview, Wigand states that B&amp;W intentionally make their cigarettes more addictive, and that he was fired after refusing to support...

At the heart of the maelstrom that has gripped Pakistan during the past eight weeks since I authored an opinion piece on the nuclear-armed nation's alleged intelligence sector malfeasance against U.S. regional interests lies nothing less than the struggle to define Pakistan's modern statehood. It is a fight between the feudal politics of Pakistan's barons, President Asif Ali Zardari being chief among them, and the military's dominance of its industry, security and strategic sectors. Stuck in the middle is a largely uneducated, underemployed and malnourished population that yearns for leadership -- any kind of leadership -- to guide the country forward. That struggle, hidden from the world's view through the many years of dictatorship and moribund civilian rule, has now come out in the open as a result of my column's disclosure of a confidential memorandum that Pakistan's then ambassador to the United States, Husain Haqqani, directed me to draft and deliver to Admiral Mike Mullen, then chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff. [Editor's note: Haqqani has denied any involvement in the memo.]. Inadvertent as my purpose was in disclosing the memorandum, the debate it has touched off is real and the issues being debated are finally the ones that need illumination in a country that survives on a rich diet of conspiracy theories and the adolescent antics of its political leaders. The memorandum called on Mullen to dissuade his friend, Pakistan's army chief Gen. Ashfaq Kayani, from moving against the civilian government in the tense days that followed Operation Neptune Spear -- the U.S. Special Forces raid that killed Osama bin Laden. In return, it offered a commitment by a reconstituted civilian government, which would have added national security muscle previously belonging to the army and intelligence sectors, to do a lot of what America and its allies in the region, India and Afghanistan, have long been calling on Pakistan to do. To some in Pakistan, the memo was the product of an honorable civil servant (Haqqani) attempting to save his boss's government from imminent demise at the hands of military men he had come to despise. To others, the memorandum's contents were nothing short of high treason, the product of a ruthless operator's (Zardari) directive and his cunning collaborator's (Haqqani) compliance. The truth probably lies somewhere in between. Yet far from harming the democratic institutions Haqqani claimed to be defending when he first contacted me on that beautiful May morning, the debate over the memorandum's who, what, when and why has had the remarkable effect of stimulating forces that make democracy real in a civilized society, not the mirage that was being peddled around the halls of Congress, Washington's think-tank lecture circuit or the Sunday talk shows by the able ambassador. Today, nearly two months after the memorandum's contents became known, the army remains in its barracks. The intelligence services continue to play their Patriot Games in Afghanistan while minding the store at home with an invisible hand. Zardari, who said he would address a special joint session of Parliament on \\"memogate\\" sometime next week, had his heart condition resurface on Tuesday, sending him scurrying off to Dubai (Pakistani doctors and hospitals wouldn't do) for a stay of undetermined length outside the country. The Supreme Court has taken on the challenge addressed to it by a leader of an opposition political party who felt he couldn't get the \\"memogate\\" truth out of a biased Parliamentary committee. An Inquiry Commission has been formed as a result. A former cricket hero turned politician now routinely attracts tens of thousands of supporters at gathering points around the country as he tries to coerce the Arab Spring's winds to blow further east. And the chivalrous prime minister, Yousef Raza Gilani, tells his party loyalists that he is prepared to resign if my facts are proven right and Haqqani, or worse, Zardari, are found to be the minds behind the memo. Pakistan's press is also doing its job well -- the hacks who support Zardari, Inc. are throwing knives at me hourly while those who want to see Zardari get his comeuppance will simply not let the story go and are eagerly digging at and reporting on every facet of it. All of which means everyone -- finally -- has a stake in the outcome of an issue that could have brought serious repercussions to the country's method of accountability and governance if the doctrine outlined in the memo had been enacted. Hmmm...... seems to me that democracy is doing exactly what it should: Self-corrective actions with heated debate about principled issues, all within the constitutional framework and rule of law as it exists today. David Frum can call me all the names he wants -- it won't change the facts. It certainly will not deter me. And it won't help to fix what ails Pakistan. Peter Bergen can ridicule my three or four claims that turned out to be inaccurate over a five year period of being interviewed nearly four or five times a week -- it won't change the facts, or the accuracy with which I recorded them in this instance. The think-tank crowd and my detractors at the State Department, never ones to like private US citizens running off and doing what they only talk about or dream of being able to do, have always pilloried my efforts -- but their frustrations and jealousies won't change the facts. Even the White House didn't have all the facts when it issued a denial of my opinion that Pakistani officials knew about the bin Laden raid before it happened. Its fact checkers could not readily find the May 2, 2011 story from CNN reporter Nick Paton Walsh which reported that Pakistan's High Commissioner to the UK had said -- when asked about the bin Laden raid -- that Pakistan was \\"in the know of certain things\\" and \\"what happened happened with our consent.\\" [Editor's note: Haqqani has been quoted as saying the allegation that he was informed of the raid in advance are \\"reckless, baseless and false.\\"]. I have largely ignored the attacks emanating from Haqqani's supporters in Washington because the former ambassador can't speak for himself since being put on ice by Zardari in a safe house. But enough is enough. Haqqani should be offered immunity from prosecution in Pakistan and simply tell the Pakistani people the truth about what he -- and his boss -- did. He will be seen as a hero for having the guts to call a spade a spade. Rogue operations inside governments have no place in our world today. The people of Pakistan deserve better. They deserve to know the truth. And it is alone for the Pakistani people to decide whether their political leaders deserve their faith and trust after learning the truth of what has been done in their names. I did not ask to be involved in the events that gave rise to this firestorm. I too face threats and haranguing from Zardari's supporters on a daily basis. But I had the courage to speak truth to power -- as I have done all my life -- and now I'm going to make sure the facts of what the ambassador and those behind him asked me to do in the name of democracy are put squarely on the table for the people of Pakistan to see, judge and decide. Facts, after all, are still stubborn things. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Mansoor Ijaz.

I looked in my Comcastic little box to find a movie to watch. Zombie Nation? Hey, I love zombie movies. Says the filmmaker has some sort of cult following in the description. Funny how it doesn't warn me not to watch this film. I could've used that advice. Zombie Nation is just like Troll 2 in that it's completely misnamed. It has little (if anything, depending on your point of view) to do with zombies, and takes place all within one city. This film revolves around a crooked cop, who acts as badly as possible (he has to be trying to suck this much), while he arrests women for trivial bullshit and then kills them. Yup, he's a serial killer cop. Not only is this film flawed in thinking that it's a zombie flick, it also gets its serial killer facts completely wrong. Serial killers enjoy killing, they live for it and they get down and personal with it. This guy knocks out the women, and injects them with some poison. He doesn't even have sex with the corpse or dismember it. Talk about boring! Eventually, one of the whopping five women he kills has Voodoo protection done to her and for no apparent reason, all five come back to life and head off to kill this guy. They were all buried or tossed into the ocean, but you wouldn't know it buy the sharp clean clothes they're all wearing. The women then act very poorly and take their revenge. Oh yay. This film was crap in every category. Crap acting, crap writing, crappier sets, and crappier make-up effects. The women don't look zombie-like, unless you count really dark make-up around the eyes to be the de facto definition of what makes a zombie. They can all talk, behave, think, and act perfectly human. The gore is weak compared to even many PG-13 films and the nudity is beyond brief. You see glimpse of breasts in the opening sequence... Then the exact same breasts later! Go figure. Guess only one actress was willing to go topless for this trite. The police station is so badly constructed that you can see where they stopped painting the walls of the warehouse they're obviously filming in.

Help as much as you can. Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below. Where people are more at risk of mental retardation, coastal area or inland? People in the coastal area naturally get more iodide from food items because the soil has more iodized salt. But farther we go inland, the soil lacks necessary iodine. As a result, inland population do not get enough iodine naturally. Hint: Before iodized salt was developed, some people experienced a number of developmental difficulties, including problems with thyroid gland function and mental retardation. In the 1920s, we learned that these conditions could usually be treated easily with the addition of iodide anion to the diet. One easy way to increase iodide intake was to add the anion to table salt. This simple step greatly enhanced health and development. Large amounts of iodide ion are also found in seaweed such as kelp (see picture above) and saltwater fish. A:","completion":"People are more at risk of mental retardation in inland areas due to the soil lacking necessary iodine, leading to insufficient natural iodine intake for the inland population."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Title: Vexille Movie plot: By the 2060s, robotics technology has become extremely advanced, including cybernetics. World opinion begins to turn against robotics, leading to the U.N. declaring a unilateral ban on further research in 2067. Japan, being home to robotics pioneer Daiwa Heavy Industries, strongly protests this ban, but is unable to prevent its passage. In protest, Japan withdraws from international politics. All foreigners are deported, and further immigration is prohibited. In addition, the R.A.C.E. network is constructedÂ â 270 off-shore installations that cover Japan with an energy field, nullifying all communication with the outside world and making satellite surveillance impossible. Trade and diplomacy continues, but Japan vanishes from the world scene. Ten years later, the United States Navy special warfare unit \\"SWORD\\" is trying to trap a Japanese informant for Daiwa in Colorado. The instigator, Saito, escapes by cutting off his own leg. Analysis shows the leg is made of bio-metal. SWORD suspects that Japan has concealed extensive development of banned technologies. They embark on an unapproved scheme to infiltrate Japan and to find out the frequency of the R.A.C.E. network, enabling SWORD to gather intelligence on the country. Although the agents successfully enter Japan, they are detected by security forces before they can transmit their data. Vexille is the sole SWORD agent to evade capture, and only her lover Leon survives to be taken to Daiwa's headquarters. Vexille awakens to find Tokyo is now a shanty town ruled by Daiwa. A small resistance movement opposes the company, and uses Vexille's transmitter to successfully transmit the distortion frequency. Maria, the head of the resistance, details the 10 years of secrecy while SWORD studies Japan in shocked horror â the islands are a lifeless wasteland. In 2067, an unknown disease struck Japan and was countered by an experimental vaccine. In actuality, the disease was created by Daiwa and the \\"vaccine\\" was used as an excuse for Daiwa to begin testing...
