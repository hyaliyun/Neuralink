Comments ranged from anguish and shock to an outpouring of support and concern for the injured Liu. The athlete, who won gold in Athens in 2004, crashed at the first hurdle but got up and hopped to the finish line. For many, it was a tragic repeat of the 2008 Beijing Games when he pulled out with an Achilles injury. \\"Ah Liu Xiang, my heart is broken,\\" said one user of the Twitter-like Sina Weibo website. News of Liu's fall dominated the front pages of many newspapers. Many lauded him as a hero despite his failure to progress to the final - unlike the general reaction to his withdrawal in Beijing four years ago, which spawned a slew of criticism. \\"Liu Xiang fell down, but he will be our hero for ever,\\" said one netizen, echoing the feelings of many who watched his dramatic exit. As Liu struggled down the track, he stopped at the last hurdle and kissed it, prompting the China Daily newspaper to dub that his ''last kiss''. He was then embraced by fellow competitors and helped off the track. ''He may not have cleared any of the hurdles, but he crossed the most difficult hurdle of his life,'' the official People's Daily newspaper wrote, paying tribute to Liu's persistence. Liu Xiang left the track in a wheelchair, after an Olympic build-up that had also been overshadowed by injury. He left London for Leverkusen after pulling out of the Diamond League London Grand Prix 110m hurdles final on 13 July - his 29th birthday - due to muscle pain. Reports said that Liu's right heel was protected with tape when he entered the stadium on Tuesday. After the race, Feng Shuyong, the head of China's track team told a press conference that Liu had ruptured his Achilles tendon. \\"What Liu Xiang did today reflected the true Olympics spirit,\\" state media quoted him as saying. \\"Winning is not so important, participation is what matters.\\" Liu Yandong, a top Communist Party official, had called Liu to ''express sympathy and concern'', state media reported. The official told Liu that ''his spirit, will and attitude have deeply moved and highly inspired the whole nation\\", said the Xinhua news agency. Some netizens questioned why Liu, who is one of China's top sporting icons, was competing despite his injuries. \\"Liu Xiang was carrying too heavy a burden. Chinese sports officials know nothing about the Olympic spirit. For them, athletes are just machines and pawns,\\" one comment said. Among the outpouring of support, there were a handful of negative comments and allegations against the athlete, who is easily one of China's best-known faces, with a slew of product endorsements. Some lambasted him for failing to do his duty by his country. But by and large, the Chinese people's reactions reflected a level of maturity and compassion within society, said a commentary in the Chinese edition of the Global Times newspaper. ''Thank you, Liu Xiang, for all that you've given us,\\" it said.","completion":"Liu Xiang, a gold-winning athlete from the 2004 Athens Olympics, faced a tragic repeat of his 2008 Beijing Games accident when he crashed at the first hurdle, garnering an outpouring of support and concern from fans and fellow competitors."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

He has a crush on his next door neighbor, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), who is also one of the few classmates who is nice to him. Her boyfriend, Flash (Joe Manganiello) and his buddies pick on him. Peter's only friend is Harry Osborn (James Franco), who, though rich and good-looking, is similarly an outcast. Harry, however, is somewhat jealous of the affection his father, Norman (Willem Dafoe) shows Peter. Norman, the head of weapons contractor Oscorp, appreciates Peter's scientific aptitude and can barely conceal his desire that Peter was his own son.Peter's science class takes a field trip to a genetics laboratory at Columbia University. The lab works on spiders and has even managed to create new species of spiders through genetic manipulation and combination. While Peter is taking photographs of Mary Jane for the school newspaper, one of these new spiders lands on his hand and bites him. Peter comes home feeling ill and immediately goes to bed. At the genetic level, the venom injected by the spider bite begins to work strange magic on Peter. Meanwhile, General Slocum (Stanley Anderson) visits Oscorp to see the results of their new super soldier formula. When one of Norman's top scientists, Dr. Stromm (Ron Perkins) warns him the formula is unstable, General Slocum threatens to pull all of the military's funding from Oscorp. Later that night, Norman exposes himself to the formula. He gains superhuman strength and agility but is driven insane. He kills Stromm and steals two other Oscorp inventions, an exoskeleton and jet glider.Peter wakes up the next morning feeling better than ever. He also learns his scrawny physique now ripples with muscles and his eyesight is perfect. At school that day, he learns he can shoot webs out of spinnerettes in his wrists.

Much to the annoyance of Colonel Robinson, von Papen survives and the Russians that his agent provocateur was trying to frame have solid alibis, forcing him to turn to another scheme to inflame Turkey's traditional rivalry with Russia. Meanwhile, American machinery salesman Joe Barton boards the Baghdad-Istanbul Express train at Aleppo and is attracted to another passenger, Ana Remzi. She is worried about being searched by customs agents once they reach the Turkish border; she asks Joe to hold on to an envelope containing some securities, all that remains of her inheritance. Joe obliges, but when he later examines the envelope, he finds maps of Turkey with writing on them. When they stop in Ankara, he goes to her hotel to return her property, only to find she has been fatally wounded. He hides when someone else approaches the room. He watches unobserved as Soviet spy Nikolai Zaleshoff searches the dead woman's luggage. Then, Joe exits through the window. Leaving the scene, he is seen by Tamara Zaleshoff, Nikolai's sister and partner in espionage. The Turkish police take Joe in for questioning, only it turns out that they are German agents. They take him to their leader, Colonel Robinson. Robinson wants the maps. Joe refuses to cooperate, and is taken away to be interrogated by Mailler. Before the Germans get very far, Joe is rescued by Nikolai. When the Zaleshoffs reveal that they are Soviet agents, Joe agrees to fetch them the documents.

Bank customers of NatWest bank in Ipswich, England ducked for cover on Friday as a protective seagull swooped towards people as they approached the bank entrance, local news outlet the Ipswich Star reports. According to the report, a baby seagull fell from its nest overnight and was resting near the door of the bank before eventually making its way to a safer location. Fortunately, a spokesperson for the bank reported that the baby chick did survive the fall and was not removed from its natural habitat. To protect customers, a bak employee escorted people to and from the entrance using one of the best bird defensive mechanisms available: an umbrella. A spokesperson for the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA) told the Ipswich Star that in some cases it's better to leave the animal with its natural parents instead of taking it into captivity.

Necessities comprise urgent situations like medical bills, crucial home repairs or putting food on the table. Wants, on the other hand, are things like vacations, luxury items or entertainment. Keep in mind that borrowing money for wants might strain a friendship and potentially lead to uncomfortable scenarios. After you've conducted a proper self-examination of your financial situation, you must come up with a realistic plan to repay. Building a concrete payment schedule consists of calculating how much you can afford to pay back each month. Factor in your income, expenses, and potential changes in circumstances. Remember, your friend's kindness shouldn't become a burden; you need to ensure that you’re in a position to repay the loan in a reasonable time frame. Communication is paramount throughout the entire process. If you decide to approach your friend, plot out the conversation in advance. Explain your circumstance honestly and why you have come to them. Yet, make sure to give them ample space to consider their decision without any influence - it's important to remember not to force or guilt them into it. Just as with any financial decision, the language you use to communicate your need for the loan should be precise and clear-cut. It's advisable to steer clear of vague languages, rather opt for clear statements about the amount needed, the reason for borrowing, and your solid plan to repay the loan. Keep everything from terms, conditions, interest (if any), and repayment schedule in writing. Documenting the loan agreement is a step that protects both parties involved. With everything in black and white, there are fewer chances of misunderstandings that could lead to hurt feelings or ruin relationships. Ultimately, borrow responsibly. Always remember that, while borrowing from a friend may not come with the financial fees that a bank might charge, it does have the potential cost of a relationship. Hence, demonstrating respect and professionalism throughout the entire process is a must. Make it your absolute priority to avoid any scenarios that could evoke stress, misunderstandings, or damage to your friendship."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Is Estonia is situated in the northern part of the temperate climate zone and in the transition zone between maritime and continental climate. a good answer to this question? Pick from: a). yes b). no","completion":"b). no While the given answer is partially correct, it can be elaborated and improved for better clarity and understanding. Here is a more detailed and long answer to the question: Estonia, a country located in Northern Europe, primarily resides within the northern part of the temperate climate zone. Geographically, it is situated between latitudes 57° and 60° North and longitudes 21° and 29° East, which places it in the overlap area between the maritime and continental climates. This unique location results in distinct variations in the region's climate characteristics. The temperate climate zone, which Estonia lies in, is generally characterized by moderate temperatures—neither exceedingly hot nor excessively cold—making it a comfortable region for human habitation. Though Estonia's climate primarily falls within this zone, its specific positioning also exposes it to influences from both the Atlantic Ocean and the colder Eurasian landmass, accounting for the climate's transitional nature between maritime and continental conditions. The country's maritime climate influence, primarily from the Baltic Sea, leads to relatively mild, wet winters with stable temperatures. Oceanic influences also result in moderate summers, with occasional rainfall and generally pleasant conditions. However, Estonia's position on the eastern boundary of this maritime climate zone exposes it to the effects of the colder continental climate, which can cause rapid and sudden weather fluctuations. This climatic duality is particularly evident during the transition between seasons, where the weather tends to be more unpredictable. In conclusion, Estonia resides in the northern part of the temperate climate zone while experiencing a unique transitional climate due to its location between maritime and continental climate zones. This results in a range of weather patterns and conditions that embody influences from both maritime and continental sources, contributing to the diverse and interesting climate of the region."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Q:This is a correct answer to the following question about List of Presidents of the United States. Yes or no? Answer: Since the ratification of the Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution in 1951, no person may be elected President more than twice, and no one who has served more than two years of a term to which someone else was elected may be elected more than once. Question: how many presidents of the us A:","completion":"Your question seems to be incomplete, but based on what you provided, I assume that you want to know either 'how many presidents of the United States there have been' or 'how many times a person can be elected as President of the United States'. If you're asking about the total number of US presidents, as of 2021 there have been 46 presidencies, which have been served by 45 different individuals. Grover Cleveland served two non-consecutive terms and therefore is counted twice, as the 22nd and the 24th president. If you're asking about how many times a person can be elected as President of the United States, as per the Twenty-second amendment to the United States Constitution, a person can be elected to the office of the President only twice. In addition, a person who has already served more than two years of a term to which someone else was originally elected, can only be elected to the presidency once. This amendment was ratified in 1951 to ensure that no single individual could hold the presidency indefinitely, offering a response to Franklin D. Roosevelt's four terms in office. It's also worth noting that, while the amendment places restrictions on being elected to the presidency more than twice, it does not restrict a person from serving as President for more than two terms. For instance, if a Vice President or another official assumes the presidency for less than two years of someone else's term (due to the original president's death, resignation, or removal from office), they can still be elected president twice in their own right.

This is because the question suggests a connection between moving up and down and the flow of current. In an electrical circuit, the flow of current is controlled by switches, which, as mentioned, can be moved up for \\"on\\" and down for \\"off\\". This is a crucial aspect of electronic devices, allowing users to control the power and functioning of the device. An electrical circuit is composed of components such as resistors, capacitors, inductors, and diodes, which are connected together to perform specific functions such as amplification, filtering, or voltage regulation. Circuits can be designed in various configurations or topologies, such as series, parallel, or a combination of both. The primary goal of the circuit is to control the flow of electric current through the components in a desired and predictable way. In contrast, the other answer choices do not directly relate to the flow of current being moved up and down. For example: 1. An electrical storm refers to a natural phenomenon that involves the development of lightning and thunder, which is not controlled by human intervention such as moving a switch up or down. 2. Veins and arteries are part of the circulatory system and are responsible for carrying blood throughout the body, not electrical currents. 3. The mouth of rivers refers to the point where a river meets an ocean, sea, or lake. It is not related to the flow of electrical current. 4. A short circuit occurs when an unintended low-resistance path in a circuit is formed, causing a large amount of current to flow through the path. This can lead to dangerous situations, such as electrical fires. 5. Circulatory systems transport nutrients, gases, and waste throughout an organism's body. They do not relate to electrical current. 6. Bad wiring refers to poor electrical connections or malfunctioning components, which can lead to electrical hazards. However, it does not directly pertain to the concept of moving current up and down. 7. A hydraulic system uses fluid power to transmit energy and perform work. While it may involve the movement of fluid in various directions, it is not directly related to the flow of electrical current. Hence, considering the given information and context surrounding the question, \\"an electrical circuit\\" remains the most appropriate answer choice regarding the flow of current being moved up and down."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: Blood vessels help regulate body processes by either constricting (becoming narrower) or dilating (becoming wider). These actions occur in response to signals from the autonomic nervous system or the endocrine system. Constriction occurs when the muscular walls of blood vessels contract. This reduces the amount of blood that can flow through the vessels (see Figure below ). Dilation occurs when the walls relax. This increases blood flows through the vessels. I am facing a new situation today: Greg is a physician working for the city hospital. Today he is seeing two patients, patient A and patient B. He noticed that patient A's blood vessels are constricted, but blood vessels of patient B are dilated. He needs to prescribe medicine according to his observation.

Answer:","completion":"Based on the information from the background article, patient B's blood vessels would be wider than patient A's. This is because patient B's blood vessels are dilated, which means the walls of the blood vessels are relaxed, resulting in an increase in blood flow through the vessels.

Tuesday, September 11, 2001, dawned temperate and nearly cloudless in the eastern United States. Millions of men and women readied themselves for work. Some made their way to the Twin Towers, the signature structures of the World Trade Center complex in New York City. Others went to Arlington, Virginia, to the Pentagon. Across the Potomac River, the United States Congress was back in session. At the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, people began to line up for a White House tour. In Sarasota, Florida, President George W. Bush went for an early morning run. For those heading to an airport, weather conditions could not have been better for a safe and pleasant journey. Among the travelers were Mohamed Atta and Abdul Aziz al Omari, who arrived at the airport in Portland, Maine. Boston: American 11 and United 175. Atta and Omari boarded a 6:00 A.M. flight from Portland to Boston's Logan International Airport. When he checked in for his flight to Boston, Atta was selected by a computerized prescreening system known as CAPPS (Computer Assisted Passenger Prescreening System), created to identify passengers who should be subject to special security measures. Under security rules in place at the time, the only consequence of Atta's selection by CAPPS was that his checked bags were held off the plane until it was confirmed that he had boarded the aircraft. This did not hinder Atta's plans. Atta and Omari arrived in Boston at 6:45. Seven minutes later, Atta apparently took a call from Marwan al Shehhi, a longtime colleague who was at another terminal at Logan Airport. They spoke for three minutes.

(CNN) -- The defense and prosecution were hammering out a plea deal Tuesday in the court-martial of Brig. Gen. Jeffrey Sinclair, but no matter what the negotiations hold, the defense says three things are off the table. First, Sinclair won't plead guilty to sexual assault, said Josh Zeitz, a spokesman for the general's defense team. Nor will he plead guilty to any charge that will land him on a sex-offender registry. And lastly, Zeitz said, Sinclair will not plead guilty to threatening his accuser or her family. No developments are expected Tuesday or Wednesday, and Zeitz said the negotiations could last for weeks. Col. James Pohl, the judge in the case, dismissed the jury \\"for the time being\\" Tuesday morning to return to their duty stations, a spokeswoman for Fort Bragg in North Carolina said. On Monday, a day when Sinclair's accuser was slated to continue her testimony from Friday, Pohl dismissed the jury because of 22 pages of e-mails that emerged over the weekend. The e-mails include a January communication in which a senior military lawyer wrote Fort Bragg's chief of military justice casting doubt on the credibility of Sinclair's accuser and a February correspondence in which a lieutenant colonel with the Judge Advocate General's Corps asked for a colonel's \\"thoughts/opinion\\" on Sinclair's offer to enter a plea. Pohl indicated there may have been \\"undue command influence\\" by Pentagon officials. While Pohl would not grant the defense's request to drop charges against Sinclair, he ordered that the general be provided a possible plea deal, in addition to several other options.

Read this: The onset of symptoms in myocardial infarction (MI) is usually gradual, over several minutes, and rarely instantaneous. Chest pain is the most common symptom of acute MI and is often described as a sensation of tightness, pressure, or squeezing. Chest pain due to ischemia (a lack of blood and hence oxygen supply) of the heart muscle is termed angina pectoris. Pain radiates most often to the left arm, but may also radiate to the lower jaw, neck, right arm, back, and upper abdomen, where it may mimic heartburn. Levine's sign, in which a person localizes the chest pain by clenching their fists over their sternum, has classically been thought to be predictive of cardiac chest pain, although a prospective observational study showed it had a poor positive predictive value.

Question: Generate a question that has the following answer: zombies for the following movie plot: The film opens as Rose (Brooke Adams) is found drifting alone in a small rowboat. Two fishermen find the dinghy and pull her onto their boat, barely alive and in a horrible state. Her voiceover indicates she had been rescued from some terrifying experience. The film's events are flashbacks.Rose is seen previously as part of a small group of tourists aboard a small commercial pleasure boat. The Captain (John Carradine) seems to be having trouble with the boat. His mate, Chuck (Fred Buch), seems to share a mutual attraction with Rose. Also on board are Dobbs (Don Stout), who is the boat's cook; Keith (Luke Halpin), another tourist; and a bickering married couple named Norman (Jack Davidson) and Beverly (D.J. Sidney).After some trouble with the engine, the Captain and Chuck are faced with the fact that their navigation system is going haywire after they encounter a strange orange haze. The others sense that something is wrong and that they may be lost at sea. Norman in particular becomes very whiny about it, insulting the Captain and being generally abrasive to everyone. In the darkness of night, a hulking ship suddenly appears and brushes up alongside their boat, damaging it. The Captain sends up a flare, which momentarily lights up the eerie sight of a huge, rotting vessel wrecked nearby.The next morning, everyone wakes up to find the Captain missing. Realizing the boat is slowly taking on water, everyone evacuates in the lifeboat and makes for a nearby island. They also see the huge wreck in the light of day; it appears to have been there for decades, nothing more than a skeletal framework, and now seemingly immobile, stranded on the island's reef. The group is startled to find the body of the Captain, apparently drowned while he was trying to check the underside of the boat for damage.

Lordi was a major hype and revelation in 2007 because they won the Eurovision Song Contest with a (not-so-heavy) metal song called \\"Hard Rock Hallelujah\\" and appeared on stage dressed like hideous monsters. But, let's face it, their victory most likely had very little to do with their great musical talents. The Eurovision contest gradually turned into one big political circus over the years and Lordi probably just won because their song finally brought a little change and  even more importantly - because their whole act sort of ingeniously spoofed the whole annual event. The absolute last thing Lordi's first (and hopefully last) horror film brings is change and ingenuity. \\"Dark Floors\\", based on an idea of the lead singer and starring the rest of the band in supportive roles, is a truly unimaginative and hopeless accumulation of clichés. The immense budget (\\"Dark Floors\\" supposedly is the most expensive Finnish film ever) definitely assures greatly macabre set pieces and impressive make-up art, but what's the point where there's no story that is worth telling? The film takes is set in a busy hospital where a bunch of people, among them a father and his young daughter with an unidentifiable illness, become trapped in the elevator during a power breakdown. When the doors open again, the floors are empty and it looks as if the hospital lies abandoned since many years already. Trying to reach the exit, the group stumbles upon several morbid and inexplicable obstacles, like eyeless corpses, screaming ghosts and Heavy Metal monsters emerging from the floors. The only three points I'm handing out to \\"Dark Floors\\" are exclusively intended for the scenery and the adequate tension building during the first half of the film. For as long as the sinister events don't require an explanation, the atmosphere is quite creepy, but as soon as you realize the explanation will a) be very stupid or b) never come, the wholesome just collapses like an unstable house of cards. Lordi's costumes never really were scary to begin with (except maybe to traditional Eurovision fans) and, in combination with a story more reminiscent to Asian ghost-horror, they just look downright pathetic and misfit. With all the national myths and truly unique exterior filming locations, I personally always presumed Finland  The Land of a Thousand Lakes  would be the ideal breeding ground for potentially horrific horror tales, but I guess that's another disillusion on my account.

Let's analyze the situation in detail. In the scenario described, there are two main objects: 1. A bag of flour 2. A sack of potatoes The position of these objects is that the sack of potatoes has been placed above the bag of flour. Consequently, this makes the access to the bag of flour restricted because the sack of potatoes is blocking it. As a result, in order to access or move the bag of flour, one must first move the sack of potatoes out of the way. Doing so clears the pathway and grants easier access to the bag of flour. This indicates that the sack of potatoes must be moved before the bag of flour can be moved. In conclusion, the statement \\"The bag of flour had to be moved first\\" is incorrect based on the given information, as the proper sequence of actions would be to move the sack of potatoes first and then proceed with moving the bag of flour. This ensures that the objects are moved without creating any unnecessary complications, like potential damage or spills caused by attempting to access the flour without properly addressing the obstacle imposed by the sack of potatoes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Living among the foliage are the brown Bar-ba-Loots, who eat truffula fruit from the local trees. In the nearby pond live the Humming Fish, and overhead fly the Swomee Swans. The trees amaze the Once-ler with their texture and scent, and he soon builds a small shop in the area. After cutting down a truffula tree, the Lorax pops out of it's stump. The Lorax claims to speak for the trees, and demands to know what the Once-ler is doing. The Once-ler explains that he is using the truffula tree's tufts to make something called a Thneed...a fine thing that all people need.The multi-purpose item soon attracts the attention of many customers, and the Once-ler continues to cut down more truffula trees. When it seems that the business is growing too big for just one Once-ler, he calls his relatives to help him with his thriving business.The business keeps growing and growing, until finally the Lorax demands an audience with the Once-ler, explaining that with the number of trees having been cleared, the Bar-ba-Loots have run out of truffula fruits, and have left to find new sources of food.The Once-ler ignores this, but is then met by the Lorax again, who explains that the smog from the factories has overwhelmed the Swomee Swans.

Question: A person takes a deep breath and wants to know if the air outside their lungs is stronger than the air outside. The air outside the body, compared to the air in their chest, when they have a large chest, will be higher or lower? Text: During inhalation, because the chest volume is larger, the air pressure inside the lungs is lower than the air pressure outside. Answer:","completion":"Based on the given text, when a person takes a deep breath, the chest volume increases, which results in a decrease in air pressure inside the lungs as compared to the air pressure outside. The text states that during inhalation, the air pressure inside the lungs is lower than the air pressure outside because of the larger chest volume. To clarify further, the human body uses the principles of atmospheric pressure and pressure differences to inhale and exhale air. When we inhale, our diaphragm and intercostal muscles contract, resulting in an increase in the volume of our chest cavity. According to Boyle's law, the relationship between pressure and volume is inversely proportional, meaning that when the volume increases, pressure decreases. In this scenario, the person has taken a deep breath, and their chest volume has become larger. Consequently, the pressure inside their lungs has dropped. The air outside the body is now at a higher pressure as compared to the pressure inside the lungs. This pressure difference causes the air to flow from a region of high pressure (outside the body) to a region of low pressure (inside the lungs) until equilibrium is reached. Therefore, when the person in question takes a deep breath and has a large chest, the air pressure outside their body is higher than the air pressure inside their chest cavity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He noticed that in his own state a lake near agricultural lands has been declared as a dead zone. For his study Greg labeled this zone as zone A. Then he found near a national park in his state a lake is not declared as a dead zone. To further his study he labeled this zone as zone B. and a hint : Rain dissolves fertilizer in the soil. Runoff carries it away. The fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, from ponds to oceans. Nitrogen is a fertilizer in the water. Since there is a lot of nitrogen, it causes algae to grow out of control. Pictured below is a pond covered with algae ( Figure below ). Algae use up carbon dioxide in the water. After the algae die, decomposers break down the dead tissue. The decomposers use up all the oxygen in the water. This creates a dead zone. A dead zone is an area in a body of water where nothing grows because there is too little oxygen. There is a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico ( Figure below ). The U.S. states outlined on the map have rivers that drain into the Gulf of Mexico. The rivers drain vast agricultural lands. The water carries fertilizer from these areas into the Gulf. Please answer this question : Would zone A have less or more oxygen than zone B? A:","completion":"Zone A would have less oxygen than Zone B. This is because Zone A is classified as a dead zone, which is an area in a body of water where nothing grows due to low oxygen levels. The agricultural lands near Zone A contribute to this issue, as rain dissolves fertilizers rich in nitrogen from the soil, and runoff carries them into the water body. The excess nitrogen promotes the overgrowth of algae, which consume carbon dioxide. When the algae die, decomposers break down the dead tissue and use up all the oxygen in the water, creating a dead zone. On the other hand, Zone B is not classified as a dead zone and is situated near a national park, where there is likely less human impact and agricultural runoff.

The crew spotted particles of ammonia drifting away from the laboratory on Thursday.

A spacewalk might be needed to inspect and fix the site of the leak. The seepage is coming from the station's port side, at the far end of the backbone, or truss, structure that holds one of the laboratory's huge sets of solar arrays.

Does the sentence \\"Treaties formed an important part of European colonization and, in many parts of the world, Europeans attempted to legitimize their sovereignty by signing treaties with indigenous peoples.\\" answer the question \\"What formed an important part of European colonization?\\"","completion":"Yes, the sentence \\"Treaties formed an important part of European colonization and, in many parts of the world, Europeans attempted to legitimize their sovereignty by signing treaties with indigenous peoples.\\" answers the question \\"What formed an important part of European colonization?\\" The sentence explicitly states that treaties were an important part of European colonization. It goes a step further by explaining that these treaties were used as a tool for legitimizing European sovereignty in various territories around the world. Europeans sought to establish their authority by signing treaties with indigenous peoples who were already residing in those lands. In order to delve deeper into why treaties played such a pivotal role in European colonization, let's examine the process and objectives. European colonization began in the late 15th century with the Age of Discovery, which was driven by technological advancements in navigation. The primary goal of this period was to explore and secure direct sea routes to Asia for products like spices and silk, bypassing the traditional land routes. As European nations ventured into the unknown world, they encountered numerous indigenous societies with whom they came into contact. As Europeans continued their exploration and expansion, the need to establish order and control over the newly discovered territories became evident. Colonizers sought to achieve this by forming treaties with indigenous peoples. These treaties served various purposes, such as ensuring the safety and security of European settlements, obtaining rights to resources and land, and asserting political control in the region. Many European countries, such as Britain, Spain, France, and the Netherlands, made extensive use of treaties to help achieve their colonial aims. For example, the British Crown signed numerous treaties with Native American tribes during the colonization of North America. These treaties often entailed territorial cessions by the indigenous peoples, establishing military alliances, and creating trading relationships. The Treaty of Waitangi, signed in 1840 between Britain and Māori chiefs of New Zealand, is another notable example. However, it is essential to note that not all treaties were fair or just, and the indigenous peoples' perspectives were often overlooked or misrepresented in these agreements. In many cases, Europeans used a combination of coercion, deception, and outright force to impose their will on indigenous peoples. As a result, treaties, while central to the European colonization process, have left a complicated and, at times, painful legacy. In conclusion, the sentence answers the question by identifying treaties as a vital part of European colonization. It further clarifies that Europeans used these treaties to legitimize their sovereignty, create relationships with indigenous peoples, extract resources, and control territories. The use of treaties, however, was not always fair or just, resulting in a complex legacy that still impacts many societies today."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

News article: Donald Trump Donald John TrumpHouse Democrat slams Donald Trump Jr. for ‘serious case of amnesia’ after testimony Skier Lindsey Vonn: I don’t want to represent Trump at Olympics Poll: 4 in 10 Republicans think senior Trump advisers had improper dealings with Russia MORE is done being nice. The president on Thursday night gave an ultimatum to House conservatives, telling them he’ll leave ObamaCare in place unless they get on board with White House-backed legislation to repeal and replace the seven-year-old healthcare law. At a dramatic closed-door House Republican Conference meeting, Trump’s budget director, Mick Mulvaney, delivered the message to rank-and-file Republicans: After weeks of talks, Trump is done negotiating the bill and wants a vote on Friday, according to a source in the room. ADVERTISEMENT The House had been set to vote Thursday on the American Health Care Act (AHCA), but the vote was delayed after Trump and leadership couldn’t corral the necessary 216 GOP votes. If the vote fails Friday, Mulvaney warned, Trump will move on to other priorities like tax reform, and ObamaCare will stay as the law of the land. Mulvaney attended the Thursday night meeting in the basement of the Capitol along with White House chief of staff Reince Priebus and top Trump aides Stephen Bannon and Kellyanne Conway. But Mulvaney was the messenger. That’s because Mulvaney, the Tea Party favorite from South Carolina, was a co-founder of the far-right House Freedom Caucus that Trump and GOP leaders believe is standing in the way of passage. The Trump officials didn’t stay long. Shortly after delivering the message, Mulvaney, Priebus and Bannon stormed out of the room. Asked what their message was, Bannon told The Hill: “Vote.” Once the White House officials left, several House members lined up to speak at the microphones to rally support for passage. Freshman Rep. Brian Mast (R-Fla.), an Army veteran who lost his legs in the Afghanistan War, called on his colleagues to come together to defeat ObamaCare. “I’d like to think I know a little something about battle,” Mast said as the room erupted in a standing ovation, sources in the room said. “This was almost like one of those classic scenes in football movies where they kick the coaches out and the players start talking with one another. It might as well been ‘Remember the Titans,’ ” said longtime Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.). “This is about the members. This is about the team players. This isn’t about the coaches,” he said. “This is about whether we can play together and win.” Rep. Chris Collins (R-N.Y.), a close Trump ally, confirmed the Trump administration's message after the meeting. “There are no more negotiations,” Collins told reporters. \\"We have to have a vote tomorrow. He expects it to pass, but he's moving on if for some reason it didn't.\\" The developments set up a likely vote on the rule on Friday morning and a vote on the measure later that afternoon. Dozens of centrist and conservative Republicans have vowed to oppose the bill, putting them in direct conflict with their new president. With all House Democrats expected to vote against the bill, the GOP can afford only 22 defections. Freedom Caucus leaders, including Chairman Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), have been demanding additional changes to the health bill, specifically the repeal of ObamaCare’s 10 essential health benefits and the law's Title 1 regulations. Those regulations include the rule that bans insurers from denying coverage to people with preexisting conditions. These changes, conservatives argue, will lower premium costs. But Trump has only been willing to offer repeal of the essential health benefits, which includes maternity care, pediatric services, hospitalization and prescription drugs, among other things. Leaving a Freedom Caucus meeting in Rep. Jim Jordan's (R-Ohio) office late Thursday night, Meadows declined to comment on his position. An amendment will be released Thursday night that would repeal the essential health benefits and also add 15 billion to the AHCA's Patient and State Stability Fund. The 15 billion will go toward mental health and maternity coverage, which will be paid for by keeping ObamaCare's 0.9 percent Medicare tax on high earners for six years. But the effect of the Trump ultimatum on the vote remains to be seen. Many of the critics of the bill said they’re still opposed, including Rep. Charlie Dent (R-Pa.), who heads the Tuesday Group of centrist Republicans. Meadows said the roughly 40-member Freedom Caucus would hold an emergency meeting Thursday night to digest what transpired in the meeting, but added: “I'm still a no.” Rep. Louie Gohmert Louis (Louie) Buller GohmertThis week: Congress seeks to avoid a shutdown Lawmakers call on Treasury to take tougher stance on Hamas in Qatar Colbert spoofs Louie Gohmert's Uranium One chart MORE (R-Texas) said the inclusion of repealing ObamaCare's minimum insurance coverage requirements — at the Freedom Caucus’s request — wasn't enough to win his vote. But he also said lawmakers were so energized by Thursday night’s meeting that he doubts the bill will fail. \\"I’m rather broken-hearted right now,\\" Gohmert told The Hill. \\"There’s too many federal aspects to this that remain in place that appear to make it pretty well certain it’s going to be here for the rest of this country’s life. That means I can’t get there.\\" Failure of the bill on the House floor would be a humiliation for GOP leaders, raising questions about their ability to govern effectively given that they control the White House and both chambers of Congress. Trump himself has said for months that the safest course for the Republicans, politically, would be to do nothing and let ObamaCare collapse on itself. And many Republicans on Capitol Hill feel the same way. “Politically, the smart thing for us to do would be to just say, ‘OK, we won’t do anything, we’ll just let ObamaCare fail. If we think it’s imploding … then let it implode.’ And then we’ll step in and rescue,” said Rep. Mike Simpson (R-Idaho), a supporter of the bill. “That would be the politically smart thing to do,” he added. “It’s not the right thing to do, though.” After huddling with rank-and-file members, Speaker Paul Ryan Paul Davis RyanMcConnell names Senate GOP tax conferees House Republican: 'I worry about both sides' of the aisle on DACA Overnight Health Care: 3.6M signed up for ObamaCare in first month | Ryan pledges 'entitlement reform' next year | Dems push for more money to fight opioids MORE (R-Wis.) went to the microphones in the Capitol basement, where he made a brief statement. He did not make any predictions about the fate of the bill. “For seven-and-a-half years, we have been promising the American people that we will repeal and replace this broken law, because it’s collapsing and it’s failing families,” Ryan said. “And tomorrow we’re proceeding.” This story was updated at 11:23 p.m. ||||| Rep.

Steve Stivers, R-Ohio, talks to a reporters as he leaves the office of House Speaker Paul Ryan on Capitol Hill in Washington, Thursday, March 23, 2017, after a meeting with other Republicans to rally support for GOP's long-promised legislation to repeal and replace \\"Obamacare\\" as it moves toward... (Associated Press) WASHINGTON (AP) — Abandoning negotiations, President Donald Trump demanded a make-or-break vote on health care legislation in the House, threatening to leave \\"Obamacare\\" in place and move on to other issues if Friday's vote fails. The risky move, part gamble and part threat, was presented to GOP lawmakers behind closed doors Thursday night after a long and intense day that saw a planned vote on the health care bill scrapped as the legislation remained short of votes amid cascading negotiations among conservative lawmakers, moderates and others. At the end of it the president had had enough and was ready to vote and move on, whatever the result, Trump's budget director Mick Mulvaney told lawmakers. \\"'Negotiations are over, we'd like to vote tomorrow and let's get this done for the American people.' That was it,\\" Rep. Duncan Hunter of California said as he left the meeting, summarizing Mulvaney's message to lawmakers. \\"Let's vote,\\" White House chief strategist Steve Bannon said as he walked out. \\"For seven and a half years we have been promising the American people that we will repeal and replace this broken law because it's collapsing and it's failing families, and tomorrow we're proceeding,\\" House Speaker Paul Ryan said, then walked off without answering as reporters demanded to know whether the bill had the votes to pass. The outcome of Friday's vote was impossible to predict. Both conservative and moderate lawmakers had claimed the bill lacked votes after a long day of talks. But the White House appeared ready to gamble that the prospect of failing to repeal former President Barack Obama's health law, after seven years of promising to do exactly that, would force lawmakers into the \\"yes\\" column. \\"It's done tomorrow. Or 'Obamacare' stays,\\" said Rep. Chris Collins, R-N.Y., a top Trump ally in the House. Collins was among those predicting success on Friday, but others didn't hide their anxiety about the outcome. Asked whether Republicans would be unified on Friday's vote, freshman Rep Matt Gaetz of Florida said, \\"I sure hope so, or we'll have the opportunity to watch a unified Democratic caucus impeach Donald Trump in two years when we lose the majority.\\" One announcement after Thursday's meeting moved things the wrong way for Trump. Freshman Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., stated he would oppose the bill, saying, \\"I cannot support anything less than a clean repeal of Obamacare.\\" Thursday's maneuvers added up to high drama on Capitol Hill, but Friday promised even more suspense with the prospect of leadership putting a major bill on the floor uncertain about whether it would pass or fail. The Republican legislation would halt Obama's tax penalties against people who don't buy coverage and cut the federal-state Medicaid program for low earners, which the Obama statute had expanded. It would provide tax credits to help people pay medical bills, though generally skimpier than Obama's statute provides. It also would allow insurers to charge older Americans more and repeal tax boosts the law imposed on high-income people and health industry companies. The measure would also block federal payments to Planned Parenthood for a year, another stumbling block for GOP moderates. In a concession to the conservative House Freedom Caucus, many of whose members have withheld support, the legislation would repeal requirements for insurers to cover \\"essential health benefits\\" such as maternity care and substance abuse treatment. The drama unfolded seven years to the day after Obama signed his landmark law, an anniversary GOP leaders meant to celebrate with a vote to undo the divisive legislation. \\"Obamacare\\" gave birth to the tea party movement and helped Republicans win and keep control of Congress and then take the White House. Instead, as GOP leaders were forced to delay the vote Thursday, C-SPAN filled up the time playing footage of Obama signing the Affordable Care Act. In a danger sign for Republicans, a Quinnipiac University poll found that people disapprove of the GOP legislation by 56 percent to 17 percent, with 26 percent undecided. Trump's handling of health care was viewed unfavorably by 6 in 10. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., who as speaker was Obama's crucial lieutenant in passing the Democratic bill in the first place, couldn't resist a dig at the GOP disarray. \\"You may be a great negotiator,\\" she said of Trump. \\"Rookie's error for bringing this up on a day when clearly you're not ready.\\" Obama declared in a statement that \\"America is stronger\\" because of the current law and said Democrats must make sure \\"any changes will make our health care system better, not worse for hardworking Americans.\\" Trump tweeted to supporters, \\"Go with our plan! Call your Rep & let them know.\\" Unlike Obama and Pelosi when they passed Obamacare, the Republicans had failed to build an outside constituency or coalition to support their bill. Instead, medical professionals, doctors and hospitals — major employers in some districts — as well as the AARP and other influential consumer groups were nearly unanimously opposed. So were outside conservative groups who argued the bill didn't go far enough. The Chamber of Commerce was in favor. Moderates were given pause by projections of 24 million Americans losing coverage in a decade and higher out-of-pocket costs for many low-income and older people, as predicted by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. In an updated analysis Thursday, the CBO said late changes to the bill meant to win over reluctant lawmakers would cut beneficial deficit reduction in half, while failing to cover more people. And, House members were mindful that the bill, even if passed by the House, faces a tough climb in the Senate. ___ Associated Press reporters Alan Fram, Kevin Freking, Ken Thomas and Matthew Daly contributed to this report. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","completion":"President Donald Trump has issued an ultimatum to House conservatives, warning that he will leave ObamaCare in place unless they support White House-backed legislation to repeal and replace the healthcare law.

To both the Anti-Federalists and the Federalists, the very word \\"national\\" was a cause for alarm because of the experience under the British crown. During the debate over the establishment clause, Rep. Elbridge Gerry of Massachusetts took issue with Madison's language regarding whether the government was a national or federal government (in which the states retained their individual sovereignty), which Baker suggests compelled Madison to withdraw his language from the debate.

Would \\"\\"Give me liberty, or give me death!\\" is a quotation attributed to Patrick Henry from a speech he made to the Virginia Convention .\\" be a reasonable answer? Choose from: * No; * Yes;","completion":"Yes, the phrase \\"Give me liberty, or give me death!\\" is indeed attributed to Patrick Henry, and he made this statement during a speech at the Virginia Convention in 1775. Your answer accurately identifies the source of the quote and provides relevant contextual information. Patrick Henry was a Founding Father and a prominent figure during the American Revolution. The speech took place on March 23, 1775, at St. John's Church in Richmond, Virginia, which was serving as a temporary meeting place for the convention. The objective of this gathering was to discuss the deteriorating relationship between the American colonies and the British Crown. In his speech, Patrick Henry argued that the colonists were entitled to their liberties and that they should be prepared to fight for them. He passionately urged the Virginia House of Burgesses (the colonial assembly) to take up arms and join the emerging rebellion against British rule, insisting that a militia should be formed in every county of Virginia. Henry's speech was a call to action for the colonists who were facing oppressive British policies. The phrase \\"Give me liberty, or give me death!\\" encapsulates the energy, determination, and commitment he put forth in rallying support for the American cause. His impassioned words resonated with those in attendance and contributed to the growing sense of urgency in the pursuit of colonial resistance. Patrick Henry's words continue to be remembered as one of the most powerful and iconic phrases in American history. The sentiment behind them represents the importance of freedom and the willingness to risk everything in the struggle for liberty.

On the other hand, Kettle Foods supplied non-GMO potato seeds to their farmers. They wanted to see how customers react to their non-GMO products, mostly chips. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which company's potatoes would be more herbicide tolerant, PepsiCo or Kettle Foods? Hint: Genetically modified organisms (GMO) are organisms whose genetic material has been altered by genetic engineering techniques generally known as recombinant DNA technology. Genetic engineering has expanded the genes available to breeders to utilize in creating desired germlines for new crops. Increased durability, nutritional content, insect and virus resistance and herbicide tolerance are a few of the attributes bred into crops through genetic engineering. For some, GMO crops cause food safety and food labeling concerns. Numerous countries have placed restrictions on the production, import or use of GMO foods and crops. Currently a global treaty, the Biosafety Protocol, regulates the trade of GMOs. There is ongoing discussion regarding the labeling of foods made from GMOs, and while the EU currently requires all GMO foods to be labeled, the US does not.Herbicide-resistant seed has a gene implanted into its genome that allows the plants to tolerate exposure to herbicides, including glyphosate. These seeds allow the farmer to grow a crop that can be sprayed with herbicides to control weeds without harming the resistant crop. Herbicide-tolerant crops are used by farmers worldwide. With the increasing use of herbicide-tolerant crops, comes an increase in the use of glyphosate-based herbicide sprays. In some areas glyphosate resistant weeds have developed, causing farmers to switch to other herbicides. Some studies also link widespread glyphosate usage to iron deficiencies in some crops, which is both a crop production and a nutritional quality concern, with potential economic and health implications.Other GMO crops used by growers include insect-resistant crops, which have a gene from the soil bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), which produces a toxin specific to insects. These crops resist damage by insects. Some believe that similar or better pest-resistance traits can be acquired through traditional breeding practices, and resistance to various pests can be gained through hybridization or cross-pollination...

Given a task, you explain in simple steps what the task is asking, any guidelines it provides and how to use those guidelines to find the answer. Definition: Given a scientific question and its correct answer, generate supporting facts for the answer. This supporting fact can be an explanation for the answer to the given question. Input: Question: All atoms have equal numbers of what two particles? Answer: electrons and protons Output:","completion":"Task: The task is to provide an explanation and supporting facts about why all atoms have equal numbers of electrons and protons, given the scientific question and its correct answer. Guidelines: 1. Understand the scientific question: \\"All atoms have equal numbers of what two particles?\\" 2. Recognize the correct answer: \\"electrons and protons.\\" 3. Provide a brief background on atoms and their structure. 4. Explain what electrons and protons are, where they are located within an atom, and their charges. 5. Explain the reason behind having equal numbers of electrons and protons in an atom. 6. Provide any additional supporting facts that help explain the relationship between electrons and protons in an atom. Using the guidelines, here's how to answer the question: Atoms are the basic building blocks of all matter. They are composed of three types of subatomic particles: electrons, protons, and neutrons. Electrons are negatively charged particles that orbit the nucleus of the atom, which is composed of positively charged protons and neutral neutrons. Equal numbers of electrons and protons are found in atoms to ensure that the atom remains electrically neutral since the charges of electrons (-1) and protons (+1) are equal but opposite. The balance between the negative charge of electrons and the positive charge of protons keeps the atom stable, preventing it from attracting or repelling other atoms or charged particles. An imbalance in the number of electrons and protons within an atom would make it an ion, with either a positive (more protons, fewer electrons) or negative (fewer protons, more electrons) overall charge. These ions can engage in chemical reactions and form bonds between atoms due to the imbalance in charge. In summary, an atom has equal numbers of electrons and protons to maintain electrical neutrality and overall stability. This balance is crucial for the atom's interactions with other atoms and particles, and it plays an essential role in forming different chemical structures and compounds."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a title for this article: Aged just 28, Sheryl Sandberg was already chief of staff to the then US treasury secretary Larry Summers. She moved to Google in 2001, where she was closely involved in the launch of Google’s philanthropic arm, Google.org. Sandberg was recruited as chief operating officer of Facebook after meeting founder Mark Zuckerberg at a Christmas party, and is largely credited with turning the social media platform into the highly profitable company it is today. Sandberg was the first woman on Facebook’s board of directors and has been active as a board member of several non-profit organisations, and has built the Lean In Foundation, a charity and online community for women. However it was her book Lean In, published in 2013, which caught the imagination of women around the world. Sandberg argues that, “Women should be encouraged to ‘sit at the table’”, seek challenges, take risks and pursue their goals with gusto, urging women “to set boundaries and abandon the myth of ‘having it all’.” Arianna Stassinopoulos Huffington is a Greek-born American businesswoman and media entrepreneur who co-founded news website The Huffington Post. Under her stewardship, The Huffington Post has become one of the most influential and important news and comment websites in the US, the first purely digital publisher to be awarded a Pulitzer Prize. She left The Huffington Post in August this year to begin a new start-up, Thrive Global, promoting health and wellness in the workplace. Huffington says that the world as it is creates stress and burnout for both sexes, but especially for women, who tend not to thrive in male-dominated working environments. “We need to redesign it,” she says. “And women have a great opportunity to do that.” Aged just 23, Karren Brady earned her nickname “The First Lady of British Football”, when she was made the first female managing director of a British football club, Birmingham City. And she became the youngest managing director of a PLC when the company was floated in 1997. Now vice-chairman of West Ham, Brady stars in BBC’s The Apprentice alongside host Lord Sugar and was the small business Ambassador for the UK during David Cameron’s government, as well as being a strong advocate and champion for women in business. In 2014 Brady was awarded a life peerage as Baroness Brady of Knightsbridge, and was in addition made a Commander of the British Empire for services to entrepreneurship and women in business. Says Brady, “Those women who have got to the top need to ensure there is a pipeline of younger women, whether by networking or mentoring, who in turn are encouraging those below them.” During her long and illustrious career with Nickelodeon, Fox and Disney, Anne Sweeney was often known as the most powerful woman in entertainment. After overseeing the global expansion of Nickelodeon in the late 1980s, Sweeney moved to FX networks, where she launched FXM: Movies from Fox, Hollywood’s first studio-based movie network. In 1996 Sweeney moved to The Walt Disney Company as president of the Disney Channel and became president of ABC Networks, responsible for Disney’s entertainment and news television properties worldwide. Hugely successful and respected wherever she has been, Sweeney recently surprised many in the industry by quitting her executive career for a new role as a director. Sweeney is a supporter of Girls Inc., a charity which “inspires all girls to be strong, smart and bold”, empowering girls to be healthy, educated and to succeed. Sweeney said: “Define success on your own terms, achieve it by your own rules, and build a life you’re proud to live.” Whoopi Goldberg once said: “We’re all here for a reason. I believe a bit of the reason is to throw little torches out to lead people through the dark.” An inspiration both to African Americans and women throughout her long career as a comedian, actress, and activist, Goldberg was the second black woman to win an Oscar, and remains one of the few entertainers to have won an Emmy, a Grammy and an Academy Award.

Uroš III's decision not to attack the Byzantines after the victory at the Battle of Velbazhd against Bulgaria resulted in the alienation of many nobles, who sought to expand to the south. By January or February 1331, Dušan was quarreling with his father, perhaps pressured by the nobility. According to contemporary pro-Dušan sources, evil advisors turned Uroš III against his son; he decided to seize and exclude Dušan of his inheritance. Uroš III sent an army into Zeta against his son, the army ravaged Skadar, but Dušan had crossed the Bojana. A brief period of anarchy in parts of Serbia took place before the father and son concluded peace in April 1331. Three months later, Uroš III ordered Dušan to meet him. Dušan feared for his life and his advisors persuaded him to resist, so Dušan marched from Skadar to Nerodimlje, where he besieged his father. Uroš III fled, and Dušan captured the treasury and family. He then pursued his father, catching up with him at Petrić. On 21 August 1331, Uroš III surrendered, and on the advice or insistence of Dušan's advisors, he was imprisoned.

If Contract management includes the steps required to ensure that the agency receives products and services within established costs and time frames., can we conclude that \\"The agency receiving products and services should be aware of their costs and time frames.\\"?","completion":"Yes, we can conclude that \\"The agency receiving products and services should be aware of their costs and time frames\\" because contract management is a comprehensive process that ensures the efficient delivery of products and services in line with established costs and time frames. To better understand the connection and importance of this conclusion, let's dive into the different aspects of contract management and the responsibilities of the involved parties. Contract management is a vital component of any business relationship that involves the exchange of products or services between parties. It encompasses the entire lifecycle of a contract, from drafting and negotiation to execution, implementation, and renewal or termination. This process helps ensure that both parties fulfill their contractual obligations and adhere to the agreed-upon terms. Key components of effective contract management include: 1. Contract creation: The initial stage of contract management involves drafting the contract, outlining the terms and conditions, the agreed-upon costs and time frames for product/service delivery, and the responsibilities of each party. This process typically involves collaboration between the involved parties to ensure that the contract addresses their specific requirements and expectations. 2. Contract negotiation: Both parties review the draft contract and may propose modifications or alterations to the terms and conditions. Negotiations continue until all parties reach a mutually agreeable final version of the contract. 3. Contract execution: Once both parties have agreed upon the terms and conditions, they sign the contract to formalize the business relationship. This legally binding document now serves as the basis for the parties' obligations and their rights in the agreement. 4. Contract implementation and monitoring: With the contract in place, the involved parties must adhere to their respective obligations. The agency receiving products and services should actively monitor the fulfillment of those obligations, such as verifying the quality of delivered products or services, tracking project progress, and ensuring the agreed-upon costs and time frames are adhered to by the suppliers. 5. Contract administration: Throughout the contract's lifecycle, any issues or disputes that may arise need to be addressed. Both parties should have mechanisms in place to resolve these issues in a timely and efficient manner. Any changes or amendments to the contract should also be documented. 6. Contract renewal or termination: As contracts may have specific end dates or provisions for extensions, the involved parties should be aware of these timelines and make decisions on whether to renew the contract or terminate the relationship. By being aware of the costs and time frames of the products and services they receive, the agency can effectively manage their budget and resources, as well as hold suppliers accountable for delivering within the agreed-upon constraints. This level of awareness also allows the agency to address any potential issues or roadblocks promptly and make informed decisions regarding contract renewals or revisions. In summary, contract management is a critical process for ensuring the successful delivery of products and services, and it is vital for the agency receiving these products and services to be aware of their costs and time frames. This awareness allows the agency to actively engage in monitoring and managing the contract, ultimately helping to ensure a successful business relationship that benefits all parties involved."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Scientists have spent the past two years getting to grips with its data. And on Tuesday, they reported that Cryosat was now delivering an unprecedented view of the seasonal growth and retreat of sea ice spanning the entire Arctic basin. The researchers also released a map showing the difference in height across the Greenland ice sheet. Click the two tabs above to see visualisations of the satellite's data. \\"The message is that Cryosat is working extremely well. Its data are very reliable and the measurements we have match reality,\\" said Prof Volker Liebig, the director of Earth Observation at the European Space Agency (Esa). \\"We now have a very powerful tool to monitor the changes taking place at the poles,\\" he told BBC News. The Esa director delivered an update on the mission at London's Royal Society. The information was also being released here at the European Geosciences Union (EGU) meeting in Vienna, Austria. Several satellites have already detailed the recent and rapid erosion of summer sea ice extent as the Arctic has warmed. But Cryosat's innovation has been to provide a means to get at a figure for ice volume - a far more significant number in terms of understanding the long-term viability of the ice. To do this, the satellite carries one of the highest resolution synthetic aperture radars ever put in orbit. The instrument sends down pulses of microwave energy which bounce off both the top of the ice and the water in the cracks, or leads, which separate the floes. By measuring the difference in height between these two surfaces, scientists can, using a relatively simple calculation, work out the overall volume of the marine cover. The Cryosat team, led from University College London, has spent the period since launch working through the satellite's measurements, validating and calibrating them against a number of independent observations. These include data from plane-borne instruments, from direct on-the-ice assessments, and even from scientific sea-floor moorings that profile the ice floes as they pass overhead. \\"We can now say with good confidence that Cryosat's maps of ice thickness are correct to within 10-20cm,\\" said Dr Seymour Laxon, from UCL's Centre for Polar Observation and Modelling (CPOM) . Tuesday's release shows a complete seasonal cycle, from October 2010, when the Arctic Ocean was beginning to freeze up following the summer melt, right through to March 2011, when the sea ice was approaching peak thickness. Cryosat found the volume (area multiplied by thickness) of sea ice in the central Arctic in March 2011 to have been 14,500 cubic kilometres. This figure is very similar to that suggested by PIOMAS (Panarctic Ice Ocean Modeling and Assimilation System) , an influential computer model that has been used to estimate Arctic sea ice volume, and which has been the basis for several predictions about when summer sea ice in the north might disappear completely. In addition to the announcement on sea ice, the Cryosat team also published a digital elevation model (DEM) of Greenland. The big island, too, has experienced some rapid changes of late and is losing tens of billions of tonnes of its ice cover to the ocean annually. The DEM is a map of varying height, and the visualisation on this page incorporates a year's worth of data. For Cryosat, it is another illustration of its capability. Radar satellites have traditionally struggled to discern the detail in the steep slopes and ridges that mark the edges of ice sheets, but the Esa spacecraft can recover far more information thanks to a special interferometric observing mode that uses two antennas. \\"This is really the first demonstration of the interferometer in action,\\" said Prof Andrew Shepherd from Leeds University . \\"The DEM contains about 7.5 million data points, and we're pretty confident this will be the best elevation model for Greenland, by some margin. Our next step is to compare it to previous data to see how Greenland has changed.\\" Cryosat's principal investigator, Prof Duncan Wingham - formerly of UCL but now chief executive of the UK's National Environment Research Council - summed up: \\"We have years of data to come, but I think it's quite clear that we will provide synoptic, accurate, Arctic-wide thickness; and that we will be able to determine the accuracy of the predictions of when the Arctic will be ice-free in Summer. \\"And I think it's also clear we can now sustain coverage of [ice sheets on Antarctica and Greenland] right down to the coast.\\" The Cryosat update was timed to coincide with this week's 50th anniversary of UK activity in orbit . April 1962 was the month Britain became a space-faring nation with the launch of its first satellite, Ariel-1.

Many nations have designated Wilderness Areas, including Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa and the United States. - An inholding is privately owned land inside the boundary of a national park, national forest, state park, or similar publicly owned, protected area. In-holdings result from private ownership of lands predating the designation of the park or forest area, or the expansion of the park area to encompass the privately owned property. In the United States, the main causes of inholdings is that all of the Federal land-management agencies were formed over a century after the government sold and issued land grants to private citizens to fund the administration of the United States. When the park system was formed, many of these now-called \\"in-holdings\\" had been in private ownership for generations and not available for sale when the park was formed. Over the last several decades, conservation groups have lobbied the United States Congress to acquire private residences especially within designated wilderness areas, either by direct purchase or via land exchange which trades the inholding for other federal lands located outside of national parks or wilderness areas. - The Pepperbox Wilderness Area , an Adirondack Park unit of the New York Forest Preserve , lies entirely within the town of Webb in Herkimer County .

Mitchell's son, Max, is an up-and-coming artist with a rebellious spirit, while Fuller's son, Ethan, is a dedicated college student studying environmental science. The brothers, facing their own emotional struggles and yearning for connection with their sons, decide to bring their families together for a summer vacation in a secluded beach house. Mitchell's wife, Angela, and Fuller's wife, Diane, are both supportive of this initiative, hoping that the summer can serve as an opportunity to heal emotional wounds and eventually bridge the growing gaps between the fathers and their sons. At the beginning of their vacation, both Mitchell and Fuller realize the extent of the emotional damage caused by their lack of presence in their sons' lives. They struggle to understand their children's interests, dreams, and fears. In their quest for redemption, Mitchell and Fuller each take an interest in their sons' respective passions. Mitchell begins attending Max's art classes and even starts painting himself to show support for his son. Simultaneously, Fuller decides to join Ethan in volunteering at a local environmental organization, working side by side with him on various conservation projects. Throughout the summer, the brothers and their sons begin to learn more about each other's lives and start to form new bonds. This experience encourages them to open up about their previously unspoken feelings, revealing their inner fears and insecurities. During their emotional conversations, Mitchell and Fuller come to understand the importance of being present in their children's lives and taking a more active role in their future. In the meantime, Angela and Diane, who have become close friends, encourage their husbands to also mend their own relationship. Over time, Mitchell and Fuller begin to understand the roots of their own estrangement and realize that their sibling rivalry was rather pointless. As the summer comes to an end, the families gather for a farewell dinner on the beach, filled with laughter, tears, and heartfelt conversations. Mitchell and Fuller promise to stay connected with their sons and to be more involved in their lives. They also express their deep gratitude to their wives for supporting them throughout this emotional journey. The families return to their separate homes but continue to stay connected through calls, visits, and joint family vacations. Mitchell and Fuller have not only successfully mended their relationships with their sons but have also managed to reignite their sibling bond. Reconnected is a heartwarming family drama that showcases the power of forgiveness, healing, and reconnection. It teaches the essential lesson that it is never too late to rebuild relationships with loved ones and that it is crucial to prioritize family over all else. The film also explores themes of personal growth, vulnerability, and the importance of emotional communication.

Options: (A). yes. (B). no.","completion":"(A). Yes. Dr. Karl Clark developed the hot water removal process in the 1920s, and it is indeed a good answer to the question. The hot water process was a crucial development in the extraction of bitumen from oil sands. Dr. Clark, a chemist, and engineer from the University of Alberta, dedicated considerable time and effort into developing an effective yet practical method for doing so. To further explain the process, it consists of the following steps: 1. Mining: The oil sands are extracted using large trucks and shovels or hydraulic excavators to remove the material from the Earth. 2. Conditioning: Once the oil sand is mined, it is then mixed with hot water to create a slurry, making it easier to handle and process. This step helps in heating and softening the bitumen, allowing it to detach from sand particles. 3. Separation: The slurry is fed into a separator where the low density bitumen floats to the top, while the water, sand, and clay – commonly referred to as tailings – settle to the bottom. The liquid bitumen is then skimmed from the surface, and some additional processing is carried out to remove remaining water and impurities. 4. Upgrading: After the bitumen is separated, it undergoes further processing, known as upgrading. In this step, the heavy, viscous bitumen is converted into various lighter crude oil products by using various processes, such as coking, hydrocracking, and hydrotreating. This makes the bitumen suitable for further refining into gasoline, diesel, and other petroleum products. Dr. Karl Clark's hot water removal process revolutionized the way bitumen was extracted from oil sands, making the exploitation of resources in areas like the Canadian oil sands commercially viable. As a result, Clark's work paved the way for significant growth in the oil sands industry, providing a valuable boost to the economies of countries such as Canada that possess vast oil sands deposits."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Cats normally have 4 toes on their back feet and 5 on the front but these polydactyl cats mostly have 5 on the back and 6 on the front, thanks to a genetic mutation. Their front paws are noticeably larger and look like they have mittens on.

Adeline Virginia Woolf (; nee Stephen; 25 January 1882 - 28 March 1941) was an English writer who is considered one of the most important modernist twentieth century authors and a pioneer in the use of stream of consciousness as a narrative device. Virginia Stephen was born into an affluent household in South Kensington, London. She was the seventh child in a blended family of eight. Her mother, Julia Stephen, celebrated as a Pre-Raphaelite artist's model, had three children from her first marriage, her father Leslie Stephen, a notable man of letters, had one previous daughter, and four children were born in her parents' second marriage, of whom the most well known was the modernist painter, Vanessa Stephen (later Vanessa Bell). Julia Stephen fell ill with influenza in February 1895, and never properly recovered, dying on 5 May, when Virginia was only 13. This was a pivotal moment in her life and the beginning of her struggles with mental illness. Essentially, her life had fallen apart. The Duckworths were travelling abroad at the time of their mother's death, and Stella returned immediately to take charge and assume her role. That summer, rather than return to the memories of St Ives, the Stephens went to Freshwater, Isle of Wight, where a number of their mother's family lived. It was there that Virginia had the first of her many nervous breakdowns, and Vanessa was forced to assume some of her mother's role in caring for Virginia's mental state. Stella became engaged to Jack Hills the following year and they were married on 10 April 1897, making Virginia even more dependent on her older sister. George Duckworth also assumed some of their mother's role, taking upon himself the task of bringing them out into society. First Vanessa, then Virginia, in both cases an equal disaster, for it was not a rite of passage which resonated with either girl and attracted a scathing critique by Virgina regarding the conventional expectations of young upper class women \\"Society in those days was a perfectly competent, perfectly complacent, ruthless machine. A girl had no chance against its fangs. No other desires - say to paint, or to write - could be taken seriously\\". Rather her priorities were to escape from the Victorian conventionality of the downstairs drawing room to a \\"room of one's own\\" to pursue her writing aspirations. She would revisit this criticism in her depiction of Mrs Ramsay stating the duties of a Victorian mother in To the Lighthouse \\"an unmarried woman has missed the best of life\\". The death of Stella Duckworth, her pregnant surrogate mother, on 19 July 1897, after a long illness, was a further blow to Virginia's sense of self, and the family dynamics. Woolf described the period following the death of both her mother and Stella as \\"1897-1904 -- the seven unhappy years\\", referring to \\"the lash of a random unheeding flail that pointlessly and brutally killed the two people who should, normally and naturally, have made those years, not perhaps happy but normal and natural\\". In April 1902 their father became ill, and although he underwent surgery later that year he never fully recovered, dying on 22 February 1904. Virginia's father's death precipitated a further breakdown. Later, Virginia would describe this time as one in which she was dealt successive blows as a \\"broken chrysalis\\" with wings still creased. Chrysalis occurs many times in Woolf's writing but the \\"broken chrysalis\\" was an image that became a metaphor for those exploring the relationship between Woolf and grief. At his death, Leslie Stephen's net worth was PS15,715 6s. 6d.

An Afghan villager who risked everything to save the life of a Navy SEAL is seeking asylum in the U.S. after his life came under threat in his home country. Mohammed Gulab could have left heavily injured Marcus Luttrell to die in the mountains, but instead took him to his village and protected him from the Taliban. In the extraordinary story depicted in the movie 'Lone Survivor', Luttrell was the only one of four Navy SEALs to survive a nightmarish firefight in northeastern Afghanistan in June 2005. Scroll down for video. Navy SEAL Marcus Luttrell (left) was the lone survivor of a firefight with the Taliban in northeastern Afghanistan in June 2005. Gravely wounded, he was protected by Mohammad Gulab until his rescue by U.S. forces. When Gulab found Luttrell he had been shot twice, suffered several cracked vertebrae and had shrapnel wounds to his leg. Speaking through a translator to CBS's '60 Minutes' in 2013, Gulab said: 'I knew I had to help him; to do the right thing, because he was in a lot of danger.' 'He very well could have just left me laying there on the side of that waterfall and let me die,' Luttrell said. 'But he didn't.' Marcus Luttrell, pictured third from right, was operating in Afghanistan supporting Operation Red Wings, when the rest of his team (pictured with him) were killed in a firefight with the Taliban in June 2005. Luttrell was rescued by American forces and came home to the US, back to his native Texas. Now Gulab needs help from the U.S. After his crucial role in Luttrell's survival, Gulab and his family had to go into hiding as they received death threats from the Taliban, their house was burned down, and his cousin was killed. These threats had worsened after the release of the movie 'Lone Survivor' depicting the events surrounding Gulab's heroism and Luttrell's dramatic survival. Once audiences in Afghanistan had seen the movie and understood the role Gulab had played, it became dangerous for him to stay in the same place for longer than a night. Mark Wahlberg (second from left) played Luttrell in the 2013 movie 'Lone Survivor'. Once it had been seen in Afghanistan, threats against Gulab's life intensified as his role in Luttrell's survival became more widely known. Last Saturday, with the help of the U.S., he managed to escape Afghanistan with family members to a neutral, undisclosed, third country. He is now working with New York immigration attorney Michael Wildes to gain refugee status to enter the U.S. – the first step towards being granted asylum, CBS reports. Wildes is working on the exceptionally complicated case on a pro bono basis. Mohammad Gulab (left) attended the 'Lone Survivor' New York premiere in December 2013. Immigration lawyer Michael Wildes (right) has said that if he had applied for asylum then he probably could have stayed in the U.S. Much of the complexity comes from the number of agencies involved, from the United Nations to the Department of Homeland Security – and ultimately it is the latter that will make the decision. Ironically, the process could have been made much simpler. Gulab has been to the U.S. before, occasionally visiting Luttrell on his ranch in Texas, and attending the movie's premiere in New York in December 2013. Wildes said Gulab probably could have stayed had he applied for asylum on one of those visits. Despite a language barrier between the two of them, Luttrell and Gulab have become friends and have even gone shooting together on the Texas ranch.

Plot title: The Mission Movie plot: The film is set in the 1750s and involves Spanish Jesuit priest Father Gabriel (Jeremy Irons) who enters the northeastern Argentina and western Paraguayan jungle to build a mission station and convert a GuaranÃ­ community to Christianity.[6] The GuaranÃ­ community is not initially receptive to Christianity or outsiders in general, shown by the opening scene where they tie a priest to a wooden cross and send him over the Iguazu Falls, a large waterfall they live above. Father Gabriel travels to the falls, climbs to the top, and plays his oboe. The GuaranÃ­ warriors, captivated by the music, allow him to live. Mercenary and slaver Rodrigo Mendoza (Robert De Niro) makes his living kidnapping natives such as the Guarani community and selling them to nearby plantations, including the plantation of the Spanish Governor Don Cabeza (Chuck Low). After returning from another kidnapping trip Mendoza is told by his assumed fiancÃ©, Carlotta (Cherie Lunghi), that she loves his younger half-brother Felipe (Aidan Quinn). Mendoza later finds them in bed together and in a fit of rage kills Felipe in a duel. Although he is acquitted of the killing by Cabeza, Mendoza spirals into depression and seeks absolution for his actions. Father Gabriel visits and challenges Mendoza to undertake a suitable penance. Mendoza accompanies the Jesuits on their return to the GuaranÃ­ village, scaling a cliff while dragging a heavy bundle containing his armour and sword. Upon reaching the outskirts of the natives' territory, there are a few tense moments when the natives recognise him, but after seeing him in his humbled state, they cut away his heavy bundle and forgive him. Father Gabriel's mission is depicted as a place of sanctuary and education for the GuaranÃ­. Moved by the GuaranÃ­'s acceptance, Mendoza wishes to help at the mission and Father Gabriel gives him a Bible. In time, Mendoza takes vows and becomes a Jesuit under Father Gabriel and his colleague Father Fielding (Liam Neeson). The Jesuit missions were safe because they were... My question: How does Rodrigo Mendoza make his living ? ? A:","completion":"Rodrigo Mendoza, a character played by Robert De Niro in the film \\"The Mission,\\" makes his living as a mercenary and a slaver. His primary activity involves kidnapping natives from various communities, including the Guarani community situated in the northeastern Argentina and western Paraguayan jungle, and selling them to nearby plantations. These plantations where Mendoza sells the natives are colonial establishments meant for producing goods like cotton, rice, tobacco, sugar, etc., where labor-intensive farming is done by enslaved people. Among the plantation owners who use these natives as slaves is the Spanish Governor Don Cabeza, a character played by Chuck Low. In essence, Mendoza's income is generated from the brutal business of human trafficking, which allows him to profit off the suffering and displacement of indigenous communities. However, Mendoza's actions lead to significant personal change when he experiences a moral and religious crisis, following the murder of his younger half-brother Felipe in a fit of rage. He spirals into depression and seeks absolution for his sins, which Father Gabriel, a character played by Jeremy Irons, provides him with an opportunity to seek penance. His journey towards redemption involves physically and symbolically carrying the burden of his past sins (his armour and sword), indicating a transition from mercenary and slaver to a penitent man seeking forgiveness. Over time, Mendoza transforms from a purveyor of violence and slavery to someone trying to protect and save the Guarani community he once exploited, eventually becoming a Jesuit under Father Gabriel."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Before the mysterious disappearance of one of its passenger jets this month, Malaysia wasn't a country used to finding itself dominating headlines around the world. Some of its Southeast Asian neighbors, including Indonesia and the Philippines, have suffered devastating natural disasters in recent years and are all too familiar with the media frenzy that accompanies a major crisis. But Malaysia has largely managed to stay out of the international spotlight since its independence from British colonial rule more than half a century ago. \\"It is one of these countries, because of its geography, that doesn't have earthquakes,\\" said Ernest Bower, senior adviser for Southeast Asia studies at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \\"It doesn't have tsunamis. It hasn't been tested with a disaster like this.\\" The disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 has thrust the government into the dazzling glare of worldwide attention. And it hasn't emerged with very good grades. \\"I think on a stress test, they're failing,\\" Bower told CNN's Jake Tapper, pointing to the government's coordination of different agencies and communication with other countries. China among critics Criticism and complaints have come from other countries involved in the search for the missing plane, including China and Vietnam, and from the relatives of passengers. Malaysian officials have created confusion by issuing contradictory statements on key aspects of the investigation. The majority of the people on board the plane were Chinese, and Beijing has increasingly voiced its displeasure with the search, especially after Malaysia announced over the weekend that evidence suggested the plane had been deliberately flown west into the Indian Ocean, away from its last confirmed location over the South China Sea. \\"The new information means the intensive search in the South China Sea for the whole past week was worthless and would never bear fruit,\\" said a commentary published by China's state-run news agency Xinhua. \\"Even worse, the golden time for saving possible survivors, if any, was generously wasted.\\" Question: \\"Why might Malaysia not suffer the kinds of natural disasters experienced in Indonesia and the Philippines?\\" Response: \\"Because of its geography\\" Available options: A. no B. yes Does the response correctly answer the question?","completion":"B. yes"},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The problem is: 53*j - 177 = -143 + 735 + 768 1. First, we need to add the numbers on the right side of the equals sign: -143 + 735 + 768 - Think of it like adding up your candies from three different bags. -143 + 735 = 592 (You can think of it as having 735 candies and eating 143 of them) Now, we have 592 + 768. 592 + 768 = 1360 So now, our equation looks like: 53*j - 177 = 1360 2. Now, we need to get rid of the -177 on the left side. To do that, we will add 177 to both sides: 53*j - 177 + 177 = 1360 + 177 -177 + 177 becomes 0, so now we have: 53*j = 1537 3. Now, we need to find the value of 'j'. To do that, we'll divide both sides by 53: j = 1537 ÷ 53 4.

The modern game with pegs was invented in 1970 by Mordecai Meirowitz, an Israeli postmaster and telecommunications expert. It resembles an earlier pencil and paper game called Bulls and Cows that may date back a century or more. Can we draw the following conclusion? The modern with pegs of Mastermind was not invented until 70 years after the start of the 20th century","completion":"Yes, we can draw the conclusion that the modern peg-version of Mastermind was not invented until 70 years after the start of the 20th century. As mentioned, the modern game of Mastermind was invented in 1970 by Mordecai Meirowitz. Considering that the 20th century began in the year 1900, we can calculate the time elapsed from the start of the 20th century to the invention of the game as follows: 1970 – 1900 = 70 years Thus, it took 70 years from the beginning of the 20th century for the modern peg-based version of Mastermind to be developed. This implies that the within pegs version of Mastermind was not around for a significant portion of the 20th century, having only arrived on the scene with the invention by Mordecai Meirowitz. It is important to note that the Mastermind game we know today with colored pegs is inspired by the earlier pencil and paper game Bulls and Cows, which possibly dates back a century or more. Despite sharing similarities, the two games are distinct from one another in their gameplay mechanics and materials used. While Bulls and Cows was a mathematical game played with numbers and relied on players manually writing their guesses and results, the modern Mastermind features colored pegs, with one player creating a code using these pegs and the other player attempting to break the code by deducing the correct sequence of colors. In conclusion, given that the modern Mastermind game was invented in 1970, it is accurate to state that this peg-based version was not developed until 70 years after the start of the 20th century. Although it has roots in an older game, the modern implementation with pegs fundamentally transformed the game, giving it a unique identity and ensuring its place in history as a fascinating and engaging code-breaking challenge."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Is there a way on Quora to ask why a specific question was marked as needs improvement? Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?","completion":"These two questions contain different inquiries within the context of Quora and improving a question. I will address each question separately to provide a detailed and long answer. Question 1: If this question needs improvement then how can it be improved? Before suggesting improvements, let us first understand why a question on Quora might be marked as \\"needs improvement.\\" A question might be flagged for improvement if it is: 1. Unclear or insufficiently descriptive 2. Has grammatical or spelling errors 3. It is phrased awkwardly or contains informal language 4. It is overly broad or lacks specificity Now, to improve the question in question, the following steps can be taken: 1. Clarity and Descriptiveness: Ensure that the question is clear and easily understandable. Provide enough context and details to guide the respondents in the direction of what information you are looking for. 2. Grammar and Spelling: Review the question for any grammatical or spelling errors and correct them. Users are more likely to engage with well-written questions. 3. Proper phrasing and language: Reframe the question using formal and appropriate language. If needed, restructure the question to make it more readable and easier to understand. 4. Specificity: Narrow down the scope of the question and make it more specific, so potential answerers will know precisely what you are asking. If there are several aspects to the question, consider breaking it into multiple separate questions. Providing an example of an improved version of the first question: “What steps can be taken on Quora to effectively edit and improve a question that has been marked as 'needs improvement'?” Question 2: Is there a way on Quora to ask why a specific question was marked as needs improvement? Asking why a specific question was marked as \\"needs improvement\\" can help the user get more insight into how to enhance and modify their question. Unfortunately, Quora does not provide a direct or built-in way to ask for the reasoning behind why a particular question received this designation. However, there are still a few options that you can consider to gain some insight: 1. Reach out to experienced users: You can directly message or ask experienced Quora users in a related topic to review your question and provide feedback. They might provide valuable advice or guidance on specific improvements. 2. Observe other questions: By looking at similar questions in the same topic, you can compare and make changes to your question based on the trends and successful questions you see. This process can help you identify what works best on Quora and optimize your question accordingly. 3. Use the \\"Edit\\" feature: Even if you're unsure why your question has been marked as needing improvement, you can still try to optimize it by following the guidelines for improving questions (as discussed in response to the first question). Once you've made your edits, you can resubmit the question to see if it receives a more positive response from the community. In conclusion, these two questions are not inquiring about the same information. The first question is asking for recommendations on how to improve a question, while the second question is looking for ways to understand why a particular question was marked as \\"needs improvement\\" on Quora. Both questions revolve around the broader theme of enhancing questions on the platform, but they address different aspects of the process."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A commoner (Kichijiro Ueda) joins them and they tell him that they have witnessed a disturbing story, which they then begin recounting to him. The woodcutter claims he found the body of a murdered samurai three days earlier while looking for wood in the forest; upon discovering the body, he says, he fled in a panic to notify the authorities. The priest says that he saw the samurai with his wife traveling the same day the murder happened. Both men were then summoned to testify in court, where they met the captured bandit TajÅmaru (å¤è¥ä¸¸), who claimed responsibility for killing the samurai and raping his wife. The bandit's story[edit] TajÅmaru (Toshiro Mifune), a notorious brigand, claims that he tricked the samurai to step off the mountain trail with him and look at a cache of ancient swords he discovered. In the grove he tied the samurai to a tree, then brought the samurai's wife there. She initially tried to defend herself with a dagger, but was eventually \\"seduced\\" by the bandit. The woman, filled with shame, then begged him to duel to the death with her husband, to save her from the guilt and shame of having two men know her dishonor. TajÅmaru honorably set the samurai free and dueled with him. In TajÅmaru's recollection they fought skillfully and fiercely, but in the end TajÅmaru was the victor and the woman ran away. At the end of the story to the court, he is asked about an expensive dagger owned by the samurai's wife: he says that, in the confusion, he forgot all about it, and that it was foolish of him to leave behind such a valuable object. The wife's story[edit] The samurai's wife (Machiko KyÅ) tells a different story to the court. She says that TajÅmaru left after raping her.

US President Herbert Hoover belonged to which political party?","completion":"Herbert Hoover, the 31st President of the United States, belonged to the Republican Party. Born on August 10, 1874, Hoover was a prominent and successful engineer and businessman before entering politics. As a member of the Republican Party, Hoover believed in supporting a limited government with minimal intervention in daily life and an emphasis on individual responsibility. His political stance was grounded in the principles of American conservatism, and he endeavored to prioritize free enterprise, economic growth, and efficient governance. Hoover's tenure as president lasted from March 4, 1929, to March 4, 1933. His term began in an era marked by economic prosperity, but it was cut short by the onset of the Great Depression, which started in October 1929 following the stock market crash. The Great Depression would ultimately take a heavy toll on his presidency and redefine U.S. politics for decades to come. Initially, Hoover tried to combat the economic crisis using typical Republican strategies – he advocated for voluntary state and local responses while trying to maintain a balanced budget. However, as the Great Depression deepened, he was ultimately forced to intervene more directly and drastically to address the country's dire economic conditions. Some of his interventions included the Emergency Relief and Construction Act, the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, and a series of agricultural policies aimed at stabilizing food prices. Unfortunately for Hoover and the Republican Party, these efforts were not enough to turn the economy around, and the American public largely blamed Hoover for the severity and duration of the depression. In the 1932 presidential election, Hoover lost by a landslide to Democratic nominee, Franklin D. Roosevelt, who introduced the New Deal, a series of economic relief and social programs that promised sweeping reforms to alleviate the effects of the depression. Herbert Hoover's presidency, marked by the Great Depression and a failed attempt at recovery, contributed to the Democrats' dominance in American politics during the subsequent decades. Nevertheless, the Republican Party continued to evolve, ultimately reasserting its status as one of the two major political parties in the United States."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Translate to English.","completion":"If you reduce the percentage of use of the movable property for commercial purposes, you may need to repay a portion of the Input Tax Credit (ITC) already received. Here's the detailed explanation: In the context of Value-Added Tax (VAT) or Goods and Services Tax (GST) systems, businesses can claim Input Tax Credit (ITC) for the tax paid on goods or services used to provide their own commercial goods or services. Movable property, also known as chattels, refers to tangible personal property that can be moved from one place to another. In a business context, this typically includes items like furniture, machinery, and equipment used for commercial purposes. In certain situations, the use of movable property may change over time. For instance, if a business originally used a machine 100% for commercial purposes but later decreases its usage to 80%, the percentage of use for commercial purposes has been reduced. As a result, the tax credit previously claimed may no longer be fully applicable. If you decrease the percentage of use of movable property for commercial purposes, you may need to adjust the Input Tax Credit you claimed accordingly. This could involve repaying a portion of the ITC already received to the tax authority. To do so, you would generally have to recalculate the tax credit according to the new percentage of commercial use and compare it to the original amount claimed. The difference would be the amount that potentially needs to be repaid. It is essential for businesses to monitor changes in their use of movable property and ensure that their tax credits claimed reflect actual commercial usage. Failure to account for these adjustments appropriately could result in penalties or interest charges by the tax authorities. It is always recommended to consult a tax professional or an accountant if you are unsure about how to adjust your Input Tax Credits due to changes in the commercial use of movable property."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Le programme en question visait à lutter contre plusieurs formes de violence, à savoir la violence physique, sexuelle et mentale, tant dans le cadre familial qu'au sein des établissements scolaires. Ainsi, les créateurs du programme ont mis en place des dispositifs pour venir en aide non seulement aux personnes qui subissent déjà ces types de violences, mais également à celles qui se trouvent dans des situations à risque, et qui pourraient devenir victimes à leur tour. Tout d'abord, pour aborder la question de la violence physique, le programme met l'accent sur la prévention et la sensibilisation. Il est ainsi question de promouvoir le dialogue et la communication non violente entre les membres de la famille et les élèves, afin de désamorcer les conflits avant qu'ils ne dégénèrent en agressions physiques. De plus, des formations sont proposées aux enseignants, aux travailleurs sociaux et aux professionnels de la santé, dans le but de leur fournir les outils nécessaires pour identifier et intervenir dans des situations de violence physique. En ce qui concerne la violence sexuelle, le programme vise à déconstruire les stéréotypes de genre et les préjugés qui peuvent favoriser ce type de violence. Ainsi, des ateliers sont organisés pour sensibiliser les jeunes et les adultes à l'égalité des sexes, au consentement, et au respect de l'intégrité physique et morale de chacun. De même, un accompagnement et un soutien psychologique sont proposés aux victimes de violences sexuelles, afin de les aider à surmonter les traumatismes subis et à entreprendre des démarches juridiques si nécessaire. Enfin, en ce qui concerne la violence mentale, le programme cherche à prévenir et à combattre les comportements toxiques, tels que le harcèlement, l'intimidation, le mépris ou la manipulation, qui peuvent avoir des conséquences dévastatrices sur la santé mentale des victimes. Pour cela, des formations sont dispensées aux éducateurs et aux professionnels de la santé, afin de leur permettre de détecter ces comportements nuisibles et d'apporter un soutien adapté aux personnes concernées. Par ailleurs, des campagnes de communication sont menées pour encourager les témoins et les victimes à dénoncer ce type de violence et à chercher de l'aide. En somme, le programme aborde de manière globale et complète les différentes facettes de la violence au sein du foyer et des établissements scolaires, en mettant un accent particulier sur la prévention, la sensibilisation et le soutien aux victimes. Cette approche pluridisciplinaire permet d'apporter des réponses concrètes et adaptées aux problèmes complexes liés à la violence, et contribue ainsi à créer un environnement sain et bienveillant pour chacun."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:When can I get a cell phone?\\" The answer is when your parents think you need one, though many kids seem to be getting them around age 12 or 13. Some younger kids may have them because their parents see it as a matter of safety and convenience. For example, a kid can call mom and dad when sports practice is over. And a cell phone can give kids almost instant access to their parents if something goes wrong or they need help. It can give parents quick access to their kids so they can check on them and make sure they're OK. If you do get a cell phone, make some rules with your parents, such as how many minutes you're allowed to spend on the phone, when you can use your phone, when the phone must be turned off, and what you will do if someone calls you too often, and so on. You'll also have to learn to take care of the phone in your life. Keep it charged and store it in the safe place so it doesn't get lost. And whatever you do, don't use it in the bathroom.

Please answer a question about the following article about Hunting: Unarmed fox hunting on horseback with hounds is the type of hunting most closely associated with the United Kingdom; in fact, \\"hunting\\" without qualification implies fox hunting. What in other countries is called \\"hunting\\" is called \\"shooting\\" (birds) or \\"stalking\\" (deer) in Britain. Originally a form of vermin control to protect livestock, fox hunting became a popular social activity for newly wealthy upper classes in Victorian times and a traditional rural activity for riders and foot followers alike. Similar to fox hunting in many ways is the chasing of hares with hounds. Pairs of Sight hounds (or long-dogs), such as greyhounds, may be used to pursue a hare in coursing, where the greyhounds are marked as to their skill in coursing the hare (but are not intended to actually catch it), or the hare may be pursued with scent hounds such as beagles or harriers. Other sorts of foxhounds may also be used for hunting stags (deer) or mink. Deer stalking with rifles is carried out on foot without hounds, using stealth.

Let's briefly analyze each keyword: 1. \\"Examples\\": This word suggests that the focus is on specific instances or cases among a larger group or category. It implies that there will be multiple items presented to illustrate the point or concept being discussed. 2. \\"Work\\": In the context of this sentence, \\"work\\" likely refers to academic assignments, projects, or other tasks completed by students. It may encompass a variety of outputs, such as essays, art, presentations, research, or group projects. 3. \\"Produced\\": This keyword indicates that the students have generated or created something. It suggests that the focus is not merely on the students themselves, but on their output and what they have accomplished in their academic pursuits. 4. \\"Students\\": This term specifies that the subject of the sentence is the population of learners or individuals enrolled in an educational program. Given the context of the other keywords, this most likely refers to students within a Bachelor of Arts (BA) program, but it's not clear since the sentence is incomplete. 5. \\"Across the ba\\": As mentioned earlier, this portion of the sentence is most likely incomplete. It could potentially refer to \\"Bachelor of Arts\\" (BA) as in \\"across the Bachelor of Arts program\\" or \\"across the various disciplines within the BA program.\\" However, without the full context or completion of the sentence, it is challenging to determine the intended meaning accurately. In summary, it seems that the sentence is discussing a variety of student-created works in a Bachelor of Arts program, highlighting specific instances or samples.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Prior to the introduction of the current format of semifinals (deltävlingar) in 2002, the competition was usually a single live show. Under the current system, four semifinals are broadcast at 20:00 CET on consecutive Saturday nights. The semi-finals begin in early February, and seven songs compete in each show. Unlike in the final, no juries are used; televoting decides the results. The songs are performed live with telephone lines open for the first round of voting; two songs with the fewest votes do not qualify to the second round. The top five battle for a place in the final and Andra chansen round – the 1st and 2nd placed songs qualifying to the final, and the 3rd and 4th placed songs progressing to Andra chansen. Both finalists reprise their entries at the end of the broadcast. The organisation of a semi-final system for Melodifestivalen popularised televised heats at national Eurovision selections. A similar system was adopted by the Eurovision itself in 2004. The Second Chance round (Andra chansen) is the fifth heat in which the remaining four entries to the final are chosen. The third- and fourth-placed songs from each semi-final (eight songs in total) compete in the event. The first Second Chance round in 2002 had a panel of former winners decide the two finalists. Between 2003 and 2006, the semi-final performances were re-broadcast, and a round of voting narrowed the songs to three or four. Another round then determined the two finalists. The programme was broadcast on the Sunday afternoon after the fourth semi-final. It was held in a smaller venue than those that would have hosted the semi-finals—such as Berns Salonger in Stockholm, which hosted the Second Chance round in 2005. In 2007, the Second Chance round became a full semi-final, taking place in a venue comparable in size to those hosting the others. The expanded Second Chance takes place on a Saturday night, adding an extra week to the event's timetable. The format of voting also changed with the introduction of a knock-out system. The... A:","completion":"The system that pairs the eight songs off against each other in the context provided is called the Second Chance round or Andra chansen in Melodifestivalen, which is the Swedish music competition to choose their entry for Eurovision. This round is held to determine the final four entries that will move forward to the final round, as the 3rd and 4th placed songs from each of the four semifinals (totaling eight songs) compete in this event. The Second Chance round has gone through multiple format changes over the years. Initially, in 2002, a panel of former winners would decide the two finalists, but the format evolved and changed with time. Between 2003 and 2006, the semifinal performances were re-broadcast, and a round of voting narrowed the songs to three or four, followed by another round determining the two finalists. In 2007, the Second Chance round became a full-blown semifinal, taking place in a venue similar in size to those hosting the other semifinals and featuring a knock-out system for voting. This new format extended the event's timetable by adding an extra week. In the knock-out system, the eight songs are paired against each other, and the viewers vote to decide the winners of each pair. The four winning songs from these pairings then proceed to the final round of Melodifestivalen. Overall, the Second Chance round or Andra chansen plays a significant role in the Melodifestivalen competition, as it allows eight songs that didn't initially qualify for the final a chance to compete for one of the final spots. This system not only offers more exposure and opportunities for the competing artists and songs, but it also encourages greater audience engagement and interest in the competition."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Which farmer didn't provide a good environment for weeds? Jake and Todd used different farming methods to produce their crops. Jake always tills his land, while Todd uses he no-tillage method. Hint: The benefits provided by no-tillage to predators may lead to larger predator populations, which is a good way to control pests (biological control), but also can facilitate predation of the crop itself. In corn crops, for instance, predation by caterpillars can be higher in no-till than in conventional tillage fields.In places with rigorous winter, untilled soil can take longer to warm and dry in spring, which may delay planting to less ideal dates. Another factor to be considered is that organic residue from the prior year's crops lying on the surface of untilled fields can provide a favorable environment to pathogens, helping to increase the risk of transmitting diseases to the future crop. And because no-till farming provides good environment for pathogens, insects and weeds, it can lead farmers to a more intensive use of chemicals for pest control. Other disadvantages of no-till include underground rot, low soil temperatures and high moisture.Based on the balance of these factors, and because each farm has different problems, agroecologists will not attest that only no-till or complete tillage is the right way of farming. Yet, these are not the only possible choices regarding soil preparation, since there are intermediate practices such as strip-till, mulch-till and ridge-till, all of them – just as no-till – categorized as conservation tillage. Agroecologists, then, will evaluate the need of different practices for the contexts in which each farm is inserted. Answer:","completion":"The farmer who didn't provide a good environment for weeds is Jake. This is because he uses the conventional tillage method for his farming practices, while Todd uses the no-tillage method. As mentioned in the provided information, no-till farming can provide a conducive environment for pathogens, insects, and weeds, potentially leading to a more intensive use of chemicals for pest control. On the other hand, the conventional tillage method used by Jake involves turning and breaking up the soil, which may be less hospitable to weeds compared to the no-tillage method. It is important to note, however, that the choice between no-till and conventional tillage depends on various factors, and agroecologists do not necessarily advocate for one method over the other. Instead, they consider the specific challenges and conditions each farm faces and may recommend intermediate practices such as strip-till, mulch-till, or ridge-till, which are all forms of conservation tillage."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Media playback is not supported on this device Wales saw off South Africa by 27-13 to make it three wins out of four in the series for the first time since 2002. \\"We targeted three or four games and we've reached our target,\\" said Howley. \\"We are very pleased. The players have given everything, their training's gone really well. It's nice to transfer what we've done in training into the final game.\\" Wales have faced criticism for their performances in the Autumn series but Howley had nothing but praise for his players. \\"I'm just delighted for the players, The effort and attitude they have shown over the past five weeks has been brilliant. \\"They've rounded it off with a good win today,\\" Howley told BBC Radio Wales Sport. Howley admitted there had been a lack of discipline as Wales almost let South Africa back into the match. \\"At 20-6 we were looking for the next score. Unfortunately we lacked discipline in the last 20 odd minutes,\\" Howley explained. \\"We gave them field position. We gave them opportunities and when you give South Africa opportunities in your white zone, in the 22, they've got a great driving game. \\"And we conceded that score which was disappointing, but overall I'm really pleased.\\" After an autumn in which they were heavily criticised for a heavy defeat by Australia and narrow wins over Argentina and Japan, Howley wants Wales to rise to the \\"next level\\" in the 2017 Six Nations.

Summarize this article: Use a sharp knife to shave the beef into very thin slices. Cut the onion and shiitake mushrooms into moderately thin slices, as well. To save yourself time and effort, ask the butcher to slice the beef very thinly before packaging it. If the butcher does not slice the beef, freeze it for 1 hour before slicing it yourself. Partially frozen meat is easier to cut than fully thawed meat. The slices of beef should be just a little thicker than cold cut lunchmeat is. This thinness is key. Beef that is too thick will not cook quickly enough. The slices of onion and mushroom should both be approximately 1/3 inch (1 cm) thick. Place the butter in a medium saucepan and set it on the stove. Heat over medium for a few minutes, just until the butter is completely melted. Add the sliced onions and sliced shiitake mushrooms to the melted butter. Cook, stirring frequently, for 4 to 5 minutes. The onion should become translucent and the shiitake mushrooms should feel notably tender. Add both alcohols to the saucepan. Cook for another 2 minutes. During this time, most of the actual alcohol should burn away, leaving only the flavor behind. Add the water, Dashi powder, soy sauce, sugar, grated ginger, and minced garlic to the contents of the saucepan. Stir to combine. Allow the contents of the pan to reach a steady simmer before continuing. Place the thin slices of raw beef in the saucepan. Reduce the heat to low and cook gently for 3 to 5 minutes. Use cooking chopsticks or tongs to carefully separate the beef slices as they cook. Doing so can help prevent the beef from sticking together. This may seem like an abnormally short cooking time, but if the beef has been sliced to an adequately thin size, it should be plenty. Do not overcook the beef since it can easily become dry. Fill two serving bowls with freshly steamed white rice. Divide the gyudon evenly and spread it over the rice in both bowls. For an even more authentic experience, prepare Asian-style sticky rice or sushi rice instead of relying on instant rice. Top each serving of gyudon with an organic raw egg. Crack the egg directly over the beef, allowing the yolk to remain intact in the center of the bowl when you serve the dish. Please exercise caution when consuming raw eggs. Organic eggs from a clean, reliable source might be safe to eat, but the USDA discourages the consumption of raw eggs altogether due to the risk of salmonella. If you feel squeamish about consuming raw eggs, you may skip this step. If you do opt to include the raw egg, mix it into the beef and rice as you eat the gyudon. Doing so can give the taste of the dish a rich, creamy undertone. Gyudon is frequently topped with a bit of shichimi togarashi and beni shoga. Pair it with sides like miso soup and steamed vegetables. A combination of broccoli, cauliflower, and sliced carrots will pair especially well with this dish, but you can serve it with any vegetables you prefer. Consider steaming the vegetables for a few minutes, allowing them to become tender-crisp without turning into mush. Summary:","completion":"To make gyudon, thinly slice beef, onions, and shiitake mushrooms. In a saucepan, melt butter and cook the onions and mushrooms until tender.

South Africans marked the momentous milestone with acts of charity, capped by news that the former president's health was improving. \\"He continues to respond positively to treatment and we are encouraged by the progress he is making,\\" said President Jacob Zuma, after visiting Mr Mandela in hospital. \\"We are proud to call this international icon our own as South Africans and wish him good health.\\" Children were among the well-wishers outside Mr Mandela's hospital He thanked people for their support of Mr Mandela and \\"undying love and compassion, and for responding to a call to give the beloved figure \\"the biggest birthday celebration ever this year.\\" South Africans took to the streets in celebration of their national hero. Biker gangs cleaned streets, volunteers planted trees and politicians spent 67 minutes on worthy projects - to mark Mr Mandela's 67 years of public service. Children in schools around the country started the day by singing \\"Happy Birthday\\" to Mr Mandela. Thursday also marks 15 years since the anti-apartheid leader married his third wife Graca Machel. The UN declared the Nobel peace laureate's birthday Mandela Day in 2010, but for many this year takes on extra poignancy. Winnie Madikizela-Mandela with a giant birthday cake Mr Mandela has spent the last 41 days in a Pretoria hospital in a critical but stable condition after being admitted for a recurring lung infection on June 8. His youngest daughter told Sky News her father has been able to communicate and watch television. \\"He is making remarkable progress,\\" said Zindzi Mandela, adding that when she visited him on Tuesday he was \\"watching TV with his headphones\\". \\"He responds very well ... with his eyes, and he nods and sometimes he lifts his hand like to shake your hand.\\" Granddaughter Ndileka Mandela poured soup for poor children at a charity event and said her family had been unsure about whether her grandfather would live to see his birthday. Mr Mandela's granddaughter Ndileka serves soup in a poor community \\"But because of the fighter that he is, he was able to fight a repressive system, and he was able, through God and everybody's prayers, to make it today,\\" she said. President Zuma opened low-cost housing for poor black and white families in the Pretoria area, while Retired archbishop Desmond Tutu helped to paint a school outside Cape Town. US President Barack Obama also urged people to honour Mr Mandela on his birthday \\"through individual and collective acts of service\\". \\"Through our own lives, by heeding his example, we can honour the man who showed his own people - and the world - the path to justice, equality and freedom,\\" Mr Obama said. Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Tutu helps paint a school The South African government is hosting a ceremony for the symbolic handing over of Mr Mandela's new high-tech ID card, which will be received by Zindzi Mandela. The event is laden with meaning in a country where apartheid was enforced by pass books, which black citizens were forced to carry and which limited movement to certain areas at certain times. \\"On behalf of government and all the people of South Africa, we wish Madiba a joyous 95th birthday,\\" said Mr Zuma, using Mr Mandela's clan name. A group of young South African artists and designers unveiled a project celebrating Mr Mandela's life through paintings and posters. Mr Mandela's grandson Zondwa gives out food parcels to children The group whittled down 700 posters submitted by designers from more than 70 countries, to 95 for each year of Mr Mandela's life. A single special edition of the posters will be auctioned off to raise money for a proposed children's hospital that will be named after Mr Mandela, the group said. \\"He carries across this concept of humanity and selflessness,\\" said Mohammed Jogie, a co-founder of the project. Elsewhere world leaders, pop stars and companies also pledged their support for Mr Mandela. \\"I will also be giving my 67 minutes to make the world a better place, one small step at a time,\\" said Sir Richard Branson. The anti-apartheid leader's face has been captured in corn in Kent In the UK, a giant portrait of Mr Mandela's face has been etched into the English countryside to celebrate his birthday. The two-acre maze in corn crops in Birchington, near Margate, Kent, was the idea of Karen Botha and Dawn Tilley who have spent the past five years working on the design. Meanwhile, 50 abandoned street children in the Philippines will get to tour a Manila television studio and see performances by local artists. And the Australian city of Melbourne will hold a concert featuring local and African artists at the weekend, while a music festival later this year in Norway will promote equality in schools. ||||| PRETORIA South Africa and the world showered tributes on Nelson Mandela on Thursday as the anti-apartheid leader turned 95 in hospital and his doctors reported he was \\"steadily improving\\" from a six-week lung infection. The country has been on edge since the former president and father of the multi-racial 'Rainbow Nation' established at the end of apartheid in 1994 was admitted to hospital on June 8 with recurring lung problems that kept him in a critical condition. It was his fourth stay in hospital in six months and has reminded South Africans that the man who is globally admired as a moral beacon against injustice and a symbol of racial reconciliation will not be with them forever. But the mood was of celebration on Thursday as thousands of South Africans sang \\"Happy Birthday\\" and took part in charitable initiatives in a global outpouring of support for the Nobel Peace Prize laureate on U.N.-designated 'Nelson Mandela Day'. At a United Nations event in New York marking the day, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon hailed Mandela as \\"a giant of our times\\". Throughout the day, crowds of well-wishers outside the Pretoria hospital where the retired statesman is being treated sang \\"Happy Birthday, Madiba\\" - using Mandela's traditional clan name - brought cakes and birthday cards and danced. \\"Thank you for all that you have done for this country,\\" said one well-wisher, Margaret Chechie. Many South Africans also commemorated the birthday with 67 minutes of public service to honor the 67 years Mandela served humanity by first fighting against white-minority rule and then consolidating racial harmony when he was president. As part of the public service initiative, office workers, students, soldiers and ordinary citizens spruced up orphanages, painted walls at schools and delivered food to the poor. President Jacob Zuma visited Mandela at the hospital and said he was making steady progress. \\"I was able to say 'Happy Birthday' to him and he was able to smile,\\" he told reporters. Hours earlier, his office had cited Mandela's doctors saying \\"his health is steadily improving.\\" Mandela's victory in the first multiracial elections in 1994 put an end to the apartheid system. Four years earlier, he was released from 27 years spent in prison under white minority rule, 18 of them at the notorious Robben Island penal colony. His former wife Winnie Madikizela-Mandela called the 95th birthday \\"a gift to the nation\\". Family members had lunch together at the hospital where the revered patriarch is being treated and his daughter Zindzi said they gave him a collage of family photographs for a present. \\"Tata (our father) is making this remarkable progress and we look forward to having him back home soon,\\" Zindzi said. Grandson Ndaba Mandela was more cautious about Mandela's condition. \\"He's still critical ... he's just a lot more alert now, a lot more aware of his surroundings,\\" he told CBS News. \\"FIRST CITIZEN\\" Mandela Day celebrations in the United States included a special event at U.N. headquarters in New York, where figures such as former U.S. President Bill Clinton and the Reverend Jesse Jackson added their voices to the global tributes. Clinton, a personal friend of Mandela, recalled the nearly three decades the nonagenarian spent in apartheid jails. \\"Mandela walked out of prison after 27 years a greater man than he went in,\\" Clinton said. \\"Though he is old and frail and fighting for his life ... what is in his heart still glows in his smile and lights up the room through his eyes.\\" Volunteers in New York handed out South African oranges. In South Africa, Ethiopian and Nigerian asylum seekers who had settled their fleeing persecution and conflict in their own countries cleaned streets in Johannesburg expressed their praise for the personality considered \\"a father of Africa\\". \\"In this country, Mandela is the reason all of us blacks are free, so that's why we love him as the first citizen,\\" said Kennedy Uzondu, 30, a Nigerian trader in South Africa. Despite the adulation on his birthday, Mandela's post-apartheid 'Rainbow Nation' has not fulfilled all expectations. Enormous gaps still persist in income, employment and access to education and these inequalities largely follow racial lines, according to the government's own data. White households in 2012 earn on average about six times more than black households. Nevertheless, quality education and employment opportunities have also been opened up to tens of thousands of blacks.

In January 10, the batteries of the Nizam began bombarding the outer blockhouses of Chaul, reducing them to rubble after a few days. One such piece earned from the Portuguese the nickname \\"Orlando Furioso\\". At the same time, about 2,000 horsemen of the Nizam proceeded to devastate the lands owned by Portuguese around Bassein and Daman, but were repelled trying to assault a small Portuguese fort at Caranjá near Bombay, defended by 40 Portuguese soldiers. In February, a small fleet of 5 half-galleys and 25 smaller craft with 2,000 men from Calicut, commanded by Catiproca Marcá, arrived in Chaul to meet up with the forces of the Nizam, under cover from the night. The Portuguese had five galleys and eleven foists in the harbour, but the Malabarese avoided clashing with the Portuguese galleys. Fighting around Chaul broke down to trench warfare, as the army of Ahmadnagar dug trenches towards Portuguese lines to cover from their gunfire, amidst frequent Portuguese raids. The Portuguese dug counter-mines to neutralize them. In late February the Nizam ordered a general assault on the city, but was repelled with heavy losses, just as the Portuguese received important reinforcements by sea from Goa and Bassein. Fighting continued over the possession of the outer strongholds along the months of March, April and May, as the army of the Nizam suffered heavy casualties. Following a sortie of the Portuguese in April 11, the Nizam ordered the city to be subjected to a general bombardment, which demolished several strongholds and sunk the Viceroy's galley anchored in the harbour. In June 29, the Nizam ordered another mass assault but after six hours fighting, they were repelled, suffering over 3,000 dead.

Captured Moments by Will Shetterly I remember Papa's stopbox, a teal blue Tiempo Capturado that Mama brought home for his birthday. It was huge and inefficient, and she should never have spent so many pesos on a toy, but Papa would not let her return it. He used it to preserve baby tomatoes, cucumbers, and strawberries in translucent cubes that he stored in the pantry for spring-time meals in the middle of winter. Mama kept her mink jacket, a family hand-me-down, safe from time in a stopbox, and lent the capturador to my uncle for his stamp collection. Sometimes they would let us little ones to seal a treasured toy or a last piece of birthday cake until we begged them for its release, usually a few hours after enclosing it. When my father died, a year after my mother, my sisters and I cleaned out their apartment. We found our baby shoes protected in stopboxes. I took mine home, where they sat above my computer while I worked on my first play. One night when I did not believe love had ever existed for anyone, I used my own capturador, a sleek titanium Sanyo Tardar Ahora, to undo the stopbox. Bringing my face close to the shoes, I breathed deeply of air that my parents had trapped while closing up that symbol of their love for me. The instant would have been improved had my baby shoes been cleaned before they were encased. But as soon as I coughed, I laughed, and I did not try to kill myself that night.

Article: As a teacher, I always think it right to teach my students to write about their true feelings and real experiences. But once I was puzzled about this. After explaining a text one day, I asked my students to write a passage about their families. All the students wrote quite well but the best of them all was the one written by a small girl. I was deeply touched by it. The girl's father had died years before and her mother had to work hard to support the family. Many times she had seen her mother working deep into the night but never seen tears on her face. Like her mother this girl also works hard at her lessons and she is really good at any of them. I even didn't know anything about her unlucky family. She always appears happy every day so she is really liked by us all, both the students and teachers. In order to make her an example to the class, I read this passage to the class. When I finished reading it I found my throat _ and my students' eyes full of tears. Some of them even wept in a low voice. After the class nearly all my other students wanted to hand in their pocket money for the daily use to help this girl. To tell you the truth, I was really proud of my students. But to my disappointment, this student of mine left the class even without telling me the next day. I don't know the reason why, can you tell me? Question: Which of the following is TRUE according to the passage?

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Process: - A photovoltaic cell is created with two layers of semiconductor material - The top layer are &#x27;doped&#x27; with impurities to allow a negative charge - The bottom layer are &#x27;doped&#x27; to allow for a positive charge - This produces an electric field that allows electrons to flow from negative to positve - Sunlight enters the cell - Energy from sunlight knocks electrons loose in both fields - This prevents the flow of electrons from negative to positive - Adding an external circuit allows the exchange to continue - Give the cells owner a flow of electricity. Question: suppose less sunlight enters the cell happens, how will it affect electrons flow more. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","completion":"When less sunlight enters the photovoltaic cell, it will result in fewer photons available to interact with the semiconductor material, specifically the electrons within the material. Consequently, fewer electrons will be knocked loose in both the negatively charged (n-type) layer and the positively charged (p-type) layer. This reduction in the number of free electrons directly correlates to a decrease in the amount of energy that can be converted by the photovoltaic cell. As mentioned in the process, sunlight is required to allow the energy from photons to dislodge electrons and prompt the flow of electricity. With less sunlight, there will be a reduced amount of energy available to initiate this process. In comparison to the original scenario with more sunlight, the process of transferring electrons from the n-type to the p-type layer will still occur, albeit at a slower rate or with fewer electrons being transferred. Therefore, the electric field's ability to facilitate electron flow from the negative to positive layer is comparatively less effective. Now, let's consider the second effect mentioned in the process - the prevention of electron flow from the negative to the positive layer. Under normal circumstances, energy from sunlight is responsible for knocking electrons loose in both layers to create free electrons, which then creates an electron-hole pair that prevents their flow from negative to positive. However, given that less sunlight is entering the cell, the rate at which electron-hole pairs are formed is reduced. When there are fewer electron-hole pairs, the hindrance to electron flow from the negative side to the positive side is weakened. However, since less sunlight also results in a diminished overall availability of free electrons to flow through the external circuit and generate electricity, the overall electrical output of the photovoltaic cell will be lower. In summary, in the case where less sunlight enters the photovoltaic cell, there will be less energy available to knock electrons loose in both the n-type and p-type layers, resulting in a reduced electric output. Although the second effect mentioned, the prevention of electron flow from negative to positive, is slightly mitigated by the decrease in electron-hole pairs, this does not increase the overall electricity produced by the cell due to fewer free electrons available for transfer."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

My name is Marvin Wright and I am delighted to be standing here as your senior class president. First and foremost, I want to thank God for making all of this possible. Secondly, I would like to thank all of the parents and family members for the unconditional love you have provided my classmates and I during our unpredictable phases of life, for ultimately sticking with us through thick and thin, and giving us constant guidance. I would like to also thank the faculty and staff of Southwest for instilling knowledge and preparing us for the next chapter that we will soon embark on. And lastly, but certainly not least, I wouldl like to personally thank my mother, Jokita Wright, for all of the sacrifices you have made for my 2 siblings and I. Selfless, strong, determined, humorous, provider, protector are only a few attributes that exhibit who you are, which motivates me day to day. So, Thank you Mom! For without you I would not be standing here today. Now, class of 2017.... this it it! We have finally made it. There are no other people I’d rather have spent my high school years with than all of you. Most of the students in our graduating class have known each other since elementary school, which is an accumulation of 13 consecutive years. When we take a walk down memory lane we can all visualize ourselves being young, naïve, tiny elementary school kids who relied on nap time throughout Kindergarten, who look forward to recess every day, and counted down the days and minutes until the biggest event of elementary school…field day. Then we moved onto middle school where things didn’t work in our favor, such as me not hitting my intended growth spurt. Middle school was a transition period of having your own locker, having multiple teachers, dress codes were challenged in trying to figure out how to come up with your own “style” by also following the uniform guidelines, and athletics became an outlet for students who sought competition. Finally, we made it to high school. There was more freedom, better lunch choices, and opportunities for us to explore, to figure out who we are. It seems like yesterday we were timid freshmen excited to be part of the mature crowd, but unsure where we would fit in. For many of us, our first year in high school was a time where the temptation to look at your cell phone was unbearable and sometimes we caved in, which resulted in us getting our phones taken. Or how about when we attended our first Friday Night Lights football game in which we were able to stay out late and hang with our friends. Sophomore year then quickly approached us where we knew the routine and thought we knew it all, but in reality we were still being overlooked because we were still considered under classmen. Junior year, reality sunk in. We did all that we could to build up our resume by being committed to our academics, participating in varsity sports, and taking leadership positions in different clubs. We also took the necessary steps to prepare ourselves for the SAT and ACT, as well as faced the immense task of figuring out a timeline that will prepare us for after high school. I think it is safe to say that although junior year was the most stressful and challenging, it was the most rewarding. Once the class of 2016 walked across the stage we were finally seniors! The year we had been dreaming of since freshmen year, was finally here. There was so many things to look forward to: seniority, senior prom, senior picnic, receiving our caps and gowns, and the list goes on. As seniors everything seemed different…teachers became mentors, friends became family, and Southwest High School became home. Little did we know that this year would come at a blink of an eye and the past four years would boil down to this day where all the hard work, laughs, tears, and long hours will have paid off. Even though today is an accomplishment for the entire 2017 class and all of those who have helped us on this journey, it is going to take a lot of adjusting to get use to not seeing every single one of you on a daily basis. Even though I can't predict the future I know that we all have the ability to make a difference in this world. For you should have the mindset that not only will you graduate today, but everyday is a graduation. This ultimately means that graduation is a continuous process in which you should strive to true lifelong learning of continuous, self-motivated pursuit of knowledge for personal improvement. I am no expert in this journey we call life but we all have the ability to make a difference and to be that change the world needs. The past 13 years have equipped us for a time as this to stand bold in who we are. So I say to my classmates, cherish these last few minutes we spend here and the memories we have created and get ready for the journey ahead. Thank you guys for making my senior year better than I could ever imagine and for all the moments I will always hold dear to my heart. Thank you, and congratulations to the class of 2017!!! ||||| You must enter the characters with black color that stand out from the other characters Message: * A friend wanted you to see this item from WRAL.com: http://wr.al/18KAC — High school graduation day should be a celebration, but for one Edgecombe County senior, it is a day he will never forget. As Southwest Edgecombe County High School's senior class president, Marvin Wright was allowed to write a speech and read it aloud at graduation. \\"I really worked hard on this speech,\\" he said. Wright said on the day of graduation, he was told by school administrators that he would not be able to read his speech. He would have to read one the school wrote for him. \\"I think my classmates would like to hear what I have to say instead of the one you wrote for me,\\" Wright said. While on stage during the ceremony, Wright said he followed his heart and chose to read his speech instead. Read Marvin Wright's full speech In a video, the principal and other staff members are seen talking behind Wright, clearly upset he wasn't following orders given at graduation rehearsal. \\"My thing to him was to follow your heart,\\" his mother, Jokita Wright said. \\"He put God first. He spoke about parents, his classmates and spoke about his mom.\\" When Marvin Wright left the stage, he discovered the principal had taken his diploma. \\"(He said) 'Mom, they took my diploma, they won't give it to me,'\\" Jokita Wright said. \\"At that moment I was totally upset. I was upset.\\" \\"I only have one chance to graduate from high school and it was really an embarrassing moment,\\" said Marvin Wright. Jada Barnes, a fellow classmate, called the principal's actions disrespectful. \\"His diploma was taken...it was hurtful not only to him and his family, but to all of us,\\" Barnes said. The school system gave no specific reason for wanting Wright to recite their simple, short paragraph. Sources told WRAL News Wright's speech was too long and that he failed to meet an approval deadline. Wright said he was not aware of any deadline. In a statement to WRAL News, a school spokesperson said there was nothing wrong with the content of Wright's speech. \\"The expectation is that all graduation speakers read the speech that has been prepared and placed at the podium...It is very unfortunate that his diploma was pulled and it should not have happened. An apology has been issued to Marvin and his family,\\" the statement said. Wright said that since it was a last-minute decision to read his speech, he did not have a hard copy and had to read it off his phone. This violated school guidelines. Wright's principal, Craig Harris, hand-delivered his diploma to his home Sunday afternoon, and the superintendent apologized via phone. WRAL News reached out to school administrators for additional comments, but no additonal information was made availible. Wright is now headed into the Navy this fall. ||||| Marvin Wright's high school diploma was withheld on June 9 after he refused to read a speech written by the school's administrators. (Amber Ferguson/The Washington Post) Marvin Wright, president of his high school senior class, spent two weeks working on his graduation speech, staying up till 5 on the morning of the event to finish. But later that day, the principal of Southwest Edgecombe High in Pinetops, N.C., told him he would be giving a different address, a five-sentence paragraph prepared by the school administrators. He gave him no explanation. “I felt robbed of a chance to say my own words,” Marvin, 18, told The Washington Post. His mother, classmates and teachers urged him to give his speech anyway. When he stepped onto the stage at the end of the commencement ceremony Friday, he opened up a folder under the podium containing the school’s prepared remarks: I would like to thank all of our friends and family for being here tonight. I would also like to address my fellow graduates one last time before we leave this gym. Although we may all never be in the same room at the same time again, we will always share the memories that we created within these walls. And no matter what we all do after graduation, never forget that this is one place that we all have in common, this place is home. Congratulations graduates, we did it! But instead of delivering those words, he took out his cellphone and read a copy of his original speech, with his friends in the audience nodding to him in encouragement. Sitting behind Marvin, the principal, Craig Harris, immediately turned to another staff member, whispering with a look of disapproval, video footage shows. After the applause and final procession, all of the students lined up to receive their official diplomas. But one folder in the stack was missing: Marvin’s. His senior adviser informed him the principal had removed the diploma because Marvin had read the wrong speech. “All my friends were outside with their big yellow folders taking pictures and I was still inside, trying to get my diploma,” Marvin said. “I was really hurt and embarrassed, basically humiliated.” The teenager and his mother, Jokita Wright, accused the school of not only censoring a student’s words but then retaliating against him by withholding his diploma. The mother complained to the principal, who explained to her that her son had missed a deadline to submit the speech to the school. Marvin says he never knew about it. Marvin did not receive his diploma for another two days, when the principal dropped it off at his home at the request of the superintendent. The principal handed him the diploma, saying only, “If your mom has any questions just give me a call.” Then he left. [N.Y. subway breakdown inspires makeshift graduation on the E train] Edgecombe County Schools Superintendent John Farrelly called Marvin on Monday to apologize for the way the school handled the situation on commencement day. “I have communicated with the family to apologize on behalf of the school,” Farrelly said in a statement to the Wilson Times. “The diploma never should have been taken from the student.” Farrelly said he did not have any problems with the content of the teenager’s speech but was concerned about Marvin’s use of a cellphone and the decision to change course at the last minute. “There is an expectation that is communicated to all graduation speakers that the prepared and practiced speech is the speech to be delivered during the ceremony,” Farrelly said. “That was made extremely clear to the speakers. The student did not follow those expectations.” In the fall, when Marvin was elected senior class president, his adviser informed him he would have to write a graduation speech. He says he wasn’t given any guidance, so he sought out tips from the previous year’s senior class president, and listened to numerous commencement speeches online for ideas. His English teacher told him she approved of the speech. Marvin even left a copy of the remarks on his principal’s desk for review on commencement day. Still, administrators insisted he should read the address they prepared. But Marvin gave the speech he wanted to give, recounting memories he shared with his classmates through elementary, middle and high school. Though he stumbled a few times — distracted by the conversations taking place behind him and struggling to read from his phone — Marvin’s speech was welcomed with cheers and laughs from the audience. [ICE nabs teenager hours before his senior prom, days before his graduation ceremony] In his approximately five-minute address, he thanked God, the family members of the graduates, the school’s faculty and his mom — who was watching in the bleachers in tears. “This is it,” Marvin said. “We have finally made it.” He talked about playing at recess in elementary school, dealing with the “transition period” of middle school, when “things didn’t work out in our favor.” Finally, he talked about his senior year. “Everything seemed different,” he said. “Teachers became mentors, friends became family, and Southwest Edgecombe High became home.” “I am no expert in this journey we call life, but we all have the ability to make a difference and to be that change the world needs,” Wright continued. “The past 13 years have equipped us for a time as this to stand bold in who we are. So I say to my classmates, cherish these last few minutes we spend here and the memories we have created and get ready for the journey ahead.” Marvin was his mother’s last child to graduate high school. His relatives drove to watch him speak and receive his diploma. While she’s glad he gave an address in his own words, Jokita Wright wished her son could have left the school that day with the diploma he rightfully earned, she said. “He can’t get that day back,” his mother said. “That was a special moment for me, it was a special moment for him.” Luckily, Marvin received the diploma just in time for the day he needed it most. On Monday, he officially committed to entering the U.S. Navy, after which he hopes to study pediatric surgery. The high school graduate will report for duty on Oct. 10. ||||| Thank you for being one of our most loyal readers. Please consider supporting community journalism by subscribing.

Despite spending two weeks writing and perfecting his commencement speech, he was told by the school principal, Craig Harris, that he had to read a speech written by the school administrators instead. The school's decision to replace Marvin's speech was allegedly due to its length and because he failed to meet an approval deadline - a deadline Marvin claims he was unaware of. Nonetheless, Marvin decided to follow his heart and read his original speech instead of the one provided by the school. As a result, his diploma was temporarily withheld after the ceremony, causing him embarrassment.

Farrelly stated that while there was no issue with the content of Marvin's speech, his use of a cellphone and last-minute change were the main concerns.

Answer a question about this article: Though the iPod was released in 2001, its price and Mac-only compatibility caused sales to be relatively slow until 2004. The iPod line came from Apple's \\"digital hub\\" category, when the company began creating software for the growing market of personal digital devices. Digital cameras, camcorders and organizers had well-established mainstream markets, but the company found existing digital music players \\"big and clunky or small and useless\\" with user interfaces that were \\"unbelievably awful,\\" so Apple decided to develop its own. As ordered by CEO Steve Jobs, Apple's hardware engineering chief Jon Rubinstein assembled a team of engineers to design the iPod line, including hardware engineers Tony Fadell and Michael Dhuey, and design engineer Sir Jonathan Ive. Rubinstein had already discovered the Toshiba disk drive when meeting with an Apple supplier in Japan, and purchased the rights to it for Apple, and had also already worked out how the screen, battery, and other key elements would work. The aesthetic was inspired by the 1958 Braun T3 transistor radio designed by Dieter Rams, while the wheel based user interface was prompted by Bang & Olufsen's BeoCom 6000 telephone.

Summarize this article: Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney may have delivered control of the House to the Democrats by putting the Medicare issue center-stage in the November election and selecting Rep.

I would have said to you then we were dead even. Well, the momentum is very much with us, the Medicare issue in this campaign,\\" Pelosi said. \\"We have the message, We have the messengers. We have the money. We have the mobilization. We have a very excellent chance to take back the House.\\" Ryan's budget proposal calls for converting part of the Medicare program to a government subsidy that would help senior citizens buy private insurance. Republicans say seniors would still have the choice of remaining in the traditional government-run Medicare program, but Democrats view the GOP plan as a transition that would shift future cost increases in medical care to seniors. Romney says he has not fully adopted Ryan's plan.

It may indeed occur in other circumstances,\\" Rice said on \\"Fox News Sunday.\\" \\"But there's no predicting exactly what the trajectory of this is. Obviously the last several days have been somewhat better, but we are very vigilant.\\" Rice said that the overseas unrest at U.S. posts, including the attack on the consulate in Benghazi, Libya, that left ambassador Christopher Stevens and three others dead last week are the result of an anti-Muslim movie trailer - not an attack on U.S. policy. \\"This is not an expression of hostility in the broadest sense towards the United States or to U.S. policy.

It's disgraceful that the Obama administration's first response was not to condemn attacks on our diplomatic missions, but to sympathize with those who waged the attacks,” Romney said last week in a release criticizing the Cairo statement.

Then after 9/11, it was a confrontation with the terrorists and Al Qaeda. Now it's ddisengangment,\\" he said. \\"We're leaving Iraq. We're leaving Afghanistan. We're leaving the area.

And I was wondering How would Cameron feel afterwards? A:","completion":"To determine how Cameron would feel after believing Ash's hazel eyes without any direct evidence, we will follow these steps: 1. Consider Cameron's personality traits and how they relate to trust and beliefs. 2. Analyze the context of the situation and the relationship between Cameron and Ash. 3. Reflect on the potential outcomes of the belief and how they could impact Cameron's emotions. Step 1: Considering Cameron's personality traits Let's assume that Cameron is a trusting person who tends to believe people, even without concrete evidence. This characteristic could make them more likely to believe Ash's hazel eyes claim without needing proof. Step 2: Analyzing the context and the relationship between Cameron and Ash Now, we need to understand the context of the situation and the nature of their relationship. If Cameron and Ash are close friends, it's more likely that Cameron trusts Ash and their feelings about the hazel eyes. If they are strangers or acquaintances, Cameron might feel more uncertain. Step 3: Reflecting on potential outcomes and their emotional impact on Cameron Lastly, we need to consider how believing Ash's hazel eyes without evidence could play out. There are a few possible scenarios here: - Scenario 1: Ash is telling the truth, and Cameron feels satisfied and glad that they trusted their friend. - Scenario 2: Cameron discovers evidence later that corroborates Ash's claim, leading to a sense of relief and validation. - Scenario 3: Cameron learns that Ash was not being truthful or was mistaken, leading to feelings of betrayal and disappointment. Conclusion: Cameron's feelings after believing Ash's hazel eyes without direct evidence would depend on their personality, the context of the situation, and the outcomes of the belief. If Cameron is naturally trusting and the outcome is positive, they will likely feel satisfied and trusting. If the outcome reveals that Ash was untruthful or mistaken, Cameron might feel disappointed or betrayed."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The Smashing Pumpkins (or Smashing Pumpkins) are an American alternative rock band from Chicago, Illinois. Formed in 1988 by frontman Billy Corgan (lead vocals, guitar), D'arcy Wretzky (bass), James Iha (guitar), and Jimmy Chamberlin (drums), the band has undergone many line-up changes. The current lineup features Corgan, Chamberlin, Iha and guitarist Jeff Schroeder. Disavowing the punk rock roots of many of their alt-rock contemporaries, they have a diverse, densely layered, and guitar-heavy sound, containing elements of gothic rock, heavy metal, dream pop, psychedelic rock, progressive rock, shoegazing, and electronica in later recordings. Corgan is the group's primary songwriter; his musical ambitions and cathartic lyrics have shaped the band's albums and songs, which have been described as \\"anguished, bruised reports from Billy Corgan's nightmare-land\\".The Smashing Pumpkins broke into the musical mainstream with their second album, 1993's Siamese Dream. The group built its audience with extensive touring and their 1995 follow-up, the double album Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness, debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 album chart. With 30 million albums sold worldwide, the Smashing Pumpkins were one of the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed bands of the 1990s. However, internal fighting, drug use, and diminishing record sales led to a 2000 break-up. In 2006, Corgan and Chamberlin reconvened to record a new Smashing Pumpkins album, Zeitgeist. After touring throughout 2007 and 2008 with a lineup including new guitarist Jeff Schroeder, Chamberlin left the band in early 2009. Later that year, Corgan began a new recording series with a rotating lineup of musicians entitled Teargarden by Kaleidyscope, which encompassed the release of stand-alone singles, compilation EP releases, and two full albums that also fell under the project's scope—Oceania in 2012 and Monuments to an Elegy in 2014.

Q:Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the name of the school that was attended by the person who was notable for being involved in the Profumo affair? Before the 1760s, Westgate consisted of only a farm, a coastguard station (built 1791 and still standing in Old Boundary Road) and a few cottages for the crew that surrounded it. These were located beside the coast at St Mildred's Bay, named after Mildrith, Thanet's patron saint and a one-time Abbess of Minster. The town inherited its name from the Westgate Manor, which was located in the area in medieval times. In the early 20th century, the remains of a Roman villa were discovered in what is now Beach Road, where a stream once used to flow. Fresh water can still be seen rising from the sand at low tide. During the late 1860s, businessmen developed the area into a seaside resort for the upper to middle-classes. A stretch of sea wall, with promenade on top, was constructed around the beaches at St Mildred's Bay and West Bay, and the land divided into plots to be sold for what would become an exclusive development by the sea for wealthy metropolitan families within a gated community, rather than for occasional tourists. The opening of a railway station, in 1871, led to the rapid expansion of the population, which reached 2,738 by 1901. The demands of the increasing population led to the building of the parish churches of St. James in 1872 and St. Saviour in 1884. St. Saviour's was designed by the architect C.N. Beazley. In 1884 it was reported that Essex, on the other side of the Thames Estuary, was hit by a tremor so large that it caused the bells of St. James' Church to ring. In 1884, ownership of most of the resort passed to Coutts Bank, after the previous proprietors had gone bankrupt.Around twenty schools were opened during the late 19th century, although many had only a few pupils or closed within a few years. The largest of the schools were Streete Court School, Wellington House Preparatory School and St Michael's School.Wellington House was established in 1886 by two clergymen, the Bull brothers.

As they work to gather local residents' accounts of the site's utilization, their efforts exemplify the ongoing struggle between economic progress and environmental conservation. Background and Context In a bid to accommodate the growing traffic demands and improve motorist experiences, plans for a new, state-of-the-art £40 million service station near the M1 have been revealed. This development, while promising economic gains and better roadside facilities, presents significant potential repercussions for the surrounding environment and local communities. The proposed site, which is located within a pristine and biodiverse woodland area, has long been a natural refuge, a haven for wildlife, and a cherished leisure space for nearby residents. Faced with potential negative impacts on the environment and local quality of life, campaigners have taken up the mantle of protecting the woodland from destruction. They now seek to present compelling evidence demonstrating the importance and widespread use of the woodland by residents, hoping to protect its integrity and support sustainable alternatives. Perspectives of the Campaigners At the heart of the campaigners' arguments is the value of preserving the natural environment for present and future generations. For them, safeguarding the woodland from encroaching development is about defending a natural legacy, nurturing a healthy relationship with nature, and promoting an ecologically sound vision for the future. Critics of the service station proposal point to a range of environmental concerns, including: 1. Habitat Destruction: The construction of a large commercial facility in a wooded area would invariably result in significant habitat loss. This could lead to the displacement or even extinction of local fauna and flora, ultimately disrupting the delicate balance of the woodland ecosystem. 2. Pollution: The introduction of a service station would mean an increase in pollution from vehicle emissions and lighting, further degrading the quality of the local environment. This could have ripple effects on surrounding habitats, impacting air and water quality and wildlife health. 3. Urban Sprawl and Loss of Green Spaces: The development of a service station could trigger urban sprawl, as other businesses and infrastructure projects follow suit. This could lead to further loss of green spaces and undermine local efforts to preserve biodiversity, reduce pollution, and ensure access to natural spaces for recreation and relaxation. The Evidence-Gathering Effort In their appeal for evidence of the site's use by residents, the campaigners are pursuing a two-pronged approach: 1. Collecting Testimonies: Compiling personal stories, accounts, and experiences of local residents who have long enjoyed the picturesque woodland can effectively paint a vivid picture of the site's cultural and social significance, bolstering the case for its preservation. 2. Documenting Recreational Use: Gathering data on the frequency, variety, and types of recreational activities that take place in the woodland, such as hiking, birdwatching, and picnicking, can illustrate the significant role the area plays in promoting wellbeing and fostering community connections. Considering Alternative Solutions As public sentiment and global trends increasingly lean toward environmentally-conscious policies and urban planning, exploring alternative solutions that prioritize sustainable growth becomes all the more pressing. In the case of the £40m service station, this might mean identifying alternative locations that present fewer ecological risks or investing in greener infrastructure to minimize environmental impact. Conclusion The passionate campaign driven by concerned residents against the £40m service station development highlights an ongoing tension between modern development plans and environmental preservation. As they gather evidence to support their case and present feasible alternatives, these campaigners encourage a broader conversation about our collective responsibility to value and protect our natural landscapes for the sake of a more sustainable future."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

During 2012 the first wave of 'city deals' recognised the eight cities as \\"the largest and most economically important English cities outside of (sic) London\\". - A conurbation is a region comprising a number of cities, large towns, and other urban areas that, through population growth and physical expansion, have merged to form one continuous urban or industrially developed area. In most cases, a conurbation is a polycentric urbanised area, in which transportation has developed to link areas to create a single urban labour market or travel to work area. - North Shields is a town on the north bank of the River Tyne, in the metropolitan borough of North Tyneside, Tyne and Wear in North East England. Historically part of Northumberland, it is located eight miles (13 km) east-north east of Newcastle upon Tyne. - Northumberland is a county in North East England. The northernmost county of England, it borders Cumbria to the west, County Durham and Tyne and Wear to the south and Scotland to the north. To the east is the North Sea coastline with a long distance path. The county town is Alnwick although the county council is in Morpeth (for the moment, as there are plans to move it to nearby Ashington). The northernmost point of Northumberland and England is at Marshall Meadows Bay. - The North Sea is a marginal sea of the Atlantic Ocean located between Great Britain, Scandinavia, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, and France. An epeiric (or \\"shelf\\") sea on the European continental shelf, it connects to the ocean through the English Channel in the south and the Norwegian Sea in the north. It is more than long and wide, with an area of around . - Edinburgh is the capital city of Scotland and one of its 32 local government council areas. Located in Lothian on the Firth of Forth's southern shore, it is Scotland's second most populous city and the seventh most populous in the United Kingdom. The 2014 official population estimates are 464,990 for the city of Edinburgh, 492,680 for the local authority area, and 1,339,380 for the city region as of 2014 (Edinburgh lies at the heart of the proposed Edinburgh and South East Scotland city region). Recognised as the capital of Scotland since at least the 15th century, Edinburgh is home to the Scottish Parliament and the seat of the monarchy in Scotland. The city is also the annual venue of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland and home to national institutions such as the National Museum of Scotland, the National Library of Scotland and the Scottish National Gallery. It is the largest financial centre in the UK after London. - EUROCITIES is the network of major European cities, founded in 1986 by the mayors of Barcelona, Birmingham, Frankfurt, Lyon, Milan, and Rotterdam. The 1989 Barcelona conference agreed that a key task was to put the issue of cities and their economic, political and social development onto the European agenda. Indeed, the founders suggested that major European cities could benefit from forming such an association. They intended to form a political platform to act as a channel for communicating with the European institutions and to become recognised as a significant partner in the European community and each member state. - The River Tyne is a river in North East England and its length (excluding tributaries) is . It is formed by the confluence of two rivers: the North Tyne and the South Tyne. These two rivers converge at Warden Rock near Hexham in Northumberland at a place dubbed 'The Meeting of the Waters'. - Tyneside is a conurbation in North East England which includes a number of settlements on the banks of the River Tyne. As defined by the Office for National Statistics, the conurbation comprises Newcastle upon Tynea city forming the urban coreas well as a number of other towns including Gateshead, Tynemouth, Wallsend, South Shields, and Jarrow. The population of the conurbation was 774,891 according to the 2011 census. - The A186 road is a road in England connecting Newcastle upon Tyne and North Shields .

Article: According to the Internal Revenue Service, a FMV is an estimate of the sales amount that a private seller and buyer would agree to for a vehicle. In contrast, a trade-in value is what a dealership would offer. It’s also important to note that the FMV is calculated based on the actions of willing buyers/sellers, not ones under duress. Trade-in values for used cars are also often altered by dealers to boost vehicle sales. An FMV estimate is more consistent. If you are looking up an estimate for someone else or if you are researching an older vehicle, you may not know every detail requested by the website. That’s okay. Enter in a number of years or a series of options to create a workable value range. For example, if you know that the car was made in the late 1990s, enter in 1996, 1997, 1998, and, 1999. Note how the values differ with each year. Look at the automobile listings in your local newspaper. Or, go to a used auto sales website such as www.autotrader.com, enter in your zipcode, and search for similar cars in your area. Make note of the asking prices for cars that are similar to your own. For example, if you are selling a 1999 Mustang and see a 2000 model in your local paper, note the price. It’s probably a bit higher than your car’s FMV, but may be pretty close to it. What is a summary?","completion":"So, imagine you've got a toy car you want to swap with your friend. A Fair Market Value (FMV) is like a guess of how many toy blocks your friend might trade you for your car. It's what you both would happily agree on. On the other hand, a Trade-in value is like trying to swap your toy car at a toy store. The store might offer you less blocks than your friend, because they want to sell it for more blocks later. FMV is usually more fair because it is decided by people who really want to trade, not people who do it because they are forced to. When we don't know all the details about a toy car (maybe you forgot which year you got it), we can think about a range of years or options it might be, and that can help us guess the value. To find out more, we can look at what other toy cars like ours are being traded for.

Stochastic computing was first introduced in a pioneering paper by von Neumann in 1953. However, the theory could not be implemented until advances in computing of the 1960s. He also created the field of cellular automata without the aid of computers, constructing the first self-replicating automata with pencil and graph paper. The concept of a universal constructor was fleshed out in his posthumous work Theory of Self Reproducing Automata. Von Neumann proved that the most effective way of performing large-scale mining operations such as mining an entire moon or asteroid belt would be by using self-replicating spacecraft, taking advantage of their exponential growth. His rigorous mathematical analysis of the structure of self-replication (of the semiotic relationship between constructor, description and that which is constructed), preceded the discovery of the structure of DNA. Beginning in 1949, von Neumann's design for a self-reproducing computer program is considered the world's first computer virus, and he is considered to be the theoretical father of computer virology.

For example, we must judge whether the person in the library is a reader or a librarian, whether the telephone caller is a friend or a salesman and so on. Our statuses often vary with the people we meet, and change through life. Most of us can, at very high speed, assume the different statuses that various situations require. Much of social communication consists of recognizing and selecting among proper statuses and allowing other people to assume their statuses in relation to us.

A country may be an independent sovereign state or one that is occupied by another state, as a non-sovereign or formerly sovereign political division, or a geographic region associated with sets of previously independent or differently associated people with distinct political characteristics. Regardless of the physical geography, in the modern internationally accepted legal definition as defined by the League of Nations in 1937 and reaffirmed by the United Nations in 1945, a resident of a country is subject to the independent exercise of legal jurisdiction. - Bexley is an area of south-east London, England and part of the London Borough of Bexley. It is located east-southeast of Charing Cross. It was an ancient parish in the county of Kent. As part of the suburban growth of London in the 20th century, Bexley increased in population, becoming a municipal borough in 1935 and has formed part of Greater London since 1965. - An architect is someone who plans, designs, and reviews the construction of buildings. To \\"practice architecture\\" means to provide services in connection with the design of buildings and the space within the site surrounding the buildings, that have as their principal purpose human occupancy or use. Etymologically, \\"architect\\" derives from the Latin \\"architectus\\", which derives from the Greek \\" (\\"arkhi-\\", chief + \\"tekton\\", builder), i.e., chief builder. - The Celtic Sea (; ) is the area of the Atlantic Ocean off the south coast of Ireland bounded to the east by Saint George's Channel; other limits include the Bristol Channel, the English Channel, and the Bay of Biscay, as well as adjacent portions of Wales, Cornwall, Devon, and Brittany. The southern and western boundaries are delimited by the continental shelf, which drops away sharply. The Isles of Scilly are an archipelago of small islands in the sea. - Scotland (Scots: ) is a country that is part of the United Kingdom and covers the northern third of the island of Great Britain. It shares a border with England to the south, and is otherwise surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to the east and the North Channel and Irish Sea to the south-west. In addition to the mainland, the country is made up of more than 790 islands, including the Northern Isles and the Hebrides. - William Morris (24 March 1834 3 October 1896) was an English textile designer, poet, novelist, translator, and socialist activist. Associated with the British Arts and Crafts Movement, he was a major contributor to the revival of traditional British textile arts and methods of production. His literary contributions helped to establish the modern fantasy genre, while he played a significant role in propagating the early socialist movement in Britain. - The English Channel (\\"the Sleeve\\" [hence ] \\"Sea of Brittany\\" \\"British Sea\\"), also called simply the Channel, is the body of water that separates southern England from northern France, and joins the southern part of the North Sea to the rest of the Atlantic Ocean. - The London Plan is the statutory spatial development strategy for the Greater London area in the United Kingdom that is written by the Mayor of London and published by the Greater London Authority. The regional planning document was first published in final form on 10 February 2004. In addition to minor alterations, it was substantially revised and republished in February 2008 and again in July 2011. The London Plan published in July 2011 is currently in effect and has 2031 as a formal end date. minor alterations are being made to the plan to comply with the National Planning Policy Framework and other changes in national policy. - Borders are geographic boundaries of political entities or legal jurisdictions, such as governments, sovereign states, federated states, and other subnational entities. Some borderssuch as a state's internal administrative border, or inter-state borders within the Schengen Areaare often open and completely unguarded. Other borders are partially or fully controlled, and may be crossed legally only at designated border checkpoints and border zones may be controlled. Mostly contentious, borders may even foster the setting up of buffer zones. A difference has also been established in academic scholarship between border and frontier, the latter denoting a state of mind rather than state boundaries. - Fantasy is a fiction genre set in an imaginary universe, often but not always without any locations, events, or people from the real world. Most fantasy uses magic or other supernatural elements as a main plot element, theme, or setting. Magic and magical creatures are common in many of these imaginary worlds. Fantasy is generally distinguished from the genres of science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three, all of which are subgenres of speculative fiction. - The Arts and Crafts movement was an international movement in the decorative and fine arts that began in Britain and flourished in Europe and North America between 1880 and 1910, emerging in Japan in the 1920s. It stood for traditional craftsmanship using simple forms, and often used medieval, romantic, or folk styles of decoration. It advocated economic and social reform and was essentially anti-industrial. It had a strong influence on the arts in Europe until it was displaced by Modernism in the 1930s, and its influence continued among craft makers, designers, and town planners long afterwards. - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom.

It has common borders with the London Borough of Bromley to the south, the Royal Borough of Greenwich to the west, across the River Thames to the north it borders the London Borough of Havering, the London Borough of Barking and Dagenham and there is a small boundary with the unitary authority of Thurrock in Essex to the north-east. There is a border with Dartford borough to the east and Sevenoaks district to the south-east, both being in the ceremonial county of Kent. The London Borough of Bexley is within the Thames Gateway, an area designated as a national priority for urban regeneration. The local authority is Bexley London Borough Council. - Textile design is essentially the process of creating designs for woven, knitted or printed fabrics or surface ornamented fabrics. Textile designers are involved with the production of these designs, which are used, sometimes repetitively, in clothing and interior decor items. - Red House is a significant Arts and Crafts building located in the town of Bexleyheath in Southeast London , England . Co-designed in 1859 by the architect Philip Webb and the designer William Morris , it was created to serve as a family home for the latter , with construction being completed in 1860 . It is recognised as one of the most important examples of nineteenth - century British architecture still extant . - Great Britain, also known as Britain , is a large island in the north Atlantic Ocean off the northwest coast of continental Europe. With an area of , Great Britain is the largest European island and the ninth-largest in the world. In 2011 the island had a population of about 61 million people, making it the world's third-most populous island after Java in Indonesia and Honshu in Japan. The island of Ireland is situated to the west of it, and together these islands, along with over 1,000 smaller surrounding islands, comprise the British Isles archipelago. - London is the capital and most populous city of England and the United Kingdom, as well as the most populous city proper in the European Union. Standing on the River Thames in the south east of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded by the Romans, who named it \\"Londinium\\". London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its medieval boundaries. Since at least the 19th century, \\"London\\" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which today largely makes up Greater London, governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly. - The North Sea is a marginal sea of the Atlantic Ocean located between Great Britain, Scandinavia, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, and France. An epeiric (or \\"shelf\\") sea on the European continental shelf, it connects to the ocean through the English Channel in the south and the Norwegian Sea in the north.

The three Kansas militiamen planned to blow up an apartment complex housing Somali refugees during the 2016 presidential election, unleashing what one of them called \\"Crusades 2.0.\\" But their plan was foiled after their arrest just weeks before the election, highlighting the changing enemy list of a movement founded on the back of anti-government activism a generation ago. And with the election of a president whose policies many militia members support, the urge to confront the government appears to have lost some of its urgency. Instead of railing at the government, they have in recent years turned their venom against new-found foes: Muslims, immigrants, the Antifa. \\"Some of the militia groups have been refocusing their attention on secondary enemies for the movement,\\" said Mark Pitcavage, who researches extremism at the Anti-Defamation League civil rights group. Often lumped together with other right-wing groups, the anti-government movement comes in different forms. There are the \\"preppers,\\" so called because they stockpile water, food and other essentials in preparation for civil unrest. There are the \\"survivalists,\\" people who learn skills to “live off the land” in case of a disaster. There are “sovereign citizens” such as the suspect in the recent shooting at a Waffle House in Tennessee who are opposed to paying taxes and believe they should decide which laws to follow. And then there are the militiamen who conduct regular military-style training to resist a government they see as engaged in a global plot to take away their guns and constitutional rights. The modern militia movement dates back to a series of events in the early 1990s, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center. Among them: the 1992 election of Democratic President Bill Clinton and an FBI attack the following year on the Branch Davidian compound in Waco, Texas, an event seen as \\"evidence of an out of control government willing to attack citizens.\\" Under Clinton, the number...

Today, I want to tell you about a really cool rugby game that happened. Sometimes, when we watch our favorite sports, we see exciting matches where teams work super hard and win in the end. That's exactly what happened in this rugby game! In the beginning, there were two rugby teams that were going to play a game. One team was called Connacht, and the other team was called Newport Gwent Dragons. Both teams were really good at playing rugby, and they both really wanted to win. The name of the competition they were playing in is called Pro12. Do you know how rugby is played? It's like when you and your friends are playing tag, but there's also a ball you need to run with, and sometimes you need to catch it or pass it to your friends on the same team. It's really fun, and sometimes the games can be really close, just like this one. During this rugby game, the Newport Gwent Dragons were playing really well at the start. But the Connacht team didn't give up. They kept trying and working hard, just like how you should never give up when you're playing a game or doing a task. Then, something amazing happened! The Connacht team started to play even better, and they started to score more points, which means they were getting closer and closer to winning the game. This is called a \\"late surge\\" because they started playing better later in the game. At the end of the game, Connacht continued to play really well and even scored some extra points. This is called a \\"bonus-point win\\" because they got more points than they needed to win the game. It was a really big victory for Connacht, and now they moved to the top of the Pro12 competition. So, what can we learn from this great rugby game? It's important to never give up and always try your best, just like the Connacht team did! And when you and your friends play games together or do anything else in life, remember that working hard and never giving up can lead to big victories!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Single/multi-select question: Do the following sentences say the same thing? \\"Close co-operation between law-enforcement agencies and intelligence services lie at the heart of the ongoing fight against terrorism,\\" Mr Howard said. Close cooperation between regional law enforcement agencies and intelligence services was at the heart of the fight against terrorism, he said. Return your answer on a scale from 0 to 5, where 0 is \\"not similar\\" and 5 is \\"very similar\\". Choices: -0 -1 -2 -3 -4 -5","completion":"Based on a close examination of the two sentences, it is clear that they convey a similar meaning. However, there are certain discrepancies that prevent them from being identical. Let us dissect each sentence to juxtapose their message. Sentence 1: \\"Close co-operation between law-enforcement agencies and intelligence services lie at the heart of the ongoing fight against terrorism,\\" Mr Howard said. In this sentence, Mr. Howard emphasizes the importance of \\"close co-operation\\" between law-enforcement agencies and intelligence services in the \\"ongoing\\" fight against terrorism. The term \\"ongoing\\" suggests that the battle is continuous and is still happening at the time of the statement. Sentence 2: Close cooperation between regional law enforcement agencies and intelligence services was at the heart of the fight against terrorism, he said. Here, Mr. Howard underscores the significance of \\"close cooperation\\" involving \\"regional law enforcement agencies\\" and intelligence services in the fight against terrorism. However, the use of \\"was\\" indicates a past event or a statement referring to a particular point in time. From this analysis, the key differences are: 1. Sentence 1 describes the cooperation as a crucial element in an \\"ongoing\\" fight against terrorism, while Sentence 2 alludes to a past event or a specific moment in time. 2. Sentence 2 specifically mentions \\"regional law enforcement agencies\\", adding a geographic aspect to the cooperation. In contrast, Sentence 1 does not specify the scope of the law enforcement agencies involved in the cooperation. Despite these differences, the overall message conveyed in both sentences—that close cooperation between law enforcement agencies and intelligence services is essential in combating terrorism—is quite similar. Consequently, on a scale from 0 to 5, where 0 is \\"not similar\\" and 5 is \\"very similar\\", the comparison between these two sentences would be rated as a 4. Since they convey a closely related meaning, but with subtle variations in regards to the timeline and specificity of the agencies involved, they cannot be considered identical statements."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Given the following passage \\"After Cassander's death in 298 BCE, however, Demetrius, who still maintained a sizable loyal army and fleet, invaded Macedon, seized the Macedonian throne (294) and conquered Thessaly and most of central Greece (293-291). He was defeated in 288 BC when Lysimachus of Thrace and Pyrrhus of Epirus invaded Macedon on two fronts, and quickly carved up the kingdom for themselves. Demetrius fled to central Greece with his mercenaries and began to build support there and in the northern Peloponnese. He once again laid siege to Athens after they turned on him, but then struck a treaty with the Athenians and Ptolemy, which allowed him to cross over to Asia minor and wage war on Lysimachus' holdings in Ionia, leaving his son Antigonus Gonatas in Greece. After initial successes, he was forced to surrender to Seleucus in 285 and later died in captivity. Lysimachus, who had seized Macedon and Thessaly for himself, was forced into war when Seleucus invaded his territories in Asia minor and was defeated and killed in 281 BCE at the Battle of Corupedium, near Sardis. Seleucus then attempted to conquer Lysimachus' European territories in Thrace and Macedon, but he was assassinated by Ptolemy Ceraunus (\\"the thunderbolt\\"), who had taken refuge at the Seleucid court and then had himself acclaimed as king of Macedon. Ptolemy was killed when Macedon was invaded by Gauls in 279, his head stuck on a spear and the country fell into anarchy.

There was a huge corporation in which I had a contract with. I was called in, to help them uncover what they considered “a very serious series of incidents”. Their own “in house” attempts were fruitless. It turned out, they had an over-sized engineering department, and that it had been announced that this would be scaled back due to completion of contracts. Someone though, within the engineering department, was sabotaging the continued work, slowing the completion. I was to go undercover, posing as a visiting engineer from a distant plant, and find out who the perpetrator/s were, as they wished to file legal action. So, this is at the corporate headquarters, in the late 1980’s. These people were making 6 figure incomes easily. That being said, you kind of expect a bit more of a dignified behavior here than you would with a construction laborer or dishwasher. I completed my job in four days, giving them the evidence and name of the lone individual respsonsible for the sabotage. What exactly was he doing? He carried rubber gloves in his back pocket, and he would periodically use the restroom, and remove his feces from the toilet and smear it all over the walls, covering as much surface as he could. He would also visit restrooms in different departments and do the same. This would cause the unionized individuals, who only had that restroom to use in their area, to walk off their work stations.

While the app provides a clean user interface and solid messaging features such as end-to-end encryption, it struggles in areas like group management and media sharing. One of the aspects I appreciate most about this app is its dedication to privacy. The encryption feature offers a sense of security when discussing sensitive topics. Furthermore, the clean and straightforward user interface makes for a seamless and enjoyable messaging experience. I find the app's performance to be smooth, rarely experiencing any glitches or stutters on my device. However, the org.telegram.messenger app falls short when it comes to group management. As an admin, it often proves difficult to configure settings, moderate the chat, and keep track of members. Additionally, while the app does offer the ability to share various media files, this capability appears to be somewhat limited. I have occasionally experienced slow upload speeds and a lack of support for certain file formats, resulting in cumbersome exchanges with others. In conclusion, the org.telegram.messenger app delivers satisfactory performance in most areas, but a few minor shortcomings prevent it from being a truly top-tier messaging service. With some targeted improvements to group management and media sharing, I believe this app could earn an even higher rating.

This question has options. How would someone go about accomplishing this goal? how to do spin painting OPT: -- place your canvas on a pottery wheel, and slowly drip the paint as its spinning. -- place your canvas on a drill bit, and slowly pour paint on the drill while the canvas is spinning.","completion":"Spin painting is an exciting and creative art technique that involves spinning a canvas while applying paint to create unique designs and patterns. The centrifugal force generated by the spinning motion distributes the paint, resulting in a mesmerizing, abstract artwork. Here are two methods you can use to create spin paintings, which include using a pottery wheel and a drill with detailed explanations: Method 1: Using a Pottery Wheel 1. Gather necessary materials: You'll need a pottery wheel, preferably with speed control, a canvas (choose a size that fits comfortably on the pottery wheel), acrylic or any liquid paint, paintbrushes, cups, and a drop cloth to protect your work surface. 2. Prepare your workspace: Lay out the drop cloth on the floor or table as spin painting can be quite messy. Set up the pottery wheel on the drop cloth and ensure it is securely fastened and stable. 3. Attach the canvas: Place your canvas on the pottery wheel's surface. You can use a non-slip mat, or if needed, some clay to hold the canvas in place and prevent it from sliding. Make sure the canvas is centered and secure. 4. Test the wheel's speed: Start spinning the pottery wheel at a low speed, adjusting it as needed. It's crucial to find a comfortable pace to work with; not too fast that the paint will fling off the canvas, and not too slow, so the paint migrates. 5. Apply the paint: Pour paint into cups and dilute slightly with water, if necessary, for a better flow. Begin spinning your canvas and slowly drip or pour paint onto the canvas using a brush, squeeze bottle, or directly from the cups. You can use multiple colors and layer them to create more depth and contrast. 6. Experiment with techniques: Try rotating the canvas at different speeds, using various paint application techniques, or tilting the canvas to manipulate the paint's flow. 7. Dry and finish: Once you achieve the desired look, stop the wheel and carefully remove the canvas. Allow the paint to dry completely; this may take several hours to a full day, depending on the paint's thickness. When dry, you can coat the painting with a varnish or sealant for added protection, if desired. Method 2: Using a Drill 1. Gather necessary materials: You'll need a drill (preferably cordless) with a flat drill bit or attachment that fits the canvas size, a spare bolt and wing nut, a canvas, acrylic or liquid paint, paintbrushes, cups, and a drop cloth to protect your work surface. 2. Prepare your workspace: Lay out the drop cloth on the floor or table and set up the drill. Make sure to keep the drill at a comfortable working height. 3. Attach the canvas: Drill a hole in the center of the canvas, then thread the bolt through the hole and secure it with the wing nut. Attach the bolt-end to the drill, making sure the canvas is centered and stable. 4. Test the drill's speed: Hold the drill firmly in place and steadily increase the speed. Adjust the speed to find a comfortable pace to work with, considering the canvas size and the flow of paint. 5. Apply the paint: Pour paint into cups and dilute slightly with water, if necessary, for better flow. Start spinning the canvas by turning on the drill. Slowly drip, pour, or use brushes to apply paint onto the spinning canvas. You may want to wear protective gloves to avoid paint splatter. 6. Experiment with techniques: Vary the canvas's spinning speed and use different paint application methods to create unique designs, patterns, and color combinations. 7. Dry and finish: Once satisfied with your painting, stop the drill and carefully remove the canvas from the attachment. Allow the paint to dry completely. When dry, you can coat the painting with a varnish or sealant for added protection, if desired. Both methods offer different experiences, and experimenting with each one will allow you to find your unique spin painting style.

The Thebaid ( ; Latin: \\"Thēbaïs\\") is a Latin epic in 12 books written in dactylic hexameter by Publius Papinius Statius (AD c. 45 – c. 96). The poem deals with the Theban cycle and treats the assault of the seven champions of Argos against the city of Thebes. Can we draw the following conclusion? The poem treats the assault of the seven champions.","completion":"Yes, we can draw the conclusion that the poem treats the assault of the seven champions, but it is important to delve deeper into the context, themes, and structure of the epic to gain a better understanding of its complexities and the story it narrates. The Thebaid, written by the ancient Roman poet Publius Papinius Statius circa 45-96 AD, is an epic poem consisting of 12 books. It is composed in dactylic hexameter, a metrical pattern commonly used in epic poetry. The poem centers around the Theban cycle, which is a collection of myths and legends pivoting on the city of Thebes in ancient Greece. The main story of the Thebaid revolves around the events leading to the assault on the city of Thebes by seven champions of Argos. These events unfold as the result of a power struggle between two brothers, Eteocles and Polynices, who are both sons of King Oedipus of Thebes. When their father is forced into exile after his destined tragic events, his curse casts its dark shadow on the sons, leading them to engage in a struggle for the throne of Thebes. The brothers strike a deal to alternate their rule each year. However, Eteocles refuses to yield the throne to Polynices after his year is up, which sets the stage for the epic battle that is the focus of the poem. Polynices, feeling betrayed, flees to the city of Argos, where he seeks the support of King Adrastus. The king agrees to aid Polynices in his quest to reclaim the throne of Thebes, and together, they assemble a mighty force. This army is composed of seven champions - each representing and leading a great contingent of warriors - to attack the seven gates of Thebes. Throughout the poem, Statius incorporates various themes and motifs common in Greco-Roman epic poetry, such as divine intervention, heroism, family bonds, and fate. The seven champions themselves are portrayed as heroes, each with their own unique skills, attributes, and personal history. These seven champions include Polynices, Tydeus, Amphiaraus, Capaneus, Hippomedon, Parthenopaeus, and Eteoclus. Their respective destinies, individual goals, and interpersonal relationships intertwine to form the epic narrative of the Thebaid. In conclusion, the poem indeed treats the assault of the seven champions, as it narrates the story of their assault on the city of Thebes in an attempt to overthrow the rule of Eteocles and to place Polynices on the throne. The Thebaid, with its complex characters and multifaceted themes, explores the nature of power, loyalty, fate, and heroism as it offers readers a rich and elaborate account of the events involved in the Theban cycle."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In his tent on the beach, Zurga notes that the storm has abated, as has his rage; he now feels remorse for his anger towards Nadir (\\"L'orage est calmé\\"). Leila is brought in; Zurga is captivated by her beauty as he listens to her pleas for Nadir's life, but his jealousy is rekindled. He confesses his love for her, but refuses mercy (\\"Je suis jaloux\\"). Nourabad and some of the fishermen enter to report that the funeral pyre is ready. As Leila is taken away, Zurga observes her giving one of the fishermen her necklace, asking for its return to her mother. With a shout, Zurga rushes out after the group and seizes the necklace. Outside the temple, Nadir waits beside the funeral pyre as the crowd, singing and dancing, anticipates the dawn and the coming double execution (\\"Dès que le soleil\\"). He is joined by Leila; resigned now to their deaths, the pair sing of how their souls will soon be united in heaven. A glow appears in the sky, and Zurga rushes in to report that the fishermen's camp is ablaze. As the men hurry away to save their homes, Zurga frees Leila and Nadir. He returns the necklace to Leila, and reveals that he is the man she saved when she was a child. He recognises now that his love for her is in vain, and tells her and Nadir to flee. As the couple depart, singing of the life of love that awaits them, Zurga is left alone, to await the fishermen's return (\\"Plus de crainte...Rêves d'amour, adieu!\\"). (In the revised version of the ending introduced after the opera's 1886 revival, Nourabad witnesses Zurga's freeing of the prisoners and denounces him to the fishermen, one of whom stabs Zurga to death as the last notes sound of Leila and Nadir's farewell song. In some variations Zurga meets his death in other ways, and his body is consigned to the pyre.)

Title: City Heat Movie plot: In Kansas City, 1933, near the end of Prohibition,[1] a police lieutenant known by his last name, Speer (Eastwood), is acquainted with a former cop turned private eye named Mike Murphy (Reynolds). Speer and Murphy were once good friends, which changed after Murphy left the force.[1] On a rainy night, Speer comes to a diner for coffee. Two goons arrive, looking for Murphy. They pounce the minute Murphy arrives, starting a fistfight. Speer, no fan of Murphy's, ignores the fight until a goon causes him to spill his coffee. Both goons are thrown through the front door. Murphy sarcastically thanks Speer for saving his life. The two rivals have eyes for Murphy's secretary Addy (Jane Alexander). She loves both and proves it when, after tenderly kissing Murphy goodbye, goes on a date with Speer. Murphy does have a new romantic interest, a rich socialite named Caroline Howley (Madeline Kahn), but finds himself unable to commit. Speer and Addy go to a boxing match at which the mob boss Primo Pitt (Rip Torn) is present. Murphy's partner Dehl Swift (Richard Roundtree) is also there, and seems to be in cahoots with Pitt and his gang. Swift is in possession of a briefcase whose contents, secret accounting records of rival gang boss Leon Coll's operations, are the target of both Pitt's and Coll's gangs. Swift, tailed by Speer and Addy, is confronted by Pitt's thugs at his apartment with Ginny Lee (Irene Cara) taken hostage. Ginny Lee manages to escape but Swift is shot and killed during a struggle with Pitt.[1] A thug opens the briefcase but there's nothing inside. He picks up Swift's body and throws it out the window, where it lands on the roof of Speer's parked car (which is occupied by the horrified Addy, who waits after Speer goes to investigate in the apartment). Murphy vows revenge on Pitt for killing his partner. He asks Speer for assistance and they form a reluctant alliance.

Question 2: What are the easiest ways to make good money using the Internet? Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","completion":"Yes, questions 1 and 2 are essentially asking the same thing. Both questions inquire about easy methods to make money online (through the Internet). Answer to Question 1 and 2: There are several easy ways to make money online. Some of these methods require skills or talents, while others simply involve investing time and effort. To give you a better idea, here are ten common and easy ways to earn money using the Internet: 1. Freelance Work: Many websites like Upwork, Freelancer, and Fiverr provide platforms for skilled professionals to find freelance work. You can offer your services in writing, programming, graphic design, marketing, or any other area of expertise, depending on your skills. 2. Online Surveys: You can sign up for websites that send you paid surveys to complete. These surveys come from companies looking to gather consumer data and opinions for their products and services. Examples of such platforms include Swagbucks and Survey Junkie. 3. Blogging and Affiliate Marketing: Establishing a blog or website on a specific niche topic and consistently creating unique, engaging content can attract an audience. Once you have a strong following, you can monetize your blog through advertising, sponsored content, or affiliate marketing. Amazon Associates is a popular affiliate program that you can join to promote products and earn a commission on sales made through your website. 4. Vlogging and YouTube: If you have a knack for creating engaging videos, consider starting a YouTube channel. As your subscribers and views grow, you can monetize your channel through YouTube ads, sponsorships, and merchandise sales. 5. Selling Digital Products: If you have a talent for writing ebooks, designing templates, or creating courses, you can sell these digital products on platforms such as Amazon, Etsy, or your own website. This will require time and effort at the beginning, but the potential for passive income makes it an appealing method. 6. Online Tutoring and Teaching: Online platforms such as VIPKid and Teachable enable people with knowledge in certain subjects or languages to teach others. You can create courses or provide one-on-one tutoring and earn money through this method. 7. Stock Trading and Cryptocurrency: Investing in stocks or cryptocurrencies can be an easy way to make money if you do thorough research and make informed decisions. Keep in mind, however, that this method carries inherent financial risks. 8. Selling Handmade Items: If you have a talent for crafting handmade items, you can establish an online store through platforms such as Etsy or Shopify. This will allow you to sell your products worldwide and potentially earn a good income from your hobby. 9. Dropshipping: With dropshipping, you can set up an online store without having to handle the physical products yourself. Instead, a third party handles the inventory and shipping for you. This model requires initial investment and continuous marketing efforts to generate a steady flow of orders. 10. User Testing: Many websites pay users to test their apps or websites and provide feedback on their user experience. Companies like UserTesting, TryMyUI, and Userlytics offer this service, enabling you to earn money by testing and reviewing online products. Remember, it is important to research each method to determine which best fits your skills, interests, and availability. Some of these methods may require more time and effort than others, but the additional dedication can result in higher returns."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

OPTIONS: A). no B). yes","completion":"A). No, the questions do not have the same meaning. The first question, \\"What is the world’s best tongue twister?\\" seeks an answer identifying the most challenging or well-known tongue twister in the world. A tongue twister is a phrase that is designed to be difficult to articulate properly, particularly when repeated quickly. They often rely on similar but distinct phonemes or rapid shifts in pronunciation. One contender for the world's best tongue twister is the Guinness World Record holder, \\"The sixth sick sheik's sixth sheep's sick.\\" This tongue twister is considered the most difficult to articulate due to its phonetic complexity and the repetitive use of similar but distinct sounds that can easily trip up the speaker. Another popular tongue twister, often cited as one of the most difficult, is, \\"How can a clam cram in a clean cream can?\\" This tongue twister combines a variety of similar consonants and vowel sounds, making it challenging to pronounce accurately and quickly. However, the concept of the \\"world's best\\" tongue twister is subjective, as people might consider different factors that determine the difficulty and effectiveness of a tongue twister. The second question, \\"Why do we have tongue twisters?\\" explores the reason behind the existence of tongue twisters in language and culture. There are several reasons why tongue twisters exist and continue to be popular: 1. Linguistic curiosity: Tongue twisters play with the phonetic features of languages. They challenge the brain and the speaker's ability to manipulate and produce complex linguistic combinations. By experimenting with various combinations of sounds and words, tongue twisters offer an insight into the flexibility and intricacies of human language. 2. Language learning and practice: They can be used as a fun and informal way to practice pronunciation, diction, and fluency in speaking. They help speakers become more aware of their articulatory habits and can improve precision in pronunciation and enunciation of specific phonemes. 3. Brain and speech development: Tongue twisters can contribute to the development of cognitive skills, such as memory, attention, and focus. They can also help in speech therapy, fostering motor coordination and control over the articulators involved in speech production, benefiting those with speech impediments or difficulties. 4. Entertainment and social interaction: Tongue twisters have long been a popular form of amusement. They serve as an engaging challenge that can be shared in a group setting, fostering laughter and connection among people who attempt to say them correctly and quickly. In conclusion, the two questions are different in terms of meaning, as the first one asks for the identification of the world's best tongue twister, while the second one seeks the reasons and purposes behind the existence of tongue twisters in language and culture."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Given the question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: The bed should be reserved as a place for sleep, but people tend to read an iPad a lot in bed before they go to sleep. Charles Czeisler, a professor at Harvard Medical School, and his colleagues got a small group of people for an experiment. For five days in a row, the people read either a paper book or an iPad for four hours before sleep. Their sleep patterns were monitored all night. Before and after each trial period, the people took hourly blood tests to paint a day-long picture of just how much melatonin was in their blood at any given time. When subjects read on the iPad as compared to the paper books, they reported feeling less sleepy at night and less active the following morning. People also took longer to fall asleep on the iPad nights, and the blood tests showed that their melatonin secretion was delayed by an hour and a half. The researchers conclude in today's journal article that given the rise of e-readers and the increasingly widespread use of e-things among children and adolescents, more research into the long-term consequences of these devices on health and safety is urgently needed. Czeisler and colleagues go on, in the research paper, to note:\\"Reading an iPad in bed may increase cancer risk.\\" However, software has been developed that can reduce some of the blue light from the screens of phones and computers according to time of day, and there are also glasses that are made to filter short wavelengths.

This cartoon is short on plot, but is a visually stunning piece of work. There will be very, very minor spoilers: This short has a \\"story\\" that's incredibly slight-gnomes underground are responsible for the return of spring each year, yet must contend with a winter not yet ready to withdraw. Both the gnomes and the storm have their own songs. That's pretty much the plot, such as it is. But this cartoon isn't about the plot-it's about the color and animation. The visuals are exceptional. Back in 1936, such bright color was still something of a novelty and there's some incredibly inspired work here. My favorite moments of the short surround the movement of the liquefied colors through pipes. At more than one point, there are a series of pipes aligned in a row, from the shortest to the tallest and the colors move through the pipes and the musical track makes it seem as though the row is a pipe organ. The visuals of the battle between the emerging greenery and the winter storm which refuses to leave quietly are exceedingly well executed. These types of shorts were things which Hugh Harman and Rudolf Ising are noted for, but they probably also helped lead to their ultimate departure from MGM, because this cartoon probably went over budget and MGM finally decided that they could control costs better if the animation department were managed by someone a little more conscious of cost than Harman and Ising were.

Breakdown: First I identify the different parts of the sentence. The subject is \\"A new security system\\", the action or verb is \\"is being developed\\", and the location \\"in the buildings housing the Turkish parliament in Ankara.\\" 2. Translation: The next step involves translating each segment to Turkish: - \\"A new security system\\" translates to \\"Yeni bir güvenlik sistemi\\" - \\"is being developed\\" translates to \\"geliştiriliyor\\" - \\"in the buildings housing the Turkish parliament in Ankara.\\" translates to \\"Ankara'daki Türk parlamentosunu barındıran binalarda.\\" 3. Reassembly: In Turkish, the sentence structure slightly differs; it generally follows the subject-object-verb (SOV) turnover. Hence, the sentence would be reassembled as: \\"Ankara'daki Türk parlamentosunu barındıran binalarda yeni bir güvenlik sistemi geliştiriliyor.\\" So, \\"A new security system is being developed in the buildings housing the Turkish parliament in Ankara.\\" translates to \\"Ankara'daki Türk parlamentosunu barındıran binalarda yeni bir güvenlik sistemi geliştiriliyor.\\" in Turkish."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The only complaint Jose Mourinho could possibly have after this astonishingly one-sided contest was the fact that there was so little to complain about. Not a hint of controversy. Not a booking he could blame on a referee. Barely a misplaced pass that might have given him an excuse to criticise one of his players. It was, Mourinho was moved to declare, a perfect performance from his Chelsea side; a ‘perfect game’ with no possible reason to cry conspiracy or point to an ongoing campaign against his team.

Instead, a stunned Liberty Stadium witnessed Chelsea returning to the campaign that remains Mourinho’s true focus beyond the diversionary tactics of his recent outbursts; the campaign to propel his side back to the summit of the English game. However strong Manchester City might be, Chelsea will be hard to stop on this evidence. This time two first-half goals apiece for Oscar and Diego Costa and a further second-half strike from Andre Schurrle secured three more points, with some quite extraordinary defensive errors contributing to Swansea’s demise. But to suggest simply that Swansea were the architects of their own downfall would be to seriously undervalue just how wonderful a performance this was from the Premier League leaders. Swansea were awful. ‘Horrible’ was how Garry Monk described a first 45 minutes he rated their worst of the season.

Mourinho has assembled the Chelsea side we are enjoying this season and right now they are playing as well — and as attractively — as any team in Europe. The manager was invited to praise Costa and Oscar afterwards but he quite rightly pointed to the fact that every player in the side deserved praise. He mentioned John Terry, Filipe Luis and Branislav Ivanovic in response but he could just have easily pointed to the commanding midfield display of Cesc Fabregas and Nemanja Matic. The finishing of Oscar and Costa was nevertheless superb. The opening Chelsea goal, scored after just 49 seconds, might have owed much to Gylfi Sigurdsson’s wayward pass — one seemingly intended for Ashley Williams but one that was diverted into the path of Oscar when it struck Tom Carroll — but it remained a marvellous strike. There was the briefest glimpse of a riposte when Sigurdsson sent a shot crashing against the angle of post and crossbar in the second minute but after that Swansea pretty much folded. When Fabregas, so composed and confident alongside the marvellous Matic, executed a delightful one-two with Willian before feeding the ball into Costa, goal number two arrived in the 20th minute. Costa, much like Oscar, produced a fierce, low finish Lukasz Fabianski was powerless to stop. Chelsea were so in control, with Willian seeing one shot bounce off a post and another rebound off the crossbar. But when Federico Fernandez contrived in the 34th minute to knock a back-pass into the path of Costa, the Spaniard extended Chelsea’s lead with another deadly strike.

For Monk it was clearly proving very painful, Swansea’s manager watching in despair as another goal arrived within two minutes. This time Willian sparked the move with a burst from midfield and a delightful pass out to Costa on the right flank, with Costa then delivering to the ball into the path of a rapidly advancing Oscar and so inviting the Brazilian to smash it home. He did so with ease. It enabled Chelsea to stroll through the second half, even if there was a moment when Costa and Williams threatened to become embroiled in an ugly exchange. But it remained a game without controversy and without much of a fight from the hosts. With one eye on Tuesday’s League Cup encounter at Liverpool, Mourinho eventually made changes. But a fifth Chelsea goal, scored in the 79th minute, still came, with Eden Hazard and Ivanovic inviting Schurrle to compound Swansea’s misery from close range.

Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?","completion":"The hypothesis \\"We never have to worry about money\\" is not entailed by the given premise \\"excuse me if uh it comes the end of the month and I don't have any money uh we don't buy any more milk.\\" To understand the relation between the premise and hypothesis, let's first break down the premise and hypothesis into their core assertions. Premise: 1. The speaker may run out of money at the end of the month. 2. If there is no money, no milk will be purchased. Hypothesis: 1. There is no need to worry about money. The hypothesis claims a state of financial stability and no need to worry about money. However, the premise explicitly states two facts - one of which is the speaker running out of money at the end of the month. This clearly contradicts the hypothesis, as the speaker's experience suggests that there is a financial concern. The second part of the premise states a logical event that follows the previous condition - if there's no money, no milk will be purchased. It further emphasizes the significance of money in this scenario and possibly hints at a monthly occurrence where this individual runs out of funds, leading to a lack of essential items like milk. Upon examining the links between the assertions in the premise and the hypothesis, it is obvious that there is no entailment between the two. The hypothesis suggests a state of no worry about money, while the premise explicitly highlights a concern regarding money. The contradiction between the two makes it clear that the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Use the following highlights to write an article: Charlie Adam is open to the possibility of moving abroad. Scottish midfielder has started just five games this season. Adam has been linked with a move to David Moyes' Real Sociedad.","completion":"Title: Scottish Midfielder Charlie Adam Considering Moving Abroad Amidst Limited Game Time Body: Scottish midfielder Charlie Adam has recently expressed his openness to moving abroad in search of more game time as his appearances for his current club have been limited this season. The talented playmaker has only managed to start in five games so far, sparking discussions about his future and possible destinations. One club that has gained attention in regards to Adam's possible transfer is David Moyes' Real Sociedad, as the former Premier League manager looks to rebuild his team around experienced campaigners. Charlie Adam, 35, began his professional career in Scotland with Rangers before enjoying stints at Blackpool and Stoke City subsequently. He quickly gained a reputation as both a goal-scoring midfielder and reliable creator with a lethal left foot. Despite his advanced age, Adam still possesses the qualities that made him a valuable asset for his former clubs, including top-notch set pieces and a keen eye for a defense-splitting pass. However, his limited game time this season has raised concerns among fans and pundits alike that Adam needs a change of scenery to fully utilize his skills. The prospect of moving abroad could offer the Scottish veteran a new lease on life and rejuvenate his career, as adapting to different leagues and playing styles can indeed be a challenge, but a fruitful one at that. A potential move to David Moyes' Real Sociedad has been making headlines, as Moyes' familiarity with the Scottish Premiership during his time as manager at Everton and Manchester United could be an attractive factor for Adam. Real Sociedad, a Spanish side that competes in La Liga, has historically been known for its development of young talent, but the presence of experienced players like Adam could add some much-needed depth and tactical knowledge to the squad. Having previously worked with Premier League talent, Moyes is well aware of the skillset that Adam could bring to a team, and his ability to foster resilience and determination may be what the Spanish side needs to push for domestic success. If Adam does decide to move abroad, it will be a significant moment for Scottish football. For years, the country's most talented players have preferred to remain within the familiar surroundings of the United Kingdom, with a select few venturing into the European football scene. However, in recent times, there has been a slow but steady shift in mindset as Scottish players have started to acknowledge the potential benefits that playing abroad can offer, such as broadening footballing horizons and a diverse approach to the game. In conclusion, as Charlie Adam contemplates a potential move abroad in search of more game time, he is inadvertently paving the way for fellow Scottish talent to consider overseas ventures too. Not only could the midfielder's transfer to a team like Real Sociedad add an insightful touch to their setup, but it could also be a symbolic gesture for the evolution of Scottish football and potentially give Adam the chance to revitalize his distinguished career. Whatever the outcome, the Scottish football fraternity will be keenly watching Adam's next moves, as it could very well be a turning point in the midfielder's illustrious career."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

This game marked Russell Wilson's first 300-yard passing game, and Cam Newton's worst career performance, posting 125 yards through the air, a career low. The first quarter ended equal for both teams, as both sides exchanged a couple of punts. Seattle took their third drive of the game in the second quarter, and drove into the red zone, capping it with a Steven Hauschka 27-yard field goal. Carolina responded immediately, and taking advantage of a couple of Seattle penalties, and some big runs by DeAngelo Williams, with Cam Newton hitting Steve Smith for a 3-yard TD. Seattle responded with a drive to around the Carolina 27 yard line, but Charles Godfrey sacked Russell Wilson and stripped the football, which Carolina recovered. So the first half ended 7-3, Carolina. The second half began with a defensive battle between both sides. Seattle then broke the deadlock with a Steven Hauschka 40-yard field goal, on a drive that lasted over 4 minutes, cutting the lead to 7-6. After forcing Carolina to punt midway through the fourth quarter, Seattle's offense produced its finest drive of the day. A couple of Russell Wilson passes, followed by a Robert Turbin 15-yard scamper, set up Seattle at the Panthers' 43 yard line. Russell Wilson overthrew receiver Stephen Williams on first down, but on second down and 10, by using exactly the same play, Wilson connected with second-year man Jermaine Kearse for a 43-yard score, with 10 minutes left to play. They failed the two-point conversion however, so Seattle had a 12-7 lead. Carolina responded by using DeAngelo Williams on some big runs. Inside the Seattle 35 yard line, Williams took off for a 24-yard scamper, and looked like he was going to score, however at the last possible moment, Earl Thomas forced Williams to fumble inside the 10 yard line. Who scored the most points, the Seahawks or the Panthers?","completion":"Based on the context of the provided information, the Seattle Seahawks scored the most points in the game.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Read the following context and answer the question. Context: Last week we talked about healthy eating on a budget. Today I want to take it a step further and focus on how to start clean eating on a budget. It is very similar with just a couple of extra steps. Clean eating focuses on fresh ingredients, no processed foods, and eating good foods as close to nature as possible such as: fruits, vegetables, whole grains, cage-free eggs, grass-fed beef and grain-fed poultry, and raw milk (if possible) to your diet. Some of these may seem like a burden when you are on a small food budget, but with the tips below, you can eat clean and stay within your budget. I am sure you will recognize some from the previous post; but read through there is extra information that applies specifically to clean eating. A major component of clean eating is buying fresh produce rather than canned fruits and vegetables. Frozen produce is OK; but, if in-season fruit is available, it is always better to choose that. Buy in bulk, and freeze it yourself. Use Google to help you search for seasonal produce in your area. When you can buy it from a Farmer’s Market, or even directly from the farmers, it will be less expensive. My next choice is SPOUTS Farmer’s Marker, if there is one near you. Those sources will probably be the least expensive. For example: you may be able to buy strawberries, peaches, and nectarines very inexpensively in the summer and find that squash is a better buy in the fall. Always buy extra when the price is right and freeze the leftovers. When you first start reading about clean eating, you may find “experts” expounding the importance of certain superfoods that you should start eating. The reality is – they are nutritious and excellent additions to your diet; but, you don’t have to eat them just start a clean eating. If you cannot afford to add chia seeds of flax seeds to every smoothie or eat a pomegranate each morning, don’t worry about it. Buy the clean foods you can afford and eat those – you will be doing just fine. Question: What field does the author most probably work in?

A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the current name of the third-party movement that was able to elect Jesse Ventura to the governorship in 1998?, using the article: Minnesota is known for a politically active citizenry, and populism has been a long-standing force among the state's political parties. Minnesota has a consistently high voter turnout. In the 2008 U.S. presidential election, 78.2% of eligible Minnesotans voted—the highest percentage of any U.S. state—versus the national average of 61.2%. Voters can register on election day at their polling places with evidence of residency.Hubert Humphrey brought national attention to the state with his address at the 1948 Democratic National Convention. Minnesotans have consistently cast their Electoral College votes for Democratic presidential candidates since 1976, longer than any other state. Minnesota is the only state in the nation that did not vote for Ronald Reagan in either of his presidential runs. Minnesota has gone for the Democratic Party in every presidential election since 1960, with the exception of 1972, when it was carried by Republican Richard Nixon. Both the Democratic and Republican parties have major-party status in Minnesota, but its state-level \\"Democratic\\" party is actually a separate party, officially known as the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party (DFL). It was formed out of a 1944 alliance of the Minnesota Democratic and Farmer-Labor parties. The state has had active third-party movements. The Reform Party, now the Independence Party, was able to elect former mayor of Brooklyn Park and professional wrestler Jesse Ventura to the governorship in 1998. The Independence Party has received enough support to keep major-party status. The Green Party, while no longer having major-party status, has a large presence in municipal government, notably in Minneapolis and Duluth, where it competes directly with the DFL party for local offices. Major-party status in Minnesota (which grants state funding for elections) is reserved to parties whose candidates receive five percent or more of the vote in any statewide election (e.g., Governor, Secretary of State, U.S. President).

What is the missing first step of the following process: - Embryo is C - Embryo grows and develops into a fetus inside the woman&#x27;s womb - The fetus is born - Begins to grow and develop through infancy and childhood - In the teenage years the human experiences puberty - Reaches sexual maturity - At 18 the human becomes an adult - Adult may procreate continuing the cycle. Answer:","completion":"The missing first step in the above process is: A - The successful fertilization of an egg by a sperm cell. In order to provide a detailed and long answer, let's break down this entire process into its proper stages: A. Fertilization: This is the process in which a sperm cell from a male unites with an egg cell from a female during sexual reproduction. The fusion of these two cells, known as the spermatozoon and ovum, respectively, creates a single-celled, fertilized egg called a zygote. Fertilization typically takes place in the Fallopian tubes of the female reproductive system, after the sperm has traveled through the cervix and uterus. B. Creation of an Embryo (Embryo is C): The zygote starts to divide and multiply through the process of cellular replication called mitosis. This process continues as the cells undergo differentiation, which allows them to take on specialized roles and functions. This stage of growth and development forms an embryo, which will eventually develop into a fetus. C. Growth and Development inside the Woman's Womb: The embryo continues to grow and differentiate as it implants itself into the woman's uterine wall. The placenta, amniotic sac, and umbilical cord all form to provide nourishment and protection to the developing fetus. Throughout the pregnancy, the fetus will further develop all essential organs and body systems to prepare for life outside the womb. D. Birth of the Baby: Following a successful gestation period of approximately 40 weeks, the baby is born through the process of labor and delivery. The baby may be born via vaginal birth or cesarean section, depending on the specific circumstances of the pregnancy and the health of both the mother and baby. E. Growth and Development through Infancy and Childhood: After birth, the baby enters the stages of infancy and childhood, characterized by rapid growth, development, and various physical and cognitive milestones. During this time, they will learn to crawl, walk, talk, and achieve countless other developmental milestones as they gain more independence and understanding of the world around them. F. Puberty and Adolescence: As the child transitions into their teenage years, they will undergo puberty, a period marked by hormonal changes and the maturing of the body's reproductive system. Both males and females will experience physical changes, such as growth spurts, the development of secondary sexual characteristics, and emotional changes. G. Reaching Sexual Maturity: Upon completing puberty, individuals reach sexual maturity, meaning their bodies are capable of producing viable sperm or eggs for reproduction. This stage of life allows for the possibility of engaging in sexual activity and beginning the cycle anew through potential procreation. H. Adulthood and Potential Procreation: At the age of 18, individuals are typically considered adults, taking on new responsibilities, and potentially forming relationships that may lead to procreation. If a couple decides to have children, the cycle of life, as outlined above, continues, ensuring the ongoing development and survival of the human species."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What was the nickname given to the largest of the four sister ships that completed a record eastbound crossing? With government subsidies promised, initially at 385,000 a year, and with the backing of the leading investment bank Brown Brothers, Collins founded the New York and Liverpool United States' Mail Steamship Company, familiarly known as the Collins Line. He immediately embarked on an ambitious steamship construction program. The first of the four Collins Line ships, SS Atlantic, was launched in 1849 and began service in April 1850. Her three sister ships, Pacific, Arctic and Baltic, were all in service before the end of 1850. The four, all constructed of wood, were broadly similar in size and performance; Arctic was marginally the largest, at 284 feet (87 m) in length and 2,856 tons by American custom house measurement. The new Collins Line steamers were about 25 percent larger than the biggest of the Cunard ships, and were soon outperforming them; crossings in ten days became routine. Arctic entered service on October 26, 1850. The luxurious standards of its passenger accommodation contrasted with those experienced by Charles Dickens, who crossed the Atlantic in Cunard's Britannia in 1840. Dickens found his Britannia cabin dark and cramped, \\"a thoroughly hopeless, and profoundly preposterous box\\", while the bleak saloon was \\"a long narrow apartment, not unlike a gigantic hearse\\". In Arctic, according to a seasoned transatlantic passenger, her cabins \\"in comfort and elegance surpassed that of any merchant vessel Great Britain then possessed\\", while the main saloon had \\"an air of almost Oriental magnificence\\".Under her captain, James Luce, a 49-year-old veteran of thirty years at sea, Arctic became the most celebrated of the Collins ships. Her record eastbound crossing, from New York to Liverpool in nine days, seventeen hours in the winter of 1851–52, earned her the title of the \\"Clipper of the Seas\\". Luce was admired by passengers as much for his social qualities as for his seamanship; a reporter for Harper's New Monthly Magazine wrote approvingly: \\"If you ever wish to cross the Atlantic, you will find in the...

Select the correct sentiment of the following review: This movie had potential and I was willing to give it a try but there are so many timeline problems that are so obvious - it's hard to swallow being treated like such an idiot. Rise to Power is set in the late sixties. Carlito's Way is set in the mid to late seventies. For this movie to be realistic, it would have to be set in the fifties, if not the late forties. Rise to Power has no sign of Gail (Pennelope Ann Miller), no sign of Kleinfeld, no sign of Rolando that Carlito supposedly ran with in his \\"hey-day\\". None of the primary characters in the original film were in this movie. We're supposed to believe that Carlito met all these people in the span of a few years. Rise to Power ends with Carlito walking down the beach talking about retiring in paradise which is what he wanted to do in the original film. Also, the pre-quel creates the Rocco and Earl characters - what's supposed to happen with them since they are clearly not in Carlito's Way? It's also hard to understand how Carlito could have the relationship with the Italians he has in the original film watching the events of Rise to Power. Where are the Taglialucci's in this film? There is probably seven years between the two films and he spends five of them in prison. It's like trying to put a square plug into a round hole. It is obvious that no one was interested in telling a good story and that they were more interested in making some bucks by making an average gangster film and throwing a character called Carlito Brigante into the story. The film had some good moments but I think they would have been better off leaving this movie to stand by itself instead of trying to make it a prequel to Carlito's Way. If you feel determined to see this movie, the only advice I can give is to not think of the movie as a linear pre-quel. Think of it like the spaghetti westerns with Clint Eastwood's man with no name, in other words two movies that have the same character but aren't necessarily connected with each other.

In Springberry, Alabama, 1946, young Dewey Cox accidentally cuts his brother Nate in half with a machete. The trauma causes Dewey to lose his sense of smell. Dewey meets a blues guitarist, who discovers Dewey is a natural musician. In 1953, after a successful talent show performance, 14-year-old Dewey leaves Springberry with his 12-year-old girlfriend Edith; they soon marry and have a baby. Working at an all-African American nightclub, Dewey replaces singer Bobby Shad onstage and impresses Hasidic Jewish record executive L'Chaim. While recording a rockabilly rendition of \\"That's Amore,\\" Dewey is berated by an executive. A desperate Dewey performs \\"Walk Hard,\\" a song inspired by a speech he gave Edith, which restores the executive's belief in Judaism and rockets Dewey to superstardom. The song becomes a hit within 35 minutes, and Dewey becomes caught up in the rock-and-roll lifestyle. Dewey is introduced to marijuana by his drummer Sam, and becomes unfaithful to Edith. Dewey's father informs him that his mother has died while dancing to Dewey's song, and blames Dewey's music for her death. Distraught, Dewey finds Sam using cocaine and partakes, resulting in a cocaine-fueled punk rock performance. Choirgirl Darlene Madison enters Dewey's life, and he produces several hit records amid their courtship laden with sexual tension. He weds Darlene while still married to Edith, which leads to both women leaving him, and purchases drugs from an undercover cop. After he serves time in prison and in rehab, Darlene returns.

How do you do this: I can't remember what the name is but is there a plant that smells like pineapples?","completion":"Yes, there is indeed a plant that smells like pineapples, it's called the Pineapple Sage (Salvia elegans). This is a sub-tropical plant native to Mexico and Guatemala. The name pineapple sage comes from the fact that its bright green leaves emit a fragrance that closely resembles that of pineapples when lightly touched or bruised. Here's a bit more about the plant: Appearance: Pineapple sage is a perennial plant, meaning it can live for more than two years. It commonly grows up to 4 feet tall and spreads to about 3 feet wide. It has vibrant green, lance-shaped leaves that are about 3 to 4 inches long. From late summer through autumn, it develops scarlet colored hummingbird-attracting flowers which grow in whorls on slender, terminal spikes. Each individual tubular flower is about 1 inch long. Growing Conditions: This plant is known for its hardiness and can be grown in a variety of climates, however, it thrives best in hardiness zones 8 to 11. It typically prefers full sun exposure but can tolerate partial shade. It prefers well-drained soil with average fertility. Cultivation: Pineapple sage grows best in a rich, loamy soil that is well-drained. It requires ample water, especially during the growing season but is relatively drought-tolerant once established. The plant can be propagated with cuttings or by division. It's generally free from serious insect and disease problems and is easy to cultivate, making it a popular choice for beginner gardeners. Uses: Pineapple sage is often used in landscaping. Its bright red flowers add a pop of color to garden borders and beds. It is also popular in kitchen gardens due to its sweet pineapple-scented leaves that can be used in a variety of culinary applications including fruit salads, drinks, jellies, and garnishes. Some people even use it to make a soothing herbal tea. In Summary, the pineapple sage is the plant you're referring to. It's a hardy plant that brings both visual appeal to gardens and also offers culinary benefits.

Eric, being an experienced optometrist, was trained to handle various procedures related to the eyes, including inserting contact lenses, diagnosing eye diseases, and providing appropriate treatments for patients with vision problems. His steady hands, exceptional knowledge of the eye's anatomy, and understanding of proper hygiene allowed him to perform such tasks confidently and efficiently. Aaron, on the other hand, was an expert in a completely unrelated field. As a software developer, his skills revolved around coding, troubleshooting, and building complex algorithms for various applications. While he excelled in managing and maintaining software projects, his abilities did not extend towards handling medical procedures, especially those as delicate as inserting foreign objects into the eye. Furthermore, the two friends had differing levels of comfort when it came to touching their own eyes. Eric, being accustomed to the direct contact with the human eye, could put things in the eye without flinching, thanks to years of practice and desensitization. Aaron, while incredibly talented in his own domain, felt squeamish at the mere thought of touching his eyes, which made it difficult for him to perform any eye-related actions. It is important to consider personal preferences and limitations when comparing the abilities of two individuals. In this case, Eric's experience as an optometrist and his comfort level with handling eye-related tasks allowed him to put things in the eye easily, whereas Aaron, due to his lack of expertise in this area and a general discomfort for such actions, couldn't perform the same task. In conclusion, Eric could put things in the eye but not Aaron because their professional expertise and individual predispositions made them suitable for their respective fields and tasks, highlighting the importance of understanding the diverse skillsets and capabilities humans possess. The value of their individual strengths should not be underestimated simply because they cannot perform specific tasks outside their domains, as each of them contributes uniquely and significantly to their fields of expertise."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Background: Parliament-Funkadelic (abbreviated as P-Funk) is an American funk music collective of rotating musicians headed by George Clinton, primarily consisting of the individual bands Parliament and Funkadelic, both active since the 1960s. Their distinctive funk style drew on psychedelic culture, outlandish fashion, science-fiction, and surreal humor; it would have an influential effect on subsequent funk, post-punk, hip-hop, and post-disco artists of the 1980s and 1990s, while their collective mythology would help pioneer Afrofuturism. The collective's origins date back to the doo-wop group the Parliaments, formed by Clinton in the late 1950s in Plainfield, New Jersey. Under the influence of late-1960s artists such as Jimi Hendrix, Sly Stone, and Frank Zappa, Clinton later relocated to Detroit and began the sister groups Parliament and Funkadelic, with the former playing an eclectic and more commercial form of funk, and the latter incorporating more influence from psychedelic rock. Context: In the early 1980s George Clinton continued to record while battling with financial problems and well-publicized drug problems. The remaining members of Parliament-Funkadelic recorded the 1982 hit album Computer Games, which was released as a George Clinton solo album. Included on this release was the much-sampled #1 hit single \\"Atomic Dog\\". The following year, Clinton formed the P-Funk All Stars, who went on to record Urban Dancefloor Guerillas in 1983. The P-Funk All Stars included many of the same members as the late-1970s version of the Parliament-Funkadelic collective, and was so named because of various legal issues concerning use of the names Parliament and Funkadelic after 1980. The name P-Funk All Stars is still in use to the current day, and group has included a mix of former Parliament-Funkadelic members as well as guests and new musicians. As the 1980s continued, P-Funk did not meet with great commercial success as the band continued to produce albums under the name of George Clinton as solo artist. P-Funk retired from touring from 1984 until 1989, except for extremely sporadic performances and TV appearances. It was at this time that Hip hop music began to extensively sample P-Funk music, so remnants of the music were still heard regularly, now among fans of Hip hop. By 1993, most of the Parliament and Funkadelic back catalog had been reissued. The same year saw the return of a reconstituted P-Funk All Stars, with the re-release of Urban Dancefloor Guerrillas under the title Hydraulic Funk, and a new hip hop influenced album Dope Dogs. In 1994, the group toured with the Lollapalooza festival and appeared in the film PCU. The 1996 album T.A.P.O.A.F.O.M. (The Awesome Power of a Fully Operational Mothership), released under the name George Clinton & the P-Funk All Stars, served as a reunion album featuring contributions from the band's most noteworthy songwriters from the earlier eras, such as Bootsy Collins, Bernie Worrell, and Junie Morrison. It would be ten years before another album would be released. In the intervening time, successive tours would slowly restore some of the broken ties between the original band members, together with an accumulation of new talent. On July 23, 1999, George Clinton and Parliament-Funkadelic, including noteworthy former members Bootsy and Catfish Collins and Bernie Worrell, performed on stage at Woodstock '99. The collective continued to tour sporadically in to the 2000s, with participation from some of the children and grandchildren of the original members. Question: Are there any other interesting aspects about this article? Answer:","completion":"Yes, there are some interesting aspects about this article. One is that Parliament-Funkadelic has a unique music style that blends funk, psychedelic culture, science-fiction, and surreal humor, which greatly influenced various music genres like hip-hop, post-punk, and post-disco. Additionally, their collective mythology contributed to the development of Afrofuturism. Another interesting point is the way George Clinton managed to keep the P-Funk All Stars going despite his financial and drug-related issues. Also, how P-Funk's music continued to be popular and relevant through sampling in the hip-hop community during their inactive period. The reconstitution of the P-Funk All Stars in the 1990s, with a mix of old and new members, and their participation in events like Woodstock '99 and Lollapalooza festival also add to the fascinating story of this musical collective."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","completion":"The given review, with the title \\"George Foreman Grill Review,\\" describing the user's experience with the grill, would likely decrease the chances of me buying the product. The review presents certain concerns and negative aspects of the grill that could influence my decision. Below, I will detail the reasons for my conclusion based on the given review. 1. Unsatisfactory cooking results: The reviewer mentions that their experience with the grill has not been particularly successful, as the meats they cooked - hamburgs, chicken breast, and steaks - have been undercooked. This suggests that the product may have difficulty cooking food thoroughly, which is its primary function, and it might not deliver the expected results. 2. Inefficient cooking method: The dissatisfaction with the grill's cooking capabilities leads the reviewer to compare it with broiling. They state that they have had better luck with broiling, implying that the grill may not be as effective or efficient as alternative cooking methods. This comparison strengthens the perception that the grill does not perform its function as it should, potentially leading to subpar results and disappointment. 3. Lack of positive aspects mentioned: While the review does not directly emphasize any positive aspects of the grill, it could be inferred that the reviewer did not find any significant advantages to using the product. This lack of praise for the grill, combined with the negative experiences they shared, increases the likelihood that the review would discourage potential buyers from making the purchase. 4. Trust in the reviewer's opinion: It should be noted that a single review does not necessarily represent the consensus of all users, and individual experiences may differ. Nevertheless, as a potential buyer, it is essential to take into account the experiences of others as they provide a deeper understanding of potential issues that may not be evident in product specifications or promotional materials. By considering multiple reviews that highlight similar issues, the confidence in the reviewer's opinion increases and may further influence my decision to avoid purchasing the product. In conclusion, the negative experiences shared by the reviewer, along with the expressed preference for alternative cooking methods and the lack of any notable positive aspects, decrease the chances of me buying the product. However, it is important to consider multiple reviews before making a final decision, as individual experiences may vary significantly."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: We know, painkillers in a tablet can make your headache go away, and antibiotic from a tube can prevent your cuts from becoming infected. Can medicine come in chicken eggs? A team of scientists from Scotland says \\"yes.\\" They've kept some special chickens that lay eggs with disease-treating drugs inside. These drugs are made of molecules called proteins. Animals make thousands of proteins--they're the main ingredients in skin, hair, milk, and meat. Since animals can make proteins easily, they're good animals for making protein drugs. Researchers have already made cows, sheep, and goats that pump out protein drugs in their milk. But chickens are cheaper to take care of, need less room, and grow faster than these other animals. \\"Those qualities could make chickens a better choice to become living drug factories.\\" says Simon Lillico of the Roslin Institute near Edinburgh, Scotland. Lillico and a team of researchers changed chickens' DNA--the code that tells cells how to make proteins--so that the birds' cells made two protein drugs. One drug can treat skin cancer, and the other treats a nerve disease called multiple sclerosis. The scientists changed the chickens' DNA so that the birds made these drugs only in their egg whites. This protects the chickens' bodies from the drugs' possible harmful effects and makes it easy for scientists to collect the drugs. These special chickens can pass on their drug-laying abilities to their chicks. So far, the Scottish researchers have kept five generations of drug-producing chickens. But the scientists need to improve these chickens. The chickens don't make enough drugs to treat people yet. Once the researchers perfect their technique, you might eventually take your medicine from chicken eggs. Question: What is the best title of the passage? Options: A: Animals and Protein Drugs.

I even ‘came out’ to her at one point. We spent a lot of time together and gradually, I thought I might not be gay after all, as I had feelings of love for her. Eventually, we started dating and I tried to suppress my gay feelings. Eventually, I proposed. We were engaged for just over a year and I got married at the age of 19. I have to admit, when the wedding plans got firmed up and much closer to the date, I started to feel that I was in fact still gay but so much money had already been spent, and plans made that I was too afraid to pull out.

How to find a sports law attorney Decide whether you need a sports lawyer or a sports agent. Although many sports lawyers also are registered as agents, the two may perform different functions, since a sports agent primarily is concerned with maximizing a player's brand and monetary gain. In many states, agents are largely unregulated-even if they are required to register as an agent. Pick from: (a). In other states, sponsorships are eliminated for personal athletes. If you have decided to operate a sporting and athletic game, you must first achieve a qualifying goal.. (b). For example, many states require that athletes travel to and from work. Those delousing these jobs must have permission.. (c). This lack of regulation could increase the chance that the agent takes advantage of you. In contrast, attorneys are bound by the state bar's code of ethics and stringent professional responsibility rules.. (d). Many sports associations-such as the american society of sports attorneys-will specify which attorney to choose. Review the list of contests and companies you admire and which athletic court publishes the sports law.. Answer:","completion":"(c). This lack of regulation could increase the chance that the agent takes advantage of you. In contrast, attorneys are bound by the state bar's code of ethics and stringent professional responsibility rules. Therefore, it is essential to determine if you need an attorney, who can provide legal services, or an agent, who can focus on maximizing your brand and revenue. Once you have decided which professional best suits your needs, the next step is to conduct thorough research to find the right individual for the job. When searching for a sports law attorney, consider the following steps: 1. Identify your specific legal needs: Begin by outlining your specific sports-related legal requirements. This could include contract negotiation, endorsement deals, dispute resolution, intellectual property rights, or issues related to doping, eligibility, and disciplinary actions. 2. Seek recommendations from trusted sources: Ask for referrals from friends, family, teammates, coaches, or other individuals involved in your sport who may have worked with a sports lawyer in the past. They can give you firsthand insights into their experiences and the quality of the attorney's services. 3. Research the attorney's credentials and experience: Look for attorneys with experience in sports law and a strong track record of representing clients in matters similar to your own. Consult online legal directories and the website of your state bar association to verify the attorney's licensure and any disciplinary records. 4. Evaluate their communication skills and responsiveness: An attorney's ability to effectively communicate and be available when needed is crucial to successfully handling your legal concerns. During initial consultations, pay attention to how well they listen and respond to your questions, as well as their willingness to discuss your case in-depth. 5. Discuss fees and billing structure: Before making your final decision, confirm the attorney's fee structure, including hourly rates, flat fees, or contingency fees. Get a written retainer agreement outlining the cost of services to avoid any misunderstandings or surprise charges later. 6. Check for reputable professional affiliations: Membership in respected organizations like the American Bar Association (ABA) or the Sports Lawyers Association (SLA) can indicate that the attorney is committed to staying current with industry trends and maintaining high ethical standards. 7. Trust your instincts: Finally, it's important to feel comfortable with the attorney you select. Trust your instincts and choose a professional with whom you can build a strong working relationship. Remember that you may be working closely with this individual for an extended period, and open communication and trust will be key to a successful partnership. By following these steps, you will be better equipped to find an experienced and competent sports law attorney who can effectively represent your interests and help you navigate the complex world of sports law."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Here's a question and a few possible answers: Q: What happens when you take a shower after going for a run? Possible A: feeling refreshed, becoming tired, restlessness, leg cramps, sweating Why is \\"feeling refreshed\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? Answer:","completion":"\\"Feeling refreshed\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because taking a shower after a run helps to wash away sweat, cool the body down, and relax the muscles, leading to an overall sense of rejuvenation and cleanliness. It's a natural response for humans to feel refreshed after a shower, especially after physical activity like running, as the water and cleansing process not only provide physical benefits but also mental satisfaction. Other reasons why \\"feeling refreshed\\" makes sense are: 1. Improved circulation: During a shower, the combination of warm water and gentle water pressure can help stimulate blood flow, which can aid in reducing muscle stiffness and soreness after running. 2. Reduced inflammation: Warm or cold showers can help decrease inflammation in the muscles and joints, which is a common side effect of intense exercise, leading to a more refreshing and comfortable feeling after the shower. 3. Mental relaxation: Showers are known for their calming effect on the mind. The soothing sound of water and the sensation of being cleansed can help reduce stress and anxiety levels, complementing the endorphin release from exercise and contributing to a more refreshed state. 4. Enhanced hygiene: Running, especially outdoors, can expose the body to dirt, bacteria, and environmental elements. A shower immediately after running can effectively wash away these contaminants, leaving you feeling clean and refreshed.

Instead, the Speed Boosters was the earlier name of the teams that later became known as PLDT Home TVolution Power Attackers (women's) and the PLDT Home Telpad-Air Force Turbo Boosters (men's). The paragraph suggests that the teams owned by PLDT had undergone a name change, transitioning from PLDT myDSL Speed Boosters to their respective new team names.

Later on, to better align the branding of the teams with PLDT's home products and services, the teams were renamed as PLDT Home TVolution Power Attackers and PLDT Home Telpad-Air Force Turbo Boosters.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Timmons was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the son of a minister. He had a sister, Eleanor. Both of his parents, and several aunts and uncles, played the piano. From an early age Timmons studied music with an uncle, Robert Habershaw, who also taught McCoy Tyner. Timmons moved to New York in 1954. He played with Kenny Dorham in 1956, making his recording debut with the trumpeter in a live set in May of that year. He went on to play and record with Chet Baker in 1956-57 (bassist Scott LaFaro was part of this band for a time), Sonny Stitt in 1957, and Maynard Ferguson in 1957-58. He also recorded as a sideman with hornmen Curtis Fuller, Hank Mobley, and Lee Morgan, all for Blue Note Records in 1957. Timmons became best known as a member of Art Blakey's band the Jazz Messengers, which he was first part of from July 1958 to September 1959, including for a tour of Europe. He was recruited for the Messengers by saxophonist Benny Golson, who said that \\"He was inventive, [...] He could play bebop and he could play funky - he could play a lot of things, and I thought it was the element that Art needed. He hadn't had anybody quite like Bobby, who could go here or go there, rather than walking in a single corridor.\\" By late 1958 Timmons was sharing bandmate Morgan's East Sixth Street apartment and the pair had bought a piano, allowing Timmons to practice and Morgan to work on composing. From around the time he joined Blakey, Timmons, along with some of his fellow band members, was a heroin user. After leaving Blakey, Timmons joined Cannonball Adderley's band, in October 1959. Timmons was also known as a composer during this period: The Encyclopedia of Jazz states that his compositions \\"Moanin'\\" (from the 1958 album of the same title), \\"This Here\\", and \\"Dat Dere\\" \\"helped generate the gospel-tinged 'soul jazz' style of [the] late '50s and early '60s.\\" The first was written when Timmons was first with Blakey; the others were composed when he was with Adderley. \\"This Here\\" (sometimes \\"Dis Here\\") was a surprise commercial success for Adderley: recorded in concert in 1959, it was released as part of The Cannonball Adderley Quintet in San Francisco album while the band was still on tour, and they discovered its popularity only when they arrived back in New York and found crowds outside the Village Gate, where they were due to play. Timmons was reported to be dissatisfied with the money he had received from \\"This Here\\", and was enticed in February 1960 into leaving Adderley and returning to Blakey's band by the offer of more pay. Timmons then appeared on further well-known albums with the drummer, including A Night in Tunisia, The Freedom Rider and The Witch Doctor. His own recording debut as sole leader was This Here Is Bobby Timmons in 1960, which contained his first versions of his best-known compositions. In the same year, he played on recordings led by Nat Adderley, Arnett Cobb, and Johnny Griffin, among others; on the first of these, Work Song, Timmons did not appear on all of the tracks, because he had been drinking heavily.

He played with them for a while and became known as a composer during this period. Then, in February 1960, he went back to Art Blakey's band again."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

He was the Ambassador to 1975, but back home in 1898, in New Jerusalem, Utah, they all thought he was Ambassador to France. When he disappeared, Mama and I came back through the triple-bolted door that led from our apt in 1975 to our horsebarn in 1898. We returned to the dusty streets of New Jerusalem, and I had to keep on reminding myself that I was supposed to have been in France, and 'polly-voo' for my chums, and tell whoppers about the Eiffel Tower and the fancy bread and the snails and frogs we'd eaten. I was born in New Jerusalem, and raised there till I was ten. Then, one summer's day, my Pa sat me on his knee and told me we'd be going away for a while, that he had a new job. 'But what about the store?' I said, scandalised. My Pa's wonderful store, the only General Store in town not run by the Saints, was my second home. I'd spent my whole life crawling and then walking on the dusty wooden floors, checking stock and unpacking crates with waybills from exotic places like Salt Lake City and even San Francisco. Pa looked uncomfortable. 'Mr Johnstone is buying it.' My mouth dropped. James H Johnstone was as dandified a city-slicker as you'd ever hope to meet. He'd blown into town on the weekly Zephyr Speedball, and skinny Tommy Benson had hauled his three huge steamer trunks to the cowboy hotel. He'd tipped Tommy two dollars, in Wells-Fargo notes, and later, in the empty lot behind the smithy, all the kids in New Jerusalem had gathered 'round Tommy to goggle at the small fortune in queer, never-seen bills.

Q:Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: SEOUL — The head of the United Nations World Food Program (WFP) on Tuesday said the North Korean leadership is hopeful that following a possible denuclearization deal, the international community will increase humanitarian aid for millions of people in the country who are living in poverty and suffering from malnutrition. “There is a tremendous sense of optimism by the leadership, by the people I met with, in the hopes that they will be turning a new chapter in their history, a new page,” said David Beasley, the Executive Director of the WFP during a briefing in Seoul. The WFP director visited North Korea for four days last week, spending two days in Pyongyang and two visiting rural areas outside the capital. Beasley said he was given “remarkable” access during his visit to the restrictive state where contact with foreigners is tightly controlled. Government minders also accompanied him during his visit. Beasley, a former governor of the U.S. state of South Carolina, was nominated to head the WFP last year by U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley, who is also a former South Carolina governor. With the upcoming summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un now scheduled to be held in Singapore on June 12, there are increased expectations that an agreement will be reached to dismantle the North’s nuclear, missile and chemical weapons programs that threaten the U.S. and its allies. Details over the scope and timing of the denuclearization process must still be worked out, but the North Korean leader has indicated he wants to resolve the dispute to focus on improving the economic conditions of the country. Ending the severe U.S. led sanctions banning 90% of North Korean trade that were imposed for the North’s repeated nuclear and missile tests, would open the door to increased economic investment and cooperation. Humanitarian assistance has been exempted from the economic sanctions, but Beasely said import restrictions has made it more complicated to bring in aid, and made...

(AP) -- Lauren Panos was surprised when she walked into her ninth-grade English class in the fall and saw there were no boys. Her parents had not told her they had enrolled her in a new all-girls class at Arrowhead High School in Hartland. Panos still isn't sold on the idea. \\"All the girls there, they can talk out of turn,\\" the 14-year-old said. \\"We are bored of tasks and it's really upsetting.\\" More public school systems are looking at separating boys and girls, whether for certain classes or by total schools, after the federal government opened the door last fall. Supporters say separating students by sex helps them learn better and allows boys and girls to explore subjects they may not otherwise take. \\"Boys just make a bigger trouble in the class,\\" Panos' classmate, Alyson Douglas, 15, said \\"I likes not worrying about boys causing _ .\\" Presently, nationwide, at least 253 public schools offer single-sex classes and 51 schools are entirely single sex, according to the National Association for Single Sex Public Education. In1995, just three public schools offered single-sex classes. Critics of same-sex classrooms argue that proven methods of improving education should be carried out instead of one that divides boys and girls. \\"Too many schools feel they can carry out a social experiment with students' education with really the weakest of theories,\\" said Emily Martin, deputy director of the American Civil Liberties Union's Women's Rights Project. Single-sex schools are an \\"illusionary silver bullet,\\" said Lisa Maatz, director of public policy and government relations for the American Association of University Women. They distract from real problems and do not offer proven solutions such as lower class sizes and enough funding, she said. \\"I would suggest that for many of our kids and families, especially in Milwaukee, it's a question of choice,\\" Spence said. \\"We have a series of choices in Milwaukee and I just think this should be one additional choice.\\" Question: From what Panos said we can learn that _ .

They both touch upon happiness and its role and significance in life, but they tackle the subject from different perspectives and intend to seek out different kinds of information. The first question, \\"What is the main thing to get happy in life?\\" asks for potential factors or elements that might contribute to happiness in life. These can be tangible things, such as financial stability, or less concrete constructs, like love, friendship, or meaningful work. The focus is on the causes of happiness and the variables that might impact it. For example, someone may point to a loving family as their main source of happiness in life, while another person might place career fulfillment or life purpose at the top of their list. The second question, \\"Is being happy the biggest thing in life?\\" is more philosophical and subjective. This question seems to ask if the ultimate goal or principle measure of a successful or worthwhile life is happiness. It invites contemplation about the role of happiness in the broader context of life's purpose and goals. Some people might argue that while happiness is important, it is not the ultimate goal or 'biggest thing' in life, proposing instead that things like personal growth, accomplishment, or contributing to the betterment of society are more important.

Please answer the following question: I can use this background: Soil is well developed in the forest as suggested by the thick humus layers, rich diversity of large trees and animals that live there. In forests, precipitation exceeds evapotranspiration which results in an excess of water that percolates downward through the soil layers. Slow rates of decomposition leads to large amounts of fulvic acid, greatly enhancing chemical weathering. The downward percolation, in conjunction with chemical weathering leaches magnesium (Mg), iron (Fe), and aluminum (Al) from the soil and transports them downward, a process known as podzolization. This process leads to marked contrasts in the appearance and chemistry of the soil layers. Now, I have a new situation: Two brothers owned two adjacent parcels of land.

Which student learned more about how many carbon atoms each molecule of the alkane has? Answer:","completion":"Answer: Jane learned more about how many carbon atoms each molecule of the alkane has. Step 1: Identify the topics each student studied. - Beth studied noble gases. - Jane studied alkanes. Step 2: Determine which topic is related to the information about carbon atoms in alkanes. - The given information states that alkanes are named based on the number of carbon atoms they have. - Alkanes are the topic relevant to the number of carbon atoms in their molecules. Step 3: Match the student who studied the relevant topic. - Jane studied alkanes, which are related to the number of carbon atoms in their molecules. Conclusion: Since Jane studied alkanes, which are directly related to the number of carbon atoms in their molecules, she learned more about how many carbon atoms each molecule of the alkane has."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: Process: - One type of air pollution is the addition of carbon dioxide gas into the air - Some scientists believe that releasing too much carbon dioxide into the atmosphere is one of the causes of global warming - This upsets the balance of the carbon cycle - The ozone layer helps protect us from harmful rays from the sun - It is getting damaged from air pollution such as methane gas from livestock and CFCs from spray cans - Acid rain is created when gasses such as sulfur dioxide get high into the atmosphere - The wind can blow these gasses for miles and then they get washed out of the air when it rains - This rain is called acid rain and can damage forests and kill fish. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose planting more trees happens, how will it affect LESS bad effects of pollution. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"Planting more trees can have a significant positive effect on reducing the negative impacts of pollution. This perturbation influences the process described in several ways, both directly and indirectly. 1. Carbon sequestration: Trees absorb carbon dioxide and store it in their biomass (trunks, branches, roots, and leaves) as they grow. This process is called carbon sequestration. By removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, trees help reduce the greenhouse gas effect and mitigate global warming. This addresses the concern about the increased levels of carbon dioxide released into the air and its subsequent impact on the Earth's temperature. 2. Air quality improvement: In addition to absorbing carbon dioxide, trees also absorb a variety of other air pollutants, such as sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide. These pollutants are trapped and absorbed by the tree's leaves, which then helps improve air quality. This can lead to a reduction in the harmful gases that contribute to the formation of acid rain. 3. Ozone layer protection: While trees do not directly address the depletion of the ozone layer caused by methane gas and CFCs, increasing the number of trees can have some indirect effects. For example, forests can help reduce the need for air conditioning by providing shade and having a cooling effect on surrounding areas. This reduces the energy consumption of buildings, which in turn lowers the emissions from power generation that contribute to air pollution that can harm the ozone layer. 4. Habitat support: Planting more trees helps restore and expand natural habitats for various species, including those that are sensitive to air pollution, such as certain insects, birds, and mammals. As a result, ecosystems can become more resilient to the effects of pollution. 5. Soil protection and water quality: In the context of acid rain, trees help protect soil and water quality. Tree roots hold soil together, preventing soil erosion caused by acidic precipitation. Moreover, the increased vegetation can act as a natural buffer that helps neutralize acidic water, thereby minimizing the harmful effects of acid rain on aquatic ecosystems. In conclusion, planting more trees has multiple direct and indirect effects on the processes related to air pollution. Increasing tree coverage helps to address the increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide, improve air quality, reduce the need for air conditioning, support habitat conservation, and protect soil and water from the damages of acid rain. While it may not have a direct impact on repairing the ozone layer, the collective benefits of planting more trees can contribute to a healthier environment and a reduction in the harmful effects of pollution."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Your body starts to fight the illness. Thats why you want to eat right and get plenty of sleep. You need a strong immune system to fight off illness. Plants dont have an immune system. That does not mean they do not get sick. Plants are affected by disease just like us. Typically, their first line of defense is the death of part of the plant. This prevents the infection from spreading. Many plants also produce special chemicals to fight disease. For example, willow trees produce a chemical to kill the bacteria. The same compound is used in many acne products. You can see a picture of a willow tree in Figure Plants may be smarter than we think. No, they cannot talk to each other. They may be able to send messages, though. Do you have any questions?","completion":"It's interesting to learn how plants protect themselves against diseases and communicate with each other. Just as humans have evolved with immune systems, plants have also developed various methods and mechanisms to combat diseases and pests. To elaborate further, here are some additional strategies that plants use to defend themselves: 1. Physical Barriers: Plant cells are equipped with a rigid cell wall that serves as a barrier against invasion by bacteria, viruses, and fungi. The outer layer, known as the cuticle, also provides a shield against pest attacks and disease-causing pathogens. 2. Chemical Defenses: Plants produce a variety of chemical compounds to deter would-be attackers. These chemicals can be toxic, repellent, or antinutritive for pests and pathogens. Some examples of these compounds are alkaloids, flavonoids, and phenols. In some cases, plants release these chemicals as a response to an attack, while in others, they may continuously produce these protective substances. 3. Systemic Acquired Resistance (SAR): This is a process where plants \\"immunize\\" themselves against future attacks by activating a variety of defense mechanisms. When a plant is infected, it produces signaling molecules called salicylic acid, jasmonic acid, and ethylene that activate defense genes throughout the plant, thus making it more resistant to further attacks. 4. Mechanical Defenses: Some plants have physical adaptations like thorns, spines, or hairs that deter herbivores from consuming them. These mechanical defenses can also provide a level of protection against disease, as they create a barrier for the pathogens to penetrate. 5. Indirect Defenses: Plants can also form relationships with other organisms, such as ants, to help protect them from herbivores. These ants feed on the nectar that plants produce and, in return, they patrol the plant and attack any herbivores that may be causing damage. 6. RNA Silencing: This is a molecular defense mechanism employed by plants to combat viruses. When a virus invades a plant cell, it produces double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), which is a viral replication intermediate. The plant detects this dsRNA and breaks it into small pieces that subsequently guide the cell's defense machinery to degrade the virus's genetic material, effectively stopping its replication. In the context of plant communication, while they indeed do not have the capability to \\"talk\\" like humans, they can send chemical signals. These signals can be transported through the air as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) or through the soil and roots via chemical compounds known as 'infochemicals.' These forms of communication can alert neighboring plants about an impending attack, stimulate growth, or even attract natural predators of their pests.

Eleanora Fagan (April 7, 1915 - July 17, 1959), better known as Billie Holiday, was an American jazz musician and singer-songwriter with a career spanning nearly thirty years. Nicknamed \\"Lady Day\\" by her friend and music partner Lester Young, Holiday had a seminal influence on jazz music and pop singing. Her vocal style, strongly inspired by jazz instrumentalists, pioneered a new way of manipulating phrasing and tempo. She was known for her vocal delivery and improvisational skills, which made up for her limited range and lack of formal music education. As a young teenager, Holiday started singing in nightclubs in Harlem. She took her professional pseudonym from Billie Dove, an actress she admired, and the musician Clarence Holiday, her probable father. At the outset of her career, she spelled her last name \\"Halliday\\", the birth surname of her father, but eventually changed it to \\"Holiday\\", his performing name. The young singer teamed up with a neighbor, the tenor saxophone player Kenneth Hollan. From 1929 to 1931, they were a team, performing at clubs such as the Grey Dawn, Pod's and Jerry's on 133rd Street, and the Brooklyn Elks' Club. Benny Goodman recalled hearing Holiday in 1931 at the Bright Spot. As her reputation grew, she played in many clubs, including Mexico's and the Alhambra Bar and Grill, where she met Charles Linton, a vocalist who later worked with Chick Webb. It was also during this period that she connected with her father, who was playing in Fletcher Henderson's band. Late in 1932, at the age of 17, Holiday replaced the singer Monette Moore at Covan's, a club on West 132nd Street. The producer John Hammond, who loved Moore's singing and had come to hear her, first heard Holiday there in early 1933. Hammond arranged for Holiday to make her recording debut, at age 18, in November 1933, with Benny Goodman. She recorded two songs: \\"Your Mother's Son-in-Law\\" and \\"Riffin' the Scotch\\", the latter being her first hit. \\"Son-in-Law\\" sold 300 copies, but \\"Riffin' the Scotch\\", released on November 11, sold 5,000 copies. Hammond was impressed by Holiday's singing style and said of her, \\"Her singing almost changed my music tastes and my musical life, because she was the first girl singer I'd come across who actually sang like an improvising jazz genius.\\" Hammond compared Holiday favorably to Armstrong and said she had a good sense of lyric content at her young age. In 1935, Holiday had a small role as a woman abused by her lover in Duke Ellington's short Symphony in Black: A Rhapsody of Negro Life. In her scene, she sang \\"Saddest Tale\\".","completion":"This text is about Eleanora Fagan, better known as Billie Holiday, an American jazz musician and singer-songwriter with a career spanning nearly thirty years."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Moores wrote for Drowned in Sound that \\"Somebody considers unleashing a guitar solo, yet its notes are few and the vocals kick back in before it has the chance to go anywhere. Is it a solo or a riff? Whatever it is, it flicks its middle finger at other solos and riffs, exposing them as absurd, flamboyant, shallow fripperies.

Please answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the full name of the person who Winston Churchill bought Chartwell from a family member? Chartwell is a country house near the town of Westerham, Kent in South East England. For over forty years it was the home of Winston Churchill. He bought the property in September 1922 and lived there until shortly before his death in January 1965. In the 1930s, when Churchill was excluded from political office, Chartwell became the centre of his world. At his dining table, he gathered those who could assist his campaign against German re-armament and the British government's response of appeasement; in his study, he composed speeches and wrote books; in his garden, he built walls, constructed lakes and painted. During the Second World War Chartwell was largely unused, the Churchills returning after he lost the 1945 election. In 1953, when again Prime Minister, the house became Churchill's refuge when he suffered a devastating stroke. In October 1964, he left for the last time, dying at his London home, 28, Hyde Park Gate, on 24 January 1965. The origins of the estate reach back to the 14th century; in 1382 the property, then called Well-street, was sold by William-at-Well. It passed through various owners and in 1836 was auctioned, as a substantial, brick-built manor. In 1848, it was purchased by John Campbell Colquhoun, whose grandson sold it to Churchill. The Campbell Colquhouns greatly enlarged the house and the advertisement for its sale at the time of Churchill's purchase described it as an \\"imposing\\" mansion. Between 1922 and 1924, it was largely rebuilt and extended by the society architect Philip Tilden. From the garden front, the house has extensive views over the Weald of Kent, \\"the most beautiful and charming\\" Churchill had ever seen, and the determining factor in his decision to buy the house. In 1946, when financial constraints forced Churchill to again consider selling Chartwell, it was acquired by the National Trust with funds raised by a consortium of Churchill's friends led by Lord Camrose, on condition that the Churchills retain a life-tenancy. After Churchill's death, Lady Churchill... Answer:","completion":"The full name of the person who Winston Churchill bought Chartwell from a family member is John Campbell Colquhoun's grandson.

Kenneth Stensby, 73, of Edina, Minnesota, left a note with the concierge of his hotel on Sunday saying he was going to the top of Vernal Fall and planned to return around noon, officials said. The hotel staff contacted rangers around 5 p.m. when Stensby had not yet returned. Park officials conducted a search on foot with a dog team and a California Highway Patrol helicopter, and Stensby's body was found at the base of the 317-foot waterfall around 6 p.m. Monday, the release said.

The premise focuses on a specific scenario in which two children are engaging in an action (shaking hands) within a particular context (a crowded area). When individuals shake hands, it involves extending their hands towards one another, grasping the other person's hand, and moving their hands up and down in a rhythmic motion. The physical act of shaking hands inherently implies that hand movement is occurring. In contrast, the hypothesis simply states that \\"the children are moving their hands.\\" It does not provide any detail about why, how, or in what context the children are moving their hands. However, based on the premise, which includes the situation of two children shaking hands, it is clear that some form of hand movement is indeed taking place since it is an integral aspect of the handshaking process. Thus, the premise does indeed tell us that the hypothesis is true. The act of shaking hands, as described in the premise, confirms that the children are moving their hands as stated in the hypothesis. However, it is essential to take into account that the premise is specific to a particular scenario where the children are shaking hands in a crowded area, while the hypothesis does not specify any contextual details about the hand movement."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Fairborn mayor Dan Kirkpatrick has confirmed a major reason for Wright State withdrawing from the debate was security concerns around Wright State being an open campus. HASAN ABDUL-KARIM/STAFF Fairborn mayor Dan Kirkpatrick has confirmed a major reason for Wright State withdrawing from the debate was security concerns around Wright State being an open campus. HASAN ABDUL-KARIM/STAFF By Lynn Hulsey Staff Writer Wright State President David Hopkins announced Tuesday the university has withdrawn from hosting the first presidential debate in September. WSU cited rising costs and lackluster fundraising Costs rose well over 8 million University informed Commission on Presidential Debates at noon WSU in an internal remediation to overcome budget deficit RELATED: Wright State cancels presidential debate: 5 things to know UPDATE @ 2:32 p.m. Hofstra University has offered to allow 15 Wright State students to attend the first presidential debate at the Hempstead, N.Y., campus, which replaces WSU as host of the debate, according to Wright State President David Hopkins. “What a very generous offer. I really, really appreciate that,” Hopkins said a day after announcing that Wright State was withdrawing as host of the debate. Hopkins said Wednesday that university donors will be asked to cover the costs for the students, who will be chosen by lottery. Hopkins on Tuesday announced that he had told the Commission on Presidential Debates that Wright State could no longer serve as host of the Sept. 26 debate, the first of four in the general election. Hopkins cited rising security costs that were driving estimated costs up from the 5 million he anticipated to as much as 11 million. He said the university had not been able to convince donors to contribute enough to cover the cost, and the financially strapped university could not afford to cover the cost of a debate. UPDATE @11:47 a.m. Fairborn mayor Dan Kirkpatrick has confirmed a major reason for Wright State withdrawing from the debate was security concerns around Wright State being an open campus. He said officials were confident the Nutter Center could be secured through checkpoints, security guards and fence, but with all the students and community members on campus, it did not feel safe. UPDATE @ 3:34 p.m. The planned presidential debate at Wright State University had been expected to generate about 14 million in economic impact for the immediate area near the Nutter Center, a local official said. “As we expanded it, obviously this impact was to ripple throughout the entire region with an estimated economic impact of approximately 25 million dollars,” said Paul Newman Jr., the Fairborn Chamber of Commerce executive director. Newman said he believes it was a difficult decision for Wright State and David Hopkins, the university president. However, Newman was surprised by the decision and had no warning the university was thinking about pulling out from hosting the event. Wright State President Hopkins had repeatedly vowed he would not fund the debate through university reserves, which have plummeted from 162 million in 2012 to a projected 40 million by 2018 as school officials have spent more than they were taking in. Wright State is cutting 18.9 million more from reserves over the next two years and planning 27.7 million in budget cuts, including 8 million through staff attrition. WSU trustees also raised tuition for graduate and out-of-state students. TIMELINE: Wright State University and the presidential debate UPDATE @ 2:58 p.m. The president of Wright State’s faculty union, Martin Kich, said cancelling the debate was probably for the best. “I think It’s unfortunate we’ve gotten two months away from it and we have to pull the plug on it. I don’t think that makes anyone look good. But if the alternative is we would be left with a sizeable financial liability because of this, then I think it’s the smart thing to do,” he said. Kich said he felt the university was low-balling what the debate was actually going to cost. “Under ideal circumstances, I think it would be a nice thing for the university to host this kind of an event, but given the financial issues the university is grappling with, from the start this seemed like a kind of dubious proposition.” RELATED: No debate for Wright State — community reacts UPDATE @ 2:45 p.m. In a release Tuesday, the Wright State Board of Trustees Chair Michael Bridges said the board fully supports Hopkins’ decision. “It’s the responsible thing to do,” Bridges said in a release. “While the community has been overwhelmingly supportive of Wright State hosting the debate, the safety and security of the campus and community is of paramount importance.” Unlike private universities that have hosted debates in the past, Wright State cannot restrict public access to its campus, which added to the security challenges, the university said. “We were fully aware of the challenges and were prepared to meet them when we decided to host the debate, but things have changed,” Hopkins said. “The current national environment has made security even more critical.” UPDATE @ 2:23 p.m. The Commission on Presidential Debates posted this announcement on its website: “In light of Wright State University’s announcement of earlier today, the September 26, 2016 Presidential Debate will be held at Hofstra University in Hempstead, NY. The Commission very much appreciates Wright State’s efforts. Hofstra University served very successfully as a presidential debate site in 2012. On September 23, 2015, the Commission announced that Hofstra University had agreed to serve as an alternate site this debate cycle if needed. The Commission looks forward to working with Hofstra once again.” 2 million in gifts and pledges will be utilized for student and debate related activities. @daytondailynews@WHIORadio — Kara Driscoll (@karadriscollcox) July 19, 2016 UPDATE @ 2:13 p.m. “We’re not going to shut down the educational institution,” Hopkins said. Wright State was one of four host universities chosen this year by the the commission, a non-profit in charge of producing the General Election debates. Earlier this month, officials said the debate was expensive, but worth it. DOWNLOAD OUR MOBILE APPS FOR LATEST BREAKING NEWS UPDATE @ 2:09 p.m. Greene County Sheriff Gene Fischer said he had not spoken with anyone at Wright State University on Tuesday. He had sent some people from his office to Cleveland for the Republican National Convention to check out the security layout on Monday. “I’m convinced we could have had enough manpower, where’s the money coming from I wouldn’t have any idea,” he said. “We would’ve been able to get the manpower, but fundraising is always an issue.” Fischer said he didn’t remember exactly how many law enforcement personnel would have been needed to cover the event. “With everything going on, every time something happens, the number has to get bigger because you never know what to anticipate,” he said UPDATE @ 2:01 p.m. “I really wanted this experience for our students,” Hopkins said in a news conference. The escalating security concerns have caused the financial costs to rise too much, Hopkins said. The university was expecting to pay about 3.5 million when planning first started, but now it’s exceeded 8 million, he said. Hopkins said with the nature surrounding this presidential election, the costs were too high. “We went into this in good faith,” Hopkins said. Hopkins talks about safety. pic.twitter.com/64yKmAyNZt — Kara Driscoll (@karadriscollcox) July 19, 2016 EARLIER REPORT WSU President David Hopkins said Tuesday that Wright State is withdrawing as host of first presidential debate scheduled for Sept. 26 at Nutter Center. He cited escalating costs for security and the inability to raise enough money from community and state to cover what could be as much as 8 million to host the event. Hopkins said Tuesday in an exclusive interview that he was motivated in part by security concerns raised by the recent attack in Nice, France. “I can’t assure the safety of our students and the community,” Hopkins said. Hopkins informed the Commission on Presidential Debates at noon today, and hopes to recoup at least some of the 2 million fee that was paid to the Commission in advance. Approximately 500,000 had been spent already on Nutter Center upgrades. University will lose some of the 2.5 million they've invested in hosting the debate. — Kara Driscoll (@karadriscollcox) July 19, 2016 The university has raised about 3.5 million in contributions, state funding and in-kind pledges. The university is in an internal remediation plan to overcome its budget deficit, and that also played a role in the decision, Hopkins said. “I can’t dip into more reserves to do this debate,” Hopkins said. “I’m not going to do this when we’re in remediation.” Hopkins said his board of trustees has been supportive and understands the concerns about of spiraling costs and safety. “I wanted it so much for our students,” Hopkins said. “I hate this decision. It hurts my heart.” ||||| Cleveland (CNN) Wright State University is pulling out of its presidential debate scheduled for September 26, and the debate will move to Hofstra University, sources confirmed to CNN on Tuesday. Wright State University President David Hopkins told the Dayton Daily News, which first reported the story , that the university decided to pull out of the debate due to rising security concerns and costs. He said insufficient fundraising forced the university to pull out of the debate, which could have cost the university as much as 8 million, according to the Daily News. Hofstra University, which hosted a presidential debate in 2012, will instead host the first debate between the general election candidates.

Help as much as you can. This article: From the age of six and for the rest of his life Saint-Saëns composed mélodies, writing more than 140. He regarded his songs as thoroughly and typically French, denying any influence from Schubert or other German composers of Lieder. Unlike his protégé Fauré, or his rival Massenet, he was not drawn to the song cycle, writing only two during his long career – Mélodies persanes (\\"Persian Songs\\", 1870) and Le Cendre rouge (\\"The Red Ash Tree\\", 1914, dedicated to Fauré). The poet whose works he set most often was Victor Hugo; others included Alphonse de Lamartine, Pierre Corneille, Amable Tastu, and, in eight songs, Saint-Saëns himself: among his many non-musical talents he was an amateur poet. He was highly sensitive to word setting, and told the young composer Lili Boulanger that to write songs effectively musical talent was not enough: \\"you must study the French language in depth; it is indispensable.\\" Most of the mélodies are written for piano accompaniment, but a few, including \\"Le lever du soleil sur le Nil\\" (\\"Sunrise over the Nile\\", 1898) and \\"Hymne à la paix\\" (\\"Hymn to Peace\\", 1919), are for voice and orchestra. His settings, and chosen verses, are generally traditional in form, contrasting with the free verse and less structured forms of a later generation of French composers, including Debussy.Saint-Saëns composed more than sixty sacred vocal works, ranging from motets to masses and oratorios. Among the larger-scale compositions are the Requiem (1878) and the oratorios Le déluge (1875) and The Promised Land (1913) with an English text by Herman Klein. He was proud of his connection with British choirs, commenting, \\"One likes to be appreciated in the home, par excellence, of oratorio.\\" He wrote a smaller number of secular choral works, some for unaccompanied choir, some with piano accompaniment and some with full orchestra. In his choral works, Saint-Saëns drew heavily on tradition, feeling that his models should be Handel, Mendelssohn and other earlier masters of the genre.

Answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the last name of the person who received his first musical education from his paternal grandfather?, using the article: Bennett was born in Sheffield, Yorkshire, the third child and only son of Robert Bennett, the organist of Sheffield parish church, and his wife Elizabeth, née Donn. In addition to his duties as an organist, Robert Bennett was a conductor, composer and piano teacher; he named his son after his friend William Sterndale, some of whose poems the elder Bennett had set to music. His mother died in 1818, aged 27, and his father, after remarrying, died in 1819. Thus orphaned at the age of three, Bennett was brought up in Cambridge by his paternal grandfather, John Bennett, from whom he received his first musical education. John Bennett was a professional bass, who sang as a lay clerk in the choirs of King's, St John's and Trinity colleges. The young Bennett entered the choir of King's College Chapel in February 1824 where he remained for two years. In 1826, at the age of ten, he was accepted into the Royal Academy of Music (RAM), which had been founded in 1822. The examiners were so impressed by the child's talent that they waived all fees for his tuition and board.Bennett was a pupil at the RAM for the next ten years. At his grandfather's wish his principal instrumental studies were at first as a violinist, under Paolo Spagnoletti and later Antonio James Oury. He also studied the piano under W. H. Holmes, and after five years, with his grandfather's agreement, he took the piano as his principal study. He was a shy youth and was diffident about his skill in composition, which he studied under the principal of the RAM, William Crotch, and then under Cipriani Potter, who took over as principal in 1832. Amongst the friends Bennett made at the Academy was the future music critic J. W. Davison. Bennett did not study singing, but when the RAM mounted a student production of The Marriage of Figaro in 1830, Bennett, aged fourteen, was cast in the mezzo-soprano role of the page boy Cherubino (usually played by a woman en travesti). This was among the few failures of his career at the RAM. The Observer wryly commented, \\"of the..., what would be the answer ?

The band's name is a play on 1960s rock band Dick Dale and the Del-Tones. The Flecktones formed in 1988 when Bela Fleck was invited to perform on the PBS TV series The Lonesome Pine Specials. The original members were Fleck on banjo, Victor Wooten on bass guitar, his brother Roy Wooten on Drumitar, and Howard Levy on harmonica and keyboards. Context: Their debut album, Bela Fleck and the Flecktones (Warner Bros, 1989), received a Grammy nomination for Best Contemporary Jazz Album, as did their second album, Flight of the Cosmic Hippo (Warner Bros., 1991), which also received a nomination for Best Instrumental Composition for the song \\"Blu-Blop\\". Their second album contained the Flecktones's version of \\"The Star Spangled Banner\\". Their next album had another cartoon cover and the palindromic title UFO TOFU (Warner Bros., 1992). The song \\"Bonnie & Slyde\\" had Fleck playing banjo atypically with a slide, an idea suggested to him by slide guitarist Bonnie Raitt. UFO Tofu would be the last album the Flecktones recorded with their original lineup until Rocket Science in 2011. Howard Levy left the band in December 1992. While the departure of Levy was tough for the band, it was not unexpected. During their 1992 tour it became evident to the band that Levy was not happy with the rigors of touring and wanted to spend more time with his wife and children. The remaining trio, consisting of Fleck and the Wooten brothers, recorded their fourth album, Three Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. \\"'Once we started rehearsing, everything was fine,' said Fleck. 'We started finding ways to sound good, and it was real exciting.'\\" Without Levy, the Flecktones as usual spent most of 1993 on the road and released Three Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest in September of that year. In July 1996 the Flecktones released their fifth album, and first live album, Live Art. Devoted fans who had been seeing the band for several years were clamoring for an album to capture the experience of live Flecktones, and this album fit the bill. The trio took home a Grammy for Best Pop Instrumental Performance in 1997 for the track \\"Sinister Minister\\". Question: What is the name of a record company that they were with?.

A dormitory, or dorm, is a building that provides living quarters for college or university students, and it's common for roommates in college dorms to engage in recreational activities together, such as playing chess.

Placing them on grass would be harmful to them and not in line with their natural habitat. - Sewage Treatment Plant: Sewage treatment plants are primarily designed for the processing of wastewater and human waste, and not for accommodating live fish. It would be highly unusual and against common sense to transfer fish to a sewage treatment plant when other, better-suited options are available. - Reflecting Pool: While a reflecting pool is a body of water, it is typically a shallow, decorative feature found in gardens or around monuments. Reflecting pools are not specifically designed to serve as habitats for fish, and the conditions may not be suitable for their health and wellbeing. Choosing a fish tank would be a more sensible option, as such a tank is specifically designed to house fish. - Surface of Earth: The surface of Earth is quite a vague and general option. It could include many places that would not be suitable for fish to survive, such as dry land, roads, or mountaintops. It does not directly imply an appropriate habitat where the fish could survive and thrive.

The question describes a man who enjoys sitting quietly by himself and feels that it helps him come up with his best \\"something\\" about things. Step 2: Evaluate each option based on the context.

Happiness does not reflect a deeper thought process about things. Option 3: insights - This is a suitable choice because insights are understanding or perspective gained from contemplation or thinking deeply about things, which is in line with the context.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Giving Women the Access Code TANDEM Bill Gates and Maria Klawe at Microsoft headquarters in Redmond, Wash., in 2005.Â CLAREMONT, Calif. — When Maria Klawe became president of Harvey Mudd College in 2006, she was dismayed — but not surprised — at how few women were majoring in computer science. A mathematician and computer scientist herself, she arrived at Harvey Mudd (the smallest of the five so-called Claremont Colleges) in the midst of a nationwide downturn for women in computer science. As recently as 1985, 37 percent of graduates in the field were women; by 2005 it was down to 22 percent, and sinking. And the situation at Mudd was even grimmer. Of the college’s 750 students, about a third were women (the figure is now closer to half), but for years the percentage of computer science graduates had been hovering around the single digits. How Dr. Klawe (pronounced KLAH-vay) and her faculty turned things around — this year, nearly 40 percent of Harvey Mudd’s computer science degrees will go to women — sheds light on a gender gap that elsewhere remains stubbornly resistant to changing times. Thanks in part to companies like Facebook, Yelp and Zynga and in part to cultural sensations like the movie “The Social Network,” coders are hip and computer science is hot. Departments across the nation are brimming with students. But those students are overwhelmingly male. In 2010, just 18.2 percent of undergraduates in the field were women, according to the National Center for Education Statistics — in spite of gains in chemistry, biomechanical engineering and other so-called STEM fields (the acronym stands for science, technology, engineering and mathematics). “It must be the unique area of science and technology where women have made negative progress,” said Nicholas Pippenger, a mathematics professor at Harvey Mudd, who is married to Dr. Klawe. Dr. Klawe and others say the underrepresentation of women in the field is detrimental in a larger sense. Computer science, they say, is as vital to propelling society forward in the digital era as mechanical engineering was in the industrial age. “If we’re not getting more women to be part of that, it’s just nuts,” Dr. Klawe said. At Mudd, she continued, “we’re graduating 20 female computer science majors a year, and every one of them is a gem.” In 2005, the year before Dr. Klawe arrived, a group of faculty members embarked on a full makeover of the introductory computer science course, a requirement at Mudd. Known as CS 5, the course focused on hard-core programming, appealing to a particular kind of student — young men, already seasoned programmers, who dominated the class. This only reinforced the women’s sense that computer science was for geeky know-it-alls. “Most of the female students were unwilling to go on in computer science because of the stereotypes they had grown up with,” said Zachary Dodds, a computer scientist at Mudd. “We realized we were helping perpetuate that by teaching such a standard course.” To reduce the intimidation factor, the course was divided into two sections — “gold,” for those with no prior experience, and “black” for everyone else. Java, a notoriously opaque programming language, was replaced by a more accessible language called Python. And the focus of the course changed to computational approaches to solving problems across science. “We realized that we needed to show students computer science is not all about programming,” said Ran Libeskind-Hadas, chairman of the department. “It has intellectual depth and connections to other disciplines.” Dr. Klawe supported the cause wholeheartedly, and provided money from the college for every female freshman to travel to the annual Grace Hopper conference, named after a pioneering programmer. The conference, where freshmen are surrounded by female role models, has inspired many a first-year “Mudder” to explore computer science more seriously. Write a one or two sentence summary.","completion":"Dr. Maria Klawe and her faculty at Harvey Mudd College increased the number of women majoring in computer science by making changes to the introductory computer science course and providing support for female students to attend the annual Grace Hopper conference, which celebrates women in technology. This approach improved the course's appeal to female students and created a more supportive environment for them to learn and engage in the field."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Movie title: Babes in Toyland Context: Lisa Piper (Drew Barrymore), an eleven-year-old girl from Cincinnati, Ohio, takes care of her siblings and cooks for her family. She has no time for toys, and refuses to be treated as a child. During a blizzard on Christmas Eve, Lisa is transported to Toyland. She arrives just before Mary Contrary (Jill Schoelen) is to be wedded to the unpleasant Barnaby Barnacle (Richard Mulligan), although Mary loves Barnaby's nephew, Jack Nimble (Keanu Reeves). Lisa stops the wedding and, with her new friends, finds out that Barnaby plans to take over Toyland. Lisa, Mary, Jack, and Georgie Porgie (Googy Gress) go to the kindly Toymaster (Pat Morita) for help, but he can only help them if Lisa really believes in toys. Barnaby confronts them and the Toymaster, finally showing his true colors, and steals a flask containing distilled evil that the Toymaster had been collecting, before leaving Lisa and company to be eaten by Trollog, a vulture-like monster with a single enchanted eye that Barnaby uses to spy on his enemies. They escape by blinding Trollog with paint and locking him in a chest, but are captured and imprisoned one by one in Barnaby's hidden fortress. Barnaby reveals that he had been creating an army of trolls to take over Toyland, and then attempts to corrupt his captives into being his servants with the contents of the flask, stating he would replace Trollog with Lisa and make Mary his Troll Princess. Lisa, however, proves to be immune to the evil, and manages to reverse the effects on her friends. After escaping from Barnaby's stronghold, they return to the Toymaster. When Barnaby unleashes his army of trolls upon Toyland, Lisa's newfound belief animates an army of life-sized toy soldiers that the Toymaster had created, and they drive Barnaby into the Forest of the Night.

News article: Pakistan agrees to open supply lines after U.S. apology “We are sorry for the losses suffered by the Pakistani military,” she said. “We are committed to working closely with Pakistan and Afghanistan to prevent this from ever happening again.” Pakistan had refused to reopen the border absent an explicit apology from the United States. Although the State Department has long urged the use of what one official called ”the sorry word,” both the White House and the Pentagon had insisted that it was not merited because both countries were at fault in the deaths, which a U.S. military investigation said resulted from a skirmish in which the Pakistanis fired first at U.S. ground forces on the border. The U.S. commander in Afghanistan, Gen. John R. Allen, issued a statement similar to Clinton’s on Tuesday, calling the agreement “a demonstration of Pakistan’s desire to help secure a brighter future for both Afghanistan and the region at large.” Pakistan’s closure of the border resulted in an additional 100 million in transit costs each month as U.S. and NATO supplies and troops have used alternative routes through Central Asia. Those expenses were expected to increase exponentially as the United States begins a major troop drawdown in Afghanistan to be completed by the end of 2014. Pakistan’s cabinet was meeting Tuesday afternoon to discuss the issue, and Clinton’s statement was timed to its decision. The wording of the statement appeared carefully formulated to suit Pakistan’s needs for an apology and the Obama administration’s reluctance to issue a full-throated “sorry” during an election year in which Republicans have accused President Obama of weakness in his foreign policy. The “we” in Clinton’s apology referenced mutual regret, from both her and Pakistani Foreign Minister Hina Rabbani Khar, about the incident. In a telephone conversation with Khar, Clinton said, they both “acknowledged the mistakes that resulted in the loss of Pakistani military lives. We are sorry for the losses suffered by the Pakistani military.” She said Khar “has informed me that the ground supply lines into Afghanistan are opening. Pakistan will continue not to charge any transit fee in the larger interest of peace and security in Afghanistan and the region. This is a tangible demonstration of Pakistan’s support . . . and our shared objectives in the region.” The agreement, Clinton said, “will also help the United States and ISAF [the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan] conduct the planned drawdown at a much lower cost.” “Consistent with current practice,” she said, “no lethal equipment” will transit the route except for supplies destined for Afghan security forces. A Pakistani government statement quoted the country’s new prime minister, Raja Pervez Ashraf, as saying that the continued closure of the supply lines would have forced the country to “impinge” on its relationship with the United States, as well as with other NATO member countries. Pakistan will also reap a financial benefit from the deal. In addition to collecting fees for the transit of containers, it will receive 1.3 billion that the United States owes Pakistan for counterterrorism operations. The Pakistani military had largely deferred to the civilian government to make the decision on reopening borders to NATO convoys. In April, in setting down what it called new “terms of engagement” with the United States, the Pakistani parliament included a demand for an “unconditional apology” for the “condemnable and unprovoked” attack in November. Although the deal means that Afghanistan-bound NATO war supplies will start moving across the border again, the decision also carries the prospect of another public backlash in Pakistan, where public opposition to American policies remains strong. On Tuesday, the Defense Council of Pakistan, which includes pro-Taliban clerics and other foes of the NATO routes, vowed civil disobedience to stop the trucks from rolling. “The decision to reopen NATO supplies is big crime against the country and we will not sit silently over this,” Hamid Gul, leader of the group and a former chief of Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence agency, told the Pakistani cable channel Express News. “We will come to roads and streets and protest against the decision and will also try to stop the supplies.” What are the most important parts of this news article?","completion":"1.

Minutes before the ball dropped on New Year’s Eve, Dave Herman stood in a frigid, jam-packed Times Square, gripping a microphone and staring into the camera. He had just seconds of on-screen banter with “The Office” actress Angela Kinsey before it was back to Carson Daly — but a moment was all he needed. Herman had completed his 100th job of the year, as a correspondent for NBC’s “New Year’s Eve with Carson Daly.” “It was just incredible,” he told the Daily News on Wednesday. “I can’t wrap my head around it, and I don’t think I ever will.” The 27-year-old New Yorker schlepped through 100 different jobs during 2012, from distributing flyers to data entry to telling fortunes. He was a dog-walker one day, a bartender the next. Each job was chronicled on his blog, 100jobs1year.com. Herman, a self-described actor, producer and writer, came up with the 100 jobs challenge when he realized he was swamped with freelance work in late 2011. “I had booked five different jobs in a week,” he said. “And I thought, maybe I can make something of this. Maybe I can do 100 jobs in a year.” He used temp agencies and the Internet to find work. Eventually, word of mouth helped secure even more gigs. Among the highlights was working with “Goosebumps” author R.L. Stine, Herman said. “I tweeted at him on a whim and said, ‘Do you want to hire me as a scary muse?’” he explained. The muse gig didn’t work out, but the pair did collaborate on an improv show, and Herman crossed job No. 78 off his list in November. The over-experienced Herman is launching another creative project in March, called 10,000 Kevins. “I want to see if I can get 10,000 people named Kevin to sign a petition to get Kevin Bacon to take me to lunch,” he said. In the meantime, Herman recently scored a full-time job — one he wants to hang on to for more than a week. “I think I’m afraid of commitment at this point,” he joked.","completion":"A man named Dave Herman completed 100 different jobs in one year, and his last job was being on TV for a few seconds during New Year's Eve.

When flipping a house, even if you've got a great buy, if people do not know about your house they aren't going to make an offer on it. There are a number of different ways you can really get your name and property out into the public eye. Select from the following. (1). Whatever you do, make sure you're making the necessary contacts and the right amount of money. If you end up getting more than 1 offer, you'll be out of luck. (2). You can advertise using ads in the newspaper, online listings or craigslist. You might even consider using mls or \\" multiple listing service \\". (3). Talk to your local bank or credit union and get a broker. Talk to the airline that distributes the most advertising during regular business hours. (4). To make an impression on other buyers, start out with online listings that attract sellers to your location. Advertising to local authorities and forums is an effective way to attract people that wouldn't usually see you with a bad deal. Answer:","completion":"(2). You can advertise using ads in the newspaper, online listings or Craigslist. You might even consider using MLS or \\"multiple listing service\\". When flipping a house, it's essential to get your property noticed by as many potential buyers as possible. One effective way to achieve this is through advertising, both in print and online media. Traditional newspapers still offer a platform for reaching out to potential buyers. You can place an ad in the classifieds section or, even better, include your property in the real estate section, where individuals actively seeking properties will be looking. Online listings are another powerful venue for advertising your property. Many popular real estate websites offer a platform for listing your property, often free of charge. Make sure to include compelling photos and descriptions of the house to entice buyers. In addition, many online platforms allow you to post updates and alerts about your property, ensuring that prospective buyers are always in the know about any improvements or changes regarding the house. Craigslist is another popular online platform that lets you advertise your property directly to prospective buyers. By posting an ad under the appropriate listings section, you can easily reach a wide audience seeking to buy a home in your area. Just like with other online listings, include striking photographs and detailed descriptions of the property to capture the readers' interest. In addition to the methods mentioned above, you might consider using Multiple Listing Service (MLS). The MLS is a platform used by real estate brokers to share property listings with other brokers. By having your property listed on the MLS, you can significantly increase its exposure to real estate agents and potential buyers in your area. Talk to a local real estate agent to help you navigate the process of listing your property on the MLS. By utilizing a combination of these advertising methods, you greatly increase the chances of selling your flipped house quickly. Each platform has its unique benefits and reaches different types of potential buyers. By covering as many bases as possible, you can feel confident knowing that your property will be found by interested buyers, ultimately leading to a faster sale and, in turn, making your house flipping venture an overwhelming success."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You may suddenly be very busy with classes, social activities, and studying. But, you will need to prioritize your significant other and make sure you give them an appropriate amount of time and attention. Even though it's important to give your boyfriend or girlfriend your attention, it will need to be a balance. You are obviously in college because you want to succeed in school, so make sure you are giving the right amount of time to all of your academic responsibilities. Sometimes, combining the priorities of school and a significant other can work, too—try having study dates, or doing homework together. Similarly to making your significant other a priority and making time for them, you need to make sure you make time for yourself. Taking time for yourself might seem like an easy thing to do, but you might find out it can be difficult! If you are having trouble making time for yourself, put it in your planner or on your calendar, and make sure not to schedule anything else during that time. If you go to the same school, or even take some of the same classes, the two of you might begin to feel a little overwhelmed from too much time together. Make sure to pencil some alone time into your schedule. Talk to each other honestly and openly. Do not harbor any secrets or grievances. These omissions can end up weakening your bond, especially when they finally come out. Simply talking isn't necessarily good communication. Make sure you are really listening to your significant other rather than just waiting for your turn to speak. An advantage of living near your boyfriend or girlfriend through college is that when you communicate with them, you can also read into their body language. For example, folded arms might indicate defensiveness, while a lack of making eye contact might signal disinterest or even shame.","completion":"In college, you will be very busy with classes, friends, and studying.

The statement you provided claims that contact between rocks over long periods of time causes rocks to be \\"slippery.\\" However, it is important to clarify that rocks becoming slippery is not a direct result of contact between rocks alone. The slipperiness of rocks is typically caused by other environmental factors, such as the presence of water, algae, or moss on the rock surfaces. On the other hand, \\"erosion\\" refers to the process by which natural forces, such as wind, water, ice, or even living organisms, can gradually wear away and remove rock and soil particles. Prolonged contact between rocks can contribute to erosion, as the constant rubbing between the surfaces can break down and wear away the rock material over time. This process is called abrasion, which is a form of mechanical weathering, a subset of processes that fall under the umbrella of erosion."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: As a parent you might never guess all the ways a good imagination benefits your child. It helps a preschooler : Develop social skills As children play pretend, they explore relationships between family members, friends and coworkers and learn more about how people interact. Playing doctor, they imagine how physicians care for their patients. Playing house, they learn more about how parents feel about their children. Imaginative play helps develop empathy for others. If children can imagine how it feels to be left out of a game or to lose a pet, they are better able to help those in need. They become more willing to play fair, to share, and to cooperate. Build selfconfidence Young children have very little control over their lives. Imagining oneself as a builder of skyscrapers or a superhero defending the planet is empowering to a child. It helps them develop confidence in their abilities and their potential. Boost intellectual growth Using the imagination is the beginning of abstract thought.Children who can see a king's castle in a mound of sand or a delicious dinner in a mud pie are learning to think symbolically . This skill is important in school where a child will have to learn that numerals symbolize groups of objects, letters symbolize sounds, and so on. Practice language skills Kids who play pretend with their friends do a lot of talking.This helps _ their vocabulary, improve sentence structure and promote communication skills. Work out fears Playing pretend can help children work out their fears and worries. When children roleplay about the big, bad monster under the bed, they gain a sense of control over him and he doesn't seem quite so big or so bad. Imaginative play also helps kids vent confusing feelings they might have, such as anger toward a parent or compete with a new sibling . To encourage your youngster's imagination, read to him every day. Books offer children the opportunity to visit other worlds and create new ones of their own. For generations children have enjoyed reading the story... Question: What's NOT the advantage of children having a good imagination?

Article: There’s been a disturbance in the Force, one felt by fans, critics, and everyone interested in the aggregate quality ratings of movies on Rotten Tomatoes. On Sunday, it appeared that Star Wars: The Last Jedi was making history. The gap between the audience score and the critics score on Rotten Tomoates was huge. But now, there are whispers that this isn’t remotely accurate and that the audience score is the result of a hack. On Sunday, a Facebook community page called “Down With Disney’s Treatment of Franchises and Fanboys” claimed that they were responsible for deploying bots to artificially bring down The Last Jedi’s audience score. Inverse spoke with the individual who claims to run the Facebook page. They brazenly call Disney an “abomination” and takes a stalwart defender position on the now discontinued Star Wars Expanded Universe. “Do you see the hate towards Disney unfolding with this movie and the SJW hate?” the unnamed individual said via email when asked about their motives. “Add to that the whole Disney/Fox deal and what Disney will probably do when Net Neutrality is repealed — well now is a great time to strike Disney.” But can they prove it? Short answer: No. “Look for the accounts there that have The Last Jedi as their only review,” the individual wrote in their page. “That is me.” But as of this writing, more than 116,000 reviews had been posted, which would mean scrolling through 920 pages filled with reviews and checking individual user profiles just to find the users that only reviewed The Last Jedi. But this onerous task would prove what, exactly? That many people wrote their first Rotten Tomatoes review about The Last Jedi? The more likely suspect here might just be a ton of genuinely enraged fans. On Sunday, Deadline seemed to contradict any claims of hacking with bots: “The consensus from non-Disney sources this morning is that ‘trolling’ occurred here in regards to the online reaction to Last Jedi.” This means Deadline’s source doesn’t think a hack was at work here, just bad, old-fashioned internet trolls causing trouble. So what does the individual in charge of this Facebook page have against Disney, exactly? And why would they invent a story about deploying bots? It involves a multi-pronged response in opposition to diversity in filmmaking, the discontinuation of the Star Wars Expanded Universe, and blaming the failure of DC Comics films on Marvel. In summation, every issue they have goes back to Disney’s business practices. “They discontinued the Expanded Universe, shut down LucasArts, created an unrealistic environment for any DC movie to find true success and shove SJW messages down our throats.” They also believe that Marvel “sabotaged” the superhero landscape: “Marvel killed and effectively made what Christopher Nolan and Zack Snyder tried to achieve with the superhero genre to be null and void.” In this person’s mind, people didn’t want “Luke Skywalker to be nerfed in favor of MaRey Sue,” referencing the blatantly sexist complaint after The Force Awakens that Rey was a Mary Sue undeserving of her power or her prevalence. “I brought out the worst in all sorts of people by using my bots. One look at bad numbers allows people to go in with a mindset I help create and to tear down the film.” Whether or not these alleged “bots” did open the door for more negative responses to the film remains to be verified, as there’s no feasible way to track the effectiveness. Nor is there a way to prove if these bots even exist at all. However, in scrolling through the actual reviews, many of the negative audience reviews on Rotten Tomoates do skew political in the way they are reminiscent of the claims the “hacker” is making. The people who didn’t like the movie say it’s because there was an “SJW agenda,” or they offer similar criticisms of diversity. Back when The Force Awakens opened in 2015, there was also a small but very vocal group who opposed the ideas of a female protagonist and a black stormtrooper. When reached for comment on this suspicion, Rotten Tomatoes told Inverse: “Similar to other movie sites, we’re currently experiencing a high volume of fan activity around Star Wars: The Last Jedi. We’re closely monitoring all user review activity to make sure it’s valid.” But what does this mean? Or, to put it another way, does the audience score of The Last Jedi reflect the consensus of reality at all? Do the 56 percent of average people who have seen The Last Jedi actually hate it? And because the Down With Disney “hacker” can’t actually prove bots were used, the whole thing is pretty muddy. Still, as Joanna Robinson writing for Vanity Fair on Sunday pointed out: “There’s no social-media record to preserve in amber the 1980 reaction from Star Wars fans to the darker Empire Strikes Back, though I have heard, anecdotally, from some who saw it in the theater, that even Empire had to grow on them.” If there is a divide among human beings who saw The Last Jedi (let’s not even bother to use the word “fans”) on opening weekend, it’s possible we won’t be able to accurately measure that divide for several years to come. In other words, online metrics and vocal Facebook pages claiming to have all-powerful hacking bots are no match for a little bit of perspective on your side. This story is developing. Star Wars: The Last Jedi* is out now. Read Next: “How the Last Jedi Porg Creator Weaponized Cuteness” ||||| Star Wars: The Last Jedi is one of the top-rated movies on Rotten Tomatoes, according to critics, but scroll down the movie’s page a little further and audience testimonies tell a different story. There’s a gaping disparity between what critics thought of the movie (certified fresh) and the feeling a majority of moviegoers walked away from the theater harnessing. How could a movie so universally applauded by critics not have the same resounding effect on general moviegoers? It’s hard to discern whether reviews of the movie are genuine or, as some outlets have reported, generated by bots or organized attacks from 4chan. One Facebook group, “Down With Disney's Treatment of Franchises and its Fanboys,” which aligns itself as a pro-DCEU community, announced on Facebook that it had generated trolls to help review-bomb The Last Jedi’s score on Rotten Tomatoes. (Review-bombing is when a horde of negative reviews with low ratings are left on an entities page in protest.) The page defines itself by its anti-Marvel and anti-Disney stance as a pro-DCEU fan page. “Thanks to friends of mine who taught me a thing or two about Bot Accounts, I used them to create this audience score through Facebook accounts created that subsequently logged into Rotten Tomatoes who rigged this score and still keep it dropping,” the post reads. Questions about 4chan’s influence on the score have also been raised, but a thread on 4chan’s infamous politically incorrect forum, /pol/, has a number of site users claiming that 4chan wasn’t involved. Some 4chan users suggested it was a /pol/ attack because the audience rating is sitting at 56 percent, which could allude to a 2015 meme that /pol/ participants in Europe and the United States used. The term “56” has become notable among 4chan for a keyword used during organized attacks; when the score for The Last Jedi hovered at 56 percent, people thought it was a sign that 4chan was behind the review bomb. One /pol/user noted that, “even if /pol/ could muster up 10,000 people, which would be like 2-3 times the amount for popular strawpolls posted more than once, it wouldn't be enough to change it to 56% and be able to keep it there.” This sentiment was echoed on the thread, with many /pol/ members claiming they wish it had been an organized attack, but downplaying any involvement in it. Some of those comments have been screencapped and can be read below. Just because 4chan claims to not be behind the review bomb doesn’t mean everything is fine. Many of the reviews being left on The Last Jedi’s page call out the film for its inclusion of “SJW” concepts, criticizing the movie for its forced inclusion of race and powerful female figures. Among those reviews, a large portion are from accounts created that day and have only left comments for The Last Jedi. One review, which was left earlier today from a new user named Johnny S., called out The Last Jedi for its political tendencies. A portion of his review can be read below. If you like stunning visuals, superficial character development, a choppy, incoherent, illogical plot, plot holes, SJW concepts such as capitalism is bad, animal abuse is bad, \\"make love not war\\", every bad guy being a white male, and neutering every positive protagonist male in this movie, or you are only a casual fan of Star Wars, you'll probably like this movie. There are countless other reviews like this one that go back to Dec. 14, when the first public screenings for The Last Jedi began. When asked by Polygon whether Rotten Tomatoes was worried about attacks on The Last Jedi, a representative for the company said the website is closely monitoring the situation. “Fans can rate a movie several ways,” the representative said. “They can rate it ‘want to see’ or ‘not interested,’ add a score from .5 to 5 stars as well as post a written review with the score. Similar to other movie sites, we’re currently experiencing a high volume of fan activity around Star Wars: The Last Jedi. We’re closely monitoring all user review activity to make sure it’s valid.” For Rotten Tomatoes — and for general audiences — it’s important to note the difference between illegitimate and legitimate criticism. The Last Jedi, just like any review, is subject to people’s opinions, and all legitimate opinions should be heard. In one opinion piece, we called out the movie for its lack of direction heading into Episode IX, saying “a middle act should not leave so much ambiguity,” adding that we couldn’t see “one clear purpose coming out of The Last Jedi.” Frustrations over how nostalgia is used in the movie, the use of exaggerated comedic bits and the quick dismissal of Snoke as a character are all valid criticism points. Many people walked away from The Last Jedi feeling unsure about how it sits in the universe created by George Lucas 40 years ago. The issue, as many critics have pointed out, is the reactionary response online. When people are burning their Star Wars shirts and calling out for bots to raid review sites as a way of getting disappointment across, that’s when questionable attacks come into play. The last Jedi was quite simply insulting to every Star Wars movie before it. pic.twitter.com/Z4nL2SYVVO — Carson Juhl (@carson_juhl) December 15, 2017 With more than 100,000 reviews of the movie, most people are convinced that something is amiss — especially after predominant polling sites like CinemaScore gave the film an “A” after collecting survey data from the movie’s opening night. The backlash to the movie, which is unprecedented for a Disney film in recent years, led to Dave Hollis, Disney’s president of theatrical distribution, issuing a statement to Deadline about the situation. “Rian Johnson, the cast, and the Lucasfilm team have delivered an experience that is totally ‘Star Wars’ yet at the same time fresh, unexpected and new,” Hollis told Deadline. “That makes this a ‘Star Wars’ film like audiences have never seen – it’s got people talking, puzzling over its mysteries, and it’s a lot to take in, and we see that as all positive, that should help set the film up for great word-of-mouth and repeat viewing as we enter the lucrative holiday period.” Despite the negative reviews flooding Rotten Tomatoes — a number of which, Polygon confirmed just from reading through 15 pages of reviews, contain phrases like “SJW” or “diversity” in their description — Star Wars: The Last Jedi is still one of the year’s most successful movies. The film is projected to have surpassed 220 million during its opening weekend, joining Star Wars: The Force Awakens, The Avengers and Jurassic World as one of four films to cross the 200 million line. As critics have pointed out, this has nothing to do with whether people liked The Last Jedi, but when looking at reactionary comments on sites like Rotten Tomatoes, which allow users to post their reviews with little oversight, it’s important to read the language being used in those descriptions. As cultural critic Peter Coffin said on Twitter, “if you only looked on Reddit (or Rotten Tomatoes user reviews), you’d think the world hated Star Wars: The Last Jedi.” Polygon has reached out to Rotten Tomatoes for more information on whether the audience score is expected to change in the coming days or if it’s expected to hover around 56 percent. If it stays the same, it will be one of the only movies “Certified Fresh” by critics and “Certified Rotten” by audiences. Update (Dec. 21): After reports of the attack being organized by a right-wing group began to circulate, a Rotten Tomatoes representative told Polygon that its security team and database experts “haven’t determined there to be any problems.” Rotten Tomatoes’ full statement can be read below. ||||| Focused crawls are collections of frequently-updated webcrawl data from narrow (as opposed to broad or wide) web crawls, often focused on a single domain or subdomain. |||||Summary:","completion":"Disney's latest Star Wars installment, The Last Jedi, has become embroiled in a controversy over audience and critic divisions on review aggregator site Rotten Tomatoes.

He received a Bachelor of Science degree from Auburn University (then known as Alabama Polytechnic Institute) in 1901. He had already decided on a military career and had become first sergeant of a cavalry company in the Alabama National Guard. However, he obtained his Bachelor of Laws degree from the University of Alabama in 1903 and practiced law in Montgomery, Alabama for a year. Returning to the United States in April 1919, Smith's assignments in the next four years included duty at Norfolk, Virginia, study at the Naval War College, Newport, Rhode Island, and service in Washington, D.C., with the War Plans Section of the Office of Naval Operations. There, he was the first Marine officer to serve on the Joint Army-Navy Planning Committee. Leaving Washington in May 1923, he served aboard the battleships Wyoming and Arkansas as Fleet Marine Officer, U.S. Scouting Fleet, until September of that year. In February 1924, after serving at Marine Corps Headquarters and in the West Indies in connection with joint Army-Navy maneuvers, Smith joined the Marine Brigade on expeditionary duty in Haiti, serving as that unit's Chief of Staff and Officer in Charge of Operations and Training. He returned from that country in August 1925, to serve as chief of staff of the 1st Marine Brigade at Quantico, Virginia, until September 1926, as a student in the Marine Corps School, Quantico, from then until June 1927, and as Post Quartermaster of the Marine Barracks, Philadelphia Navy Yard, from July 1927 to March 1931. In April 1931, Smith began another tour of sea duty, this time aboard the USS California as Aide to the Commander and Force Marine Officer of the Battle Force, U.S. Fleet. He served in those capacities until June 1933, commanded the Marine Barracks at the Washington Navy Yard from then until January 1935, and served the following two years at San Francisco, California, as chief of staff, Department of the Pacific. From there he was ordered to Marine Corps Headquarters in March 1937, to serve two years as director of the Division of Operations and Training, after which he was Assistant Commandant of the Marine Corps under Major General Thomas Holcomb from April to September 1939.

Answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the person that wrote I know that my Redeemer liveth? , can you please find it? The opening soprano solo in E major, \\"I know that my Redeemer liveth\\" is one of the few numbers in the oratorio that has remained unrevised from its original form. Its simple unison violin accompaniment and its consoling rhythms apparently brought tears to Burney's eyes. It is followed by a quiet chorus that leads to the bass's declamation in D major: \\"Behold, I tell you a mystery\\", then the long aria \\"The trumpet shall sound\\", marked pomposo ma non-allegro (\\"dignified but not fast\\"). Handel originally wrote this in da capo form, but shortened it to dal segno, probably before the first performance. The extended, characteristic trumpet tune that precedes and accompanies the voice is the only significant instrumental solo in the entire oratorio. Handel's awkward, repeated stressing of the fourth syllable of \\"incorruptible\\" may have been the source of the 18th-century poet William Shenstone's comment that he \\"could observe some parts in Messiah wherein Handel's judgements failed him; where the music was not equal, or was even opposite, to what the words required\\". After a brief solo recitative, the alto is joined by the tenor for the only duet in Handel's final version of the music, \\"O death, where is thy sting?\\" The melody is adapted from Handel's 1722 cantata Se tu non-lasci amore, and is in Luckett's view the most successful of the Italian borrowings. The duet runs straight into the chorus \\"But thanks be to God\\".The reflective soprano solo \\"If God be for us\\" (originally written for alto) quotes Luther's chorale Aus tiefer Not. It ushers in the D major choral finale: \\"Worthy is the Lamb\\", leading to the apocalyptic \\"Amen\\" in which, says Hogwood, \\"the entry of the trumpets marks the final storming of heaven\\". Handel's first biographer, John Mainwaring, wrote in 1760 that this conclusion revealed the composer \\"rising still higher\\" than in \\"that vast effort of genius, the Hallelujah chorus\\". Young writes that the \\"Amen\\" should, in the manner of Palestrina, \\"be delivered as though through the aisles and... Answer:","completion":"The person who wrote \\"I know that my Redeemer liveth\\" is not mentioned specifically in your article. However, the context and clues within the text suggest that the piece referred to is part of an oratorio called \\"Messiah.\\" This larger work is extensively known to have been composed by George Frideric Handel. Handel was a German, later British, Baroque composer who is well-known for his operas, oratorios, and concertos. His music was highly influential throughout Europe, and many of his compositions remain significant in Western classical music. \\"Messiah\\" is among his most famous works, renowned for its beautiful and emotionally charged choral sequences. \\"I know that my Redeemer liveth\\" is one of the numbers in the \\"Messiah\\" oratorio. Specifically, it is written in E major and is an opening soprano solo. This suggests that Handel, as the composer of \\"Messiah,\\" would be the person who wrote the music for \\"I know that my Redeemer liveth.\\" However, it should be understood that the oratorio \\"Messiah\\" is based on biblical texts, and the lyrics of \\"I know that my Redeemer liveth\\" come directly from Scripture, specifically from the Book of Job in the Old Testament. While the music was composed by Handel, the words themselves are drawn directly from the Bible. In conclusion, George Frideric Handel wrote the music for the soprano solo \\"I know that my Redeemer liveth\\" as part of his oratorio \\"Messiah,\\" but the phrase itself originates from the biblical text of the Book of Job."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Title: Disappointing Product review: I had high hopes for this book as I enjoyed the Secret Life of Bees so much. However, I ended up very disppointed. I finished the book, but wanted it to end quickly. I think what I disliked most was the main character, Jessie. For me, she is believable at first with regard to her history, her mother and issues with her husband. The whole whirlwind, selfish, infatuation with a monk, whom she met briefly 1 or 2 times and immediately fell IN LOVE with was too unbelievable to me. The fact that he's a monk doesn't come much into play for her, which is also somewhat bogus for me. Although I'm probably in the minority, I think that the book could have been written and made interesting w/o the whole affair w/the monk. The issues with her father's death and her mother were the real interesting part for me, the rest unbelievable. Disappointing ending.

The reviewer expresses disappointment with the book, specifically mentioning dissatisfaction with the believability of the main character, Jessie, and her infatuation with a monk. Additionally, the reviewer finds the subplot of the monk to be unnecessary and not as interesting as the other aspects of the story, such as issues with her father's death and her mother.

The goal is to find the longest substring that is a palindrome in the given string. Here's the approach I used: 1. I first consider the given string: \\"nnwnwlnlwlnwwww\\" 2. I start by checking for the longest possible palindrome by checking if the entire string is a palindrome or not. In this case, the complete string is not a palindrome. 3. I then check for a palindrome of length (length of string - 1). I repeat this process, decreasing the length by 1 each time until I find a palindrome. 4. I slide through the string and compare the substrings of the current length, while checking if they are palindromes. 5. I stop when I find the first palindrome in the process, as it will be the longest, since we are starting from the longest possible length and decreasing it. Following these steps for the given input \\"nnwnwlnlwlnwwww\\": - Starting with a length of 13, I slide through the string and check for palindromes: - \\"nnwnwlnlwlnww\\" - Not a palindrome - \\"nwnwlnlwlnwww\\" - Not a palindrome - Move to the next length, 12, and check for palindromes again: - \\"nnwnwlnlwlnw\\" - Not a palindrome - \\"nwnwlnlwlnww\\" - Not a palindrome - Continuing the process, I check for palindromes of length 11: - \\"nnwnwlnlwln\\" - Not a palindrome - \\"nwnwlnlwlnw\\" - Not a palindrome - And so on, until I reach the length of 7: - \\"nnwnwln\\" - Not a palindrome - \\"nwnwlnl\\" - Not a palindrome - \\"wnwlnlw\\" - Not a palindrome - \\"nwlnlwl\\" - Not a palindrome - \\"wlnlwln\\" - Not a palindrome - \\"lnlwlnw\\" - Not a palindrome - \\"nlwlnww\\" - Not a palindrome - \\"lwlnwww\\" - Not a palindrome - At length 6, I finally find a palindrome: \\"nnwnwl\\" - Not a palindrome - \\"nwnwln\\" - Not a palindrome - \\"wnwlnl\\" - Not a palindrome - \\"nwlnlw\\" - Not a palindrome - \\"wlnlwln\\" - Not a palindrome - \\"lnlwlnw\\" - Not a palindrome - \\"nlwlnww\\" - **Palindrome** So, by using the definition of a palindrome and sliding through the given string while decreasing the length of the substrings to be checked, I found the longest palindrome to be \\"nlwlnww\\"."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Let's analyze both sentences in detail to understand the contexts: Sentence 1 discusses the experience of wearing a suit and how it can sometimes feel stiff and uncomfortable. The person mentioned in this sentence is writing training material and prefers to be comfortable while working. The suit is associated with a potential meeting with a customer later in the day, which highlights that the suit may be worn due to professional settings when the need arises. Sentence 2 discusses a separate situation of being on stage and feeling the presence of an audience while wearing a suit. In this context, the person not only feels self-conscious due to the suit but also experiences awareness of being watched by others. To answer your question, the truth of the second sentence is not dependent on the truth of the first sentence. Both sentences are true on their own if one experiences the described situations and feelings individually.

Process: - Kidneys filter waste out of blood - Composition of blood is regulated - Volume of water in blood is kept constant - PH is kept at a constant level - Kidneys help regulate blood pressure - Kidneys stimulate the making of red blood cells - Calcium levels are maintained. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose there was only one person eating happens, how will it affect blood is cleaned through kidney. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis in this context suggests that if there was only one person eating, how would this affect the blood filtration process through the kidneys. To understand the impact of this hypothetical situation, we need to first comprehend the various roles that kidneys play and the factors that influence their functioning. As you mentioned, the primary functions of the kidneys include filtering waste out of the blood, regulating blood composition, maintaining constant water volume and pH levels, helping in blood pressure regulation, stimulating the production of red blood cells, and managing calcium levels. Kidneys accomplish these tasks through nephrons, which are tiny filtering units present in large numbers in each kidney. Nephrons work continuously to eliminate waste products, excess ions, and water from the bloodstream. In the perturbation hypothesis you've presented, there would be only one person eating. This could potentially have several effects on the kidney function, depending on factors like the person's diet, lifestyle, and overall health. 1. Diet: If the person has a balanced diet rich in nutrients and low in harmful substances, it might have a positive effect on their kidney function. The person will likely experience normal kidney filtration and waste removal processes. However, if the person consumes a diet high in sodium, sugar, or harmful substances, it could put a strain on their kidneys over time, making it harder for them to filter out waste effectively. 2. Lifestyle: The person's lifestyle also plays a significant role in determining their kidney health. Sedentary lifestyles and a lack of physical activity can contribute to obesity and other health conditions that impair kidney function. On the other hand, staying physically active and maintaining a healthy weight could help the kidneys perform their functions more effectively. 3. Health conditions: The presence of pre-existing health conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, or autoimmune diseases might increase the risk of kidney damage and affect their ability to filter blood. 4. Hydration: Proper hydration is crucial for maintaining healthy kidney function, as it enables them to eliminate waste through urine more efficiently. Dehydration or inadequate water intake could lead to kidney stones or urinary tract infections, which obstruct the normal functioning of the kidneys. In summary, the perturbation hypothesis you've presented suggests that if a single individual was eating, the effect on kidney filtration and blood cleaning would depend on the person's diet, lifestyle, health status, and hydration levels. Ensuring these factors are aligned with a healthy lifestyle would contribute to proper kidney function and effective blood filtration. On the contrary, poor dietary habits, inadequate hydration, and pre-existing health issues could directly or indirectly lead to decreased kidney performance and compromised blood filtration."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

And I was wondering Why did Jesse do this? Answer:","completion":"When Jesse desperately grasped onto Addison's hand after slipping on the edge of the volcano, it can be understood as a natural human reaction driven by a multitude of factors ranging from basic human instincts, trust, and emotional bonds. Here is a detailed explanation of why Jesse did this: 1. Survival instinct: The most basic explanation for Jesse's action is the innate human survival instinct. The moment Jesse slipped and faced the imminent danger of falling into the volcano, their brain's natural response was to seek support and safety. Grasping onto Addison's hand was an instant reflex to secure their own safety and prevent falling. 2. Trust in Addison: Jesse's act of reaching out for Addison's hand also demonstrates the trust built between them. Having Addison nearby during such a catastrophic event provided Jesse with a sense of security in the belief that Addison is someone they can rely on in life-threatening situations. Trusting that Addison will attempt to help them could have been a source of comfort and courage for Jesse in that critical moment. 3. Emotional bond and friendship: Jesse and Addison likely share a strong emotional bond due to their friendship or relationship. Emotional bonds create a sense of connection that goes beyond mere physical presence. By holding onto Addison's hand, Jesse not only sought physical support but also leaned on the emotional connection they shared. This connection could provide some mental strength amidst the panic and fear. 4. The power of touch: Human touch can be a powerful source of comfort and reassurance. In times of extreme distress, the touch of another person we trust can offer solace and help soothe panic. In Jesse's case, grasping Addison's hand could provide a sense of security and calm that could not be derived from any other action. 5. Collective strength: Two people working in unison can be more effective in overcoming challenges than a single person. By holding onto Addison's hand, Jesse was not only seeking help but also acknowledging their collective strength in the face of adversity. This combined effort could have increased their chances of overcoming the dangerous situation they found themselves in. In conclusion, Jesse's decision to grasp onto Addison's hand as they slipped on the edge of the volcano can be attributed to various factors like basic survival instincts, trust in their friend, emotional bonds, the power of touch, and the idea of collective strength.

Here is a news article: Mississippi quietly passed its “religious freedom” law Tuesday, prompting alarm from gay and lesbian rights activists who say it could be used to justify discrimination in the name of religion. The Mississippi version is narrowed from the religious freedom proposals championed by religious conservatives across the country, and now largely mirrors the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act. “While this is an improvement upon the language that the legislature previously contemplated, it still falls short,” said Eunice Rho of the American Civil Liberties Union. The ACLU had pushed for specific language that would prevent the bill from being used to protect discrimination in the name of religion. “The language still exposes virtually every branch, office, and agency of the government to litigation, which will require taxpayer funds to defend,” Rho said. Republican state lawmakers, spurred by cases in states like New Mexico and Colorado where businesses were prevented from turning away same-sex couples because of laws barring discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, have sought to pass bills that create or strengthen religious exemptions. Many were modeled after the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act, but with new provisions stating explicitly that business owners could use their religion as a legal defense if sued by a customer – legal language specifically designed to protect business owners in cases like those in New Mexico and Colorado. Mississippi has no state laws barring discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. Proposed in about a dozen states, all of these bills have faced significant backlashes, both from LGBT rights activists and business organizations, and until now they have all failed. Arizona Republican Governor Jan Brewer vetoed one in February, after the business community and both U.S. Senators, both Republicans, came out against the bill. In mid-March, Mississippi shelved its version after facing a backlash similar to what has been seen in other states where such bills have been introduced. But the version that passed Tuesday is nearly identical to the federal religious freedom law, with the exception of a provision that prevents employees of private businesses from filing religiously-based claims against their employers. By adopting language that mirrors federal law, Mississippi lawmakers who backed the bill assuaged the concerns of the business community that the proposal could lead to discrimination. “The legislature understands the need to follow the federal approach, and if they do that we’re fine, we’re not going to have a discrimination problem,” Blake Wilson of the Mississippi Economic Council told msnbc Monday afternoon before the final bill emerged. The MEC functions as the state’s chamber of commerce, and has been in contact with Mississippi lawmakers regarding the bill. “We’ve been in plenty of contact with the key folks, and we’ve distributed our position extensively in both houses,” Wilson told msnbc Monday. Prior to the revisions by Mississippi lawmakers, the MEC had opposed passage of the bill. With the business community on board, there were few remaining obstacles to Mississippi being the first state to pass a religious freedom law since the most recent push began. Yet contrary to the beliefs of the Mississippi Economic Council, religious right activists clearly envision the Mississippi law as empowering businesses to discriminate against same-sex couples in the name of religion. Shortly after the Mississippi law passed, Tony Perkins, head of the Family Research Center, released a statement saying as much. “Whether it’s someone like Pastor Telsa DeBerry who was hindered by the Holly Springs city government from building a new church in the downtown area, or a wedding vendor, whose orthodox Christian faith will not allow her to affirm same-sex ‘marriage,’ the provisions of RFRA would apply to prevent the government from discriminating against religious exercise,” Perkins said. ”The Founders never envisioned a government forcing Americans to choose between the basic teachings of their faith and losing their livelihood.” The Family Research Center’s website states that the group opposes ”the vigorous efforts of homosexual activists to demand that homosexuality be accepted as equivalent to heterosexuality in law, in the media, and in schools. “ As msnbc has previously reported, civil liberties groups originally backed the federal law that Mississippi’s version closely resembles. Their opposition to such a law now has to do with how the courts have begun to interpret the scope of religious freedom laws, as not only protecting individual religious exercise but also actions that affect third parties, such as a florist turning away a customer who is purchasing flowers for a same-sex wedding. LGBT rights supporters don’t believe businesses that serve the general public should be able to discriminate against customers on the basis of sexual orientation. A group of legal scholars opposing the bill wrote to Mississippi legislators in March, arguing that in light of recent court decisions, laws designed to defend religious freedom and seemingly neutral in intent could be used to undermine protections against discrimination. “Twenty years ago, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act might have been less fraught with legal and policy peril,” they wrote. “Now, when it will most likely be both seen and used as a shield against enforcement of civil rights laws (current and future), enacting it seems like a uniquely poor idea.” ||||| Photo by Dan Anderson/Reuters On Tuesday, the Mississippi legislature easily passed an Arizona-style anti-gay segregation bill, potentially legalizing anti-gay discrimination throughout the state. The bill, which in an earlier form received unanimous bipartisan support from the state House of Representatives, is almost certain to be signed by Republican Gov. Phil Bryant. That will make Mississippi the first state, but likely not the last, to enshrine anti-gay animus in law. Mark Joseph Stern Mark Joseph Stern covers courts and the law for Slate. Many commentators have assumed that these “religious liberty” bills will be struck down by the courts—but in the case of Mississippi, it’s not quite so simple. Unlike Kansas’ and Idaho’s anti-gay laws, Mississippi’s cleverly couches its animus in seemingly neutral language. After the fallout from Arizona’s failed bill, previously enthusiastic Mississippi legislators rewrote their state’s measure to curb its anti-gay extremism. These revisions struck out the bill’s most odious provision, a section that handed private businesses a blank check to refuse service to gay people. What remains at the heart of Mississippi’s reworked bill is a dense proscription against “state action” that “burden[s] a person’s right to exercise of religion, even if the burden results from a rule of general applicability,” unless it’s “essential to further a compelling government interest” and “the least restrictive means” of furthering that interest. Advertisement If all this sounds cryptic, that’s because it is: The Mississippi legislature’s intention seemed to be to write a bill so broad and opaque that no court could possibly quibble with the constitutionality of the text alone. Indeed, even the most liberal judges of the Ninth Circuit probably couldn’t find a basis to strike down the measure as it stands now. But some day, an ambitiously anti-gay Mississippian is bound to cite the law in court. And at that point, Mississippi is going to find itself with a Romer problem. From the vantage point of the Windsor era, Romer v. Evans might seem like a quaint relic. The case concerned a vicious Colorado constitutional amendment that forbade any city or county from passing gay anti-discrimination legislation, which many gay rights activists—still reeling from their defeat in Bowers—expected the Supreme Court to uphold. Yet six members of the court voted to strike down the Romer amendment, insisting that legislation targeting a specific group must “advance a legitimate government interest”—and really, really hating gay people didn’t quite pass muster. Since then, Romer has stood for the proposition that no state may pass a law expressly designed to demean or disadvantage gays. The question for the courts, then, is whether Mississippi’s new law will disadvantage gay people as a group. And on its face, the statute says nothing about gays: Legislators took pains, after all, to cloak their bill in the legalese of “general applicability,” distinguishing it from the Romer amendment (and Kansas’ recent abomination). But read between the lines, and Mississippi’s bill has the potential to do exactly what the Romer amendment did: pre-empt any city or county from protecting LGBT people from discrimination. A landlord need only insist that renting to gay people “burden[s] [his] exercise of religion,” and a city ordinance banning anti-gay housing discrimination would be suddenly unenforceable. Every attempted protection for LGBT people would be rendered toothless in practice by the religious liberty defense, thus creating a regime of discrimination that looks strikingly similar to the Romer dystopia that the court so resoundingly rejected. ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"Mississippi passed a \\"religious freedom\\" law, which has some people worried because they think it can be used to allow discrimination against gay and lesbian people in the name of religion. This law is similar to a federal law from the United States called the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.

'Scrummy': Soprano Laura Wright has hit back at comments that classical singers are too thin. ‘Scrummy Soprano’ Laura Wright yesterday launched a war of words with Dame Kiri te Kanawa, describing her recent comments about singers being too thin as ‘stupid’. Dame Kiri, 69, stirred controversy last month when she said of young singers: ‘Sometimes they’re more beautiful than their voice, and that’s a bit of a sadness.’ She added: ‘When I was at the Met [in New York], I would see these young girls, starving hungry but terrified to put on weight. ‘They couldn’t even go down to the canteen and eat in front of anyone because they were being watched. ‘You have got to have beef on you if you’re going to sing.’ Laura, 23, who has sung for the Queen six times in the past year, said: ‘It is so stupid she has highlighted body stuff. ‘I find it strange that she is commenting on girls’ figures.’ ‘She pointed out sexualisation of young women in the classical industry and that frustrates me. ‘I just received my first-class degree at the Royal College of Music and at no point in my four-year course did my figure come into it. ‘For me it is about being healthy, I’m not thin or enormous, but just a sporty shape. I look after my vocal muscles and my other muscles as well and I don’t feel the pressure to diet to go on stage thin.’ The divas’ disagreement comes as both women take to the stage tonight in the last of the Coronation Jubilee Festival Gala evenings at Buckingham Palace. Wright’s reaction to Kiri’s comments are in stark contrast to Welsh star Katherine Jenkins conciliatory attitude about Dame Kiri’s scathing comments about ‘crossover’ singers such as herself. Dame Kiri told The Radio Times in May when Katherine’s name was mentioned: ‘We should talk about serious classical singers if you want to stick to the subject.’ Controversy: Dame Kiri Te Kanawa, pictured performing at the Coronation festival, has said modern young singers are 'more beautiful than their voice' Ms Jenkins, 33, who will also perform tonight, said: ‘I don’t think Dame Kiri ever says these things. I think she’s been misquoted, as is so often the case. ‘When I met her, she was a lovely person, so I’m going to ignore it.’ Meanwhile, Ms Wright has revealed that some of her tutors at the Royal College of Music believed that her heavy concert schedule would be a distraction from her studies. Despite her outstanding academic success, Laura added: ‘Some tutors at the College disagreed with what I have been doing and haven’t been supportive.’ Summarize the highlights of this article.","completion":"This article is about a disagreement between two singers, Laura Wright and Dame Kiri te Kanawa.

Please answer the following question: What was the name of the person that painted the painting that the Royal Scottish Academy purchased? Answer the above question based on the context below: Failing to sell at the Summer Exhibition, The Combat was bought from Etty by fellow artist John Martin for 300 guineas (about £24,000 in 2019 terms), following a promise Martin had made to Etty before the painting was complete. The painting was too large for Martin's house, and in 1831 he sold it on to the Royal Scottish Academy. It was transferred in 1910 to the nearby National Gallery of Scotland where it remains. One of Etty's major works, it was exhibited at numerous major exhibitions including the seminal Art Treasures Exhibition of 1857, before Etty fell out of fashion in the second half of the 19th century. Throughout his life, The Combat continued to be considered one of Etty's most powerful paintings. In 1845, Etty took a smaller 89 by 118 cm (35 by 46 in) copy of The Combat, which had been painted by an unknown Edinburgh artist, and completely reworked it to serve as the basis for an engraving by George Thomas Doo. The engraving was published three years later, and the painting used as its model passed through the hands of several collectors in subsequent years, before entering the collection of the Ringling Museum in 1934. A number of sketches attributed to Etty, under the name of A Study for Mercy Interceding for the Vanquished, are also in circulation.After the success of The Combat, Etty continued with his preferred theme of history paintings containing nudity; of the 15 pictures he exhibited at the Royal Academy during the 1820s (including Cleopatra, Pandora and The Combat) all but one contained a nude figure. He was elected a full Royal Academician in 1828, at that time the most prestigious honour available to an artist. The Combat was the first very large work attempted by Etty, and its success prompted him to produce further works on a similar scale over the rest of his career; he produced nine very large paintings illustrating moral themes throughout his career. As time went by his canvases came to be increasingly dominated by nude women.The 1832 exhibition of Youth on the Prow, and... Answer:","completion":"William Etty"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I tried to put the dogs new toy into the basket, but the Pick your answer from: [I] basket was too large.; [II] toy was too large.;","completion":"[II] toy was too large. As soon as I received the new dog toy from the online pet store, I was quite surprised by its size. The toy was much larger than I had anticipated. The website had described it as medium-sized, but the reality was quite different. It was a plush jumbo-sized bone wrapped in brightly colored fabric. It seemed perfect for a larger breed rather than our small terrier, Caesar. However, Caesar showed immense interest in the toy, his eyes wide with curiosity and anticipation. In our home, we have a designated basket where all of Caesar's toys live. It's a cute wicker basket, robust and just the perfect size for his collection of squeaky toys, rubber balls, and various chewing items. Over time, it has become his personal treasure box where he scurries through every morning, choosing what will keep him entertained for the day. I made an attempt to fit this new toy into the basket, adhering to our unspoken house rule of keeping things organized, especially Caesar's belongings. However, I found myself struggling to even fit half of the toy in. After a few attempts of turning and adjusting, it was clear that this plush bone was just too big. I considered our options. Buying a new, larger basket was one, but it wouldn't quite fit in Caesar's designated corner. Downsizing the toy by taking out a part of its stuffing seemed harsh and unjust to our eagerly waiting pet. We could leave the toy out, but then it would throw off the balance of our well-thought-out decor. Facing this challenge, the solution I finally came up with was to install a small shelf above the current basket. It would be like a dual-story house for Caesar's toys. This way, the smaller toys could remain in the basket, and the larger ones, including this new huge plush bone, could rest on the shelf. I congratulated myself on the thought, not just finding a solution, but an opportunity to enhance Caesar's corner aesthetically too. The meticulously cleaned and polished wood for the shelf matched the rest of the furniture in the room. Looking at Caesar, who was all this while observing with hopeful eyes, I handed him the plush bone. His tail wagged with joy and he trotted away happily with his larger-than-life toy. After all, seeing Caesar happy was what mattered most. It was a simple reminder about life- some problems may seem hard to handle at first, just like the large toy, but with a bit of creativity, practicality, and patience, there's always a way around, a solution waiting to be unearthed."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer: Gorbachev's expansion of Glasnost allowed for open discussion on any subject in the media, breaking away from previous Communist Party restrictions. By appealing directly to the people for support and offering increased civil liberties, Gorbachev effectively bypassed the Central Committee's control and silenced the Party \\"conservatives\\" who opposed political reform.

Movie title: Evening Movie plot: The film alternates between two time periods, the 1950s and the present, in which a dying Ann Grant Lord (Vanessa Redgrave) reflects on her past. Her confusing comments about people she never mentioned before leave her daughters, reserved Constance (Natasha Richardson) and restless Nina (Toni Collette), wondering if their mother is delusional. As a young woman in her early twenties, cabaret singer Ann (Claire Danes) arrives at the spacious Newport, Rhode Island, home of her best friend Lila Wittenborn (Mamie Gummer), who is on the verge of getting married to Karl Ross (Timothy Kiefer). Lila's brother (and Ann's college friend) Buddy (Hugh Dancy) introduces her to Harris Arden (Patrick Wilson), a young doctor and the son of a former family servant. Buddy tells Ann his sister always has adored Harris, and expresses his concern that she's marrying another man out of a sense of duty rather than love. Inebriated, Buddy passes out, and as Ann and Harris chat they find themselves bonding. On Lila's wedding day, she confesses to Ann that she confronted Harris with her feelings for him and he rebuffed her, so she goes along with the ceremony as planned and marries Karl. At the reception, at Lila's request, Ann sings a song and is joined on stage by Harris. Afterwards Buddy, drunk again, confronts the two about their growing closeness. Then he unexpectedly kisses Harris. As Lila prepares to depart with her new husband, Ann offers to take the bride away with her, but Lila refuses and leaves for her honeymoon. Buddy admits to Ann he's had a crush on Harris since his childhood, though he also claims not to be \\"that way\\" - he denies that this would be okay as Ann assures him. He then changes the subject, confessing he has loved Ann ever since their college days, offering as proof a note she once sent him he has kept in his pocket ever since. Ann is unconvinced.

Answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the first name of the person whose relationship with Shostakovich's was tender? Stalin's death in 1953 was the biggest step toward Shostakovich's rehabilitation as a creative artist, which was marked by his Tenth Symphony. It features a number of musical quotations and codes (notably the DSCH and Elmira motifs, Elmira Nazirova being a pianist and composer who had studied under Shostakovich in the year before his dismissal from the Moscow Conservatory), the meaning of which is still debated, while the savage second movement, according to Testimony, is intended as a musical portrait of Stalin. The Tenth ranks alongside the Fifth and Seventh as one of Shostakovich's most popular works. 1953 also saw a stream of premieres of the \\"desk drawer\\" works. During the forties and fifties, Shostakovich had close relationships with two of his pupils, Galina Ustvolskaya and Elmira Nazirova. In the background to all this remained Shostakovich's first, open marriage to Nina Varzar until her death in 1954. He taught Ustvolskaya from 1937 to 1947. The nature of their relationship is far from clear: Mstislav Rostropovich described it as \\"tender\\". Ustvolskaya rejected a proposal of marriage from him after Nina's death. Shostakovich's daughter, Galina, recalled her father consulting her and Maxim about the possibility of Ustvolskaya becoming their stepmother. Ustvolskaya's friend Viktor Suslin said that she had been \\"deeply disappointed\\" in Shostakovich by the time of her graduation in 1947. The relationship with Nazirova seems to have been one-sided, expressed largely through his letters to her, and can be dated to around 1953 to 1956. He married his second wife, Komsomol activist Margarita Kainova, in 1956; the couple proved ill-matched, and divorced three years later. In 1954, Shostakovich wrote the Festive Overture, opus 96; it was used as the theme music for the 1980 Summer Olympics. (His '\\"Theme from the film Pirogov, Opus 76a: Finale\\" was played as the cauldron was lit at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece.) In 1959, Shostakovich appeared on stage in Moscow at the end of a concert performance...

Think like you are answering to a five year old. What is the formula for maximum acceleration? How is this formula determined? How is maximum velocity calculated? How is the formula determined? Please tell me if those questions are the same.","completion":"Hello! I'll explain those concepts to you like you're a five-year-old! 1. Maximum acceleration: Acceleration is how fast something speeds up. Think of it like riding a bike or playing on a swing. The faster you pedal or push on the swing, the faster it goes. The formula for maximum acceleration is F = m * a, which means Force (F) = mass (m) * acceleration (a). The mass is how heavy something is, and acceleration is how fast it speeds up. To understand how this formula is determined, imagine pushing a toy car. The harder you push (force), the faster the car speeds up (acceleration). The weight of the car (mass) also plays a role. A heavier car needs more force to speed up than a lighter car. 2. Maximum Velocity: Velocity is how fast something moves in a certain direction. Think of it like how fast a race car goes around a track. To calculate maximum velocity, we need to use this formula: v = u + a * t. In this formula, v is the final velocity, u is the initial velocity (or the speed before the race starts), a is the acceleration, and t is the time it takes to speed up or slow down. To understand how this formula is determined, imagine pushing a toy car again. If you give it a gentle push and let go, the car starts moving at a certain initial speed (u). If you keep pushing harder, it speeds up (acceleration) over some time (t). The final speed (v) is the sum of initial speed and the speed gained due to acceleration. Now, these two questions are not the same. The first question is about acceleration, which is how fast something speeds up. The second question is about velocity, which is how fast something moves in a certain direction. Both concepts are important, and they help us understand how things move."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Phase transitions are one obvious example. When a substance makes a transition from the liquid state to the gaseous state, the particles have many more possible arrangements, because they are no longer confined to a specified volume in which they are close to each other; gas particles can move freely throughout their container. Vaporization represents an increase in entropy. In the opposite direction, a liquid loses entropy when it freezes to a solid. Because solids have very ordered structures, there are fewer possible arrangements of particles that would result in the properties associated with a solid. Now, I have a new situation: Rob was in his chemistry lab, experimenting with different states of matter. He had a liquid substance that he labeled as state A. He then transformed half of the liquid substance to gaseous state. He labeled it as state B. Finally, he froze the remaining half of the liquid to solid state. He labeled it as state C.

Here is a news article: Image copyright ESA/ROSETTA/NAVCAM Image caption The new report answers one of the big questions of the Rosetta mission The rubber duck-shaped comet being followed by Europe's Rosetta probe used to be two separate objects. Scientists say pictures of 67P show its two lobes to have \\"onion skin\\" layers that intersect in a way that can only be the result of two different bodies having collided and stuck together. Ever since Rosetta arrived at the comet, the origin of its bizarre form has been one of the major puzzles. The solution is now due to be published in the journal Nature. Mission team members have also held a media conference to give further details, at the European Planetary Science Congress in Nantes, France. Rosetta first spied the duck shape on approach to 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko in July 2014. The idea that it was a \\"contact binary\\" - two conjoined comets - was a popular explanation from the word go. But proving it has not been straightforward. An alternative possibility is simply that the icy dirt ball has been sculpted this way. Every time it comes around the Sun, 67P's ices warm and it throws off gas and dust, and it could have been that this process has dominated in just one region to produce the distinctive appearance. The Osiris camera on Rosetta can now settle the debate. It reveals layers up to 650m thick in the body of the duck that are independent of similar strata detected in its head. Image copyright ESA/ROSETTA/MPS FOR OSIRIS TEAM Image caption The deep pit at bottom-right shows the internal layering on the duck's body Additional measurements taken by Rosetta of variations in the local tug of gravity across the lobes also support this two-body origin. The direction of the tugging is more closely aligned with the independent layering than with a centre of mass associated with a single object. Union of onions Scientists say that to collide and stick together, the impact must have been a very low velocity one - perhaps just a few metres per second. Any faster and the primary objects would have done enormous damage to each other. \\"I would say it's a quite beautiful love story,\\" Matteo Massironi, from the Osiris team, said at Monday's press briefing. He added that a key piece of evidence was a series of cross-sections of the comet, which the team were able to construct by extending the layers glimpsed on the surface into a 3D model of 67P's interior. These cross-sections painted a clear picture of two distinct sets of layers, reminiscent of a pair of onions. \\"You don't know the structure of an onion until you cut across it,\\" Dr Massironi said. \\"What we have seen is that this stratification is really continuous - and that [the one in the tail] doesn't match that of the head.\\" The discovery's consequences for what we understand about comet formation could be quite profound, says team member Stephen Lowry from Kent University, UK. \\"It shows that comets were forming into large sizes and that they were then still colliding in this grown form to make even larger comets. So, it's not simply a case of independent comets completely forming out of centimetre- or metre-sized planetesimals, to make the comets we see today. And that's really quite fascinating, because it could be quite a ubiquitous process.\\" Image copyright ESA/ROSETTA/MPS FOR OSIRIS TEAM Image caption The local gravity field supports the idea that 67P was once two separate objects rather than a single formation Other comets seen at relatively close quarters also display lobed shapes, including comets Halley, Borrelly and Hartley-2. Could they also be the result of low-velocity bump-and-stick events? The tantalising prospect now is whether what was once two objects could split into two again. Could the constant erosion of gas and dust result in the duck losing its head? And will Rosetta be on hand to witness it? The European Space Agency (Esa) probe has pictured a crack in the neck region of 67P, says Dr Lowry. \\"If a comet is going to split, it's most likely to break along the interface between the two lobes. But I haven't seen any evidence yet that the crack is getting longer or wider. That's a strong indicator to me that perhaps 67P won't split on this orbit of the Sun.\\" Image copyright NASA Image caption Comets Borrelly and Hartley-2 have lobed shapes. Were they also made in low velocity collisions between objects The comet takes just over six years to orbit the Sun and the Rosetta mission, after receiving a 10-month extension, will nonetheless end in September 2016. At that point the spacecraft will spiral gradually closer and land yet again on 67P, said Esa project scientist Matt Taylor at the press conference - making a reference to the Philae lander's bumpy touchdown in November 2014. He added that although the comet had passed its \\"perihelion\\" (its closest approach to the Sun), the mission was really only just beginning. \\"The papers are starting to flow.\\" Comet 67P - \\"Space duck\\" in numbers A full rotation of the body takes just over 12.4 hours The axis of rotation runs through the \\"neck\\" region Its larger lobe (\\"body\\") is about 4.1 × 3.3 × 1.8 km The smaller lobe (\\"head\\") is about 2.6 × 2.3 × 1.8 km Gravity measurements give a mass of 10 billion tonnes Mapping estimates the volume to be about 21.4 cubic km The density works out at about 470kg per cubic metre This would imply that Comet 67P is highly porous It is 70-80% empty space, but are there big voids inside?

In a paper published in Nature, researchers say that the nucleus of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko is made of two formerly distinct bodies that likely came together in a gentle collision in the early stages of the solar system. It's a cometary partnership that has lasted billions of years. The European Space Agency's Rosetta orbiter began sending back the earliest images of comet 67P's strange, bi-lobed shape in July 2014, and scientists have been wondering about the origins of its unusual morphology ever since. The comet has three distinct regions -- a major lobe (the main body of the \\"duck\\"), a minor lobe (the head) and a thin, neck-like region that connects the two. \\"Since we resolved the comet, the question of whether it was two objects that joined together or one comet that has been eaten away has been dangling,\\" said Matt Taylor of the European Space Agency, project scientist for the Rosetta mission. \\"Now we have answered it -- it's a contact binary.\\" To come to this conclusion, an international research team analyzed images of the comet collected by cameras aboard the Rosetta orbiter. The scientists were particularly interested in the distinct layers of material called strata that were visible along the comet's many steep cliffs, and which continue at least 2,000 feet into the center of its nucleus. These concentric strata suggest that the structure of the comet is similar to that of an onion. If the comet had always been just one body with what looks like a bite taken out of it, the scientists would expect to see the layers on both lobes arranged around a center point of gravity close to the neck. Instead, the researchers observed that the layers were generally well-ordered around the local gravity of each lobe. This suggests the lobes formed individually, each around their own center of mass.

This image of a wide terrace with a 600-foot-deep pit shows the inner, layered skeleton of comet 67P's nucleus.

Finally, the team looked at gravity vectors that run perpendicular to the strata and found that they matched computer models of two separate objects, rather than a single object. See the most-read Science stories this hour >> \\"All together, these three lines of evidence leave a very narrow space for doubt,\\" said Matteo Massironi of the University of Padua in Italy, who led the investigation. Joseph Masiero, a scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory who specializes in asteroids and comets, said the argument is convincing. \\"If you put it together, it looks like you have two onions sitting next to each other, not a single onion with a piece taken out,\\" said Masiero, who wasn't involved in the study. The authors note that the two lobes of comet 67P are strikingly similar in terms of their structure, which suggests that both lobes may have come from the same region of the solar system, or at least formed through similar processes, Taylor said. However, questions remain. The paper does not address what processes helped these two bodies become one. Most impacts cause objects to break apart, not stick together. Could these two objects simply have nudged each other and then became stuck? Possibly. In a paper published earlier this year in Science, a different set of researchers used 3-D computer simulations to show how two bodies moving at bicycle speed might gently collide and then merge together. They also found that a very low-velocity impact would displace some but not all of the material on the two bodies involved. Massironi said the two objects that make up comet 67P are not necessarily being held together by gravity alone. \\"There could have been some processes of cementation during the collision itself and in the following evolution of the comet,\\" he said. It seems more work will need to be done on that line of inquiry as well. \\"They convinced me that these are two things stuck together,\\" Masiero said. \\"But how do you stick them together? That's clearly the next question.\\" Science rules! Follow me @DeborahNetburn and \\"like\\" Los Angeles Times Science & Health on Facebook.

I found the following answer on Google: The project was organized by the Council of Federated Organizations (COFO), a coalition of the Mississippi branches of the four major civil rights organizations ( SNCC , CORE , NAACP and SCLC ). Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. Answer:","completion":"Yes, the answer you found is accurate, but it only covers a portion of what Freedom Summer was. To provide you with a more detailed understanding, Freedom Summer, also known as the Mississippi Summer Project, was a voter registration drive held in 1964 aimed at increasing the number of registered African American voters in Mississippi. The southern state was known for its institutionalized racial segregation and violent suppression of black voting rights. The project was indeed organized by the Council of Federated Organizations (COFO), a coalition of the Mississippi branches of the four major civil rights organizations: the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE), the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC). The Freedom Summer campaign involved over a thousand volunteers, mostly white college students from the North, who worked alongside local African American activists. They engaged in various activities such as establishing \\"Freedom Schools,\\" which provided alternative education with a focus on black history, literacy training, and civic engagement. They also established community centers and offered legal assistance for African American citizens. However, the Freedom Summer was met with significant resistance from local white supremacists, often leading to violence against the activists. There were numerous incidents of beatings, bombings, and arrests. The most infamous event occurred when three civil rights workers, James Chaney, Andrew Goodman, and Michael Schwerner, were abducted and murdered by members of the Ku Klux Klan. Despite the challenges and violence, Freedom Summer played a pivotal role in raising awareness about the pervasive racial discrimination and voter suppression in the South. It also contributed to the eventual passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which outlawed discriminatory voting practices and substantially increased African American voter registration."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

He was the eldest of six children born to Nancy Hamilton (1901-1972) and Joseph Hayes (1887-1978). The Hayes children were: Ira (1923-1955), Harold (1924-1925), Arlene (1926-1929), Leonard (1927-1952), Vernon (1929-1958), and Kenneth (born 1931). Joseph Hayes was a World War Context: Hayes enlisted in the Marine Corps Reserve on August 26, 1942. He completed recruit training in Platoon 701 at Marine Corps Base, San Diego (renamed in 1948, Marine Corps Recruit Depot, San Diego) and in October volunteered for Marine paratrooper (Paramarine) training at the Marine Parachute School at Camp Gillespie located east of San Diego. He received the codename of Chief Falling Cloud. On November 30, he graduated from the Parachute Training School and received his silver \\"jump wings\\". On December 1, he was promoted to Private First Class. On December 2, 1942, he joined Company B, 3rd Parachute Battalion, Divisional Special Troops, 3rd Marine Division, at Camp Elliott, California. On March 14, 1943, Hayes sailed for New Caledonia with the 3rd Parachute Battalion, which was assigned to Camp Kiser there on March 25 until September 26; the unit was redesignated in April as Company K, 3rd Parachute Battalion, 1st Marine Parachute Regiment of the I Marine Amphibious Corps. The 3rd battalion was shipped to Guadalcanal and remained there until it was sent to Vella Lavella, arriving on October 14 for occupational duty. On December 4, Hayes landed with the 3rd battalion on Bougainville and fought against the Japanese as a platoon automatic rifleman (BAR man) with Company K during the Bougainville Campaign. The 3rd Parachute Battalion was shipped back to Guadalcanal, and he stayed there until sometime in February when the Paramarines were sent back to California. The 1st Parachute Regiment was officially disbanded at Camp Pendleton, California, in February 1944. Hayes was transferred to Company E, 2nd Battalion, 28th Marine Regiment of the newly activated 5th Marine Division at Camp Pendleton. Hayes sailed to Hawaii with his company in September for continued training with the 5th division as it trained for the invasion and capture of Iwo Jima. Question: how was ira involved with wwII Answer:","completion":"Ira Hayes was involved in World War II as a soldier in the United States Marine Corps. He joined the Marines in 1942 and trained to be a paratrooper, which means he learned how to jump out of airplanes to fight in battles. He got a special nickname, \\"Chief Falling Cloud.\\" Ira was part of a few different groups in the Marines and fought against the Japanese in many places, like Guadalcanal, Vella Lavella, and Bougainville.

Context: It would have to be this… Donald Trump once cashed a 0.13 check… In 1990, writer from a “Spy Magazine” had a great idea for a prank: “What would happen if you sent checks for small amounts to celebrities and saw who cashed them, putting to test the theory that every man (and woman) has a price? In their words: \\"We could however, send them checks for minuscule sums of money—sums so small they couldn’t fund as much as a minute of the recipients’ existence—and see who would bother to bank these teensy amounts of money.\\" Spy thought \\"some subterfuge\\" would be necessary—it'd be suspicious to get a check from the magazine that lampooned so many of the intended recipients. This was specifically true for Trump, who Spy once famously referred to as a \\"short-fingered vulgarian.\\" So, they created a fully funded and incorporated company called National Refund Clearinghouse, which allowed them to open a checking account. Then they drafted a letter explaining that the check was a refund for a small overcharge that had occurred in 1988—what the celebrities had been overcharged for was never mentioned. They sent the checks out (initially for 1.11) to 58 well-known people like Cher, Henry Kissinger, and, of course, Donald Trump. Of the 58, 26 cashed the checks—Donald included. The magazine drafted a followup letter and checks for 0.64 to those 26 people to see who would take more free money. Thirteen—including Donald Trump—deposited the checks worth two quarters, a dime, and four pennies into their banks. Then they went for one last score: in honor of those 13 people, 13 more checks for 0.13. Two people cashed them: a Saudi arms dealer named Adnan Khashoggi, and Donald Trump.

Grant resolves to track down the gang and avenge Milo's death, despite Biscuit's reservations. Heading back into Utah, they find one of the gang's trucks overturned and several of the members dead. Before dying, one of them reveals that they planned to turn themselves in but were killed by Missoula, who is headed north through Wyoming to Montana. The boys also meet Jessie, a young woman who runs a gas station and towing business. Catching up to Missoula's truck, Grant and Biscuit engage in a high-speed shootout with Missoula and his buddy Blix, but swerve off the road and crash. They are rescued by Jessie, who teaches Grant how to shoot and ride a horse and strikes up a romance with him. Meanwhile, Biscuit has a dream in which he is part of a Native American tribe who are slaughtered by Union Army soldiers led by Missoula. Upon awakening, he begins to imitate a Native American warrior and insists on resuming the pursuit.

Although words related in form or meaning, e.g. Hellenist (Ancient Greek: Ἑλληνιστής, Hellēnistēs), have been attested since ancient times, it was J. G. Droysen in the mid-19th century, who in his classic work Geschichte des Hellenismus, i.e. History of Hellenism, coined the term Hellenistic to refer to and define the period when Greek culture spread in the non-Greek world after Alexander’s conquest. Following Droysen, Hellenistic and related terms, e.g. Hellenism, have been widely used in various contexts; a notable such use is in Culture and Anarchy by Matthew Arnold, where Hellenism is used in contrast with Hebraism.\\". Can you tell me what it is? Answer:","completion":"The answer to the question, \\"Which of the following does not refer to the same work: History of Hellenism, Geschichte des Hellenismus, or Culture and Anarchy?\\" is Culture and Anarchy. Both \\"History of Hellenism\\" and \\"Geschichte des Hellenismus\\" refer to the same work, as they are simply translations of the title of J.G.

Droysen coined the term \\"Hellenistic\\" in this work to describe the period when Greek culture spread in the non-Greek world after Alexander the Great's conquests. On the other hand, \\"Culture and Anarchy\\" is a different work altogether. It was written by Matthew Arnold and does not solely focus on Hellenism. Instead, it is a collection of essays on culture, politics, and society. In this work, Arnold uses the term \\"Hellenism\\" in contrast to \\"Hebraism,\\" discussing the importance of these two concepts in shaping the cultural and intellectual life of his time.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Which is the outermost layer of the atmosphere????","completion":"The outermost layer of the atmosphere is called the exosphere. The Earth's atmosphere is composed of several layers that extend from the Earth's surface to approximately 621 miles (1,000 kilometers) further into space. These layers are defined based on temperature variations and composition. Let's discuss the various layers of the atmosphere and provide a brief explanation of the exosphere, with its specific characteristics and relevance. 1. Troposphere: This is the lowest layer of the atmosphere, extending from the Earth's surface to an altitude of about 4 to 12 miles (6 to 20 kilometers) depending on the location. It contains roughly 80% of the total mass of the atmosphere and is the region where weather occurs, including clouds, storms, and precipitation. 2. Stratosphere: The stratosphere lies above the troposphere, extending from an altitude of around 12 miles (20 kilometers) up to around 31 miles (50 kilometers). The temperature in this layer generally increases with altitude due to the presence of the ozone layer, which absorbs solar ultraviolet radiation and protects life on Earth from harmful effects. 3. Mesosphere: The mesosphere stretches from the top of the stratosphere at about 31 miles (50 kilometers) to about 53 miles (85 kilometers) in altitude. In this layer, temperatures decrease with altitude, reaching their lowest point at the mesopause, which lies at the boundary of the mesosphere and the next layer. 4. Thermosphere: This is the layer above the mesosphere, extending from about 53 miles (85 kilometers) to about 373 miles (600 kilometers) above the Earth's surface. Here, the temperature increases with altitude due to the absorption of high-energy solar radiation by the low-density gases present. The thermosphere is also the region where auroras occur and where the International Space Station (ISS) orbits the Earth. 5. Exosphere: The exosphere is the outermost layer of Earth's atmosphere, starting at the outer edge of the thermosphere at around 373 miles (600 kilometers) above the Earth and extending up to 621 miles (1,000 kilometers) or more, merging seamlessly with interplanetary space. This layer is composed mainly of low-density hydrogen, helium, and other trace gases. The exosphere is characterized by sparsely scattered gas particles that gradually get thinner and eventually merge with the solar wind, a stream of charged particles emanating from the Sun. Since the exosphere lacks a definitive boundary separating it from interplanetary space, its outer limit is poorly defined. The main importance of this layer lies in the fact that it acts as the medium through which satellites (especially those in geostationary orbits) and other man-made objects orbit the Earth. Additionally, it helps protect life on Earth from solar radiation and space debris through various interacting phenomena. In summary, the exosphere is the outermost layer of the Earth's atmosphere, characterized by very low density and primarily composed of hydrogen, helium, and some trace gases. This layer merges gradually into interplanetary space and plays an essential role in supporting satellite communication and protecting Earth from space debris and solar radiation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Background: John Kenneth Galbraith (October 15, 1908 - April 29, 2006), also known as Ken Galbraith, was a Canadian-born economist, public official, and diplomat, and a leading proponent of 20th-century American liberalism. His books on economic topics were bestsellers from the 1950s through the 2000s, during which time Galbraith fulfilled the role of public intellectual. As an economist, he leaned toward post-Keynesian economics from an institutionalist perspective. Galbraith was a long-time Harvard faculty member and stayed with Harvard University for half a century as a professor of economics. Context: In February 1946, Galbraith took a leave of absence from his magazine work for a senior position in the State Department as director of the Office of Economic Security Policy where he was nominally in charge of economic affairs regarding Germany, Japan, Austria, and South Korea. He was distrusted by the senior diplomats so he was relegated to routine work with few opportunities to make policy. Galbraith favored detente with the Soviet Union, along with Secretary of State James F. Byrnes and General Lucius D. Clay, a military governor of the US Zone in Germany from 1947 to 1949, but they were out of step with the containment policy then being developed by George Kennan and favored by the majority of the US major policymakers. After a disconcerting half-year, Galbraith resigned in September 1946 and went back to his magazine writing on economics issues. Later, he immortalized his frustration with \\"the ways of Foggy Bottom\\" in a satirical novel, The Triumph (1968). The postwar period also was memorable for Galbraith because of his work, along with Eleanor Roosevelt and Hubert Humphrey, to establish a progressive policy organization Americans for Democratic Action (ADA) in support of the cause of economic and social justice in 1947. During his time as an adviser to President John F. Kennedy, Galbraith was appointed United States Ambassador to India from 1961 to 1963. His rapport with President Kennedy was such that he regularly bypassed the State Department and sent his diplomatic cables directly to the president. In India, he became a confidant of Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and extensively advised the Indian government on economic matters. In 1966, when he was no longer ambassador, he told the United States Senate that one of the main causes of the 1965 Kashmir war was American military aid to Pakistan. While in India, he helped establish one of the first computer science departments, at the Indian Institute of Technology in Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh. Even after leaving office, Galbraith remained a friend and supporter of India. Because of his recommendation, First Lady of the United States Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy undertook her 1962 diplomatic missions in India and Pakistan. In autumn 1972 Galbraith was an adviser and assistant to Nixon's rival candidate George McGovern in the election campaign for the American presidency. During this time (September 1972) he travelled in to China in his role as president of the American Economic Association (AEA) at the invitation of Mao Zedong's communist government with the economists Leontief and Tobin and in 1973 published an account of his experiences in A China Passage. Galbraith wrote that there was \\"no serious doubt that China is devising a highly effective economic system,\\" \\"[d]issidents are brought firmly into line in China, but, one suspects, with great politeness,\\" \\"Greater Shanghai ... has a better medical service than New York,\\" and considered it not implausible that Chinese industrial and agricultural output was expanding annually at a rate of 10 to 11%. Question: Did he meet anyone famous? Answer:","completion":"Yes, John Kenneth Galbraith met several famous individuals throughout his career. Some of the notable people he met and interacted with include President John F. Kennedy, Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru of India, Eleanor Roosevelt, Hubert Humphrey, General Lucius D. Clay, Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy, and Mao Zedong's communist government representatives in China. Due to his prominent role in economics, policy, and diplomacy, Galbraith had the opportunity to meet and engage with influential figures of his time."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Every day he runs up and down a hill near his house until he is out of breath, then walks around his house until his breathing rate returns to normal. Will breathing rate increase or decrease when the body requires more energy to preform a task such as running? Hint: There must be more to this story than just gas exchange with the environment. To begin to appreciate the role of oxygen inside your body, think about when your breathing rate increases: climbing a steep slope, running a race, or skating a shift in a hockey game. Respiration rate correlates with energy use, and that correlation reflects the link between oxygen and energy metabolism. For this reason, the chemical process inside your cells that consume oxygen to produce usable energy is known as cellular respiration . During this process, energy is converted from glucose , in the presence of oxygen, into numerous ATP molecules. The glucose, of course, comes from the food you eat. In biological terms, you do not eat because you are hungry, you eat to get energy. Other heterotrophic organisms also acquire glucose from other organisms, whereas autotrophic organisms make their own glucose, mostly through photosynthesis. Answer:","completion":"Breathing rate will increase when the body requires more energy to perform a task such as running. This is because the body needs more oxygen to support the increased energy demand, which is provided through the process of cellular respiration. As a result, the faster breathing rate helps supply more oxygen to the cells, allowing them to produce more ATP molecules from glucose to meet the energy requirements for the task."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Because of the power of shots, the goaltender wears special equipment designed to protect the body from direct impact. The goalie is one of the most valuable players on the ice, as their performance can greatly change the outcome or score of the game. One-on-one situations, such as breakaways and shootouts, have the tendency to highlight a goaltender's pure skill, or lack thereof. Only one goaltender is allowed to be on the ice for each team at any given time. - Delaware is a state located in the Mid-Atlantic and/or Northeastern regions of the United States.

Question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the name of the place that U.S. Route 66, the BNSF Railway, and the Puerco River bisect? Petrified Forest National Park straddles the border between Apache County and Navajo County in northeastern Arizona. The park is about 30 miles (48 km) long from north to south, and its width varies from a maximum of about 12 miles (19 km) in the north to a minimum of about 1 mile (1.6 km) along a narrow corridor between the north and south, where the park widens again to about 4 to 5 miles (6 to 8 km).I-40, former U.S. Route 66, the BNSF Railway, and the Puerco River bisect the park generally east–west along a similar route. Adamana, a ghost town, is about 1 mile (1.6 km) west of the park along the BNSF tracks. Holbrook, about 26 miles (42 km) west of park headquarters along I-40, is the nearest city. Bisecting the park north–south is Park Road, which runs between I-40 near park headquarters on the north and U.S. Route 180 on the south. Historic Highway 180, an earlier alignment of the modern route, crosses the southern edge of the park. Like Route 66, it has deteriorated and is closed. Many unpaved maintenance roads, closed to the public, intersect Park Road at various points.The fee area of the park covers about 230 square miles (600 km2). The Navajo Nation borders the park on the north and northeast. State-owned land, federal land controlled by the Bureau of Land Management, and private land, much of it used for cattle ranching, adjoin the other borders. The park’s elevation above sea level varies from a low of 5,340 feet (1,630 m) along the Puerco River to a high of 6,230 feet (1,900 m) at Pilot Rock; the average elevation is about 5,400 feet (1,600 m). The terrain varies from gentle hills and major petrified wood deposits in the south to eroded badlands in the north. Most of the park's intermittent streams—including Lithodendron Wash, Dead Wash, Ninemile Wash, and Dry Wash—empty into the Puerco River. In the southern part of the park, Cottonwood Wash and Jim Camp Wash flow into the Little Colorado River.

(CNN) -- Former England and Mexico coach Sven-Goran Eriksson has been appointed as coach of the Ivory Coast national team for the World Cup finals in South Africa. Eriksson led England to the quarterfinals of both the 2002 and 2006 World Cup finals but had a less successful spell with Mexico, and was sacked from that post in April last year. The Swede was recently director of football at lower league English side Notts County, but left that position when the club ran into financial difficulties. The appointment of Eriksson was announced live on national television on Sunday evening by Souleymane Alex Bamba, a member of Ivory Coast's Football Federation. \\"The OPTIONS: - CNN has been, among others, coach of England and Mexico. - England has been, among others, coach of England and Mexico. - English has been, among others, coach of England and Mexico. - Eriksson has been, among others, coach of England and Mexico. - Football Federation has been, among others, coach of England and Mexico. - Former England has been, among others, coach of England and Mexico. - Ivory Coast has been, among others, coach of England and Mexico. - Mexico has been, among others, coach of England and Mexico. - Notts County has been, among others, coach of England and Mexico. - Souleymane Alex Bamba has been, among others, coach of England and Mexico. - South Africa has been, among others, coach of England and Mexico. - Sven-Goran Eriksson has been, among others, coach of England and Mexico. - Swede has been, among others, coach of England and Mexico. - Swede Eriksson has been, among others, coach of England and Mexico. - World Cup has been, among others, coach of England and Mexico.","completion":"\\"The appointment of Eriksson marks yet another milestone in his already decorated career, as he has been, among others, coach of England and Mexico. The Ivory Coast Football Federation is hopeful that Eriksson's experience and tactical acumen will help the national team make a deep run in the World Cup finals in South Africa. The Elephants, as the team is fondly known, are no strangers to the global stage as they boast an impressive array of talent, including stars such as Didier Drogba and Yaya Toure. With Eriksson at the helm, expectations are high for the Ivory Coast to make history and potentially bring home their first World Cup trophy. Eriksson's first order of business will be to assess the current squad and make any necessary adjustments before the tournament begins. He will also need to work closely with his coaching staff to devise a game plan that fully utilizes the team's strengths while mitigating any potential weaknesses. The Ivory Coast will be facing stiff competition in the group stage, but Eriksson's experience in previous World Cups should serve as a valuable asset in navigating this difficult path. However, Eriksson's appointment has not been without controversy, as critics have pointed to his mixed track record. His tenure with Mexico, which ended in a dismissal after a series of lackluster results, has led some to question if the Swede can still deliver on the world stage. Moreover, his previous involvement in Notts County's financial difficulties has cast a shadow over his managerial prowess. Nevertheless, the Ivory Coast Football Federation and the players remain optimistic about their chances under Eriksson's guidance. Souleymane Alex Bamba, of the Ivory Coast Football Federation, noted during the announcement that Eriksson's global experience and extensive knowledge of the sport make him an ideal candidate to maximize the team's potential in the World Cup. Fans and supporters are also rallying behind their team, eager to see them rise to the occasion and etch their names in football history. As preparations continue and the excitement around the tournament mounts, all eyes will be on Sven-Goran Eriksson and the Ivory Coast national team as they embark on their journey in South Africa. With a combination of experience, talent, and grit, the Elephants are determined to prove that they are a force to be reckoned with on the world stage.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. To live a happy, healthy, balanced life, you must learn to focus your energy on well-being. Self-care on all levels should be an integral part of your lifestyle. There is an abundance of information available about the benefits of eating well and exercising regularly to sustain a healthy mind and body. In fact, I write about both regularly. But today I want to move in a little different direction. In addition to those two very basic and critical activities, there are a number of other things you can to improve your mental health and overall well-being. By incorporating them into your daily life, you will be better able to manage most challenges – including struggles with self-doubt, anxiety, and mild depression. Practices that Focus Your Energy on Well-being Accept Your Feelings Stuffing or ignoring your emotions is more damaging than it is helpful. Everyone has emotions. They are a natural part of being human. Bottling them up may seem like a good solution in the moment, but when you do it all the time, you are potentially creating a time bomb that will eventually explode. Unfortunately, you are hurting yourself as you hold them in and you run the risk of hurting those you love when the eruption finally occurs. Rather than acknowledging what you are feeling and allowing yourself to experience emotions, you may medicate, rationalize, blame, bury, deny, smother, drink, or stuff them (pretend they don’t exist). Emotions have become the enemy and many people will do anything to avoid them – especially the big three: fear, anger and sadness. It takes a lot of mental, physical and emotional energy to avoiding your feelings and creates high levels of stress and anxiety. Don’t stuff your emotions! Let yourself laugh, cry, scream, yell, or pound something (preferably a pillow, grass, sand – not the wall or someone else). Do whatever you need to do, probably in private is the best choice. But, if emotions erupt in public, excuse yourself and let it rip. This is nature’s way of releasing stress. Don’t beat yourself... According to the above context, answer the following question. What will be the result of people not hiding their emotions probably? Answer:","completion":"The result of people not hiding their emotions will likely be a healthier expression and release of various emotions, leading to improved mental health and overall well-being. By acknowledging and allowing themselves to experience emotions, individuals can prevent the buildup of stress and anxiety that comes from avoiding or suppressing feelings. In turn, this prevents potential emotional eruptions that may cause harm to oneself or others. By expressing emotions in appropriate ways, people can effectively manage challenges, such as self-doubt, anxiety, and mild depression, leading to a happier, healthier, and more balanced life."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

A:","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis you mentioned involves the lung not being able to produce (I assume you meant not able to function properly) and the liver having to work softer (I assume you meant that the liver has to compensate for the lung's inability to function correctly). If the lung is not able to function properly, it will affect the overall oxygen supply and the removal of carbon dioxide from the body, which can negatively impact various body functions and organs, including the liver. The liver requires oxygen to efficiently perform its functions, including removing toxins from the blood, processing and storing nutrients, and producing bile. The perturbation might indirectly affect the liver's ability to carry out its processes. As a result, the liver may have to work harder to maintain its functions in a reduced-oxygen environment, and it might not be as efficient in processing nutrients and removing toxins. This scenario can lead to a potential buildup of waste materials and decreased nutrient absorption, ultimately affecting the overall health of the body.

Q: One student started packing up at the beginning of a lab exercise. I asked him where he was going. He said “I’m going to fail this class anyway, so I have other things to do.” It was true that he wasn’t doing well, and we had addressed this previously, but his attitude was completely defeatist. He had given up. So, there, in the middle of class, before he could get away, I said “Well, yeah. You will certainly fail if you don’t even try. I thought you were graduating at the end of this semester.” “I’m supposed to, but I won’t, because I’m going to fail physics. All I need is a D.” (He was right; his major didn’t require knowing any physics but they put it in the curriculum as a kind of gatekeeper course. Most students took physics much earlier in their studies than he did.) “If you have already decided to fail, I can’t stop you; you’re an adult. But you can make an appointment with me anytime. You already know that. You can email me. It’s my job to help you understand, but you have to come to me. You are an adult. It would be very inappropriate of me to follow you around, inviting you to office hours. And you must do the homework and the labs.” He stayed for the lab. I notified his counselor about what was going on, and she called him in and said the same things that I said.

The busiest woman in Labrador during one bitter cold Christmas not very long ago, was an Australian nurse named Kate Austen. But Nurse Austen was not too busy to write with a long, friendly letter for every gift of food or clothing received for poor villagers in the north of Australian. Among the gifts was a box of knittings for children, knitted and sent by a woman in Toronto. Nurse Austen, was busy, and not feeling too well that winter. She could have written just ordinary routine notes of acknowledgement. But that was not her way. She sat down and wrote the woman in Toronto a real letter telling all about the village, and the names of the children who were wearing the knitted gloves and caps, and what they said when they got them, and how they looked when they wore them. She wanted the woman who had knitted and sent all those lovely knittings \\"to see how much happiness and warmth she had created.\\" Not long after, she received the following answer from Canada.

Photos: The Amanda Knox appeal \\"We knew there was no way she could have done this,\\" he said. \\"She was sweet. She never did anything to harm anybody else. She was not conniving. She was not mean-spirited.\\" His voice breaking, he pulled off his glasses and wiped back tears. Exhausted but jubilant, about a dozen of nearly 30 supporters who had filled a suite at the tony Olympic Fairmont Hotel overnight leaped to their feet as the verdict was reported on a wide-screen television and began hugging one another. A few huddled together for a quick prayer. \\"It was remembering Meredith,\\" Margaret Ralph, an old friend of Knox's mother, said of victim Meredith Kercher, who was found stabbed to death in the apartment she shared with Knox in Italy in 2007. \\"Meredith lost her life.

October 3, 2011 at 3:55 AM Posted by Jonathan Martin Sept. 27 – Defense lawyer says Knox is less of a “femme fatale” and more like Jessica Rabbit – just drawn that way. Sept. 24 – Prosecutors ask court to increase Knox and Sollecito’s sentences to life in prison. Sept. 7 – Judge Claudio Pratillo Hellman rejects a prosecution request for new DNA testing. Prosecution requests to introduce newly found records about the DNA tests, and to hear a new witness are also dismissed. The hearing is adjourned until September 23. Dec. 4 —The eight-member jury finds Knox and Sollecito guilty, sentencing them to 26 and 25 years, respectively. Oct. 28, 2008 — Judge Paolo Micheli convicts Guede of murder and sexual assault, and sentences him to 30 years. Guede appeals. Micheli also orders Knox and Sollecito to stand trial on charges of murder and sexual assault. Nov. 20 — A fourth suspect, an Italian citizen originally from the Ivory Coast, Rudy Guede, 21, is apprehended in Germany. Meanwhile, Lumumba is released from custody due to a lack of evidence. Nov. 9 — An Italian court rules that Knox, Sollecito and Lumumba can remain in jail for up to one year during the investigation. Nov. 6 — Knox, her Italian boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito, 23, and nightclub owner Patrick Diya Lumumba, 44, are arrested by Italian police. All three say they are innocent. Nov. 1, 2007 — 21-year-old British student Meredith Kercher is found dead in the bedroom of the apartment in Perugia, Italy, that she shared with 20-year-old University of Washington student Amanda Knox. The cause of death is a stab wound to the neck. Police allege that Kercher was killed while fending off a sexual assault. UPDATE 1:35 p.m. Margaret Ralph, the parent of Knox's former Seattle Prep schoolmate and soccer teammate, said Knox will likely need time to rehabilitate. \\"Imagine being behind cement walls and bars for four years, and knowing you're innocent,\\" said Ralph. \\"I'm sure she's wounded, but she has all this support from her family, her friends, her community. And she's going to have to find a way to deal with the people who still think she's guilty.\\" UPDATE 1:26 p.m. Pamela Van Swearingen, a Seattle attorney, helped research Knox's options to appeal to the European Union human rights court. \\"This is wonderful, righting a big wrong,\\" she said. Since the prosecution can still appeal, Van Swearingen said Knox's family should expedite her exit. \\"I hope they will get Amanda Knox out of Italy very quickly,\\" she said. Knox was fined more than 22,000 Euros on the slander charge, but Van Swearingen said raising that should not be a problem now. \\"I think people will be very helpful with the fundraising,\\" she said. UPDATE 1:23 p.m. Joe Starr said he hopes to get a text message soon from Chris Mellas, his best friend and the father-in-law of Knox, saying they were on their way to the airport. Unlike the verdict in the 2009 trial, the Knox family did not buy a ticket in advance for Knox, Starr said. And contrary to media reports in London, no one has booked a privated jet to fly Knox home, he said. Knox's passport expired while she was in prison for four years, according to media reports. But Starr said he expected the state department will help. \\"Once she gets to customs, I don't think anyone will argue who she is,\\" said Starr. UPDATE 1:00 p.m. Tom Wright, surrounded by dozens of journalists, expressed sympathy to Kercher's family, saying this is a \\"solemn occasion.\\" He then congratulated Raffaele Sollecito, and Knox's family. \\"To Amanda herself, we say, way to go kid. We will welcome you with open arms and open hearts.\\" Mark Waterbury, a forensic scientist who aided the Friends of Amanda, said the verdict represented a compromise. \\"We knew it is a split the difference idea,\\" he said. \\"This is pure face-saving.\\" Knox was convicted of slandering her former boss, Patrick Lumumba, but acquitted of the murder charge. He said the campaign to prove Knox's innocence was the work \\" of four years and thousands of people. We did it.\\" UPDATE 12:50 p.m. Amanda Knox acquitted in the 2007 murder of her British roommate Meredith Kercher. In the room at the Fairmont, there were cries of \\"Yes\\" and hugs everywhere, as the verdict was read. Before the translation of the verdict was heard, Tom Wright, one of Knox's staunches supporters, sat stunned. \\"Everybody is hugging (in court), so that looks good\\" UPDATE 12:05 p.m. With a verdict rendered and Knox and Sollecito on their way from prison to hear it, one question arising at the Friends of Amanda gathering in Seattle is whether the verdict will tamp down the blog wars that have waged over the case. Each side - the \\"innocentisti\\" (innocents) and \\"colpevolisti\\" (guilties) - have taken their shots. Knox's step-father, Chris Mellas, has done battle on comment threads, and Italian police at one point arrested an innocentisti blogger in Perugia. Peggy Ganong, a Seattle translator who helps run a \\"colpevolisti\\" web forum, complained to Seattle Police about alleged online stalking via comment threads on one website. The investigation is now closed. On the innocentisi side, Karen Pruett, who runs a Facebook page on Knox, said she's called the FBI three times because photos of Amanda Knox's school-aged step-sisters appeared on a colpevolisti site. Most of the links to the photos disappeared, but Pruett wonders why the photos needed to be posted at all. \\"It tells me they (the colpevolisti) are obsessed with Amanda, and not all that interested in the case itself,\\" said Pruett, a hairdresser on Vashon Island. \\"There is just so much obsession with Amanda's family and Raffaele's family.\\" UPDATE 11:10 a.m.The court in Perugia hearing the appeal says the verdict is now expected at around 12:30 p.m. PDT. UPDATE 9:15a.m.If Knox is not acquitted on appeal, she can appeal to Italy's highest court, which is similar to the U.S. Supreme Court. The Italian high court looks at procedures and issues previously argued in the lower courts to come to a decision. The prosecution can also appeal to the high court if Knox is acquitted, according to several news agencies. UPDATE 7:50 a.m. About a dozen supporters are hunkered down at a suite in the downtown Seattle Fairmont Olympic hotel, watching the news conference held by Meredith Kercher's family. One of the questions lurking in the background here involves the slander charges against Knox and her parents. Knox was convicted of criminal slander for falsely accusing her former boss, Patrick Lumumba, fined 80,000 Euros and sentenced to a year in prison. A second slander case against Knox, for accusing police detectives of hitting her during an interrogation, is on hold. Her appeal includes the slander charge against Lumumba. Mike Heavey, a Knox suporter and King County Superior court judge, said the jurors could vacate the conviction and the fine as part of today's decision. Knox was also fined and ordered to pay 4 million Euros to the Kercher family as part of her murder conviction; that fine is also in play with the verdict. Among the theories being floated here is that Knox could be acquitted of the murder conviction but having her slander charge upheld, and released on time served. Two other slander charges, against both Knox and her parents, involving their allegation that Italian police hit her during an interrogation, are on hold, pending this appeal. \\"Hopefully those wouldn't go forward if this criminal case is dismissed,\\" said Anne Bremner, a spokeswoman for Friends of Amanda. Speaking of defamation, the Knox family has spoken with a Seattle attorney, Mark Walters about potentially suing over a Lifetime movie based on the case. Walters, who is at the Fairmont Olympic suite are gathered, declined to talk about any conversations with the Knox family. UPDATE: Both defendants gave emotional closing statements. A verdict is not expected until around 11 a.m. local time. We'll be updating throughout the morning. ORIGINAL POST: A homegrown group of Amanda Knox's most dedicated defenders are planning a private gathering at a Seattle hotel very early Monday, hoping for a celebration but bracing for something else. A verdict in the Italian appeals trial of Knox, the former University of Washington student convicted in the bloody and sensational 2007 murder of her roommate, Meredith Kercher, is expected as early as 3 a.m. Seattle time. Knox is expected to speak about three hours earlier to the Italian court and jurors. The early-morning gathering is to be held by Friends of Amanda, an ad hoc group of family friends, attorneys, forensic scientists and retired law enforcement. The group formed to battle inflammatory descriptions of Knox, but evolved into an innocence campaign seeking to debunk key forensic evidence. \\"I think it's had a hugely positive effect,\\" said Mark Waterbury, a Redmond forensic scientist who did not know Knox before the case, but wrote a book debunking the DNA evidence presented against her. A cottage industry has grown up around the case, with at least 10 books, a television movie and dozens of websites dedicated to parsing evidence as well as Knox's psyche. Defenders such as Waterbury have been ridiculed and celebrated. Opinions of the case are hot enough that organizers of Monday's event asked that its location not be disclosed, to prevent anti-Knox protesters from crashing. Most of Knox's large family -- including her parents, sister and two half-sisters, aunts and several classmates -- were in Perugia on Monday, anticipating a celebration. The Italian court is hearing a \\"de novo\\" appeal, allowing it to re-examine all the evidence. The six jurors and two presiding judges could vacate the conviction, or they could reaffirm the 2009 trial verdict and give Knox a life sentence, as prosecutors have asked. Anne Bremner, a Seattle attorney and spokeswoman for Friends of Amanda, said Knox, now 24, could potentially be held in prison or required to stay in Italy even if her conviction is vacated, should prosecutors appeal. \\"Given the history of this case, her attorneys have prepped for any eventuality,\\" Bremner said. It also is unlikely that Knox would return to Seattle immediately if she is released, to give her time relax and to avoid the sensational international media frenzy in an undisclosed location. Knox has repeatedly said she hopes to return home, and her family has said she is likely to write a book. In recent weeks, supporters have been asking local business leaders to consider hiring Knox if she returns. \\"I think Seattle is about the best place for a person like Amanda Knox,\\" said Bremner. \\"It is not the type of town that hassles people who are famous,\\" she said, citing Bill Gates and Mary Kay LeTourneau, Bremner's former client. Knox has done correspondence course work at the University of Washington while in prison, but has not graduated, according to the UW. Knox grew up in West Seattle with a younger sister. Her parents, Curt and Edda Knox, divorced while she was a toddler. Her parents each remarried, and retained homes within blocks of each other. Knox, a Seattle Prep graduate, was a dean's list student studying Romance languages when she enrolled in the University for Foreigners in Perugia in October 2007. She had saved 7,000 for her junior year abroad, working at a University District coffee shop and an art gallery and Seattle Mariners games. She rented a room in a home with three other girls, including Kercher, just outside of Perugia. Just weeks before the murder, she met Raffaele Sollecito, an Italian computer science student, at a classical music recital. \\"I'm in love,\\" she wrote in a message to friends back in Seattle. On Nov. 4, 2007, days after Kercher's body was found, Knox wrote a letter to her mother, Edda Mellas, saying she wanted to stay in Perugia. \\"I am not afraid of Italy. I am not afraid of anything in particular. I am afraid because I am confused,\\" Knox wrote. She was arrested the next day, and in a statement that was later thrown out by an Italian court, implicated Patrick Lumumba, her boss at a bar where she had worked. She wrote a new statement on Nov. 6, 2007, saying she'd been at home with Sollecito the night of the murder. She has steadfastly professed her innocence ever since. She was convicted in 2009 and sentenced to 26 years in prison. Knox's family remained silent for months after the arrest on the advice of Italian lawyers, declined interview requests from The Seattle Times and other outlets, even as British and Italian tabloids inaccurately sensationalized her as hard partying and sexually voracious. In response to that coverage and leaks from Italian law enforcement, which also proved inaccurate, the parents of several of Knox's classmates at Seattle Prep formed Friends of Amanda to defend her. Bremner, who came on later, described the effort as \\"turning a supertanker of bad information coming from leaks out of a closed proceeding.\\" Their website has now received nearly 800,000 hits, and the group has raised at least 80,000 to defray her legal bills, well over 1 million. King County Superior Court Judge Mike Heavey, whose daughter attended Seattle Prep with Knox, wrote a letter on court letterhead to the presiding Italian judge, questioning the conduct of Knox's prosecutor and police and asking the trial to be moved out of Perugia. The Washington State Judicial Conduct Commission admonished him in 2010 for improperly influencing a pending case . using the prestige of his judicial office to advance the private interests of another (Knox). Others, however, agreed. An American writer, Douglas Preston, assisted Knox's defenders by telling of his alleged mistreatment by the lead prosecutor on the Knox case. A criminal investigator, several forensic experts and a retired FBI agent also publicly rebutted evidence they said had been manipulated or wrongly analyzed by Italian law enforcement. Their key forensic rebuttal involved so-called \\"low copy DNA\\" samples taken from the alleged murder weapon, a kitchen knife seized at Sollecito's apartment allegedly containing both Knox's and Kercher's DNA. Waterbury, the Redmond biotech entrepreneur, labeled the DNA testing as \\"pretend science.\\" During Knox's appeal this summer and fall, an independent review of the knife DNA essentially agreed with Knox's defenders, finding that the sample was too low to be admitted as evidence. But prosecutors pushed back on that finding during the appeal, and emphasized other evidence, including alleged telltales of a staged break-in at the murder scene. Knox's defenders, in Seattle and online, have deployed strong rhetoric in her defense. At a Seattle University symposium in April, Steve Moore, a retired FBI agent who once oversaw Al Queda investigations, compared Knox's prosecution to a \\"lynching.\\" \\"This will be an academy class in most forensic academies, I hope,\\" said Moore. \\"This is the worst case I have ever seen in a western country.\\" ||||| What is a summary?","completion":"A summary is a brief statement or account of the main points of something.

Let's break down and analyze each component of this data for a more comprehensive understanding: 1. (19255) 1994 VK8: This is an alphanumeric code identifying a particular celestial object: - \\"19255\\": This is the assigned number or catalog designation of the celestial body, revealing its discovery sequence. - \\"1994\\": This signifies the year of discovery, indicating that the object was first observed or recorded in 1994. - \\"VK8\\": These characters form a provisional designation that consists of two letters and a number, providing additional details about the time of discovery and the specific order of discovery. In this code, \\"V\\" represents the half-month (period of 15 days) in which the object was discovered, \\"K\\" is a letter indicating the sequence of discovery within that half-month, and \\"8\\" denotes the numeric order of discoveries made in that sequence. 2. Periapsis: The term \\"periapsis\\" is a general term used in celestial mechanics to describe the point at which an orbiting object is closest to the celestial body it is orbiting. For objects orbiting Earth or another planet, the specific term \\"perigee\\" or \\"perihelion\\" is used, respectively.

While it is true that WLAE-TV played a role in helping to promote Imagination Movers, and Beth Courtney is indeed the President & Chief Executive Officer at Louisiana Public Broadcasting, neither of these individuals is directly related to the girl character in the show. Imagination Movers is a children's television program that originally aired on Disney Junior. The show focuses on the adventures of four friends - Rich, Scott, Dave, and Smitty - who solve problems through creativity, teamwork, and music. The primary female character in the show is Nina, played by actress Wendy Calio. Wendy Calio joined the Imagination Movers cast in 2008 as their neighbor and friend, Nina. She is a recurring character throughout the series and often collaborates with the Movers to resolve various challenges and create innovative solutions. In addition to her role on Imagination Movers, Calio has also appeared in various other shows and projects within the entertainment industry.

Here is a news article: LONDON (AP) — The FBI has put a spoke in the wheel of a major Russian digital disruption operation potentially aimed at causing havoc in Ukraine, evidence pieced together from researchers, Ukrainian officials and U.S. court documents indicates. On Wednesday, network technology company Cisco Systems and antivirus company Symantec warnedthat a half-million internet-connected routers had been compromised in a possible effort to lay the groundwork for a cyber-sabotage operation against targets in Ukraine. Court documents simultaneously unsealed in Pittsburgh show the FBI has seized a key website communicating with the massive army of hijacked devices, disrupting what could have been — and might still be — an ambitious cyberattack by the Russian government-aligned hacking group widely known as Fancy Bear. \\"I hope it catches the actors off guard and leads to the downfall of their network,\\" said Craig Williams, the director of outreach for Talos, the digital threat intelligence unit of Cisco that cooperated with the bureau. But he warned that the hackers could still regain control of the infected routers if they possessed their addresses and the right resources to re-establish command and control. FBI Assistant Director Scott Smith said the agency \\"has taken a critical step in minimizing the impact of the malware attack. While this is an important first step, the FBI's work is not done.\\" Much about the hackers' motives remains open to conjecture. Cisco said the malicious software, which it and Symantec both dubbed VPNFilter after a folder it creates, was sitting on more than 500,000 routers in 54 countries but mostly in Ukraine, and had the capacity to render them unusable — a massively disruptive move if carried out at such a scale. \\"It could be a significant threat to users around the world,\\" said Williams. The U.S. Justice Department said the malware \\"could be used for a variety of malicious purposes, including intelligence gathering, theft of valuable information, destructive or disruptive attacks, and the misattribution of such activities.\\" Ukraine's cyberpolice said in a statement that it was possible the hackers planned to strike during \\"large-scale events,\\" an apparent reference either to the upcoming Champions League game between Real Madrid and Liverpool in the capital, Kiev, on Saturday or to Ukraine's upcoming Constitution Day celebrations. Ukraine has been locked in a years-long struggle with Russia-backed separatists in the country's east and has repeatedly been hit by cyberattacks of escalating severity. Last year witnessed the eruption of the NotPetya worm, which crippled critical systems, including hospitals , across the country and dealt hundreds of millions of dollars in collateral damage around the globe. Ukraine, the United States and Britain have blamed the attack on Moscow — a charge the Kremlin has denied. Cisco and Symantec both steered clear of attributing the VPNFilter malware to any particular actor, but an FBI affidavit explicitly attributed it to Fancy Bear, the same group that hacked into the Democratic National Committee in 2016 and has been linked to a long series of digital intrusions stretching back more than a decade. The U.S. intelligence community assesses that Fancy Bear acts on behalf of Russia's military intelligence service. An FBI affidavit — whose existence was first reported by The Daily Beast — said the hackers used lines of code hidden in the metadata of online photo albums to communicate with their network of seeded routers. If the photo albums disappeared, the hackers turned to a fallback website — the same site whose seizure the FBI ordered Tuesday. An email sent to the website's registered owner was returned as undeliverable. When asked why the FBI specifically named Fancy Bear where Cisco did not, Williams noted that while attribution was extremely tricky based on malware analysis alone, \\"if you combine that knowledge with a traditional intelligence apparatus interesting things can come to light.\\" In any case, he said, \\"we have a high degree of confidence that the actor behind this is acting against the Ukraine's best interest.\\" Cisco said in a research note that the malware affected devices geared for small and home offices from manufacturers including Netgear, TP-Link and Linksys and had the potential to disable \\"internet access for hundreds of thousands of victims worldwide or in a focused region.\\" The malware's principal capabilities, the company said, included stealthy intelligence-collecting, monitoring industrial-control software and, if triggered, \\"bricking\\" or disabling routers. It also persists on the infected routers after they are rebooted. ___ Bajak reported from Boston. Chad Day in Washington contributed to this report. ___ Court documents: https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4482618-VPNFilter-FBI-affidavit.html Talos' blog post: https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2018/05/VPNFilter.html ||||| The FBI is advising users of consumer-grade routers and network-attached storage devices to reboot them as soon as possible to counter Russian-engineered malware that has infected hundreds of thousands devices. Researchers from Cisco’s Talos security team first disclosed the existence of the malware on Wednesday. The detailed report said the malware infected more than 500,000 devices made by Linksys, Mikrotik, Netgear, QNAP, and TP-Link. Known as VPNFilter, the malware allowed attackers to collect communications, launch attacks on others, and permanently destroy the devices with a single command. The report said the malware was developed by hackers working for an advanced nation, possibly Russia, and advised users of affected router models to perform a factory reset, or at a minimum to reboot. Limited persistence Later in the day, The Daily Beast reported that VPNFilter was indeed developed by a Russian hacking group , one known by a variety of names, including Sofacy, Fancy Bear, APT 28, and Pawn Storm. The Daily Beast also said the FBI had seized an Internet domain VPNFilter used as a backup means to deliver later stages of the malware to devices that were already infected with the initial stage 1. The seizure meant that the primary and secondary means to deliver stages 2 and 3 had been dismantled, leaving only a third fallback, which relied on attackers sending special packets to each infected device. The redundant mechanisms for delivering the later stages address a fundamental shortcoming in VPNFilter—stages 2 and 3 can’t survive a reboot, meaning they are wiped clean as soon as a device is restarted. Instead, only stage 1 remains. Presumably, once an infected device reboots, stage 1 will cause it to reach out to the recently seized ToKnowAll.com address. The FBI’s advice to reboot small office and home office routers and NAS devices capitalizes on this limitation. In a statement published Friday, FBI officials suggested that users of all consumer-grade routers, not just those known to be vulnerable to VPNFilter, protect themselves. The officials wrote: The FBI recommends any owner of small office and home office routers reboot the devices to temporarily disrupt the malware and aid the potential identification of infected devices. Owners are advised to consider disabling remote management settings on devices and secure with strong passwords and encryption when enabled. Network devices should be upgraded to the latest available versions of firmware. In a statement also published Friday, Justice Department officials wrote: Owners of SOHO and NAS devices that may be infected should reboot their devices as soon as possible, temporarily eliminating the second stage malware and causing the first stage malware on their device to call out for instructions. Although devices will remain vulnerable to reinfection with the second stage malware while connected to the Internet, these efforts maximize opportunities to identify and remediate the infection worldwide in the time available before Sofacy actors learn of the vulnerability in their command-and-control infrastructure. The US Department of Homeland Security has also issued a statement advising that \\"all SOHO router owners power cycle (reboot) their devices to temporarily disrupt the malware.\\" As noted in the statements, rebooting serves the objectives of (1) temporarily preventing infected devices from running the stages that collect data and other advanced attacks and (2) helping FBI officials to track who was infected. Friday’s statement said the FBI is working with the non-profit Shadow Foundation to disseminate the IP addresses of infected devices to ISPs and foreign authorities to notify end users. Authorities and researchers still don’t know for certain how compromised devices are initially infected. They suspect the attackers exploited known vulnerabilities and default passwords that end users had yet to patch or change. That uncertainty is likely driving the advice in the FBI statement that all router and NAS users reboot, rather than only users of the 14 models known to be affected by VPNFilter, which are: Linksys E1200 Linksys E2500 Linksys WRVS4400N Mikrotik RouterOS for Cloud Core Routers: Versions 1016, 1036, and 1072 Netgear DGN2200 Netgear R6400 Netgear R7000 Netgear R8000 Netgear WNR1000 Netgear WNR2000 QNAP TS251 QNAP TS439 Pro Other QNAP NAS devices running QTS software TP-Link R600VPN The advice to reboot, update, change default passwords, and disable remote administration is sound and in most cases requires no more than 15 minutes. Of course, a more effective measure is to follow the advice Cisco gave Wednesday to users of affected devices and perform a factory reset, which will permanently remove all of the malware, including stage 1. This generally involves using a paper clip or thumb tack to hold down a button on the back of the device for 5 seconds. The reset will remove any configuration settings stored on the device, so users will have to restore those settings once the device initially reboots. (It's never a bad idea to disable UPnP when practical, but that protection appears to have no effect on VPNFilter.) There's no easy way to know if a router has been infected by VPNFilter. For more advanced users, Cisco provided detailed indicators of compromise in Wednesday’s report, along with firewall rules that can be used to protect devices. Ars has much more about VPNFilter here. ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"Oh, this is actually a pretty big and technical report! But don't worry, I'm here to help you understand it. Imagine your toy car runs on batteries, and somebody sneaky figured out a way to control your toy car to move any time they want, or even break it. This would be really annoying and scary, right? Now, replace your toy car with 'internet routers' - those little boxes that help us connect to the internet. Acccording to this article, a sneaky group from Russia known as 'Fancy Bear' have figured out a way to control and break lots and lots of these internet routers around the world, but specifically, and most worryingly, in Ukraine. That's like if someone could control or break not just your toy car, but all the toy cars in your city! The good guys in this story, the FBI (they're a bit like the police, but for the whole of the US), have worked with some smart tech companies and have managed to stop this sneaky group from being able to control these routers. However, they are warning that the sneaky group might figure out how to take control again. The very clever people at a couple of tech companies (Cisco and Symantec) have named the way the sneaky people were controlling the routers \\"VPNFilter\\", and have found that it's on more than 500,000 routers in 54 countries. Ukraine (which is kind of like the place where all our schools are located in this story) think that the sneaky people might try to cause trouble during some of their big celebrations, a bit like trying to stop all the toy cars during a big toy car racing event. This would be very disruptive and annoying for everyone. Finally, the FBI have given some good advice to people to 'reboot' (which is like turning something off and then back on again) their routers to stop this control and possibly break it down. They also advise people ensure their 'firmware' (the system that helps the router run properly) is up to date, like making sure your toy car has fresh batteries and is in good working condition. The article goes on to list out some routers (the toy cars) that might be affected by the VPNFilter problem. People who have these routers should do the reboot, make sure the firmware is up to date and change passwords for safety."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Information: - Ted Skjellum (born 4 March 1972), also known by the stage names Nocturno Culto, Nocturno or Kveldulv, is a Norwegian musician best known as the vocalist, lead guitarist, and partial bassist (shared with Fenriz) of the influential black metal band Darkthrone. He has been with the band since 1988. He is also the vocalist of the band Sarke. He currently works in Norway as a school teacher, and has a son and a daughter. He has also released a documentary film called \\"The Misanthrope\\" in which he deals with black metal music and life in Norway. - Death metal is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal music. It typically employs heavily distorted and low-tuned guitars, played with techniques such as palm muting and tremolo picking, deep growling vocals and screams, aggressive, powerful drumming featuring double kick or blast beat techniques, minor keys or atonality, abrupt tempo, key, and time signature changes and chromatic chord progressions. The lyrical themes of death metal may invoke slasher film-stylized violence, religion (sometimes Satanism), occultism, Lovecraftian horror, nature, mysticism, mythology, philosophy, science fiction, and politics, and they may describe extreme acts, including mutilation, dissection, torture, rape, cannibalism, and necrophilia. - Gylve Fenris Nagell (born 28 November 1971), better known as Fenriz, is a Norwegian musician and politician who is best known as being one half of the metal duo Darkthrone. Although primarily a drummer, he has also performed bass, guitar and vocals for Darkthrone and a number of other metal bands. Fenriz is known for his refusal to play live, his obsessiveness about music listening, supporting other underground bands and his lack of interest in the mainstream music business in general. Fenriz has had three solo projects: the folk metal project Isengard, the dark ambient project Neptune Towers and the doom metal project Red Planet. - Darkthrone is a Norwegian black metal band. It formed in 1986 as a death metal band under the name Black Death. In 1991, the band embraced a black metal style influenced by Bathory and Celtic Frost and became one of the leading bands in the Norwegian black metal scene. Their first three black metal albums\\"A Blaze in the Northern Sky\\", \\"Under a Funeral Moon\\" and \\"Transilvanian Hunger\\" (sometimes dubbed the \\"Unholy Trinity\\") are considered the peak of the band's career and to be among the most influential albums in the genre. For most of this time, Darkthrone has been a duo of Nocturno Culto and Fenriz, who have sought to remain outside the music mainstream. Since 2006, their work has strayed from the traditional black metal style and incorporated more elements of traditional heavy metal, speed metal and punk rock, being likened to Motörhead. - Heavy metal (or simply metal) is a genre of rock music that developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s, largely in the United Kingdom and the United States. With roots in blues rock and psychedelic/acid rock, the bands that created heavy metal developed a thick, massive sound, characterized by highly amplified distortion, extended guitar solos, emphatic beats, and overall loudness. Heavy metal lyrics and performance styles are sometimes associated with aggression and machismo. - Speed metal is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal music that originated in the late 1970s from new wave of British heavy metal (NWOBHM) roots. It is described by AllMusic as \\"extremely fast, abrasive, and technically demanding\\" music. - Punk rock (or simply \\"punk\\") is a rock music genre that developed in the early to mid 1970s in the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia. Rooted in 1960s garage rock and other forms of what is now known as \\"proto-punk\\" music, punk rock bands rejected perceived excesses of mainstream 1970s rock. Punk bands typically use short or fast-paced songs, with hard-edged melodies and singing styles, stripped-down instrumentation, and often political, anti-establishment lyrics. Punk embraces a DIY ethic; many bands self-produce recordings and distribute them through informal channels. - Black metal is an extreme subgenre and subculture of heavy metal music. Common traits include fast tempos, a shrieking vocal style, heavily distorted guitars played with tremolo picking, raw (lo-fi) recording, unconventional song structures, and an emphasis on atmosphere. Artists often appear in corpse paint and adopt pseudonyms. - Lovecraftian horror is a subgenre of horror fiction that emphasizes the cosmic horror of the unknown (and in some cases, unknowable) more than gore or other elements of shock, though these may still be present. It is named after American author H. P. Lovecraft (1890 1937). - A Blaze in the Northern Sky is the second studio album by Norwegian black metal band Darkthrone. It was released on 26 February 1992 by Peaceville Records. It contained the band's first black metal recordings, and is considered a classic within the genre. It was the first album of what fans dub the \\"Unholy Trinity\\", the other albums being \\"Under a Funeral Moon\\" and \\"Transilvanian Hunger\\". The last album to feature bassist Dag Nilsen. - Motörhead were an English rock band formed in June 1975 by bassist, singer, and songwriter Ian Fraser \\"Lemmy\\" Kilmister, who was the sole constant member. The band is often considered a precursor to, or one of the earliest members of, the new wave of British heavy metal, which re-energised heavy metal in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Though several guitarists and drummers played in Motörhead, most of their best-selling albums and singles feature the work of \\"Fast\\" Eddie Clarke on lead guitar and Phil \\"Philthy Animal\\" Taylor on drums. - Necrophilia, also called thanatophilia, is a sexual attraction or sexual act involving corpses. The attraction is classified as a paraphilia by the \\"Diagnostic and Statistical Manual\\" (DSM) of the American Psychiatric Association. The term was coined by the Belgian alienist Joseph Guislain, who first used it in a lecture in 1850. It derives from the Greek words \\"\\" (\\"nekros\\"; \\"dead\\") and \\"\\" (\\"philia\\"; \\"love\\"). - Peaceville Records is a British independent heavy metal record label. The label was founded by Paul \\"Hammy\\" Halmshaw (of the bands Instigators and Civilised Society) in Dewsbury, England in 1987, who was also a one-time drummer of Sore Throat. Originally a tape label releasing anarcho punk, the releases moved towards metal through crust punk and similar forms of metal-influenced English hardcore punk. Halmshaw started running the label full-time in 1988, although the original tape label incarnation was founded in 1981 as a vehicle for releasing Instigators demo cassettes. - Ivar Enger , also known as \`\` Zephyrous '' , is a guitarist who played for black metal band Darkthrone . He is credited as featuring on the band 's first three albums ; Soulside Journey , A Blaze in the Northern Sky and Under a Funeral Moon , as well as the Goatlord album ; the rehearsal tapes of what was originally intended to be their second album ( with later added vocals ) . He is said to have left due to delving into misanthropy , instead of generally leaving , as Darkthrone never had touring stress and he did n't leave prior because of the swift change from death metal to black metal , like other former member Dag Nielsen did . The band maintains that Zephyrous went into a forest and never returned . However , in a 2006 interview with the German website Voices From The Dark Side , Nocturno Culto claims he still has contact with Zephyrous and would like him to join the band as a guest on a few songs at some point . Very little information about Zephyrous is known , as Darkthrone have always maintained mystery about themselves , let alone past members . In two interviews in 2001 and 2002 with Nocturno Culto , he stated that Zephyrous left Darkthrone partly because he felt \`\` left out '' by N.Culto and Fenriz , who were very close at the time , and partly because he was an alcoholic and had a black out while driving his car . \`\` He woke up in the hospital with much strings attached to him '' . \`\` He left Darkthrone in much anger '' .

Additionally, the adjective \\"small\\" gives an impression that the customer is unsatisfied with the size of the lamb accessory, possibly expecting something larger or more detailed. Lastly, the customer disapproves of the doll's resemblance to the character Mary, implying that the product is not an accurate representation of the character it is intended to depict.

The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who warned that other composers were interested in adapting La Tosca? , can you please find it? The French playwright Victorien Sardou wrote more than 70 plays, almost all of them successful, and none of them performed today. In the early 1880s Sardou began a collaboration with actress Sarah Bernhardt, whom he provided with a series of historical melodramas. His third Bernhardt play, La Tosca, which premiered in Paris on 24 November 1887, and in which she starred throughout Europe, was an outstanding success, with more than 3,000 performances in France alone.Puccini had seen La Tosca at least twice, in Milan and Turin. On 7 May 1889 he wrote to his publisher, Giulio Ricordi, begging him to get Sardou's permission for the work to be made into an opera: \\"I see in this Tosca the opera I need, with no overblown proportions, no elaborate spectacle, nor will it call for the usual excessive amount of music.\\"Ricordi sent his agent in Paris, Emanuele Muzio, to negotiate with Sardou, who preferred that his play be adapted by a French composer. He complained about the reception La Tosca had received in Italy, particularly in Milan, and warned that other composers were interested in the piece. Nonetheless, Ricordi reached terms with Sardou and assigned the librettist Luigi Illica to write a scenario for an adaptation.In 1891, Illica advised Puccini against the project, most likely because he felt the play could not be successfully adapted to a musical form. When Sardou expressed his unease at entrusting his most successful work to a relatively new composer whose music he did not like, Puccini took offence. He withdrew from the agreement, which Ricordi then assigned to the composer Alberto Franchetti. Illica wrote a libretto for Franchetti, who was never at ease with the assignment. When Puccini once again became interested in Tosca, Ricordi was able to get Franchetti to surrender the rights so he could recommission Puccini. One story relates that Ricordi convinced Franchetti that the work was too violent to be successfully staged. A Franchetti family tradition holds that Franchetti gave the work back as a grand...

The visual system is processing what is seen on the page; the motor system controls your eye movements and the turn of the pages (or click of the mouse); the prefrontal cortex maintains attention. Even fundamental functions, like breathing and regulation of body temperature, are controlled by the nervous system. The nervous system is one of two systems that exert control over all the organ systems of the body; the other is the endocrine system. The nervous system’s control is much more specific and rapid than the hormonal system. It communicates signals through cells and the tiny gaps between them rather than through the circulatory system as in the endocrine system. It uses a combination of chemical and electrochemical signals, rather than purely chemical signals used by the endocrine system to cover long distances quickly. The nervous system acquires information from sensory organs, processes it and then may initiate a response either through motor function, leading to movement, or in a change in the organism’s physiological state. Nervous systems throughout the animal kingdom vary in structure and complexity. Some organisms, like sea sponges, lack a true nervous system. Others, like jellyfish, lack a true brain and instead have a system of separate but connected nerve cells (neurons) called a “nerve net. ” Flatworms have both a central nervous system (CNS), made up of a ganglion (clusters of connected neurons) and two nerve cords, and a peripheral nervous system (PNS) containing a system of nerves that extend throughout the body.

I had two, one for staff accountant and the other was as accounting manager for a holistic health clinic. The clinic job paid about 40% more and came with a “manager” title. I believed in myself and all that, but who offers someone just out of school with only 2 years of internship and no specialty in field manager level? That kept bugging me. Something just wasn’t right. Acting on instinct, I took the other job. Good thing! A few months later, I read that the owner of the clinic (an MD) and his two partners (his wife and the CFO) had all been indicted for numerous counts of fraud. They were cheating the state, they were cheating the church they were affiliated with, they were cheating Medicare and private insurance companies. The IRS was after them — it was supposed to be not-for-profit but it turns out they were living large. Not only that, but they hadn’t been sending in w/h tax for non-church member paid employees. Then there was the allegation that they were abusing mentally handicapped workers who were related to church members. The church itself tried to distance themselves, but three elders were also on the clinic’s Board of Directors. It was nasty and the entire management team ended up with at least some jail time. There was no way anyone who had any access to the records (medical or financial) could have claimed innocence. My job would have included filing false budget and financial statements with the Board, IRS and other agencies. I would have also probably known that they were withholding but not remitting tax from employee checks. Fact is, the poor kid who took the job got 2 years, so I found out.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Select from: a). No; b). Yes; Question: what are the rules of fencing? Would \\"Competitive Fencing is one of five sports which has been featured at every one of the modern Olympic Games , the other four being Athletics , Cycling , Swimming , and Gymnastics .\\" be a reasonable answer? Answer:","completion":"b). Yes. The statement \\"Competitive Fencing is one of the five sports which has been featured at every one of the modern Olympic Games, the other four being Athletics, Cycling, Swimming, and Gymnastics\\" is a reasonable answer for the question about the rules of fencing. However, this statement mainly focuses on the history and prominence of fencing as an Olympic sport. To provide a more detailed answer, here is a brief overview of the rules of fencing: 1. Types of weapons: Fencing is divided into three categories based on the weapon used: Foil, Épée, and Sabre. 2. Foil: Foil is a thrusting weapon with a flexible rectangular blade. In foil fencing, the target area is the torso, and points are scored by landing a touch on the opponent's target area with the tip of the weapon. 3. Épée: Épée is also a thrusting weapon, but it has a stiffer triangular blade. The entire body is considered the target area in épée fencing, and points are scored by landing a touch anywhere on the opponent's body with the tip of the weapon. 4. Sabre: Sabre is a cutting and thrusting weapon with a flat, curved blade. In sabre fencing, the target area includes the torso, arms, and head, excluding the hands. Points in sabre are scored by landing a touch on the opponent's target area with the edge of the weapon or the tip. 5. Right of way: This rule applies to foil and sabre fencing. It is used to determine which fencer scores a point if both fencers land a touch simultaneously. The fencer who initiated the attack has the right of way, and the other fencer must defend or perform a counter-attack to score. 6. Scoring system: A point is scored when one fencer touches their opponent's valid target area with their weapon. In foil and sabre, only the fencer with the right of way scores, while in épée, simultaneous touches result in points for both fencers. 7. Timing: Fencing bouts are timed and generally last for a total of three 3-minute periods with a 1-minute break between periods. The first fencer to reach 15 points, or the fencer with the highest score after the time has elapsed, wins the bout. 8. Referee: A referee oversees the bout and is responsible for determining the right of way, awarding points, and assessing penalties for rule violations. 9. Penalties: Fencers can receive penalties for various infractions, such as crossing the boundary of the fencing strip, causing the delay of the bout, or performing illegal actions. Penalties can range from warnings to loss of points or disqualification. In summary, the rules of fencing include the use of different weapons, a focus on strikes and tactics, the right of way rule, a scoring system, timed bouts, the role of a referee, and penalties for rule violations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You are given a new situation: Bess and Dee were two entomologists. they were studying ants. Dee liked to learn more about leaf cutter ants, while Bess learned all she could about all other ants. and a hint : Most ants are generalist predators, scavengers, and indirect herbivores, but a few have evolved specialised ways of obtaining nutrition. It is believed that many ant species that engage in indirect herbivory rely on specialized symbiosis with their gut microbes to upgrade the nutritional value of the food they collect and allow them to survive in nitrogen poor regions, such as rainforest canopies. Leafcutter ants (Atta and Acromyrmex) feed exclusively on a fungus that grows only within their colonies. They continually collect leaves which are taken to the colony, cut into tiny pieces and placed in fungal gardens. Ergates specialise in related tasks according to their sizes. The largest ants cut stalks, smaller workers chew the leaves and the smallest tend the fungus. Leafcutter ants are sensitive enough to recognise the reaction of the fungus to different plant material, apparently detecting chemical signals from the fungus. If a particular type of leaf is found to be toxic to the fungus, the colony will no longer collect it. The ants feed on structures produced by the fungi called gongylidia. Symbiotic bacteria on the exterior surface of the ants produce antibiotics that kill bacteria introduced into the nest that may harm the fungi. Please answer this question : Which person read less about indirect herbivory ants?","completion":"To answer the question about who read less about indirect herbivory ants, let's evaluate the information provided about Bess and Dee: 1. Bess learned all she could about all other ants (meaning, ants other than leafcutter ants as studied by Dee). 2. Dee liked to learn more about leafcutter ants. Now, let's consider the given hint: - Most ants are generalist predators, scavengers, and indirect herbivores. However, a few ants, such as leafcutter ants, have evolved specialized ways to obtain nutrition. From this information, we can conclude that Bess, who focused on all other ants, would likely have read about various types of ants, including those that engage in indirect herbivory. On the other hand, Dee focused primarily on leafcutter ants, which have a specialized way of obtaining nutrition through a symbiotic relationship with fungi. Therefore, Dee read less about indirect herbivory ants as compared to Bess, as Dee's focus was on the more specialized leafcutter ants."},{"prompt":"Generate a question that has the following answer: Pyriel's heart for the following movie plot: Danyael Rosales, a street preacher who thinks God doesn't care about anyone because of the death of his parents Valerie Rosales and the angel Danyael from the previous film.

It's like playing peekaboo with the street, and it helps keep us safe! Second, I found out that bees make honey, which is sweet and yummy, just like the candy you like! Bees work very hard in their bee home called a hive, and they take nectar from flowers to make the honey that we enjoy on our pancakes. Lastly, I discovered that saying \\"please\\" and \\"thank you\\" is very important. It's like giving someone a hug with our words. When we say \\"please\\" and \\"thank you\\", it shows people that we are being polite, and it makes them feel good. I hope you enjoyed hearing about the things I've learned!

However, it doesn't provide an explanation for the dog's wild nature or lack of obedience. d. punishment - This implies that the owner has never disciplined or attempted to correct the dog's wild behavior. This is more likely to be the cause of the dog's continued unwillingness to listen to its owner. Step 5: Choose the most relevant answer based on the analysis.

Start a fire inside the pile by burning some small branches or paper. 5. Watch the smoke coming out of the hole. When it becomes very light or stops, close the hole with dirt or sand. 6.

A cyclist is making his way more than 1,900 miles across Europe fuelled only by food he is able to rescue from bins along the way. Baptiste Dubanchet set off from Paris, France, in April and is cycling all the way to the Polish capital, Warsaw, in a bid to raise awareness of how much food we waste. The 25-year-old from Bordeaux has already travelled through Luxembourg, Belgium, the Netherlands and the Czech Republic, surviving only on food destined for landfill. Baptiste Dubanchet pictured raiding supermarket bins in Berlin, Germany, during his 1,900-mile odyssey across Europe eating only food that others have thrown away. He hopes his project will raise awareness of waste. Resourceful: The 25-year-old from Bordeaux has already travelled through Luxembourg, Belgium, the Netherlands and the Czech Republic, surviving only on food destined for landfill. A wealth of food: This picture shows how much edible food is thrown away by businesses every single day. Along the way he has stayed with locals met online, who agreed to put him up for free, but he has refused any food - or even a beer - other than what has already been discarded. When he's been unable to find a sofa to sleep on he's camped out in the open. 'The objective is to make this trip relying only from food destined to be thrown away, from hotels, restaurants, grocery stores, supermarkets and markets, in order to denounce food waste,' he says on his website. Campaigners in Britain have welcomed his project, pointing out that even as we throw away hundreds of thousands of tons of edible food, there are people who do not have enough to eat. Mr Dubanchet chose to make the journey by bicycle to keep his carbon footprint as close to zero as possible. He set off on April 15 and last weekend he arrived in Konin, Poland, for the last leg of his journey. Yum: Mr Dubanchet eats a calabrese during a snack break during his trans-continental bike ride. Mr Dubanchet during a stop off in Belgium: He chose to cycle to keep his carbon footprint as low as possible. Mr Dubanchet in the Netherlands: He said the idea came to him when he was travelling in the developing world. As he travelled throught Germany, he told a reporter for The Local that his first objective when arriving at a new town is to track down sources of food. 'I have to find food fast because after all the cycling I am tired and I need the energy,' he said. 'Is my stomach full or empty? That is the most important thing, not what I am eating.' He has a sign written in each country's language to explain his project, but said many businesses have a policy of not giving anything away - even if it's to be thrown in the bin. Some workers, he says, have even risked their jobs to help him out. Mr Dubanchet said the idea came to him when he want travelling in Latin America and South East Asia after he graduated. He said the sight of so many people going hungry compelled him to do something to highlight how much food we waste in Europe. He wrote on his blog: 'The reason I can find sufficient food, is that industrialised countries are rich enough to allow themselves to waste tons of food that is still consumable. 'I find some food thrown away just because the packaging is wet or damaged, whole bags of fruit in the bin because one of the fruit is bruised, yoghurts, cheese, or other products discarded because of irrelevant expiry dates.' Mr Dubanchet and a friend with food he'd raided from a bin: The Frenchman has stayed with strangers met online during his journey and, when he couldn't find anyone to put him up, he camped out in the open. In a host's kitchen in Frankfurt: 'The reason I can find sufficient food, is that industrialised countries are rich enough to allow themselves to waste tons of food that is still consumable,' he wrote on his blog. Epic journey: Mr Dubanchet has visited six countries on his trip across Europe, and not spent a penny on food. Mary McGrath, chief executive of British charity FoodCycle, which takes food destined for the bin, cooks it up and serves it to people at risk of food poverty, welcomed Mr Dubanchet's initiative. She said: 'Baptiste has highlighted the unacceptable level of food waste that exists at all stages of the supply chain - from farm to fork. 'In the UK it is estimated that over 400,000 tonnes of food is thrown away at retail level yet over 4 million people are affected by food poverty. 'Food poverty and food waste shouldn’t co-exist in the same communities but unfortunately they do. 'We should be doing everything possible to ensure that as much edible surplus food as possible is going to help people who are struggling to get by.'

Answer a question about this article: In total, 156 prisoners have been either acquitted, or received pardons or commutations on the basis of possible innocence, between 1973 to 2015. Death penalty opponents often argue that this statistic shows how perilously close states have come to undertaking wrongful executions; proponents point out that the statistic refers only to those exonerated in law, and that the truly innocent may be a smaller number. Statistics likely understate the actual problem of wrongful convictions because once an execution has occurred there is often insufficient motivation and finance to keep a case open, and it becomes unlikely at that point that the miscarriage of justice will ever be exposed.

No","completion":"Based on the information provided, the answer would be: 2). No To provide a detailed explanation, Sydney's constant loud and annoying behaviors seem to be driving Remy mad. This indicates that Remy is not comfortable or content with the noise and annoyance produced by Sydney. Consequently, when asked what Remy would want to do next, suggesting that they would want to \\"keep being loud\\" is not a valid answer. Instead, Remy would likely be seeking alternatives to resolve the issue or alleviate the disturbance that Sydney's noises are causing. Some possible solutions or actions that Remy may consider include: 1. Communicating with Sydney: Remy could express their concerns and discomfort with Sydney, asking them to be more mindful of the noise they produce. A calm and respectful conversation may lead to a mutual understanding and improved behavior from Sydney. 2. Seeking an alternative environment: Remy may choose to distance themselves from the situation, either temporarily or permanently. This could involve finding a quieter place to work or relax, or making changes to their living situation if it proves to be too disruptive. 3. Utilizing noise-cancellation tools: Remy could invest in noise-canceling headphones or earplugs to help block out or minimize Sydney's annoying sounds. This solution allows Remy to maintain their presence in the shared space without being significantly disturbed by Sydney's noise. 4. Finding a compromise or establishing ground rules: Remy and Sydney could work together to schedule designated quiet times or establish boundaries within the living or working area. This gives both parties an opportunity to respect each other's needs and preferences while promoting a more harmonious environment. In conclusion, Remy would most likely not want to continue experiencing Sydney's loud and annoying behavior. They would rather seek ways to minimize the disturbance or address the issue directly with Sydney to find a resolution that works for both parties."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

During the event, a mysterious stranger, Adam (played by Idris Elba), approaches Helen and informs her that he has classified information about an imminent asteroid impact that may have catastrophic consequences for Earth. Against her better judgment, Helen decides to follow Adam to a secret government facility, where he shares stolen evidence about an asteroid named \\"Nemesis\\" heading towards Earth. Despite the government's plan to keep this information confidential, Helen convinces Adam to go public, warning people about the impending disaster. As panic spreads across the nation, a team of ambitious scientists led by Dr. George Proctor (played by Mark Ruffalo) is assembled to find a way to intercept and destroy the asteroid before it reaches Earth. As the team works tirelessly, political tensions rise as various countries try to gain control of this critical mission or use it as an opportunity to further their own agendas. Amidst the chaos, Helen and Adam embark on a dangerous quest to gather intel on Nemesis while attempting to navigate the treacherous political landscape. Through their shared commitment to save humanity, they develop a romantic relationship, which only intensifies as time runs out. As the asteroid approaches, the scientific team successfully develops a high-tech missile that can pulverize Nemesis. However, a spy in the ranks sabotages the initial launch, resulting in a race against time to fix the issue and save the planet. With Helen and Adam's intel and Dr. Proctor's expertise, they manage to identify and stop the saboteur. In a thrilling climax, the team successfully launches the missile towards Nemesis, destroying it moments before it would have collided with Earth.

Living in poverty can have devastating effects on an individual's physical, mental, and emotional well-being. It may limit access to basic necessities like food, clean water, adequate housing, healthcare, and education. The feelings of hopelessness and desperation that often accompany poverty can lead to increased stress and vulnerability to mental health issues. 1. Health problems: Poverty often equates to a lack of access to proper nutrition, which can lead to malnutrition and other health issues like diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular diseases. It can also cause stress, which can result in mental health problems such as depression and anxiety and exacerbate existing health issues. 2. Limited access to education and employment opportunities: People living in poverty may not have the resources to attain a proper education, limiting their prospects of obtaining well-paying jobs or pursuing higher education. This lack of educational opportunities may result in a cycle of poverty that can persist throughout generations. 3. Inadequate housing: Living in poverty may mean that an individual or family must reside in substandard or overcrowded housing. This can expose residents to hazardous living conditions, including poor sanitation, increased risk of illness, and higher levels of crime. 4. Social exclusion: People who live in poverty can experience social isolation and exclusion, as they may be unable to participate in activities that their more affluent peers can easily access. This can lead to feelings of loneliness, isolation, and alienation, which can further contribute to mental health problems. 5. Impeded development in children: Children growing up in poverty-stricken environments often face significant disadvantages when it comes to their cognitive, social, and emotional development. This can lead to delays in language development, lower academic achievement, and increased rates of behavioral and emotional issues. 6. Vulnerability to crime and violence: Poverty can create desperation, which can lead people to engage in criminal activities in order to survive. Furthermore, impoverished communities often experience higher crime rates, leading to increased exposure to violence, which can affect an individual's mental and emotional health. 7. Limited access to healthcare: People who live in poverty may not have access to proper healthcare or be unable to afford medical services. This can result in unaddressed health issues, chronic illnesses, or complications due to a lack of preventive care. The hardships associated with living in poverty can create a significant barrier to upward mobility and make it difficult for an individual to break the cycle of poverty. Addressing the root causes of poverty and implementing policies that promote economic stability, access to education, and healthcare are essential for alleviating poverty and providing opportunities for a better quality of life."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The two girls often played together beside the beck (stream) at the bottom of the garden, much to their mothers' annoyance, because they frequently came back with wet feet and clothes. Frances and Elsie said they only went to the beck to see the fairies, and to prove it, Elsie borrowed her father's camera, a Midg quarter-plate. The girls returned about 30 minutes later, \\"triumphant\\".Elsie's father, Arthur, was a keen amateur photographer, and had set up his own darkroom. The picture on the photographic plate he developed showed Frances behind a bush in the foreground, on which four fairies appeared to be dancing. Knowing his daughter's artistic ability, and that she had spent some time working in a photographer's studio, he dismissed the figures as cardboard cutouts. Two months later the girls borrowed his camera again, and this time returned with a photograph of Elsie sitting on the lawn holding out her hand to a 1-foot-tall (30 cm) gnome. Exasperated by what he believed to be \\"nothing but a prank\\", and convinced that the girls must have tampered with his camera in some way, Arthur Wright refused to lend it to them again. His wife Polly, however, believed the photographs to be authentic. Towards the end of 1918, Frances sent a letter to Johanna Parvin, a friend in Cape Town, South Africa, where Frances had lived for most of her life, enclosing the photograph of herself with the fairies.

The Eclogues, Georgics, and above all the Aeneid became standard texts in school curricula with which all educated Romans were familiar. Poets following Virgil often refer intertextually to his works to generate meaning in their own poetry. The Augustan poet Ovid parodies the opening lines of the Aeneid in Amores 1.1.1–2, and his summary of the Aeneas story in Book 14 of the Metamorphoses, the so-called \\"mini-Aeneid\\", has been viewed as a particularly important example of post-Virgilian response to the epic genre. Lucan's epic, the Bellum Civile has been considered an anti-Virgilian epic, disposing with the divine mechanism, treating historical events, and diverging drastically from Virgilian epic practice. The Flavian poet Statius in his 12-book epic Thebaid engages closely with the poetry of Virgil; in his epilogue he advises his poem not to \\"rival the divine Aeneid, but follow afar and ever venerate its footsteps.\\" In Silius Italicus, Virgil finds one of his most ardent admirers. With almost every line of his epic Punica Silius references Virgil. Indeed, Silius is known to have bought Virgil's tomb and worshipped the poet. Partially as a result of his so-called \\"Messianic\\" Fourth Eclogue—widely interpreted later to have predicted the birth of Jesus Christ—Virgil was in later antiquity imputed to have the magical abilities of a seer; the Sortes Vergilianae, the process of using Virgil's poetry as a tool of divination, is found in the time of Hadrian, and continued into the Middle Ages. In a similar vein Macrobius in the Saturnalia credits the work of Virgil as the embodiment of human knowledge and experience, mirroring the Greek conception of Homer. Virgil also found commentators in antiquity. Servius, a commentator of the 4th century AD, based his work on the commentary of Donatus. Servius' commentary provides us with a great deal of information about Virgil's life, sources, and references; however, many modern scholars find the variable quality of his work and the often simplistic interpretations frustrating.

Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Summarize the following: When you're playing defense, you'll wear a leather glove on your non-throwing hand to help you catch thrown or batted balls. If you purchase a new glove, you will want to \\"break it in\\" by removing the stiffness of the new leather. There are several methods of doing this, including baking the glove in an oven with special oil applied, leaving it in the sun, or playing a lot of catch with it. Playing the catcher position in fast-pitch requires a special glove. The gloves of catchers (and first basemen) are called mitts. They are made of heavier construction than the typical softball glove. Softball bats are not all the same. They must be chosen with a player’s size and strength in mind. When you look for a bat, look at three primary factors: the length, the weight, and the style. To find a bat that is the right length, stand up straight and hold a bat by its knob at the end. If you can hold your arm straight down, and the bat touches the ground, it is the right length for you. If you have to bend your elbow, it is too long. If the bat doesn't touch the ground, it's too short. To find a bat that is the right weight, look at the drop. The drop is the numerical difference between the bat's height (in inches) and its weight (in ounces). The drop will range anywhere from -8 to -12. Lighter bats (near -12), are good for weak or slow batters. Heavier bats (near -8), are best for strong batters. You can also test the suitability of the bat's weight by placing it in your throwing hand and holding it straight out in front of you. If you can easily hold it at arm's length for a full minute or more, it is not too heavy for you. There are two main types of softball bats available, aluminum and composite. Each type is appropriate for both beginners and experienced players, but aluminum bats are more popular. These are also available in single- or double-walled construction. Single-walled are cheaper but slightly less effective than double-walled bats. Composite bats will hit the ball farther, but they can crack easily in cold weather. Playing softball, especially fast-pitch, can be dangerous if you don’t take safety precautions. Most fast-pitch leagues require batters to use a caged batting helmet (pictured above), but even if they don’t, it is best to wear one when you are up to bat. Cleats are used in several sports and give you better traction while running after a ball or between bases. For softball, rubber or plastic cleats are appropriate. Metal cleats are typically banned in softball leagues, as they pose a danger to sliding runners and infielders who try to tag them. These include batting gloves, which cushion the hands, protect against blisters, and improve bat grip. If you are a fast-pitch catcher, you will want to use a mask, chest protector and shin guards. Some players who frequently slide into bases choose to wear sliding pads.","completion":"In softball, players wear leather gloves to catch thrown or batted balls, and breaking-in new gloves is essential.

If steroid hormones are made of fats, then what are steroid hormones made of? Answer choices: - fats - blood - H 2 O - sugar - dust - muscle - gasoline - SO2 Answer:","completion":"Steroid hormones are made of fats. Specifically, they are derived from lipids, which are a type of fat molecule. The main building block of steroid hormones is cholesterol, a complex lipid molecule that is an essential component of cell membranes and a precursor for several important biological molecules, including steroid hormones. Steroid hormones are a class of hormones that include testosterone, estrogen, progesterone, and cortisol, among others. These hormones play critical roles in various biological processes, such as growth, development, immune function, metabolism, and reproductive function. They are synthesized in the endocrine glands, including the adrenal glands, gonads (testes and ovaries), and in some cases, the placenta during pregnancy. The process of making steroid hormones from cholesterol involves a series of enzymatic reactions that modify the structure of the cholesterol molecule. During these reactions, functional groups are added or removed, and the steroid ring system is formed. Once they have been produced, steroid hormones are secreted by the endocrine glands into the bloodstream, where they are transported to their target cells. Upon reaching their target cells, steroid hormones diffuse across the cell membrane due to their lipid-soluble nature. Once inside the cell, they bind to specific intracellular molecular receptors, forming a hormone-receptor complex. This complex then moves into the nucleus of the cell and acts as regulatory molecules, influencing gene expression by binding to specific DNA sequences and controlling the transcription of target genes. This process ultimately leads to the regulation of various cellular processes and functions in response to hormonal signaling. In summary, steroid hormones are made of fats, specifically cholesterol-derived lipids. They play critical roles in regulating various biological processes and functions, and their mode of action involves binding to intracellular receptors and controlling gene expression in target cells. The other options presented - blood, H2O, sugar, dust, muscle, gasoline, and SO2 - are not related to the composition of steroid hormones."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Context: In the shadow of the Seattle Space Needle, almost alien crystalline forms wrap their deft tendrils through the Chihuly Garden and Glass. Every single petal, bowl, stem and branch of cascading glass has been handblown under the guidance of Washington State native Dale Chihuly (in fact he grew up in nearby Tacoma), and we couldn’t quite believe our eyes. Having discovered this exhibit through the magic of Jaime’s instagram (she’s a self-named Angloyankophile who grew up in Seattle before moving to London) I knew we would have to visit. My photos don’t do the undulating forms any kind of justice; but they might just convey the incredible scale of the exhibition. I’d always been curious to learn more about Chihuly, after being introduced to his incredible sculpture suspended over the V&A Museum information desk, a glowing confection of green and white glass whisps. In 1968, after receiving a Fulbright Fellowship, he went to work at the Venini glass factory in Venice, observing the team approach to blowing glass, which is critical to the way he works today. In 1971, Chihuly cofounded Pilchuck Glass School in Washington State. With this international glass center, Chihuly has led the avant-garde in the development of glass as a fine art. His work is included in more than 200 museum collections worldwide. He has been the recipient of many awards, including twelve honorary doctorates and two fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts. He has also lost an eye to his passion, and now mostly directs the sculpture design and assembly. It was truly amazing. In 1999, Chihuly started an ambitious exhibition, Chihuly in the Light of Jerusalem; where more than 1 million visitors attended the Tower of David Museum to view his installations. In 2001, the Victoria and Albert Museum in London curated the exhibition Chihuly at the V&A.

It boasts cool combat features, a spooky paranormal story line and some dramatic tension. But because its emphasis is on combat, not thrills, the game is not nearly as scary as it should be. \\"F.E.A.R. 3\\" (Day 1 Studios, Warner Bros. Interactive) continues its franchise's story of a family in conflict as two brothers work together to track down their psychically enhanced mother, Alma, who is about to give birth. However, their reasons for wanting to find dear Mom are totally opposite. Filmmaker John Carpenter, director of the classic fright flick \\"Halloween,\\" helped create cinematics for the game that heighten its fear factor. Comic book horror writer Steve Niles co-wrote the story line. Co-op mode is the preferred mode of play here, allowing you to take advantage of each brother's skills during combat and strive toward the highest score on each level. You can play as Point Man, who is well versed in military training and technique, or as Paxton Fettel, who was slain during the original \\"F.E.A.R\\" but returns here as a ghost with psychic energy powers. The brothers must navigate wave after wave of soldiers, whacked-out cultists and creepy creatures created from Alma's mind. The battlefields range from a looted food warehouse to the science bunker where Alma is being held. While the action is pretty linear, there are detours in which you can search for hidden weapons and ammo, psychic link gathering locations, and an Alma doll, which scores big points when found. There are enemies who require some extra work to defeat, including one called a Phase Caster, who summons additional soldiers over and over. Kill him first. Seriously. It is easy to get immersed in the run-and-gun aspects of \\"F.E.A.R. 3,\\" but keep in mind that it's also supposed to be a horror game. Remember, Mom is a psychic time bomb allegedly waiting to erupt when she gives birth to ... whatever. To be sure, there are some very good horror moments in the game. The apparitions that briefly appear, scare and disappear are disconcerting. And having a ghost brother along during solo mode is a constant reminder. When they occur, the terror elements are jump-out-of-your-seat frightening. It is almost like watching a horror movie from the eyes of the lead actor. The problem is those moments don't seem to occur as often as you'd think or hope. There were plenty of times in the game where I forgot it was supposed to be a thriller and not just a shooter. Some levels' features are so combat-heavy that there's no room for any memorable paranormal experiences. Early in the game I was peeking around every corner expecting to find some apparition or twisted scene, only to shrug and move on. By the end of the game, I stopped looking for ghosts and just treated everything as a combat scene. Multiplayer modes help make the game fun to replay. You can work together with your teammates to survive waves of enemies emerging from an advancing fog, or be possessed by Alma and try to take over your former teammates. \\"F.E.A.R 3\\" is a well-made first-person shooter that will challenge players with intelligent enemies and compelling battles. Sadly, the frights aren't quite as jarring as they could have been. Which, I'm sure, makes the ghosts very sad. Boo. \\"F.E.A.R. 3\\" is playable on the PC, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360.
