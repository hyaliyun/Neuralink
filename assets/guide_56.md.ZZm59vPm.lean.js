Think like you are answering to a five year old. Eli -- a sweet, active, blonde-haired preschooler -- had gone to sleep feeling fine, perhaps dreaming of playing with his sisters or having a fun day at school. He didn't make it through the night. While the young boy died sometime between the night of Wednesday, September 24, and the following morning, it wasn't until Friday night that authorities figured out why: enterovirus D68, a particularly pernicious strain of an otherwise common virus that has been particularly widespread this year. While it's been detected in at least four people who died, Eli's case is the first in which authorities have definitively cited enterovirus D68 as the cause of death. Jeff Plunkett, the health officer in Eli's hometown of Hamilton Township, New Jersey, explained Saturday that, while the boy was born premature, \\"he had no other existing condition\\" and his parents no reason to believe he was direly ill before the virus took his life. Eli was 4. \\"He was asymptomatic and fine, and the next morning he had passed,\\" Plunkett told reporters. \\"So the onset was very rapid, very sudden. And that's clearly the big difference (between enterovirus D68 and other enterovirus strains).\\" Authorities are testing one other child who attended preschool at Eli's school, Yardville Elementary, albeit in a different class, for enterovirus D68. That boy has been treated at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital and is now recovering at home, according to Plunkett. There are no other suspected cases in the town of 90,000 residents. Nor is there any sign of pervasive sickness at Yardville Elementary or other town schools, with attendance levels around normal. This speaks to the deadliness, the randomness and, in a sense, the pervasiveness of enterovirus D68. Hamilton Township Mayor Kelly Yaede pointed out that his parents \\"nor anyone will ever be able to determine where Eli may have contracted this virus.\\" \\"The virus is out in the community, there is nothing we can do about that,\\" the health officer said. \\"The way to prevent it is from your own personal hygiene and be vigilant with your own children and yourself.\\" Officials did not disclose Eli's last name during a Saturday press briefing. More enterovirus cases are likely. Just last week, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention or state public health laboratories had confirmed 277 cases of enterovirus D68. That figure has skyrocketed in recent days, to 538 confirmed cases in 43 states and the District of Columbia as of Friday. And there's no reason to think it won't get even worse. As the CDC points out, \\"Enteroviruses commonly circulate in summer and fall. We're currently in middle of the enterovirus season.\\" Not including Eli's cases, tests showed enterovirus D68 in four people who had died. The CDC, though, reported then that \\"the role that EV-D68 infection played in these deaths is unclear at this time.\\" Mercer County's medical examiner, Dr. Raafat Ahmad, was unequivocal about it's part in Eli's death. \\"The child had some brain swelling, it had some lymph node swelling,\\" Plunkett said. \\"But Ahmad attributed that to the virus as the cause of death.\\" Enterovirus is very common, with the CDC estimating 10 million to 15 million infections each year in the United States. But it has about 100 strains, with D68 among the most dangerous. Authorities say this strain has sent more children than usual to the hospital with severe respiratory illnesses. It seems to be most affecting children with a history of asthma or breathing problems. Enterovirus may also be linked to a small number of cases of a mysterious neurologic illness in Colorado, Boston and Michigan. Doctors in Colorado spotted it first -- a group of 10 children hospitalized with limb weakness, cranial nerve dysfunction and abnormalities in their spinal gray matter. Staff at Boston Children's Hospital have since identified four patients with the same symptoms. And a child in Washtenaw County, Michigan, has also developed partial paralysis in the lower limbs after being hospitalized with the virus, according to the Michigan Department of Community Health. As Plunkett, the Hamilton Township health officer, explained: \\"The D68 strain is a very virulent strain of entire that would attack young children, preschoolers, toddlers who have for the most part compromised immune systems. It has a certain target in our population.\\" Hygiene education, cleaning ramped up in schools. It's not clear, though, whether Eli should have been any more susceptible than anyone else, beyond his age. That and the suddenness of his death makes it especially difficult to fathom or fully understand. People in Hamilton Township, at least, are doing something about it. While officials say they're being careful not to overly alarm students, they are stressing things like hand washing, sneezing into your sleeves, staying home if you're sick and the like to students, teachers and parents to try to prevent the spread of enterovirus D68 and other viruses. Superintendent Jim Parla also said \\"we have ramped up cleaning in all of our schools,\\" devoting extra staff and hours to \\"do cleaning that goes above and beyond what we normally do.\\" Then there's the matter of taking care of Eli's family, namely his parents -- both educators -- and two young sisters. Yardville Elementary Principal Elena Manning said that blue-and-yellow bows, her school's colors, are being put up around the community in Eli's honor. The late boy's preschool teacher and an assistant bought a girlish bedroom set and rug to decorate his sisters' room at home. And the school will soon have a \\"Proud of Me\\" wall to display students' work, because Eli would regularly \\"ask Daddy if Daddy was proud of him,\\" according to Manning. Eli's parents are working with school officials on other things. But their focus now is more on grieving, taking care of their daughters and sending a message to the community. According to Principal Manning, \\"They are most concerned about giving thanks, which is incredible.\\" Summarize the highlights of this article.","completion":"Eli, a 4-year-old boy, got sick and passed away because of enterovirus D68. Enterovirus D68 is a strong type of virus that can make young children, especially those with weak immune systems, very sick. It has been spreading more this year and has affected many children in the United States. To prevent the spread of the virus, people are encouraged to practice good hygiene habits like washing hands and staying home when sick.

Given the following context: Van Eyck gives Mary three roles: Mother of Christ, the personification of the \\"Ecclesia Triumphans\\" and Queen of Heaven, the latter apparent from her jewel-studded crown. The painting's near miniature size contrasts with Mary's unrealistically large stature compared with her setting. She physically dominates the cathedral; her head is almost level with the approximately sixty feet high gallery. This distortion of scale is found in a number of other van Eyck's Madonna paintings, where the arches of the mostly gothic interior do not allow headroom for the virgin. Pächt describes the interior as a \\"throne room\\", which envelopes her as if a \\"carrying case\\". Her monumental stature reflects a tradition reaching back to an Italo-Byzantine type – perhaps best known through Giotto's Ognissanti Madonna (c. 1310) – and emphasises her identification with the cathedral itself. Till-Holger Borchert says that van Eyck did not paint her as \\"the Madonna in a church\\", but instead as metaphor, presenting Mary \\"as the Church\\". This idea that her size represents her embodiment as the church was first suggested by Erwin Panofsky in 1941. Art historians in the 19th century, who thought the work was executed early in van Eyck's career, attributed her scale as the mistake of a relatively immature painter.The composition is today seen as deliberate, and opposite to both his Madonna of Chancellor Rolin and Arnolfini Portrait. These works show interiors seemingly too small to contain the figures, a device van Eyck used to create and emphasise an intimate space shared by donor and saint. The Virgin's height recalls his Annunciation of 1434–36, although in that composition there are no architectural fittings to give a clear scale to the building. Perhaps reflecting the view of a \\"relatively immature painter\\", a copy of the Annunciation by Joos van Cleve shows Mary at a more realistic proportion scale to her surroundings.Mary is presented as a Marian apparition; in this case she probably appears before a donor, who would have been kneeling... answer the following question: What is the first name of the subject whose identification with the cathedral itself is emphasized by her monumental stature?

Now that my energy levels are returning I though that it is about time I told you about these amazing products! Okoii products are handmade by Yoko, formally from Japan, now living in Australia. Her aim was to introduce Australian women to traditional natural ingredients from Japan and Asia that they may not previously have been aware of.

When you place an order with Okoii, your products are then made by hand, one by one, so you know that they are as fresh as they can possibly be. Other than Lush' Fresh Face Masks, I can't think of any other product that would be as fresh as Okoii. I find it quite exciting to know that when I purchase a product from Okoii, that it hasn't been sitting on the shelf of a warehouse for months, slowly deteriorating. It is recommended that the products be kept in the fridge to maintain their freshness and the all come with a recommended used by date that is between 3-6 months from when it was made. The first product that I am going to introduce you to is the Luxury Rice Bran Face Soap. I decided to review this one on its own for two reasons.

Albion failed to register a single shot on target, although Craig Dawson headed over and Stephane Sessegnon slashed wide after the break. Villa rarely threatened with Ashley Westwood's low shot their best effort. Villa have been written off as relegation certainties by many onlookers, cut adrift at the bottom of the table following a miserable first half of the Premier League campaign. The Midlanders had earned just eight points after 20 matches, but have managed to give themselves - and their beleaguered fans - a modicum of hope in recent weeks. A home win against Crystal Palace - their first victory since the opening day - has been followed by successive draws at Leicester and Albion. But they still remain nine points adrift of safety with 15 matches remaining. Villa are the league's lowest goalscorers, having netted just 18 times this season, and their lack of cutting edge hampered them again at The Hawthorns. Remi Garde's men enjoyed more than 60% of possession and managed 15 attempts at the Albion goal, but home keeper Ben Foster was rarely stretched. Albion were aiming to clinch a top-flight double over Villa for the first time in 51 years, having won 1-0 at Villa Park in September. England Under-21 striker Saido Berahino was their match-winner on that day, but he has rarely made an impact since amid uncertainty about his future at Albion. Berahino was introduced with about half an hour left against Villa as Tony Pulis tried to add some much-needed attacking impetus to his team. But Berahino, like the rest of the home side, failed to seriously trouble Villa keeper Mark Bunn. Albion did not manage a shot on target when they lost at Southampton last weekend - and failed to do so again. However, the point did move Pulis' side - who are 13th - seven points clear of the bottom three. Aston Villa manager Remi Garde: \\"I'm a little bit disappointed because we wanted three points.

Here is an article: GREENSBORO, N.C., May 25 (AP)  A grass-roots commission that investigated the 1979 shooting deaths of five communist organizers by members of the Ku Klux Klan and the American Nazi Party laid the bulk of blame for the violence on Thursday on the Greensboro police, who knew that the white supremacists had planned to attend the \\"Death to the Klan\\" march, but failed to take action. The \\"single most important element that contributed to the violent outcome of the confrontation was the absence of police\\" from the Nov. 3, 1979, march, the panel, the Greensboro Truth and Reconciliation Commission, wrote in a summary of its report. Despite having a paid informer among the Klansmen, the police \\"showed a stunning lack of curiosity in planning for the safety of the event,\\" commissioners wrote. The report also found fault with both the Klan and Nazi members who opened fire and the communist activists who underestimated the danger posed by repeating their verbal baiting of the Klan. Five people died when Klan and Nazi members opened fire on people gathering for a march and rally in the city's Morningside Homes neighborhood. Ten others were injured. Debate has raged for years over whether the incident was a shooting or a shootout. The commission concluded that some members of the communist Workers Voice Organization, which organized the rally, were armed and did fire at the Nazi and Klan members, but only after the Nazis and Klansmen had fired as many as five shots. The gunmen were captured on videotape by journalists covering the rally, but six people who were charged in the case were acquitted of murder charges at a state trial in 1980. A Klan leader was also acquitted in 1984 of federal charges of conspiracy to interfere with a federal investigation. The lack of criminal convictions, along with a feeling that city leaders had swept the shootings under the rug, has been a source of dissatisfaction among minorities and liberal activists here. The seven-member commission held three public hearings on the matter in 2005. A ceremony was held Thursday at a chapel on the campus of Bennett College for Women.

It began as an all-boys school, but in 1898, three nuns belonging to the indigenous congregation of the Daughters of the Holy Heart of Mary began teaching classes for girls. Soon, there were 60 students. A school infrastructure description in the region in 1900 reveals that the boys' school in Carabane was open from December to August each year, and that holidays ran from September to November, when parents needed their children in the fields to help cultivate rice. In 1903, when Carabane lost its status as capital, the school was instructing 63 boys and 102 girls. In 1914, it had only 56 boys and 26 girls, a situation similar to that in Bignona.

It also prevents bacteria and other microorganisms from entering the body. The skin helps maintain a constant body temperature. It keeps the body cool in two ways. Sweat from sweat glands in the skin evaporates to cool the body. Blood vessels in the skin dilate, or widen. This action increases blood flow to the body surface. This allows more heat to reach the surface. The heat is then able to radiate off the body. The opposite happens to retain body heat. Blood vessels in the skin constrict, or narrow.

After U2 guitarist the Edge worked individually with Rubin in Los Angeles, the group spent two weeks in September 2006 completing songs with the producer at Abbey Road Studios in London. Later that year, the band released two songs from these sessions on the compilation album U218 Singles: a cover of the Skids' \\"The Saints Are Coming\\" with Green Day, and \\"Window in the Skies\\". In January 2007, lead singer Bono said U2 intended to take their next album in a different musical direction from their previous few releases.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. It never occurred to Sun Yukun that the decision he made four years ago would have an impact on his career. When the 22-year-old entered college in 2009, he decided not to change his rural residence to a students' collective one. But when he finished college and was offered a job with a state-owned enterprise in Beijing, Sun was told that he couldn't accept the offer unless he had an urban hukou (household registration record). This time, he had no choice but to change his residence status. Transferring hukou to a university became optional in 2003, and many students are confronted with the dilemma of whether to do so or not. Professionals suggest they make the decision based on their current situation and future plans. 'I regret transferring my hukou' Wang Jinbi, 20, is an accounting major at Beijing Union University. Coming from Chifeng, Inner Mongolia autonomous region, she transferred her hukou when she enrolled at university. \\"I didn't think it was a big deal,\\" Wang says. \\"Since I'm registering under an urban hukou, it doesn't matter whether it's in Beijing or Inner Mongolia, I thought.\\" What Wang didn't expect, however, is that she would regret her decision later. \\"After two years of study, I've figured out my future plans. I want to return to my hometown and make a living there,\\" she says. That means Wang needs to transfer her hukou back again, which she worries will be a troublesome procedure. \\"I have a friend who graduated last year. She spent a lot of time and energy transferring her hukou back to her hometown again due to complicated paperworks,\\" says Wang. Guidelines for transferring hukou Wang's experience is not uncommon. Many students don't know what their decision means for their future. In order to help these students, Xie Yongqiang, from the Chengdu Municipal Bureau of Justice, posted a guideline for transferring hukou on a micro blog. According to Xie, students should firstly think about where they're going to stay. \\"If you like the city where you're studying and are considering staying there after graduation, then you should transfer your hukou,\\" he wrote. Students should also transfer their hukou if they intend to participate in an exchange program. According to Ju Haojie, deputy director of the household registration department at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, when applying for exchange programs, it saves a lot of trouble if students have a collective hukou registered under the university. But Xie also made suggestions for students with a rural registration. \\"If your family has land and a house, it's possible that you'll get a share of compensation in the event of a forced relocation. For those students, I would recommend them not to transfer their hukou,\\" he wrote. This doesn't affect students in terms of receiving medical insurance and other benefits at university. 'I want to stay in Beijing' Sometimes, students abandon their rural hukou for the prospect of a better future. Tang Yanwei is one of them. The 23-year-old from Yantai, Shandong province, had a rural hukou but transferred it after enrolling at Beijing University of Civil Engineering and Architecture. Although there are a lot of preferential policies for rural residents, for Tang, an urban hukou in Beijing is attractive. \\"I want to stay in Beijing, so a students' collective Beijing urban hukou is a promising start,\\" he says. \\"I'll do anything that could help me stay here. After all, there's no turning back for me now.\\" Now, provide a numbered list of answers to these questions: 1. What decision did Sun Yukun make? 2. Was that a good decision for him? 3. Why? 4. Is this an issue for many students? 5. Is it difficult to maintain previous residential status after if you want to move home? 6. What should the decision be based on? 7. Is it optional? 8.

At Armory’s Winter Antiques Show, Volumes of Variety Celebrated masterpieces are all well and good, but the less-well-lit nooks and crannies of art history are also needed to sustain a true art lover. That’s what a big fair like the Winter Antiques Show at the Park Avenue Armory is especially good for. With 73 purveyors of rare and remarkable objects, from ancient Egyptian sculpture to Modernist painting, it offers innumerable opportunities to encounter and learn about aspects of painting, decorative arts, furniture, jewelry or glass that might be new to even the best-informed visitors. You probably have never heard of Emerson Burkhart (1905-1969) of Columbus, Ohio, for example. He once was a famous American Social Realist painter. Coming upon his nearly life-size portrait of a grizzled, elderly black man from 1943, at Jonathan Boos, you might think you’ve discovered a previously unknown painting by Ivan Albright. Rendered in extreme detail enhanced by white highlighting, Burkhart’s subject, Oscar Coleman, sits in a distressed armchair, wearing a tie, two shirts and a corduroy vest. His lined, worried face and gnarled hands testify to a Lear-like history of anxiety and suffering. Burkhart titled the portrait with a dubious sentiment — “The Life of the Spirit Is Elevated by Pain” — but the painting nevertheless is affectingly empathetic. Another dramatic portrait of a black man, this one Shakespearean, is in the form of a technically impressive bust at Bowman Sculpture’s booth. “Bust of Othello: The Moor of Venice,” by Pietro Calvi (1833-1884), represents our tragic hero contemplating the handkerchief he’d given to Desdemona, who is now dead. He’s enveloped in a hooded robe of white marble, while his face and hands are made of nearly black cast bronze. Looking closely, you see he’s shedding a single tear. An interesting side note is that Calvi based his portrait on the features of Ira Aldridge (1807-1867), the actor who was the first black man to play Othello in Europe. Unless you’re an architect or a historian of the field, you may not know the name of Samuel Yellin, either. A Polish-born ironworker, Yellin set up shop in Philadelphia in 1909, and by 1928 employed 268 men to fulfill hundreds of commissions for metal work. Railings, window grilles and gates at the Cloisters were produced by Yellin. His inventive way with metal is represented by a floor lamp, from around 1925, at the Conner Rosenkranz booth. With its inverted, conical shade of dark metal; its square-section stem; and incongruously graceful three legs and feet, it looks like something a steampunk artist might have dreamed up. Another eminent craftsman not widely known outside his profession was the Danish furniture maker Tage Frid, to whom Moderne Gallery has devoted its entire booth. As a professor of woodworking at the Rhode Island School of Design from 1962 to 1985 and an editor of Fine Woodworking magazine, Mr. Frid exerted a huge influence on the craft of fine-furniture making. He particularly abhorred woodworkers who prized fancy design over sound construction. You can see his ethos of plain-spoken, well-made simplicity in the tables and chairs on view here, including an example of his most celebrated design, “Three-Legged Stool,” which looks like the child of a Shaker artisan and a Danish Modern designer. Along with a delightful set of a dozen 18th-century pocket-watch-size miniatures in oval frames picturing a rabbit, a donkey and 10 different species of birds, at Elle Shushan, there’s a small, deftly made pastel self-portrait by John Raphael Smith. Yet another artist, forgotten now, who was well known during his lifetime — in 18th-century England — Smith was celebrated for his mezzotint prints and pastel portraits. He also happened to be J. M. W. Turner’s first teacher. If you like miniatures — and even if you don’t — one don’t-miss booth is that of Les Enluminures, which has a splendid display of small-to-tiny illuminated books, manuscripts and individual paintings. One visionary paperback-book-size painting is “The Creation of the World,” made by a follower of Giovanni di Paolo around 1475. Followers of modern painting will recognize the name of Allan D’Arcangelo, but they might be surprised by his “Guard Rail” (1964), at Geoffrey Diner. Mr. D’Arcangelo was well known in the ’60s for his expansive, graphically vivid paintings of highways and road signs, which combine Modernist abstraction and Pop Art. This piece is unusual because it has an assertive sculptural element, a rare thing for Mr. D’Arcangelo. The painted part features a diamond-shaped vignette of a white road with black stripes cut into a field of reddish orange. The sculptural part is a real segment of chain-link fencing topped by barbed wire mounted over more than half of the picture. Anticipating by decades the similarly dystopian use of chain-link fencing by the sculptor Cady Noland, it evokes the dark side of the American dream of infinite mobility with eerie prescience. There are lots of folk art in the show, including a lovely and amusing quilt bearing a pattern of black elephants on an intricately stitched red field. Made between 1930 and 1950 by an unknown Pennsylvanian, it’s at Old Hope Antiques. A piece of folk art with a rich back story, at Allan Katz, is a tall secretary from 1876. Made of dark oak and walnut, it has a large clock on its top and is decorated all over with stars, eyes and fan shapes made of white bone. On an upper door, neatly cutout letters spell the name of J. F. Bingham, a soldier in the 16th Regiment of the Connecticut Infantry who was killed at Antietam in 1862. This memorial was made by unidentified friends of Wells Bingham, the dead soldier’s brother; he also fought at Antietam but survived the war. The friends presented it to him in the centennial year of the United States. Sadly, Wells Bingham committed suicide in 1904 at the age of 58. Of course, there are masterpieces to be seen. One is a major painting by the great Hudson River School painter Asher B. Durand called “Lake Hamlet” (1855). Depicting a peaceful, gleaming lake, with purple mountains in the distance, it’s an inspirational expression of transcendentalist faith in God and nature.

(CNN) -- A Florida exterminator whose dead daughter and injured son were found in his truck has been charged with attempted murder, and police were searching his Miami home Thursday night, police said. Chase Scott, spokesman for West Palm Beach Police, told CNN that officers were executing a search warrant for evidence in the home of Jorge and Carmen Barahona. Jorge Barahona, 53, was found unconscious beside his pest-control truck early Monday along a south Florida interstate by a road assistance ranger, along with his 10-year-old adopted son, who was inside the vehicle next to an open gas can, according to a probable-cause affidavit filed by detectives. Hours later, crews removing toxic chemicals from the truck discovered the boy's twin sister dead in a plastic bag. Earlier Thursday, Barahona was taken to a hospital Thursday after he \\"attempted to harm himself,\\" police said.

Make this lower case","completion":"The cluster participants have been tasked with delivering the material for conflict scenarios in Cluster 22. They must work on this project by themselves, which means that they need to collaborate, brainstorm, and develop different perspectives on potential conflicts that could arise within the cluster. After a session of group work, they have managed to come up with headlines for three distinct scenarios that explore a variety of challenges the cluster might face. These headlines help to focus the subsequent discussion and analysis of each potential conflict. The three scenarios are presented as follows: 1. \\"power balance in the cluster\\": This scenario examines the distribution of influence and authority within Cluster 22. Some members may possess greater control or leverage due to their resources, connections, or expertise, while others might find themselves in a position of lesser power. This imbalance could potentially lead to disagreements between members, as well as tensions and competition. This scenario urges the participants to analyze the current power dynamics within the cluster and determine ways to address and mitigate conflicts before they escalate. 2. \\"disagreement on the strategic direction of the cluster\\": Cluster 22 may face disputes regarding its overarching goals, objectives, or strategies. These disagreements could stem from differing opinions on how the cluster should prioritize its resources, which projects it should pursue, or which partnerships should be established. A lack of consensus on the cluster's strategic direction could hinder its progress and create tensions between members. This scenario prompts the participants to engage in a constructive dialogue, share their differing perspectives, and come to a mutual understanding to find the best path forward for the cluster. 3. \\"some members are milking the cluster dry\\": In this scenario, certain individuals or organizations within Cluster 22 may be exploiting the cluster's resources, taking advantage of collaborative opportunities, and reaping the benefits without adequately contributing or sharing in the overall responsibilities. This situation could create resentment among the other members and weaken the sense of trust and cooperation that is essential to a successful cluster. To address this concern, the participants are encouraged to scrutinize the contributions and expectations of each member, setting the foundation for more equitable and fair collaboration. In summary, the three conflict scenarios identified by the group - \\"power balance in the cluster\\", \\"disagreement on the strategic direction of the cluster\\", and \\"some members are milking the cluster dry\\" - serve as a starting point for Cluster 22 participants to evaluate and manage potential challenges. Through collaborative discussion and proactive planning, the group aims to tackle these issues head-on and find solutions that both maintain harmony within the cluster and ensure its continued growth and success."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Martha grew up in a household that always kept their bread in the freezer so that's what she does with her bread. Which woman's bread will grow mold slower? Hint: When the temperature of reactants is higher, the rate of the reaction is faster. At higher temperatures, particles of reactants have more energy, so they move faster. They are more likely to bump into one another and to collide with greater force. For example, when you fry an egg, turning up the heat causes the egg to cook faster. The same principle explains why storing food in a cold refrigerator reduces the rate at which food spoils (see Figure below ). Both food frying and food spoiling are chemical reactions that happen faster at higher temperatures.

In December 2015, average salaries available in Prague reached 35,853 CZK, an annual increase of 3.4%, which was nevertheless lower than national increase of 3.9% both in nominal and real terms. (Inflation in Prague was 0.5% in December, compared with 0.1% nationally.) Since 1990, the citys economic structure has shifted from industrial to service-oriented. Industry is present in sectors such as pharmaceuticals, printing, food processing, manufacture of transport equipment, computer technology and electrical engineering. In the service sector, financial and commercial services, trade, restaurants, hospitality and public administration are the most significant. Service (economics) account for around 80 percent of employment. There are 800,000 employees in Prague, including 120,000 commuters. The number of (legally registered) foreign residents in Prague has been increasing in spite of the countrys economic downturn. As of March 2010, 148,035 foreign workers were reported to be living in the city making up about 18 percent of the workforce, up from 131,132 in 2008. Approximately one-fifth of all investment in the Czech Republic takes place in the city. Question: How many percentage points of employment is not service? Answer:","completion":"In the context provided, service (economics) accounts for around 80 percent of employment in Prague. To find the percentage points of employment that is not service-oriented, we'll need to subtract this percentage from 100%. 100% - 80% = 20% Therefore, 20 percentage points of employment in Prague is not service-oriented."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The federal authorities targeted the stables and horse ranch in their investigation of a money-laundering operation connected to one of Mexico's most powerful and ruthless drug cartels, the Zetas. Jose Trevino Morales, whose stables were the primary focus of the investigation, was accused of running the sophisticated money-laundering operation on behalf of his older brother, Miguel Angel Trevino Morales. Miguel is a key figure in the Zetas drug operation, and he is presumed to have set up the horse operation that his younger brother managed from the sprawling ranch near Lexington, just south of Oklahoma City. Workers at the prominent quarter horse track in New Mexico were acutely aware of the Trevino family's alleged criminal activities, even giving the stables a nickname, the \\"Zetas' stables.\\" Federal agents staged a strategic raid on Tuesday morning at the Lexington race track and the horse ranch in Oklahoma to gather evidence and dismantle the alleged money-laundering scheme. Armed with bulletproof vests and the full support of federal law enforcement agencies, these agents worked to secure the premises and gather evidence to support the allegations against the Trevino brothers and their suspected associates. The agents remained highly alert during the operation, aware of the potential danger posed by the notoriously violent Zetas cartel. The bags of cash observed by workers at the stables were likely an integral part of the alleged money-laundering operation. Authorities believe that these funds were funnelled through the horse racing business, allowing the Zetas cartel to launder their illicit drug profits into seemingly legitimate assets, such as expensive racehorses. Through this complex operation, the drug cartel was able to maintain and expand its power and reach while obscuring the true sources of its vast wealth. With the raid on the Lexington race track and Oklahoma horse ranch, federal authorities aimed to strike a significant blow against the Zetas cartel's financial operations and weaken the criminal organization. The successful apprehension of crucial evidence and individuals involved in the money-laundering scheme could lead to the eventual dismantling of the cartel's economic infrastructure, as well as the incarceration of key figures in its leadership."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

U.S. President Donald Trump says he may veto a 1.3 trillion spending bill because it does not offer protections for young undocumented immigrants who arrived as children and does not fully fund the border wall. In a Twitter post Friday morning, Trump said he is considering a veto of the omnibus spending bill based on \\"the fact that the 800,000 plus DACA recipients have been totally abandoned by the Democrats (not even mentioned in Bill) and the BORDER WALL, which is desperately needed for our National Defense, is not fully funded.\\" Previously, White House officials said Trump would sign the spending package, a move that would head off a potential government shutdown due to a lack of funding. The measure funds the federal government through September 30. If Trump does not sign the legislation into law, the federal government will shut down at 12:01 a.m. Saturday. The Senate passed the bill by a 65-32 vote early Friday morning after the House of Representatives approved the measure Thursday. Lawmakers had just hours to read the nearly 2,200-page bill released Wednesday night. With midterm elections looming in November, the bill likely marks the final time Capitol Hill considers major legislation this year. The measure fulfills Trump’s vow to boost military funding but provides funding for limited parts of his immigration agenda. The bill includes a 2.4 percent pay raise for military personnel. After extensive negotiations between Republicans and Democrats, the bill also provides 1.6 billion for physical barriers and 150 kilometers of a wall at the U.S.-Mexico border, short of the 25 billion Trump requested for the project he repeatedly touted on the campaign trail while pledging Mexico would pick up the cost. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi touted the agreement in a letter to her Democratic colleagues, saying negotiators \\"fought for and achieved drastic reductions to the Trump/GOP plan,\\" including much less funding for the wall than Trump requested and a limit on the number of immigrants that can be... Question: After Trump's Twitter post, citizens of the US are probably feeling what way towards Trump? Options: A. Frustrated and confused B. Happy and excited C. not enough information D. Calm and reserved === The correct answer is A:","completion":"Frustrated and confused After President Trump's Twitter post about potentially vetoing the 1.3 trillion spending bill, it is likely that many US citizens are feeling frustrated and confused for several reasons. Firstly, the spending bill was created after extensive negotiations between Republicans and Democrats, representing a significant effort on both sides to come to an agreement. This bipartisan effort is not common in the currently polarized political climate, and citizens may have been hopeful that a compromise was reached that could potentially prevent a government shutdown and deal with multiple pressing issues. However, Trump's unexpected threat to veto the bill introduces uncertainty and raises the risk of a government shutdown, which could disrupt public services, affect government employees, and potentially harm the economy. This threat may cause frustration among citizens who had hoped for stability and continuity in government operations. Additionally, citizens may be confused about Trump's reasoning for the potential veto. In his Twitter post, he claims that the Democrats have abandoned DACA recipients, yet the spending bill offered no protections for the young undocumented immigrants only because the White House and Republicans did not support the bipartisan DACA proposals that were previously presented. This lack of support from the White House contributes to the absence of DACA protections in the bill, adding to the confusion of the public on Trump's stated reasoning. Lastly, the border wall funding issue may also contribute to citizens' frustration and confusion. While the bill does not fully fund the border wall, it still provides 1.6 billion for physical barriers and a portion of the wall – a compromise reached in the negotiations. Trump's insistence on full funding for the project, a campaign promise he made, might be seen as a disregard for the concession made by Democrats and the essential nature of the spending bill to keep the government running. Considering these factors, it can be concluded that many citizens of the US would likely feel frustrated and confused towards Trump's stance on vetoing the spending bill."},{"prompt":"Question: Title: Thrilling Storyline!

Objective: make chicken salad Which of the following solutions is more sound in terms of naive physics reasoning?","completion":"When evaluating the soundness of naive physics reasoning, we look to determine which solution adheres more closely to our common sense understanding of the physical world. Although you have not provided specific solutions for making chicken salad, I will present two solutions for your consideration. I'll explain which one is more sound in terms of naive physics reasoning and why. Solution 1: Traditional Chicken Salad Recipe 1. Cook 1 lb of boneless, skinless chicken breasts by boiling them in water for 10-12 minutes or until fully cooked through. Allow them to cool before shredding or dicing them into small pieces. 2. While the chicken is cooling, finely chop 1/2 cup of red onion, 1/2 cup of celery, and 1/4 cup of fresh parsley. 3. In a large mixing bowl, combine the cooled, shredded chicken, chopped vegetables, and parsley. 4. Add 1/2 cup of mayonnaise, 1 tablespoon of Dijon mustard, 1/2 tablespoon of lemon juice, salt, and pepper to taste. Mix until all the ingredients are well combined. 5. Cover and refrigerate the chicken salad for at least an hour or until it is chilled. Serve on a bed of lettuce or as a sandwich. Solution 2: Blended Chicken Salad \\"Smoothie\\" 1. Cook 1 lb of boneless, skinless chicken breasts by boiling them in water for 10-12 minutes or until fully cooked through. Allow them to cool before shredding or dicing them into small pieces. 2. While the chicken is cooling, finely chop 1/2 cup of red onion, 1/2 cup of celery, and 1/4 cup of fresh parsley. 3. In a blender, combine the cooled, shredded chicken, chopped vegetables, and parsley. 4. Add 1/2 cup of mayonnaise, 1 tablespoon of Dijon mustard, 1/2 tablespoon of lemon juice, salt, and pepper to taste. Blend until a smooth consistency is achieved. 5. Pour the chicken salad \\"smoothie\\" into a glass and serve. In terms of naive physics reasoning, Solution 1 is more sound. This solution takes into account our common understanding of how chicken salad should be prepared and consumed. It uses the logical approach of cooking the chicken, then mixing it with vegetables and seasonings to create a well-blended mixture that can be chilled and served easily. On the other hand, Solution 2 deviates from our typical understanding of how chicken salad should be made. Blending all of the ingredients together to create a liquid chicken salad \\"smoothie\\" does not adhere to the fundamental principles of naive physics reasoning, as it goes against our intuitive understanding of the preparation and consumption of chicken salad. People generally expect chicken salad to be a mixture of shredded or diced chicken combined with chopped vegetables and seasonings, not a blended liquid. Therefore, Solution 1 is the more sound solution in terms of naive physics reasoning. It stays true to the commonly accepted method of preparing chicken salad, and it is more consistent with our expectations and understanding of the physical properties of this dish."},{"prompt":"Information: - Music is an art form and cultural activity whose medium is sound and silence, which exist in time. The common elements of music are pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the \\"color\\" of a musical sound). Different styles or types of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs without instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and instruments. The word derives from Greek (\\"mousike\\"; \\"art of the Muses\\"). In its most general form, the activities describing music as an art form include the production of works of music (songs, tunes, symphonies, and so on), the criticism of music, the study of the history of music, and the aesthetic examination of music. Ancient Greek and Indian philosophers defined music as tones ordered horizontally as melodies and vertically as harmonies. Common sayings such as \\"the harmony of the spheres\\" and \\"it is music to my ears\\" point to the notion that music is often ordered and pleasant to listen to. However, 20th-century composer John Cage thought that any sound can be music, saying, for example, \\"There is no noise, only sound.\\" - Michael Henry Flanders OBE (1 March 1922 14 April 1975) was an English actor, broadcaster, and writer and performer of comic songs.

Here is a question about this article: Many contemporary uses of uranium exploit its unique nuclear properties. Uranium-235 has the distinction of being the only naturally occurring fissile isotope. Uranium-238 is fissionable by fast neutrons, and is fertile, meaning it can be transmuted to fissile plutonium-239 in a nuclear reactor. Another fissile isotope, uranium-233, can be produced from natural thorium and is also important in nuclear technology. While uranium-238 has a small probability for spontaneous fission or even induced fission with fast neutrons, uranium-235 and to a lesser degree uranium-233 have a much higher fission cross-section for slow neutrons. In sufficient concentration, these isotopes maintain a sustained nuclear chain reaction. This generates the heat in nuclear power reactors, and produces the fissile material for nuclear weapons. Depleted uranium (238U) is used in kinetic energy penetrators and armor plating. What is the answer to this question: What is the sole fissile isotope that occurs in nature?","completion":"To answer the question, I will refer to the information given in the article: The article states that \\"Uranium-235 has the distinction of being the only naturally occurring fissile isotope.\\" So, the answer to the question \\"What is the sole fissile isotope that occurs in nature?\\" is Uranium-235."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

While his dad is out working he goes to the lab in the basement and find an electroscope. The electroscope is currently in a neutral state. He then grabs a nearby rod that is positively charged and moves it near the knob of the electroscope. Fascinated he sees the leaves of the electroscope move apart from each other. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Given the rod was negatively charged when it touched the neutral electroscope, would the electroscope have a positive or negative charge? Hint: Similar to the results of a negatively charged rod, if a positively charged rod is brought near the knob of a neutral electroscope, it will attract some electrons up from the leaves onto the knob. That process causes both of the leaves to be positively charged (excess protons), and the leaves will diverge. If the positively charged rob is actually touched to the knob, the rob will remove some electrons and then when the rob is removed, the electroscope will remain positively charged. This is a permanent positive charge.

[2]. provide red hummingbird feeders around your yard, install a birdbath with a mister attachment, provide places to perch, and decorate your yard in red..","completion":"To accomplish the goal of attracting hummingbirds to your yard, you should select option [2]. provide red hummingbird feeders around your yard, install a birdbath with a mister attachment, provide places to perch, and decorate your yard in red. This option covers all the essential aspects of creating a hummingbird-friendly environment that will entice these beautiful creatures to visit your yard regularly. Here is a detailed plan on how to achieve this: 1. Provide red hummingbird feeders throughout your yard: Hummingbirds are primarily attracted to red, so placing red feeders strategically throughout your yard will help draw them in. It's essential to use hummingbird-specific feeders designed with their unique feeding requirements in mind. These feeders usually have small openings to prevent large birds and insects from consuming the nectar and easy-to-clean parts to maintain proper hygiene. You can use store-bought nectar or make your own using a simple mixture of one part white sugar to four parts water. Boil the solution and let it cool before filling the feeders, and always ensure the feeders are clean, fresh, and full of nectar. 2. Install a birdbath with a mister attachment: Hummingbirds love to bathe and drink clean water, especially if it's moving! A birdbath with a mister attachment is an excellent addition to your hummingbird-friendly yard, as it provides a source of clean, moving water for your feathered guests. A mister attachment sprays a fine mist, which hummingbirds enjoy flying through. This encourages them to visit your yard regularly, as a clean, reliable water source is vital for their survival. 3. Provide places to perch: Despite their energetic personalities, hummingbirds do need to take breaks and rest from time to time. Create perching spots throughout your yard by adding branches, vines, or trellises. Choose places that are near the feeders and the birdbaths but also provide the birds with some shelter from potential predators. This will give the hummingbirds a sense of security and enable them to relax while visiting your yard. 4. Decorate your yard in red: In addition to the red feeders, it helps to incorporate more red elements throughout your yard as a means of attracting hummingbirds. You can plant red flowering plants such as bee balm, salvia, trumpet vine, and flowering currant, which will not only add a pop of color to your yard but will also provide a natural source of nectar. Alternatively, you can also add red decorative items like flags, wind chimes, or garden stakes to create visual appeal and signal to hummingbirds that your yard is a friendly and inviting space. By implementing these strategies, you'll create an attractive and functional environment that will entice hummingbirds to visit your yard. With a little patience and attention to detail, you'll be able to enjoy the beauty and charm of hummingbirds right outside your door."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

As part of a plan to launder billions of dollars in London, \\"the Prince\\" – the head of the Russian Mafia – creates a new bank and has its financial oligarchs sign over their accounts to him. The first oligarch to do so is murdered alongside his family by a blue-eyed assassin. Poetics lecturer Perry MacKendrick and his barrister wife Gail are on a holiday in Morocco to try and salvage their marriage after Perry slept with one of his students. Perry strikes up a friendship with Dima, a hearty and boisterous Russian with an eidetic memory. The two men bond over drinks and tennis before Dima invites both MacKendricks to his daughter's birthday. At the birthday party, Dima gets Perry alone and gives him a USB stick that links corrupt British politicians and businessmen to the Russian mafia. He fears for his life after hearing of his fellow oligarch's fate, and pleads with Perry to turn the USB stick over to MI6 when he returns to London. Perry turns the information over to MI6 agent Hector, the investigator in charge. The information provided by Dima enables Hector and his supervisor Billy to witness a meeting between the Prince and corrupt politician Aubrey Longrigg. Billy refuses to sanction an investigation on a chance meeting. Hector continues regardless and recruits the MacKendricks to help stage a chance encounter with Dima in France. There, Dima provides all the names of his clients and confirms each banker and politician involved has received £5 million each for their endorsement of the new bank, with Longrigg receiving £30 million. Dima refuses to provide the bank account numbers that would verify the corruption until he and his family have been granted asylum in London.

Solve 1491*q - 117458 = -1600*q for q.","completion":"Alright, let's solve this equation step by step, like we're helping a five-year-old. 1. We have the equation: 1491 * q - 117458 = -1600 * q. 2. We need to solve for q, which means we need to get q all by itself on one side of the equation. 3. First, let's add 1600*q to both sides of the equation to get all the q terms together. This looks like: 1491 * q - 117458 + 1600 * q = -1600 * q + 1600 * q 4. Now, when we add the q terms together, we get: (1491 + 1600) * q - 117458 = 0 3091 * q - 117458 = 0 5. Next, let's add 117458 to both sides of the equation: 3091 * q - 117458 + 117458 = 0 + 117458 3091 * q = 117458 6. Finally, in order to find out what q is, let's divide both sides of the equation by 3091: q = 117458 / 3091 7. When we do the division, we find that q equals 38. So the solution to the equation is q = 38."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer.

Context: The frenetic lifestyle that many people live today is very harmful. Rushing here and there, being constantly on call, balancing multiple layers of responsibility may give you a sense of accomplishment – even make you feel important, but it takes a huge toll on every aspect of life. When you constantly push yourself to take on more and more challenges, it is easy to lose sight of why you wanted to be successful in the first place. For many, the reason was to be able to spend less time working and enjoy life more. A frenetic, high-pressure lifestyle creates exactly the opposite. There is a very dark side to constantly pushing yourself to produce more and more. Unfortunately, it creeps up on you and becomes a serious case of self-negligence. When you are busy and driven every minute of every day and well into the evening, it is easy to neglect important things in life that keep you healthy, happy, and create quality of life. A continual stream of urgent tasks that must be completed will overshadow the not-so-urgent, but important activities that make life worth living. It is not just physical well-being that is neglected – mental and emotional well-being also suffer when there is no time for self-care. When your daily schedule is crammed to overflowing one of the first areas of neglect is your diet. Eating regular, nutritious meals become a thing of the past. You are not only too busy to sleep or even take a deep breath now and then, there is no time to prepare decent meals Convenience foods, frozen dinners, take out and fast foods become the norm.

If you need an insightful summary of everything that been wrong with the history of human civilization as well as a flawless path to brighter future for mankind, who better to turn to than a comedian and practitioner of pop culture? If you need a healthy dose of all the solid, sound reasons why religion has outlived it's usefulness then turn to Sagan or Dawkins, not BILL MAHER for God's(?) sake! That's a good point in and of itself. Maher dismisses our religious past as a neurological disorder conveniently ignoring how his entire society, art and science is rooted in it. In this film, he relies heavily on his keenly-honed skill set of irony and cynicism to make his point while attempting to appear erudite and wise. Unfortunately, his intellect isn't up to the task. Maher makes us laugh but is clearly not the brightest bulb in the box. As an example, he responds to an interviewee's (and I use the term loosely as they were clearly all \\"ambushees\\") assertion that the existence of Jesus is historical fact with a deadpan \\"No, it's not\\" followed by a long stare meant to convey contempt at the subject's naivety (a device nauseatingly overused in this film). The problem is that the person was correct and Maher dead wrong in his assertion that Jesus is mentioned only in what he considers to be the historically- suspect gospels. I guess Mr. Maher has never read the contemporary historian Josephus. But the masses will flock to this pseudo-documentary as they do the fictional works of other intellectual giants like Michael Moore, and they will loudly bray and guffaw (they certainly did at my showing). It's doubly telling, however, that the loudest and most mule-like braying occurred during the approximately 70% of the running time that the film devoted to it's anti-Christian tirade while the audience was wholly mute during the token 10% devoted to criticizing the self-described Religion of Peace. Hmmm. Either criticism of Islam is off-limits to the hip and liberal target audience or they were just afraid to laugh. Very telling, either way.. Now, what is this review like? Pick from: 1. negative; 2. positive;","completion":"This review can be characterized as negative. The reviewer criticizes the film for relying on Maher's comedic skills and irony rather than deeper intellectual arguments. The reviewer points out factual inaccuracies in Maher's statements and disapproves of the heavily-targeted critique of Christianity while giving less attention to Islam in the movie. The reviewer also highlights the biased nature of the audience's reaction, finding it hypocritical and indicative of a wider issue with the perception and criticism of different religions. Throughout the review, there is a consistent tone of disapproval and disappointment with both the film's content, Maher's intellectual ability, and the audience's reception of the movie."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: The Lead with Jake Tapper draws not only on Tapper’s deep knowledge of politics and national issues, but also seeks to examine and advance stories across a wide range of topics that demonstrate his own curiosities and interests. Compelling headlines come from around the country and the globe, from politics to money, sports to popular culture, based on news drivers of the day. The Lead with Jake Tapper airs weekdays at 4 p.m. ET. ||||| It was a catchy political pitch and a chance to calm nerves about his dramatic and complicated plan to bring historic change to America’s health insurance system. \\"If you like your health care plan, you can keep it,\\" President Barack Obama said -- many times -- of his landmark new law. But the promise was impossible to keep. So this fall, as cancellation letters were going out to approximately 4 million Americans, the public realized Obama’s breezy assurances were wrong. Boiling down the complicated health care law to a soundbite proved treacherous, even for its promoter-in-chief. Obama and his team made matters worse, suggesting they had been misunderstood all along. The stunning political uproar led to this: a rare presidential apology. For all of these reasons, PolitiFact has named \\"If you like your health care plan, you can keep it,\\" the Lie of the Year for 2013. Readers in a separate online poll overwhelmingly agreed with the choice. (PolitiFact first announced its selection on CNN's The Lead with Jake Tapper.) For four of the past five years, PolitiFact’s Lie of the Year has revolved around the health care law, which has been subject to more erroneous attacks than any other piece of legislation PolitiFact has fact-checked. Obama’s ideas on health care were first offered as general outlines then grew into specific legislation over the course of his presidency. Yet Obama never adjusted his rhetoric to give people a more accurate sense of the law’s real-world repercussions, even as fact-checkers flagged his statements as exaggerated at best. Instead, he fought back against inaccurate attacks with his own oversimplifications, which he repeated even as it became clear his promise was too sweeping. The debate about the health care law rages on, but friends and foes of Obamacare have found one slice of common ground: The president’s \\"you can keep it\\" claim has been a real hit to his credibility. Why the cancellations happened How did we get to this point? The Affordable Care Act tried to allow existing health plans to continue under a complicated process called \\"grandfathering,\\" which basically said insurance companies could keep selling plans if they followed certain rules. The problem for insurers was that the Obamacare rules were strict. If the plans deviated even a little, they would lose their grandfathered status. In practice, that meant insurers canceled plans that didn’t meet new standards. Obama’s team seemed to understand that likelihood. U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius announced the grandfathering rules in June 2010 and acknowledged that some plans would go away. Yet Obama repeated \\"if you like your health care plan, you can keep it\\" when seeking re-election last year. In 2009 and again in 2012 , PolitiFact rated Obama’s statement Half True, which means the statement is partially correct and partially wrong. We noted that while the law took pains to leave some parts of the insurance market alone, people were not guaranteed to keep insurance through thick and thin. It was likely that some private insurers would continue to force people to switch plans, and that trend might even accelerate. In the final months of 2013, several critical elements of the health care law were being enacted, and media attention was at its height. Healthcare.gov made its debut on Oct. 1. It didn’t take long for the media, the public and Obama’s own team to realize the website was a technological mess, freezing out customers and generally not working. Also on Oct. 1, insurers started sending out cancellation letters for 2014. No one knows exactly how many people got notices, because the health insurance market is largely private and highly fragmented. Analysts estimated the number at about 4 million (and potentially higher), out of a total insured population of about 262 million. That was less than 2 percent, but there was no shortage of powerful anecdotes about canceled coverage. One example: PBS Newshour interviewed a woman from Washington, D.C., who was a supporter of the health care law and found her policy canceled. New policies had significantly higher rates. She told Newshour that the only thing the new policy covered that her old one didn’t was maternity care and pediatric services. And she was 58. \\"The chance of me having a child at this age is zero. So, you know, I ask the president, why do I have to pay an additional 5,000 a year for maternity coverage that I will never, ever need?\\" asked Deborah Persico. The administration’s botched response Initially, Obama and his team didn’t budge. First, they tried to shift blame to insurers. \\"FACT: Nothing in #Obamacare forces people out of their health plans,\\" said Valerie Jarrett, a top adviser to Obama, on Oct. 28. PolitiFact rated her statement False . The restrictions on grandfathering were part of the law, and they were driving cancellations. Then, they tried to change the subject. \\"It’s important to remember both before the ACA was ever even a gleam in anybody’s eye, let alone passed into law, that insurance companies were doing this all the time, especially in the individual market because it was lightly regulated and the incentives were so skewed,\\" said White House Press Secretary Jay Carney. But what really set everyone off was when Obama tried to rewrite his slogan, telling political supporters on Nov. 4, \\"Now, if you have or had one of these plans before the Affordable Care Act came into law, and you really liked that plan, what we said was you can keep it if it hasn’t changed since the law passed.\\" Pants on Fire ! PolitiFact counted 37 times when he’d included no caveats, such as a high-profile speech to the American Medical Association in 2009: \\"If you like your health care plan, you'll be able to keep your health care plan, period. No one will take it away, no matter what.\\" Even Obama’s staunchest allies cried foul. On Nov. 6, columnist Clarence Page of the Chicago Tribune wrote that the public \\"was entitled to hear the unvarnished truth, not spin, from their president about what they were about to face. I don't feel good about calling out Obama's whopper, because I support most of his policies and programs. But in this instance, he would have to be delusional to think he was telling the truth.\\" The next day, Obama apologized during a lengthy interview with NBC News’ Chuck Todd. \\"We weren’t as clear as we needed to be in terms of the changes that were taking place, and I want to do everything we can to make sure that people are finding themselves in a good position, a better position than they were before this law happened. And I am sorry that they are finding themselves in this situation based on assurances they got from me,\\" he said. Political fist-fight The reaction from conservative talk shows was withering. On Nov. 11, Sean Hannity put Obama’s statements up there with President Richard Nixon’s \\"I am not a crook,\\" and President Bill Clinton’s \\"I did not have sexual relations with that woman.\\" On the liberal network MSNBC, Joy-Ann Reid said the Obama administration’s intention was to fight off attacks like the ones that scuttled Clinton’s health proposals in the early 1990s. \\"That’s why the administration boiled it down to that, if you like your health care, you can keep it. Big mistake, but it was a mistake that I think came a little bit out of the lesson\\" of the Clinton years, she said Nov. 12. Two days later, House minority leader Nancy Pelosi defended Obama’s statement as accurate and blamed insurance companies. \\"Did I ever tell my constituents that, if they like their plan, they could keep it? I would have, if I'd ever met anybody who liked his or her plan, but that was not my experience,\\" she said. Obama offered an administrative fix that same day, allowing state insurance commissioners to extend current plans. But only some have chosen to do so. In announcing the fix, Obama again conceded he had exaggerated. \\"There is no doubt that the way I put that forward unequivocally ended up not being accurate,\\" he said. \\"It was not because of my intention not to deliver on that commitment and that promise. We put a grandfather clause into the law, but it was insufficient.\\" It is too soon to say what the lasting impact of \\"if you like your health care plan, you can keep it\\" will be. The president’s favorability ratings have tumbled in recent weeks. A Pew Research/USA Today poll conducted Dec. 3-8 found the percentage of people viewing Obama as \\"not trustworthy\\" has risen 15 points over the course of the year, from 30 percent to 45 percent. Much depends on the law’s continuing implementation and other events during Obama’s final three years in office, said Larry Sabato, a political scientist who runs the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia. Still, Obama has work to do to win back public trust, Sabato said. \\"A whole series of presidents developed credibility gaps, because people didn’t trust what they were saying anymore. And that’s Obama’s real problem,\\" he said. \\"Once you lose the trust of a substantial part of the American public, how do you get it back?\\" |||||Summary:","completion":"The article discusses the political fallout from President Obama's declaration that \\"If you like your health care plan, you can keep it.\\" This statement was made numerous times during his campaign and after the implementation of the Affordable Care Act. However, it became apparent that the promise was impossible to keep, as cancellation letters were sent out to approximately 4 million Americans. This led to a rare presidential apology and PolitiFact naming the statement the \\"Lie of the Year\\" for 2013. The Affordable Care Act aimed to allow existing health plans to continue under a complicated process called \\"grandfathering.\\" However, the stringent rules set by Obamacare meant that plans that deviated even slightly from the new standards lost their grandfathered status, resulting in insurers canceling plans that did not comply. Despite being aware of this possibility, President Obama continued to insist that individuals could keep their existing health care plans. As the health care law continued to be enacted in the final months of 2013, attention turned to the malfunctioning Healthcare.gov website and the significant number of policy cancellations. The consequences were widespread and led to a damaged reputation for the Obama administration. The administration's response to the failed promise was initially to shift blame to insurers and deflect the issue. However, as pressure mounted, President Obama eventually apologized for the confusion and admitted to the inaccuracy of his previous statements. The lasting impact of the \\"If you like your health care plan, you can keep it\\" statement remains to be seen, but President Obama's favorability ratings have decreased significantly. The challenge lies in regaining the trust of the American public over the course of his remaining time in office."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The only one who questions the family's sheltered life is his teenaged daughter Eep, who frequently disobeys her father's orders out of curiosity, which he finds dangerous. Grug and Eep, along with her mother and his wife Ugga, her grandmother Gran, and her younger brother and sister, Thunk and Sandy, face time sheltered in their cave home. Eep sneaks out when she sees what she discovers to be a torch of fire, and she encounters an inventive modern human boy named Guy and his pet sloth Belt. He warns her of an impending apocalypse and offers to take her with him, but concerned for her family, Eep stays, getting a shell horn from him to blow in case she needs his help. Reuniting with her frantic family, she tries to tell them what Guy told her, but fearing things that are \\"different\\" and \\"new\\", they destroy her horn. A massive earthquake then destroys their home, and to avoid carnivores and omnivores, they descend down into a tropical forest that lay hidden behind their cave all the time.

Using another horn, Eep calls to Guy who rescues them from the birds with his fire. After a great deal of confusion regarding their first contact with fire, Grug imprisons Guy in a log until he can guide them somewhere safe. Guy suggests the Croods go to a mountain where there are caves because the Crood family desires a cave. Grug refuses at first, but he decides to go with the promise of a cave.

One such player is Brazilian midfielder Willian Borges da Silva, better known as Willian. With an impressive 56 appearances for Chelsea, he stands as a shining example of perseverance and dedication. Despite having scored just five goals during his time at the club, Willian is eager to contribute even more and develop as an essential piece in the Chelsea puzzle. This article delves into the Brazilian's hunger for growth and improvement, along with the unique energetic vibe he brings to his team. The Drive to Score More Goals Willian's current goal tally at Chelsea, although not staggering, has shown glimpses of the talent that the winger possesses. However, he candidly admits that he is desperate to find the net more often, which is a testament to his yearning for self-improvement and his awareness of his responsibility towards the team. This hunger is not only a part of his personal growth as a footballer but also contributes to the realization that every goal he scores brings his team closer to victory and possibly more silverware for the club. Jose Mourinho's Words of Encouragement Knowing the potential that Willian carries, Chelsea's former manager Jose Mourinho never hesitated to voice his belief in the Brazilian's capabilities. The conversations between the two revealed the strong bond between them, and Mourinho's expertise in extracting the best from his players is widely regarded. With the Portuguese coach's guidance and motivation, Willian's drive to score more goals received a significant boost, with the midfielder gaining confidence and determination to unleash his full potential on the pitch. The Power of Positivity and Good Vibes While Willian's dedication to improving himself as a footballer undoubtedly pushes him towards success, his insistence on maintaining a positive attitude both on and off the field sets him apart from many of his peers. The Brazilian states that he always aims to be happy and share good vibes with those around him. This infectious positivity not only lifts his own personal morale but also creates a healthy and uplifted team atmosphere. By fostering an environment where players can share their happiness, Willian promotes camaraderie among his teammates, which in turn enhances the collective performance of the squad. Moreover, it opens up channels for open communication and boosts the morale of the players, which is essential for the success of any team. Conclusion Willian's journey at Chelsea so far has showcased the Brazilian's commitment to growth, both as a player and as a teammate. His willingness to contribute more goals to the team's success, driven by the guidance of his former mentor, Jose Mourinho, reflects his unyielding desire to push the boundaries of his capabilities. Coupled with the positive energy and good vibes that he brings to the dressing room, Willian motivates those around him to strive for the same excellence. As Chelsea moves ahead, Willian's ambition to score more goals and his ability to foster a positive team culture make him an invaluable asset. By persistently working towards cultivating these qualities, the Brazilian midfielder is set on leaving an indelible mark on the club's history, both on the field and behind the scenes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Venus's clouds are a lot less pleasant. They are made of carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide and large amounts of corrosive sulfuric acid! The atmosphere of Venus is so thick that the pressure on the surface of Venus is very high. In fact, it is 90 times greater than the pressure at Earth’s surface! The thick atmosphere causes a strong greenhouse effect. As a result, Venus is the hottest planet. Even though it is farther from the Sun, Venus is much hotter even than Mercury.

They sought to create a citizenry (frequently including women) able to speak and write with eloquence and clarity and thus capable of engaging the civic life of their communities and persuading others to virtuous and prudent actions. This was to be accomplished through the study of the studia humanitatis, today known as the humanities: grammar, rhetoric, history, poetry and moral philosophy.

Context: In the Vietnam air war radar missile kill reliability was approximately 10% at shorter ranges, and even worse at longer ranges due to reduced radar return and greater time for the target aircraft to detect the incoming missile and take evasive action. At one point in the Vietnam war, the U.S. Navy fired 50 AIM-7 Sparrow radar guided missiles in a row without a hit. Between 1958 and 1982 in five wars there were 2,014 combined heat-seeking and radar guided missile firings by fighter pilots engaged in air-to-air combat, achieving 528 kills, of which 76 were radar missile kills, for a combined effectiveness of 26%. However, only four of the 76 radar missile kills were in the beyond-visual-range mode intended to be the strength of radar guided missiles. The United States invested over 10 billion in air-to-air radar missile technology from the 1950s to the early 1970s. Amortized over actual kills achieved by the U.S. and its allies, each radar guided missile kill thus cost over 130 million. The defeated enemy aircraft were for the most part older MiG-17s, -19s, and -21s, with new cost of 0.3 million to 3 million each. Thus, the radar missile investment over that period far exceeded the value of enemy aircraft destroyed, and furthermore had very little of the intended BVR effectiveness. Question: Which were radar missile kills more reliable in Vietnam, shorter ranges or longer ranges? Answer:","completion":"In the Vietnam air war, radar missile kills were more reliable at shorter ranges as compared to longer ranges. The kill reliability of radar-guided missiles was approximately 10% at shorter ranges. However, at longer ranges, the reliability was even worse due to reduced radar return and greater time for the target aircraft to detect the incoming missile and take evasive action. This lower reliability at longer ranges hampered the intended advantage of Beyond-Visual-Range (BVR) effectiveness of radar-guided missiles. There were multiple factors contributing to the lower reliability at longer ranges, including technological limitations, countermeasures employed by enemy aircraft, and the inherent challenges in acquiring and maintaining a lock on the target at greater distances. All these combined, making radar-guided missiles less effective and reliable at beyond-visual-range engagements during the Vietnam air war. As a result, most of the radar missile kills during this period were achieved at shorter ranges as opposed to the longer ranges that these missiles were initially designed for."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In the end, credits that are heavily laced with references to moose, llamas and other furry animals roll to highly festive Latin music.Little is to be seen but fog over a grassland while the sound of a galloping horsea sound that could only be made on cobblestone, but not grassis heard. From the fog emerge two pedestrians: King Arthur (Graham Chapman), dressed in chain mail, a tunic and a crown; and Patsy (Terry Gilliam), who appears to be fulfilling the role of beast of burden, and is using two half-coconuts percussively.They approach a castle and Patsy perfectly mimics the sound of a galloping horse coming to a stop. Two guards become barely visible atop the castle wall. Arthur announces that he is looking for knights to join him at Camelot, and wishes to recruit the master of the castle. Unfortunately, the two guards are immediately distracted by Patsy's half-coconuts. Arthur tries to return the conversation to the quest, but the guards are unable to turn their attentions from the possible causes for coconuts appearing in Mercia (England), as Arthur claims that they found them there, or how a bird, or a set of birds, might have brought one up from the tropics. Frustrated, Arthur and Patsy emulate riding off.The scene changes to a plague village.

(I) negative (II) positiveWould the following phrase be considered positive or negative? flat-out amusing , sometimes endearing and often fabulous , with a solid cast , noteworthy characters , delicious dialogue and a wide supply of effective sight gags .","completion":"The phrase given can be considered positive. The first point to note that indicates the positivity of the phrase is the use of the term \\"flat-out amusing\\". This indicates that the speaker found the subject at hand to be unequivocally funny or entertaining, invoking a positive response. The term \\"flat-out\\" signifies that something is fully or completely as described, emphasizing the speaker's pleasure in the subject’s amusement factor. The phrase \\"sometimes endearing\\" also indicates a positive sentiment, although it carries a suggestion of intermittency. The term \\"endearing\\" carries a deeply positive connotation, associating the subject with affection or fondness. However, the word \\"sometimes\\" may indicate that these feelings are not consistent, but overall, it still adds to the positive aura of the sentiment. The term \\"often fabulous\\" directly adds to the overall positive outlook of the phrase. \\"Fabulous\\" is a term of high praise implying that the subject is extraordinary or amazing. Used in conjunction with the word \\"often,\\" it implies a consistent level of positivity regarding the subject. The phrase \\"with a solid cast\\" exudes positivity by suggesting that the individuals or characters involved in the subject are reliable or competent. \\"Solid\\" suggests substance and quality, which is a positive attribute in any setting. The term \\"noteworthy characters\\" adds to the positive sentiment as \\"noteworthy\\" implies that the characters are worthy of attention or memorable. The term \\"delicious dialogue\\" suggests that the conversations or spoken elements are rich, intriguing, and enjoyable - another positive aspect. Finally, \\"a wide supply of effective sight gags\\" indicates a large amount of visually humorous content that works effectively. This is certainly a positive point if one were reviewing a play, movie, or TV show, as sight gags often contribute towards the entertainment value of these mediums. Therefore, altogether, the phrase exudes positivity. It carries an overwhelmingly positive sentiment towards the subject, signaling that the observer found enjoyment, humor, and high quality in the subject being discussed."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

As Philip marched south, his opponents blocked him near Chaeronea, Boeotia. During the ensuing Battle of Chaeronea, Philip commanded the right wing and Alexander the left, accompanied by a group of Philip's trusted generals. According to the ancient sources, the two sides fought bitterly for some time. Philip deliberately commanded his troops to retreat, counting on the untested Athenian hoplites to follow, thus breaking their line. Alexander was the first to break the Theban lines, followed by Philip's generals. Having damaged the enemy's cohesion, Philip ordered his troops to press forward and quickly routed them. With the Athenians lost, the Thebans were surrounded. Left to fight alone, they were defeated. After the victory at Chaeronea, Philip and Alexander marched unopposed into the Peloponnese, welcomed by all cities; however, when they reached Sparta, they were refused, but did not resort to war. At Corinth, Philip established a \\"Hellenic Alliance\\" (modeled on the old anti-Persian alliance of the Greco-Persian Wars), which included most Greek city-states except Sparta.

Fortunately, there are devices such as Geiger counters that can detect radiation. A Geiger counter, like the one pictured in the Figure below , contains atoms of a gas that is ionized if it encounters radiation. When this happens, the gas atoms change to ions that can carry an electric current. The current causes the Geiger counter to click. The faster the clicks occur, the higher the level of radiation. You can see a video about the Geiger counter and how it was invented at the URL below. I am facing a new situation today: Keith landed a job with the EPA. As part of his training he needed to learn how the Geiger counter works. To learn more about the counter he tested it in three different locations, location A, location B, and location C. Location A had very high radiation; location B had low radiation; and location C didn't have any radiation. Keith learned how the counter works in locations with varying degrees of radiation.

It is much more dramatic than what happens between you and the door knocker, but it is the same principle. You can see how it occurs in the following diagram and animation. You have no doubt seen lightning in a rainstorm. What does lighting have to do with static electricity? As it turns out, everything! During a rainstorm, clouds develop regions of different charges. This happens due to the movement of air molecules, water drops, and ice particles. The negative charges are concentrated at the base of the clouds. The positive charges are concentrated at the top. The negative charges repel electrons on the ground below. The ground then becomes positively charged. Over time the differences increase. Eventually the electrons are discharged. This is what we see as lightning. You can watch an awesome slow-motion lightning strike below. Question: \\"How do clouds develop different regions of charges?\\" Answer: \\"Because of motion present in air molecules, water drops, and ice particles\\" Is this answer to the question correct?","completion":"Yes, the answer is correct. Clouds develop different regions of charges due to the movement of air molecules, water drops, and ice particles.

The two areas were named after the Old English \\"wella\\", or spring. A farmhouse has stood at Gilwell Farm ever since. Around this time, an adjoining 5.6 hectares (14 acres) property was purchased by Richard Osborne. In 1442, he built a large dwelling called Osborne Hall, which stood for 300 years. Legend has it that in the early 16th century, King Henry VIII owned the land and built a hunting lodge for his son Edward. Around 1736 the highwayman Dick Turpin began using Gilwell's forests to conceal himself and for ambushing travellers and freight along roads leading into London.In 1754, William Skrimshire purchased Great Gilwell, Little Gilwell, and half of Osborne's estate, including Osborne Hall. Skrimshire demolished Osborne Hall and built a new residence, which he also called Osborne Hall. That building is now called the White House. Timbers in the White House can be dated to this time, but not to any previous era. Leonard Tresilian (?–1792) bought the estate in 1771 and expanded the land holdings and size of the residence. Tresilian's first wife, Margaret Holland, died young after bearing three daughters. He then married Elizabeth Fawson. Desiring that Gilwell pass on to his eldest daughter, also named Margaret (1750 – c.1844), Tresilian drew up a detailed prenuptial agreement with Fawson's father. By the time of Tresilian's death in 1792, the younger Margaret had married William Bassett Chinnery (1766–1834), the elder brother of the painter George Chinnery.

He is primarily known for his tenure as Music Director of the Metropolitan Opera (the \\"Met\\"), a position he held for 40 years (1976-2016). He was formally terminated by the Met from all his positions and affiliations with the company on March 12, 2018 over sexual misconduct allegations which he denies. Levine was born in Cincinnati, Ohio, to a Jewish, musical family. His maternal grandfather was a composer and a cantor in a synagogue, his father (Lawrence) was a violinist who led dance bands under the name \\"Larry Lee\\" before entering his father's clothing business, and his mother (Helen Goldstein Levine) was briefly an actress on Broadway, performing as \\"Helen Golden\\". He has a brother Tom who is two years younger, who followed him to New York City from Cincinnati in 1974, and with whom he is very close. He employs Tom as his business assistant (looking after all of his affairs, arranging his rehearsal schedules, fielding queries, scouting out where he will live, meeting with accountants, and accompanying Levine on trips to Europe), and his brother is a painter as well. He also has a younger sister, Janet, who is a marriage counselor. He began to play the piano as a small child. On February 21, 1954, at the age of 10, Levine made his concert debut as soloist playing Felix Mendelssohn's Piano Concerto No. 2 at a youth concert of the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra in Ohio. Levine subsequently studied music with Walter Levin, first violinist in the LaSalle Quartet. In 1956 he took piano lessons with Rudolf Serkin at the Marlboro Music School, in Vermont. In the following year he began to study piano with Rosina Lhevinne at the Aspen Music School. He graduated from Walnut Hills High School, an acclaimed magnet school in Cincinnati. He entered the Juilliard School of Music in New York City in 1961, and took courses in conducting with Jean Morel.

The holiday crush this year is estimated to be even heavier than before. Government officials suggest that Chinese people will take to the air, roads and railways 3.62 billion times over a 40-day period around the nation's most important holiday this year as people push their way home for family gatherings or to satisfy their new-found passion for travel. Getting tickets to all those would-be travelers is a _ challenge that tries your patience annually. And the pressure for the railway system is always the greatest. Railways are the transport of choice for low-cost long-distance travel, and that's where the ticketing system regularly falls down. Much of the criticism has focused on the railway's online purchasing system, which has been unable to keep pace with the huge demand and also failed to stop scalpers from easily getting many of the hard-to-find tickets. Railway officials believed that online sales were the fairest way to get tickets for travelers, and told reporters that the public need to be patient. While by now the railway service is far from satisfying, efforts are being made to provide online identity checks that would reduce the ticket scalping problems, and the situation is expected to get better in a few years. Meanwhile, for those traveling by car, good news is that the country's extremely expensive highway tolls will be removed for the period of the official holiday.

British Education Minister Elizabeth Truss is to lead a delegation of experts on a fact-finding mission to Shanghai's schools next week to see how children there have become the best in the world at maths, to get a first-hand look at maths classes and teaching methods there, and particularly to investigate why the performance of almost all children in Shanghai is high, regardless of gender or income. Britain was last year placed 50th out of 148 countries and regions in the World Economic Forum's competitiveness ranking in quality of maths and science education. Two years ago, Shanghai topped the 2012 international PISA tables for maths, while England was ranked in 26th place.

It aimed to address issues related to naval disarmament, reduce global tensions post-World War I, and prevent the outbreak of another major conflict. The main nations involved in the Washington Naval Conference were the United States, Great Britain, Japan, France, and Italy. In addition to the primary participants, other countries also joined as observers or sent representatives during the conference. 1. United States: As the host country, the U.S. played a primary role in organizing the conference. President Warren G. Harding and Secretary of State Charles Evans Hughes led the American delegation. The U.S. aimed to achieve disarmament of naval forces, particularly among its major naval rivals like Great Britain and Japan, which would reduce potential threats in the Pacific while cutting defense costs. 2. Great Britain: The British delegation was led by Prime Minister David Lloyd George and Arthur J. Balfour, the British Foreign Secretary. The British Empire, being a global maritime power, had a vested interest in maintaining a strong naval presence worldwide. However, Great Britain was also financially burdened after World War I, which led to their willingness to negotiate naval disarmament and reduce military expenditure. 3. Japan: The Japanese delegation was led by Prince Tokugawa, Baron Kato Komei (the Japanese Minister of Foreign Affairs), and Admiral Saito Makoto. Japan aimed to secure naval parity with the United States and Great Britain and ensure its national security in the Pacific region. The recognition of Japan's territorial possessions in the Pacific and its commitment to the Open Door Policy in China were also crucial concerns for the Japanese government. 4. France: The French delegation was headed by the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Aristide Briand, and French Ambassador to the United States, Jules Jusserand. France, being a continental power focused mainly on its terrestrial borders, sought to protect its colonial interests and maintain a naval presence in the Mediterranean and the North Atlantic Ocean. 5. Italy: The Italian delegation was led by Carlo Schanzer, the Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs, and Italian Ambassador to the United States, Vittorio Rolandi-Ricci. Italy sought to maintain a strong naval presence in the Mediterranean, which was vital to the country's national security and colonial interests. Several other countries participated in the conference in varying capacities. Belgium, the Netherlands, Portugal, and China attended as observers, while Spain, Brazil, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Dominican Republic, Greece, Guatemala, Haiti, and Poland sent representatives who participated in some discussions related to their respective interests. The conference resulted in several landmark treaties, the most notable being the Five Power Naval Limitation Treaty (signed by the United States, Great Britain, Japan, France, and Italy), which limited the naval capacities of the participating nations. Further, the Four-Power Treaty (signed by the United States, Great Britain, Japan, and France) aimed to maintain the status quo in the Pacific, and the Nine-Power Treaty (signed by the United States, Great Britain, Japan, France, Italy, China, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Portugal) reaffirmed the Open Door Policy in China. While the Washington Naval Conference did achieve some short-term success in slowing the naval arms race, its long-term effectiveness in preventing conflicts was limited due to various issues, including the rise of new regional tensions and economic downturns."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Hint: Enzymes increase the rate of chemical reactions by reducing the amount of activation energy needed for reactants to start reacting. One way this can happen is modeled in the Figure below . Enzymes aren’t changed or used up in the reactions they catalyze, so they can be used to speed up the same reaction over and over again. Each enzyme is highly specific for the particular reaction is catalyzes, so enzymes are very effective. A reaction that would take many years to occur without its enzyme might occur in a split second with the enzyme. Enzymes are also very efficient, so waste products rarely form.","completion":"Given the information provided, the reaction in Trial C, when the enzyme is added, is expected to be faster than the reaction in Trial B. The reason for this is that enzymes are known to increase the rate of chemical reactions by lowering the activation energy needed, making it easier for the reactants to start reacting. Since the enzyme added in Trial C is designed specifically for use with the chemicals in the experiment, it will effectively catalyze the reaction and greatly enhance the reaction speed, even at the more modest temperature of 65 degrees Celsius. As a result, the reaction time in Trial C should be significantly reduced in comparison to Trial B. It is important to note that enzymes are not consumed in the reactions they catalyze, meaning they can repeatedly speed up the same reaction without being used up.

Context: WHITE HOUSE/BROWNSVILLE, TEXAS — A day after U.S. President Donald Trump reversed a policy of separating migrant families at the U.S.-Mexico border, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said there is a plan to reunite the more than 2,000 children who have been detained apart from their parents. \\"We have a plan to do that,\\" the secretary told reporters at an event in Washington Thursday morning. Shortly before she spoke, a VOA reporter at an immigration court hearing in Brownsville, Texas, said prosecutors dropped misdemeanor charges against 17 migrants. The migrants, who were separated from their children remain detained, but dropping the charges could be a means to reunite them and allow the families to be detained as units. David Bier, an Immigration Policy Analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute, said if government prosecutors are dropping criminal charges in similar cases across the immigration court system, it calls into question the Trump Administration's 'Zero Tolerance' policy towards immigration. It's \\"an even more clear signal that the whole purpose of bringing these prosecutions is to separate parents from children and not about enforcing the law.\\" he told VOA. The administration's policy requires that anyone who crosses the border illegally face criminal charges. \\"If it continues to be the case that some of these cases or many of them are dismissed by courts – that should be the end of the policy,\\" Bier added. The moves come as the House of Representatives prepares to vote Thursday on a pair of immigration bills that address the separations, as well as other issues that have divided the country's major political parties. Nielsen repeated her calls for lawmakers to act. \\"I want to be very clear on this.

Follow these steps: 1. Rewrite the equation as it is. 16*y = 94*y + 312 2. To isolate y, you'll want to eliminate y terms from one side of the equation. To do that, subtract 16*y from both sides of the equation. 16*y - 16*y = 94*y - 16*y 3. Simplify both sides. 0 = 78*y + 312 4. Now, you'll need to eliminate the constant term from the right side of the equation. To do that, subtract 312 from both sides. 0 - 312 = 78*y + 312 - 312 5. Simplify both sides. -312 = 78*y 6. Finally, to solve for y, divide by the coefficient of y (78) on both sides. -312 / 78 = 78*y / 78 7.

Gunslinger Sean Lafferty, known as the Montana Kid, has a bounty on his head for killing eleven people across the western United States. He arrives in town on his horse, riding backwards, bound, with a noose around his neck, and dragging the broken tree branch over which a group had tried to hang him on the American side of the border.

To help solve this problem, she co-founded the California Architecture Archives Network (or CalArchNet) with her Cal Poly SLO colleague Jessica Holada. Together they have organized a series of one-day mini-conferences designed to foster dialogue and collaboration among librarians, archivists, and curators at California institutions that house architecture archives. The goal of these semiannual meetings is to create a space for convergence among professionals who intersect with architectural archives in different ways. Architecture archives, often containing large drawings and scale models, present unique problems due to their size and fragility. CalArchNet participants are interested in improving the overall user experience for visitors to the archives by looking for solutions to obstacles to access. This space for an informal exchange of ideas provides an opportunity to be transparent about the challenges repositories face when managing and processing architecture holdings, as well as encourages investigation and experimentation into ways new technologies may help to solve accessibility issues, such as improved interaction with digitized collections via the IIIF protocol or 3D-scanned facsimile models and virtual walk-throughs. October 27 marked the third meeting of CalArchNet, held at the Palm Springs Art Museum, Architecture and Design Center, with representatives from 13 institutions in attendance. Topics discussed included historic site preservation research methodology, leveraging statewide resources to enhance discovery of collections, security considerations, GIS mapping technologies, and the use of linked open data to make connections between collections.

Please answer the following question: Given the background: Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi vary across many environmental gradients. Their tolerance to freezing and drying is known to shift between AM fungal taxa. AM fungi become less prevalent and diverse at higher soil nutrient and moisture concentrations, presumably because both plants allocate less carbon to AM fungi and AM fungi reallocate their resources to intraradical hyphae in these environmental conditions. Over the long term, these environmental conditions can even create local adaptation between plant hosts, AM fungi and the local soil nutrient concentrations. and the situation: Carrie bought two parcels of farmland. The Northern one had soil with lots of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, while the Southern parcel had almost no traces of AM fungi. Answer the following question: Which parcel had a higher soil nutrient content? A:","completion":"Based on the background information provided, it is likely that the Southern parcel had a higher soil nutrient content. This is because arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi become less prevalent and diverse at higher soil nutrient and moisture concentrations. In these conditions, plants allocate less carbon to AM fungi, and AM fungi reallocate their resources to intraradical hyphae. The Northern parcel, with lots of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, would suggest that it has relatively lower soil nutrient content compared to the Southern parcel. This phenomenon of a negative relationship between AM fungi prevalence and soil nutrient content arises due to the symbiotic relationship between plants and AM fungi. In lower nutrient conditions, plants rely more heavily on their partnership with AM fungi to access nutrients such as phosphorus, which the fungi can absorb from the soil more easily through their extensive hyphal networks. In return, the plant provides carbon-based resources to the fungi, thus promoting fungal growth and proliferation. This results in high AM fungi concentrations in the soils with lower nutrient content. As nutrient concentrations in the soil increase, plants can more readily access the nutrients directly, and therefore their reliance on fungi reduces. This reduces the amount of carbon allocated to the fungi, causing a decline in their abundance and diversity. Hence, the Southern parcel, with almost no traces of AM fungi, is likely to have higher soil nutrient content than the Northern parcel, where the fungi are more abundant. Additionally, it is important to note that environmental conditions can be variable, and local adaptation between plant hosts, AM fungi, and local soil nutrient concentrations can occur over time. Therefore, it may be beneficial for Carrie to regularly monitor the nutrient concentrations and mycorrhizal fungal abundance on both parcels to ensure proper soil management for successful agricultural activities."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Eats the gumballs Read the following context and answer the question. Context: Sheila split open and the air was filled with gumballs. Yellow gumballs. This was awful for Stan, just awful. He had loved Sheila for a long time, fought for her heart, believed in their love until finally she had come around. They were about to kiss for the first time and then this: yellow gumballs. Stan went to a group to try to accept that Sheila was gone. It was a group for people whose unrequited love had ended in some kind of surrealist moment. There is a group for everything in California. After several months of hard work on himself with the group, Stan was ready to open a shop and sell the thousands of yellow gumballs. He did this because he believed in capitalism, he loved capitalism. He loved the dynamic surge and crash of Amazon's stock price, he loved the great concrete malls spreading across America like blood staining through a handkerchief, he loved how everything could be tracked and mirrored in numbers. When he closed the store each night he would count the gumballs sold, and he would determine his gross revenue, his operating expenses, his operating margin; he would adjust his balance sheet and learn his debt to equity ratio; and after this exercise each night, Stan felt he understood himself and was at peace, and he could go home to his apartment and drink tea and sleep, without shooting himself or thinking about Sheila. On the night before the IPO of gumballs.com, Sheila came to Stan in a dream. She was standing in a kiddie pool; Stan and his brothers and sisters were running around splashing and screaming; she had managed to insert herself into a Super-8 home movie of Stan's family, shot in the late 70's. She looked terribly sad. \\"Sheila, where are you?\\" Stan said. \\"Why did you leave me, why did you become gumballs?\\" \\"The Ant King has me,\\" Sheila said. \\"You must rescue me.\\" Question: After the story, Stan most likely: Answer: Answer:","completion":"C. Tries to rescue Sheila After several months of attending the support group and operating his gumball store, Stan seemed to be moving on from the surreal event that marked the end of his relationship with Sheila. However, when Sheila appeared in his dream the night before the IPO of gumballs.com, she revealed that she was being held captive by the Ant King and needed to be rescued. This new information, combined with the fact that Stan had loved Sheila for a long time and fought for her heart, strongly suggests that he would most likely attempt to rescue Sheila. Even though Stan had created a seemingly stable life for himself and found solace in running his business, the reappearance of Sheila in his life - even if only in a dream - would likely stir up strong emotions and a sense of responsibility to help her. The fact that he was on the cusp of a significant business accomplishment with the IPO might actually motivate him further, as it could indicate that he had dealt with the loss of Sheila to the point where he was able to move forward and succeed in life. This newfound strength and confidence could make him feel more equipped to face the challenge of rescuing her. Additionally, the very nature of the support group Stan attended implies that its members have struggled to accept the surreal events that marked the end of their relationships. They have worked hard on themselves, presumably striving to find a sense of closure and answers, or at least some semblance of understanding. The dream in which Sheila appeared offered Stan exactly that - it provided context and an opportunity for him to take action, which might be a welcome change from the uncertainty he had been dealing with since the yellow gumballs incident. Moreover, the story emphasizes that there is a group for everything in California, hinting at the possibility that Stan could find a group or supportive network of people who might be willing to embark on this rescue mission with him. This detail further suggests that Stan would not be entirely alone in his attempt to save Sheila. In summary, based on Stan's past love for Sheila, his journey towards healing and self-acceptance, and the revelation of a captor and a potential mission, it is most likely that, after the story, Stan would try to rescue Sheila."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Have you ever sat in front of a campfire? What are two things you notice? The fire creates light. It is also warm by the fire, meaning it creates heat. The energy of the fire comes from the stored energy in the wood. The wood contains chemical energy. As it burns, the chemical energy is changed into light and heat. Not all chemical energy changes produce light and heat. Our cars use gasoline as a fuel. Gasoline contains chemical energy. When our cars burn gasoline in their engines, it is converted into motion and heat. When energy changes forms, energy is conserved.

Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","completion":"Yes, if the premise is true, then it is possible to infer that the hypothesis might also be true. To begin with, let's examine both the premise and hypothesis closely: Premise: \\"Rooms are very chic, with full audio systems.\\" Hypothesis: \\"The rooms themselves are very stylish.\\" In the premise, we are given information that the rooms are chic and possess full audio systems. \\"Chic\\" typically implies that something is elegant, fashionable, or stylish. Therefore, the rooms are depicted as having an aesthetically pleasing design that is also contemporary and trendy. Additionally, they are equipped with comprehensive audio systems, which indicate a functional and possibly upscale aspect to the rooms. Now, let's consider the hypothesis. The hypothesis states that the rooms are very stylish. \\"Stylish\\" may be defined as being fashionable, attractive, tasteful, or, in other words, having a sense of style. Both the premise and hypothesis hinge on the rooms exhibiting a visually appealing appearance and a sense of fashion or elegance. Given the premise as true, stating that the rooms are very chic suggests that they indeed possess a sense of style. This aligns well with the hypothesis that describes the rooms as stylish. In this case, the hypothesis might be considered a plausible conclusion drawn from the given premise, as both share the core idea of the rooms having a fashionable, elegant design. However, it's essential to note that while the hypothesis's likelihood is quite high based on the premise, it isn't a 100% guaranteed truth. The premise suggests that the rooms are very chic, but the hypothesis emphasizes the stylishness without specifically mentioning the full audio systems. Therefore, while the hypothesis likely follows suit if the premise is true, the correlation between the two isn't absolute. To solidify the connection, it would be ideal to include information about the full audio systems in the hypothesis. In conclusion, it is possible to deduce that if the premise is true, then the hypothesis is likely true as well, as they both emphasize the visually appealing and fashionable aspects of the rooms. However, the hypothesis's validity could be further cemented if it also referred to the full audio systems mentioned in the premise."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","completion":"To determine whether the hypothesis can be true if the premise is true, let's examine each statement step by step. Step 1: Analyze the premise The premise states that \\"Jim is such a giving person, so committed to helping those less fortunate.\\" This implies that Jim is generous and willing to help people who need assistance, which suggests that he might give money or other resources to those in need. Step 2: Analyze the hypothesis The hypothesis claims that \\"He was cheap and never gave money to those in need.\\" This statement contradicts the premise, as it asserts that Jim was not a giving person and did not provide financial help to those who needed it. Step 3: Compare the premise and hypothesis When comparing the premise and hypothesis, we can see that they contradict each other. The premise highlights Jim's willingness to help the less fortunate, while the hypothesis claims the opposite – that he was cheap and unwilling to help.

Article: Recently, some concerns have been raised about the health of the world's banana plants. Many media reports have said that bananas may completely disappear in the coming ten years. Bananas are one of the world's most important food crops. They are also the fourth most valuable export. Bananas do not grow from seeds. Instead, they grow from existing plants. Bananas are threatened by disease because all the plants on a farm are copies of each other. They all share the same genetic weaknesses. For example, the Cavendish banana is most popular in American markets. It is an important export crop. However, some kinds of fungus organisms easily infect the Cavendish. Black Sigatoka disease affects the leaves of Cavendish banana plants. The disease is controlled on large farms by putting chemicals on the plant's leaves. Farmers put anti-fungal chemicals on their crops up to once a week. Another fungal disease is more serious. Panama disease attacks the roots of the banana plant. There is no chemical treatment for this disease. Infected plants must be destroyed. Panama disease has affected crops in Southeast Asia, Australia and South Africa. There is concern that it may spread to bananas grown in the Americas. This could threaten an important export product for Central and South America. The International Network for the Improvement of Banana and Plantain, whose headquarter lies in France, supports research on bananas. The group says that more research must be done to develop improved kinds of bananas. The group says that fungal diseases mainly affect only one kind of banana. In fact, there are five-hundred different kinds of bananas. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization says the Cavendish banana represents only ten percent of world production. The UN agency says farmers should grow different kinds of bananas. This protects against diseases that affect only one kind. Experts warn that disease may cause the Cavendish banana to disappear. This has already happened to one popular banana because of its... Question: Panama disease _ . Options: A: doesn't belong to fungal disease. B: has spread to bananas in the world.

The boys have fun reading books while they sit on their comfortable inflatable chairs. Which chair has a higher air pressure? Hint: What does popping bubble wrap have to do with science? Actually, it demonstrates an important scientific law, called Boyle’s law. Like other laws in science, this law describes what always happens under certain conditions. Boyle’s law is one of three well-known gas laws, which state the relationships among temperature, volume, and pressure of gases. (The other two gas laws are Charles’ law and Amontons’ law.) According to Boyle’s law , if the temperature of a gas is held constant, then decreasing the volume of the gas increases its pressure—and vice versa. That’s what happens when you squeeze the bubbles of bubble wrap. You decrease the bubbles' volume, so the air pressure inside the bubbles increases until they pop. The answer to this question is:","completion":"The green chair has a higher air pressure. Since Mark weighs much more than Patrick, his weight causes the volume of the gas in the green chair to decrease, while the temperature remains constant.

When I taught in the traditional classroom, creating self portraits was something I had students do whether they were four or nine. In fact, I’d have them draw one on the first day of school and one toward the end of the year and to see the change over time was always so interesting. At least once during the year, likely toward the beginning, I would center a lesson around self portraits. In younger classes, there would be more than one. Creating a self portrait teaches students to be aware of themselves. Where is her head in relation to her body? Where are her feet in relation to her legs? It also teaches children spatial awareness. Where should he begin…with his feet or with his head? Where on the paper should his head be placed? How far down should his arms go? How can his whole body fit on a single piece of paper? A Lesson on Creating Self Portraits Whether you are in a classroom, or teaching a child at home, here is a simple lesson on creating self portraits geared toward young children, anywhere from age 2 through age 6. Keep in mind that their final product will show various levels of writing development, depending on what stage of writing they are in. (Basically, a two-year-old’s drawing should look very different than that of a five-year-old.) The teacher will need to model how to draw a self portrait. Gather the children around an easel or board and clip a paper to it. Narrate the process as you walk through the steps. “I am going to draw a picture of myself. I am going to start with my head.” Use your hands to show your actual head on yourself so students are aware of what you talking about. The visuals also help English Language Learners (if you’re teaching in an English speaking classroom.) and build vocabulary for all students.

Ask a question about Railway electrification system.","completion":"What are the different types of railway electrification systems, and what are their main characteristics and applications? Railway electrification systems refer to the process of powering railway vehicles, typically locomotives and multiple units, using electricity supplied through an external power infrastructure. This method is preferred over other means of propulsion, like diesel or steam, due to its efficiency, lower maintenance, and reduced environmental impact. There are several electrification systems used worldwide, and they can be categorized based on their voltage and current type. Here, we take a look at some of the main types of railway electrification systems, their characteristics, and applications. 1. Direct Current (DC) Systems: DC systems are characterized by the use of direct current for power supply. The most common DC systems include: a. 600-1000 V DC - This low voltage system is typically used in urban transport systems like trams, light rail, and metro systems. Some examples are the New York City Subway, London Underground, and Hong Kong Tramways. b. 1.5 kV DC - This voltage is common in older suburban and mainline electrification systems. Countries like France, the Netherlands, and Japan have railways with this system, such as the Paris RER, Dutch railway network, and Japan's Shinkansen. c. 3 kV DC - This system is used in several countries in Europe, such as Belgium, Italy, and Poland, as well as in South Africa and Argentina. Notable railways include the Italian State Railways and the Buenos Aires metropolitan network. 2. Alternating Current (AC) Systems: AC systems employ the use of alternating current for power supply. The most common AC systems are: a. 15 kV AC, 16.7 Hz - This frequency is employed mainly in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, and other neighboring countries. Railways that use this system are the German DB and the Austrian OBB. The 16.7 Hz frequency is generated by converting standard 50 Hz AC to the required 16.7 Hz using frequency converters. b. 25 kV AC, 50 Hz / 60 Hz - This system has become the most widely adopted standard worldwide due to its high efficiency and ability to support higher-speed operations. It is used on high-speed rail networks such as the French TGV, the UK's High-Speed 1, Spain's AVE, and the Chinese HSR. The frequency of 50 Hz or 60 Hz is the same as the power grid standard in each country. c. 11 kV AC, 25 Hz - This type of system was adopted earlier in the 20th century and is still used in some regions. Examples include Amtrak's Northeast Corridor in the United States and some lines on the Argentine railway network. 3. Composite Systems: Some railway networks use a combination of different electrification systems on different lines. An example is India, where the mainline electrification system is 25 kV AC, 50 Hz, while several urban rail systems such as the Kolkata Metro and Delhi Metro use 750 V DC. In conclusion, railway electrification systems can vary greatly depending on the voltage and current type used, with each system having its unique characteristics and applications. The choice of the electrification system depends on factors such as energy efficiency, the availability of power infrastructure, the speed and capacity requirements, and the compatibility with surrounding railway systems. With the growing emphasis on sustainable transport, railway electrification is expected to remain a crucial aspect of modern rail infrastructure development."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Article: One of the most widely accepted, commonly repeated assumptions in our culture is that if you exercise, you will lose weight. I exercise all the time, but I still have gut fat that hangs over my belt when I sit. Why isn't all the exercise getting rid of it? It's a question many of us could ask. More than 45 million Americans now belong to a health club, up from 23 million in 1993. We spend some 19 billion a year on gym memberships. Of course, some people join and never go. Still, as one major study -- the Minnesota Heart Survey -- found, more of us at least say we exercise regularly. And yet obesity figures have risen sharply in the same period: a third of Americans are obese, and another third count as overweight by the Federal Government's definition. Yes, it's entirely possible that those of us who regularly go to the gym would weigh even more if we exercised less. But like many other people, I get hungry after I exercise, so I often eat more on the days I work out than on the days I don't. Could exercise actually be keeping me from losing weight? The popular belief that exercise is essential for weight control is actually fairly new. As recently as the 1960s, doctors routinely advised against too much exercise, particularly for older adults who could injure themselves. Today doctors encourage even their oldest patients to exercise, which is sound advice for many reasons: People who regularly exercise are at significantly lower risk for all manner of diseases -- those of the heart in particular. They less often develop cancer and many other illnesses. But the past few years of obesity research show that the role of exercise in weight loss has been wildly over-evaluated. \\"In general, for weight loss, exercise is pretty useless,\\" says Eric Ravussin, exercise researcher at Louisiana State University. Many recent studies have found that exercise isn't as important in helping people lose weight as you hear so regularly in gym advertisements or on shows likeThe Biggest Loser -- or, for that matter, from...

Question: What was the density of particulate matter in the air a day after smog had entered Central and Eastern parts of China? Context: A dense wave of smog began in the Central and Eastern part of China on 2 December 2013 across a distance of around 1,200 kilometres (750 mi), including Tianjin, Hebei, Shandong, Jiangsu, Anhui, Shanghai and Zhejiang. A lack of cold air flow, combined with slow-moving air masses carrying industrial emissions, collected airborne pollutants to form a thick layer of smog over the region. The heavy smog heavily polluted central and southern Jiangsu Province, especially in and around Nanjing, with its AQI pollution Index at \\"severely polluted\\" for five straight days and \\"heavily polluted\\" for nine. On 3 December 2013, levels of PM2.5 particulate matter average over 943 micrograms per cubic metre, falling to over 338 micrograms per cubic metre on 4 December 2013. Between 3:00 pm, 3 December and 2:00pm, 4 December local time, several expressways from Nanjing to other Jiangsu cities were closed, stranding dozens of passenger buses in Zhongyangmen bus station. From 5 to 6 December, Nanjing issued a red alert for air pollution and closed down all kindergarten through middle schools. Children's Hospital outpatient services increased by 33 percent; general incidence of bronchitis, pneumonia, upper respiratory tract infections significantly increased. The smog dissipated 12 December. Officials blamed the dense pollution on lack of wind, automobile exhaust emissions under low air pressure, and coal-powered district heating system in North China region.

Answer the following question: If I tell you that Cells that divide uncontrollably may form masses of neoplastic origin, and ask you the question \\"cells that divide which way may form masses of neoplastic origin?\\", is the correct answer \\"non-neoplastic\\"? Answer:","completion":"No, the correct answer is not \\"non-neoplastic.\\" When defining the type of cells that may form masses of neoplastic origin, it's important to understand the terms in question. Cells that divide uncontrollably, violating the normal rules of cell division, are involved in the formation of masses of neoplastic origin, which is typically associated with cancer. The word \\"neoplastic\\" pertains to a neoplasm, which indicates an abnormal growth of cells. This can occur when cells divide and grow excessively without being regulated by the body's normal control mechanisms. Thus, neoplasms can be benign (non-cancerous), pre-malignant or malignant (cancerous). Malignant neoplasms can invade nearby tissues, spread to distant parts of the body and are generally more serious. Non-neoplastic cells, on the other hand, do not have this excessive and abnormal cell division. Non-neoplastic growths are those that do not involve the growth of cancerous cells. These could be because of inflammation, healing processes, infections, or other non-cancerous conditions. They may be referred as hyperplastic or hypertrophic changes, which are benign and controlled cases of cell growth. Therefore, by definition, only cells which divide uncontrollably, specifically leading to the development of a neoplasm, can form masses of neoplastic origin. Non-neoplastic cells, due to their regular and controlled division, would not typically lead to the formation of these neoplastic masses."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

He scratched at an imaginary itch on his right hand (just below his thumb) to take his mind off the man in the lab coat who sat across from him at the beaten, scarred, wood table. It didn't work. And whoever this man in the lab coat was, he was insistent about paperwork. He had three inches clipped onto a weathered clipboard which he flipped through with precision. \\"Can I offer you a glass of water?\\" asked the boy's captor in a calm, sensitive tenor. The boy, Kurt, continued to scratch the imaginary itch, which had leapt magically from his right hand to the left. Eventually the falseness of the itch would be deduced, and the lab coated man would disappear out of the cell and return with... God knows what. He had seen torture hundreds-if not thousands-of times on TV, and he was glumly certain that there would be no commercial breaks for him. \\"Can I offer you a glass of water?\\" The question was repeated without urgency, like a forgetful waiter. The itch now leaped with the dexterity of a trained flea onto the boy's leg, and the dutiful fingers followed. He watched as the man in the lab coat, without name tag or company insignia, studied his stack of papers attached to the clipboard. Several yellow forms near the top half inch were labeled 27B.

The premise tells us that a mother is trying to get her children to smile for a picture. However, it does not provide any information about the location or setting, such as whether the picture is being taken indoors or outdoors. To conclude the hypothesis, we would need additional information to support the assumption that the mother is taking the picture indoors.

For example, if the premise mentioned that the mother was trying to get her children to smile while they were in the living room or mentioned the family gathering around the fireplace, we would be able to conclude that the picture is being taken indoors.

The dynamics of a winning team often rely on each member's strong individual skills and their collective willingness to support one another in pursuit of a common goal. This collaborative effort fosters communication, trust, and strategic coordination, which, in turn, leads to increased performance and a higher likelihood of securing a championship title. Each team member should be prepared to contribute and score points for the team as needed. While the team may not have won the championship yet, their coordinated efforts can pave the way for future success. 1. Understand the Importance of Communication: Effective communication is key to winning a championship. It is vital for team members to continuously share information, seek clarification, and coordinate strategies during games. This open dialogue helps eliminate misunderstandings and ensures that teammates work harmoniously with each other. 2. Develop Trust Among Team Members: Team members must have faith in one another's abilities if they want to excel as a unit. Building trust involves recognizing each individual's strengths and weaknesses, offering support when needed, and encouraging teammates for their dedication. This camaraderie strengthens the team's bond, which translates into better teamwork during games. 3. Establish Clear Roles and Responsibilities: To function effectively, team members should have a clear understanding of their roles and responsibilities. They must know what is expected of them and how their performance contributes to the team's overall success. Clarifying these expectations can significantly reduce conflicts and enhance collaboration. 4. Focus on Team Objectives: All members should prioritize team goals over individual accomplishments. By aligning personal ambitions with the team's objectives, players can work seamlessly towards bringing the championship title home. 5. Emphasize Strong Team Play and Selfless Acts: Encourage unselfish plays and recognize those who assist in scoring points during a game. This positive reinforcement fuels team spirit and creates an atmosphere where everyone feels valued, motivating them to continue striving for greatness. 6. Adapt to Changing Game Situations: Teams that can quickly adjust to new game scenarios or opponent strategies have a higher likelihood of success. Practicing strategic adaptability and encouraging critical thinking among players are essential factors in maintaining a competitive edge. 7. Maintain a Positive Attitude: A winning spirit can propel a team forward during tough moments. By fostering an optimistic outlook and believing in each other's capabilities, a team will be more resilient in the face of adversity, allowing them to bounce back and maintain their pursuit of the championship. While a team may not have claimed the championship yet, focusing on these crucial aspects of teamwork can enhance their chances of future victory.

When we spend time lifting a lot of weights we become weaker or stronger?","completion":"Engaging in anaerobic exercises, such as lifting weights, can cause muscles to get bigger and stronger over time, rather than weaker. Anaerobic exercise is any physical exercise that prompts the use of glycogen as a primary fuel source, rather than oxygen. This type of exercise includes activities like weightlifting, sprinting, and high-intensity interval training. When you engage in regular weightlifting or strength training, you're stimulating muscle development through a process known as muscular hypertrophy. This process involves the increase of the size (and often strength) of skeletal muscle through the growth of component cells. During this process, muscle fibers sustain microdamage, which triggers the body's repair response. This repair response includes the activation of satellite cells located outside the muscle fibers, which then fuse to the damaged muscle fibers. As a result, the damaged muscle fibers become stronger, larger, and more resilient. This is the fundamental process behind muscle growth and increased strength stemming from anaerobic routines, such as weightlifting. However, this doesn't mean that you will only experience strength gains at all times. There can be instances where you may feel temporarily weaker – this can be due to several factors: 1. Overtraining: Lifting weights without sufficient breaks and recovery time can lead to a decline in overall strength and performance. It is vital to allow your muscles enough time to recuperate between workouts. 2. Insufficient nutrition: Proper nutrition is essential for fueling your muscles and promoting their growth and repair. Failing to consume an adequate amount of protein, carbohydrates, and essential fats can leave your muscles feeling weak and hinder progress. 3. Inadequate sleep: Sleep plays a crucial role in muscle recovery and overall performance. A lack of sleep or poor-quality sleep can result in weakened muscles and negatively impact workout performance. 4. Improper lifting technique: Incorrect weightlifting technique can not only prevent you from achieving optimal strength gains but can also lead to injury. In conclusion, if you follow a well-structured anaerobic exercise routine that suits your fitness level and goals, you will likely experience increases in muscle size and strength. Remember to prioritize proper nutrition, sufficient recovery time, and correct technique to avoid feelings of weakness or compromised progress. Regular engagement in such activities, when done correctly and consistently, will ultimately lead to stronger muscles rather than weakened ones."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: - Air enters bronchial tubes - Air is then split into the bronchioles of each lung - Bronchioles have alveoli which are tiny air sacs - Alveoli is surrounded by many small blood vessels - Oxygen passes through alveoli into blood vessels - Blood leaves the lungs as it travels through the body - Blood carries carbon dioxide back to the lungs - Carbon dioxide released when you exhale. What might be the first step of the process? Answer:","completion":"The first step of the process of respiration, as described above, is the entry of air into the bronchial tubes. This initial step is crucial for the proper functioning of the respiratory system and begins as follows: 1. Inhalation: The process starts when we breathe in air through our nose or mouth. As we inhale, the diaphragm muscle, located at the base of the chest cavity, contracts and moves downward, creating a negative pressure within the chest cavity. This negative pressure leads to the expansion of the lungs, allowing air to be drawn in. 2. Air filtration and conditioning: The inhaled air first passes through the nostrils and nasal cavity, where it is filtered, warmed, and humidified. Tiny hairs called cilia and mucus in the nose help to trap dust, debris, and other particles to protect our lungs from any harmful substances. This step is essential for maintaining healthy lungs and preventing respiratory infections or irritations. 3. Air transport via trachea: After passing through the nasal cavity and pharynx (throat), the filtered and conditioned air enters the trachea (windpipe), a tube composed of C-shaped cartilage rings that prevent the airway from collapsing during the inhalation process. The trachea transports the air down to the bronchi, which are the two main branches that connect to either lung. 4. Entry into bronchial tubes: The air eventually reaches the bronchial tubes, marking the first step in the process mentioned in the question. The bronchial tubes branch further into smaller tubes called bronchioles within each lung. From here, the process of respiration continues as the air is divided into the bronchioles, then to the alveoli, which are tiny air sacs surrounded by small blood vessels. Oxygen from the inhaled air diffuses through the walls of the alveoli and enters the bloodstream, while carbon dioxide, a waste product, diffuses from the blood back into the alveoli and is eventually exhaled. In summary, the first step of the process is the entry of air into the bronchial tubes. This occurs after several stages of inhalation, filtration, and transportation of air, which are critical for ensuring that clean, humidified, and oxygen-rich air reaches the lungs to facilitate efficient gas exchange."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: Information: - Pong is one of the earliest arcade video games and the very first sports arcade video game. It is a table tennis sports game featuring simple two-dimensional graphics. While other arcade video games such as \\"Computer Space\\" came before it, \\"Pong\\" was one of the first video games to reach mainstream popularity. The aim is to defeat an opponent in a simulated table-tennis game by earning a higher score. The game was originally manufactured by Atari, which released it in 1972. Allan Alcorn created \\"Pong\\" as a training exercise assigned to him by Atari co-founder Nolan Bushnell. Bushnell based the idea on an electronic ping-pong game included in the Magnavox Odyssey, which later resulted in a lawsuit against Atari. Surprised by the quality of Alcorn's work, Bushnell and Atari co-founder Ted Dabney decided to manufacture the game. - Atari, SA (ASA) is an international French holding company headquartered in Paris, France. It was originally called Infogrames Entertainment, SA (IESA). Its subsidiaries include Atari London Studio, Atari Interactive and Atari, Inc.. Because of continuing pressures upon the company, and difficulty finding investors, it sought bankruptcy protection under French law in January 2013; its subsidiaries in the United States have sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection there as well. All three subsidiaries have since exited bankruptcy, and are all going through a vigorous turnaround campaign. - Home computers were a class of microcomputers entering the market in 1977, and becoming common during the 1980s. They were marketed to consumers as affordable and accessible computers that, for the first time, were intended for the use of a single nontechnical user. These computers were a distinct market segment that typically cost much less than business, scientific or engineering-oriented computers of the time such as the IBM PC, and were generally less powerful in terms of memory and expandability. However, a home computer often had better graphics and sound than contemporaneous business computers. Their most common uses were playing video games, but they were also regularly used for word processing, doing homework, and programming. - Ted Dabney is the co-founder of Syzygy and Atari. While working at Ampex Dabney met Nolan Bushnell and the two jointly created Syzygy with their first product being \\"Computer Space\\", which was manufactured and sold by Nutting Associates. Following Computer Space, Ted Dabney's video circuit that was created for Computer Space was used by Al Alcorn to create \\"Pong\\", with assistance from Dabney and Bushnell. Dabney remained out of the public eye after departing Atari and his role in creating the first commercially produced coin-op video game as well as Syzygy and Atari was often omitted or marginalized with several myths attached. Dabney appeared on the RetroGaming Roundup podcast in October 2010 and told his story in a two-hour interview. - IMAGE (from Imager for Magnetopause-to-Aurora Global Exploration), or Explorer 78, was a NASA MIDEX mission that studied the global response of the Earth's magnetosphere to changes in the solar wind. It was launched March 25, 2000 by a Delta II rocket from Vandenberg AFB and ceased operations in December 2005. - The Fairchild Channel F is a home video game console released by Fairchild Semiconductor in November 1976 across North America at the retail price of 169.95. It was also released in Japan in October the following year. It has the distinction of being the first programmable ROM cartridgebased video game console, and the first console to use a microprocessor. It was launched as the Video Entertainment System, or VES, but when Atari released its VCS the next year, Fairchild renamed its machine. By 1977, the Fairchild Channel F had sold 250,000 units, trailing behind sales of the VCS. - Boxing is an Atari 2600 video game interpretation of the sport of boxing developed by Activision programmer Bob Whitehead . The game is based on Boxer , an unreleased 1978 arcade game from Whitehead 's previous employer , Atari . - The Atari 2600 (or Atari VCS before 1982) is a home video game console by Atari, Inc. Released on September 11, 1977, it is credited with popularizing the use of microprocessor-based hardware and ROM cartridges containing game code, a format first used with the Fairchild Channel F video game console in 1976. This format contrasts with the older model of having non-microprocessor dedicated hardware, which could only play the games that were physically built into the unit. - A video game is an electronic game that involves human or animal interaction with a user interface to generate visual feedback on a video device such as a TV screen or computer monitor. The word \\"video\\" in \\"video game\\" traditionally referred to a raster display device, but as of the 2000s, it implies any type of display device that can produce two- or three-dimensional images. Some theorists categorize video games as an art form, but this designation is controversial. - Atari, Inc. was an American video game developer and home computer company founded in 1972 by Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney. Primarily responsible for the formation of the video arcade and modern video game industries, the company was closed and its assets split in 1984 as a direct result of the North American video game crash of 1983. - Atari Interactive is a name used by several separate groups and corporations since the mid-1990s. In 1996, it was the name of Atari Corporation's PC publishing division, bringing games like the Atari Jaguar's \\"Tempest 2000\\" to the PC platform. From 1998 to 2001, Atari Interactive, Inc. was the name of the corporate entity that held the Atari properties purchased from JTS by Hasbro in 1998, and functioned as the retro publishing subsidiary of Hasbro Interactive. It is currently the name of a wholly owned subsidiary of Atari, SA (formerly Infogrames), who is the current owner of the Atari brand and various other properties formerly belonging to Hasbro Interactive. It was formed in 2001, when IESA acquired Hasbro Interactive and proceeded to rename it to Infogrames Interactive. In 2003, IESA then changed the company name entirely to Atari Interactive, Inc. as part of its worldwide reorganization to focus on use of the Atari brand. - Nolan Kay Bushnell (born February 5, 1943) is an American electrical engineer and businessman. He established Atari, Inc. and the Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza-Time Theaters chain. Bushnell has been inducted into the Video Game Hall of Fame and the Consumer Electronics Association Hall of Fame, received the BAFTA Fellowship and the Nations Restaurant News Innovator of the Year award, and was named one of \\"Newsweek\\"s \\"50 Men Who Changed America.\\" Bushnell has started more than twenty companies and is one of the founding fathers of the video game industry. He is currently on the board of Anti-Aging Games, but his latest venture is an educational software company called Brainrush that is using video game technology in educational software, incorporating real brain science, in a way that Bushnell believes will fundamentally change education. Nolan, who is co-founder and chairman of Brainrush, believes that Brainrush will be his biggest success. - Activision Publishing, Inc., also known as Activision, is an American video game publisher. It was founded on October 1, 1979 and was the world's first independent developer and distributor of video games for gaming consoles. Its first products were cartridges for the Atari 2600 video console system published from July 1980 for the US market and from August 1981 for the international market (UK). - Atari is a corporate and brand name owned by several entities since its inception in 1972, currently by Atari Interactive, a subsidiary of the French publisher Atari, SA (ASA). The original Atari, Inc. founded in 1972 by Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney was a pioneer in arcade games, home video game consoles, and home computers. The company's products, such as \\"Pong\\" and the Atari 2600, helped define the electronic entertainment industry from the 1970s to the mid-1980s. - Robert A. \\"Bob\\" Whitehead (born November 1, 1953) is an early game designer and programmer for the Atari 2600 who co-founded video game companies Activision and Accolade.

Choose the most suitable option to answer the above question. Options： A. medium B. illness C. throwing up D. heartburn E. sleepiness Answer:","completion":"D. Heartburn If you consume spicy food, you may experience heartburn as a consequence. Heartburn, or acid reflux, occurs when stomach acid travels back up into the esophagus, causing a burning sensation in the chest or throat. This phenomenon can be triggered by various factors, such as consuming a large portion of spicy food, overeating, or lying down soon after a meal. Spicy foods often contain capsaicin, a compound responsible for the heat sensation associated with chili peppers. Capsaicin has the potential to irritate the lining of the esophagus, which can exacerbate the symptoms of heartburn. Moreover, spicy foods can stimulate the production of stomach acid, making it more likely for acid reflux to occur. It is important to note that not everyone will experience heartburn after eating spicy food. People with a higher tolerance for spicy cuisine may not experience any discomfort at all, while others, particularly those with pre-existing gastrointestinal issues, such as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), are more susceptible to heartburn. In addition to heartburn, consuming spicy food can lead to other temporary side effects, such as increased sweating, runny nose, and a general feeling of warmth. These reactions are the body's way of trying to cool itself down and are not typically associated with any long-term negative health consequences. However, if heartburn becomes a frequent occurrence or does not respond to over-the-counter antacids, it's essential to consult a healthcare professional, as it may indicate a more serious underlying condition. Lifestyle modifications, such as avoiding trigger foods, eating smaller meals, and not lying down immediately after eating, may help alleviate symptoms. In more severe cases, prescription medications or other treatments may be recommended. In conclusion, consuming spicy food is most likely to result in heartburn, or acid reflux, due to the irritation and stimulation of stomach acid production caused by capsaicin. The severity and frequency of heartburn vary from person to person and can depend on factors such as individual spice tolerance and pre-existing gastrointestinal conditions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

By the end of the evening, all that is left is a small pile of ashes. What happened to the matter that you started with? Was it destroyed by the flames? It may seem that way.

Because the same amount of matter still exists, we can say that matter is conserved. You may wonder how it can be conserved if something is now missing? Assume you had measured the mass of the wood before you burned it. Assume you had also trapped the gases released by the burning wood and measured their mass and the mass of the ashes. What would you find? The ashes and gases combined have the same mass as the wood you started with. This example illustrates the law of conservation of mass.

Answer:","completion":"Elsa, a character from the movie \\"Tenebrae,\\" does not seem to be mentioned in the provided plot summary. Therefore, determining her cause of death cannot be accurately answered based on the given information. However, the movie \\"Tenebrae\\" is a 1982 Italian horror film directed by Dario Argento. It features a series of brutal murders inspired by the protagonist Peter Neal's violent horror novels. From the plot description, we can infer that the unidentified killer, inspired by Neal's books, commits the murders through vicious means, like razor-slashing, axe-hacking, and stabbing. Given this pattern, it is logical to assume that if Elsa was a character in the movie, her death would also have been the result of a violent attack, possibly involving one of the aforementioned weapons or methods. To determine whether it's worth investing in the film proposal, there are several factors to consider: 1. Genre: \\"Tenebrae\\" falls under the giallo subgenre, a type of Italian horror-thriller that primarily focuses on gruesome murders and psychological suspense. Determine if this genre aligns with your personal interests or the target audience you want to cater to. 2. Director: Dario Argento is a renowned filmmaker known for his distinctive visual style and innovative approach to the horror genre. This association could make the film more attractive for fans of Argento's previous works, especially within the horror community. 3. Market appeal: Assess the current market trends and audience preferences within the film industry, paying particular attention to the performance of similar films in recent years. This information will give an indication of the potential demand for a film like \\"Tenebrae.\\" 4. Financial aspects: Evaluate the proposed budget, estimated revenue projections, distribution channels, and potential collaborators for the movie, such as producers and actors. By analyzing these factors, you can determine the film's feasibility and potential for financial success. 5. Risks and challenges: Understand the foreseeable risks and challenges associated with the production, such as unforeseen expenses, audience reception, and competition with other films within the same genre or released during the same period. This understanding will help you identify if any risks outweigh the potential benefits of investing in the proposal. By taking all these factors into account, you can make a well-informed decision on whether it would be a worthwhile investment to support the film proposal for \\"Tenebrae.\\" It is essential to conduct thorough research and weigh the potential risks against the expected returns to ensure that your investment aligns with both your financial objectives and your passion for the project's content and vision."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: What city is home to the only library larger than the library located at Egypt's oldest degree-granting university? Answer:","completion":"The city home to the only library larger than the library located at Egypt's oldest degree-granting university, which is Al-Azhar University in Cairo, is Washington, D.C. This city boasts the Library of Congress, the largest library in the world in terms of shelf space and number of books. Established in 1800, the Library of Congress is the research library serving the United States Congress and the de facto national library of the United States. With approximately 170 million items on its shelves, which is more than double the number of items housed in Al-Azhar University's library, it surpasses other vast libraries around the world. The Library of Congress holds an extensive collection comprising not only books and manuscripts but also photographs, maps, sheet music, sound recordings, films, prints, and drawings. Its impressive collection growth can be attributed to Congress's early recognition of the importance of acquiring and preserving knowledge beyond their legislative work. Furthermore, the Library of Congress has evolved into a hub for knowledge, providing services like research assistance, educational activities, and public exhibitions to scholars, researchers, and the general public from all over the world. Al-Azhar University in Cairo, founded in 970 AD, is one of the oldest and most esteemed Islamic institutions globally, playing a critical role in disseminating Islamic knowledge. Its library holds an exceptional collection of manuscripts, many of which are invaluable and rare, contributing to the Islamic world's educational and religious needs. However, the size of Al-Azhar University's library does not match that of the Library of Congress. The distinction in the scope and mission of both establishments is noteworthy. While both play critical roles in knowledge preservation, dissemination, and research, their focus and impact differ due to their unique historical evolution, geographical location, and the communities they primarily serve. In conclusion, Washington, D.C.'s Library of Congress holds the honor of being home to the only library larger than the library located at Egypt's oldest degree-granting university, Al-Azhar University in Cairo. The significant difference in size and the services they provide showcase the diversity and importance of knowledge and learning in our world."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Besides news reports that tend to focus on war or election, Americans generally don't hear much about people in other countries. One reason may be that very little foreign-language literature is translated into English. In the United States, just a few of the titles, mainly translations of foreign novels, short stories, or poetry, make it into English. However, a number of efforts have taken root to try to bring more global literature to US audiences.

The nonprofit site, now in its fifth year, offers modern writing from places such as Argentina, China and Italy, often for the first time in English. It gets about 200,000 page views per month and counts roughly 8,000 subscribers , more than one-quarter of whom live in the US. \\"There's a wave of interest right now,\\" says Jill Schoolman, publisher of Archipelago Books, a small nonprofit press in Brooklyn, N.Y., opened in 2003 to publish world literature in translation only. \\"People are hungry for ideas from other countries.\\" Rainmaker Translations, a Las Vegas-based nonprofit, was formed two years ago to support the publication of more top-quality global writing here in the US.

In March, the Center for the Art of Translation, a nonprofit started in 1994 in San Francisco, will publish Two Lines World Library, focused on writing from some particular areas published over the last several decades. Dalkey Archive Press, a century-old nonprofit publisher in Champaign, Illinois, has upped the number of translations on its publication list since 2003, from 25 percent to nearly 80 percent.

Article: From age eight to eleven, I studied at a small school in Bath, England. It was a small school of four classes, with about twenty-five children in each class according to age. For the most part, one teacher had to teach all subjects. However, sometimes the headteacher , Mr. Ronald Broaches would come in and spend an hour or so. He was a large man with a very happy nature. He had a sense of humor and would be glad in telling the children small stories which make us laugh. I found that he took great interest in me and he quickly found that I enjoyed puzzles. He would stop me as I was going to class and take a piece of paper out of his pocket, often with a puzzle on it. As time went on, they slowly gave me an interest in math and problem -solving that stays with me to this day. To this day, I can remember Mr. Broaches' cheerful cry of \\"Well done!\\" whenever I got a problem right. I shall always be thankful that our paths crossed. Mr. Bruoaches died just two weeks after I won the 1993 Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine. Unfortunately, I had no chance to speak to him before he died.

Question: \\"What kind of treaties involved the President's approval?\\" Context: \\"In the United States, the term \\"treaty\\" has a different, more restricted legal sense than exists in international law. United States law distinguishes what it calls treaties from executive agreement, congressional-executive agreements, and sole executive agreements. All four classes are equally treaties under international law; they are distinct only from the perspective of internal American law. The distinctions are primarily concerning their method of approval. Whereas treaties require advice and consent by two-thirds of the Senators present, sole executive agreements may be executed by the President acting alone. Some treaties grant the President the authority to fill in the gaps with executive agreements, rather than additional treaties or protocols. And finally, congressional-executive agreements require majority approval by both the House and the Senate, either before or after the treaty is signed by the President.\\" Answer: The answer to this question is:","completion":"In the context of the United States, several types of treaties involve the President's approval. These treaties, while all considered legally binding under international law, are treated differently in the context of American domestic law. U.S. law distinguishes between treaties, executive agreements, congressional-executive agreements, and sole executive agreements based on their methods of approval. 1. Treaties: These are formal, legally binding agreements between nations that require approval by two-thirds of the Senate. The President's role is to negotiate, sign, and submit the treaty to the Senate for advice and consent. Once the Senate approves the treaty, the President must ratify it to make it officially valid. The U.S. Constitution vests the President with the authority to make treaties with the advice and consent of the Senate. 2. Executive Agreements: These types of agreements, while still binding in international law, do not require the same level of approval as formal treaties. Executive agreements are entered into by the President and another nation and can cover various topics, including security, trade, and diplomatic relations. They do not need the consent of the Senate, but they are generally submitted to Congress for review and may require implementing legislation. 3. Congressional-Executive Agreements: Congressional-executive agreements require the majority approval of both the House of Representatives and the Senate, either before or after the President signs the treaty. These agreements often address trade and economic relations between the United States and other countries. The President's role in this type of treaty is to negotiate and sign the agreement, while Congress approves it through legislation, such as an act or resolution. 4. Sole Executive Agreements: Sole executive agreements are executed by the President acting alone and don't require consent from the Senate or approval of Congress. The President may enter into sole executive agreements based on their constitutional authority or in cases where a treaty or previous statute grants them the authority to do so. These agreements can cover various issues, such as military security arrangements, recognition of foreign governments, or humanitarian aid. In conclusion, while all of these types of treaties are considered legally-binding agreements in international law, they differ regarding the required level of the President's approval and involvement in their ratification and implementation. Treaties involve a higher degree of scrutiny and approval from the Senate, while executive agreements, congressional-executive agreements, and sole executive agreements offer more flexibility in the approval process. Overall, the President plays a crucial role in negotiating, signing, and implementing treaties and agreements on behalf of the United States."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Teacher:Given a pair of words, deduce the type of relationship between them. The various types of relations are: 'HYPER', 'COORD' and 'RANDOM'. Let's denote the first word by X and the second word by Y. A COORD relationship holds when X and Y belong to the same semantic class. A HYPER relationship applies when X is a specific instance of Y. If niether COORD nor HYPER are applicable then the relationship is RANDOM. Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: X: pit, Y: cavity Student:","completion":"Part #1: Determine if the given pair of words (X and Y) has a COORD relationship. Usage: X = pit, Y = cavity. Both \\"pit\\" and \\"cavity\\" can represent a hole or hollow space; they belong to the same semantic class of holes. Therefore, there is a COORD relationship. I think it meets the criteria because both words share a similar meaning, indicating a common semantic theme. Part #2: Determine if the given pair of words (X and Y) has a HYPER relationship. Usage: X = pit, Y = cavity. In this case, \\"pit\\" is not a specific instance of \\"cavity.\\" While both words can refer to similar concepts, one is not a subset of the other. Therefore, there is no HYPER relationship. I think it meets the criteria because neither word is a more specific version of the other. Part #3: Determine if the given pair of words (X and Y) has a RANDOM relationship. Usage: X = pit, Y = cavity. Since there is already a COORD relationship identified, the relationship cannot be RANDOM. I think it meets the criteria because a RANDOM relationship is only assigned when neither HYPER nor COORD relationships exist; however, a COORD relationship exists between \\"pit\\" and \\"cavity.\\" Conclusion: Given the pair of words X: pit and Y: cavity, the relationship between them is COORD as both words belong to the same semantic class."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

They experience various stresses including redecorating their house and raising their kids. Joey (Jon Favreau) and Lucy (Kristin Davis) are high school sweethearts with a smart but naive teenage daughter named Lacey.

The premise states that \\"On a separate guided tour, you can visit the Royal Opera of Louis XV, and the king's private apartments.\\" This means that there is a guided tour available to visit these two specific locations. Step 2: Evaluate if the hypothesis contains any new or contradictory information. The hypothesis states \\"Just pay ten dollars and you would be able to see the Royal Opera of Louis XV.\\" Now, let's justify the steps: Justification of Step 1: The offered guided tour is the common factor between the premise and the hypothesis. It's important to establish the available means to visit the Royal Opera of Louis XV as mentioned in the premise. Justification of Step 2: Analyzing the hypothesis, we find that it introduces the cost to visit the Royal Opera of Louis XV, which is not mentioned in the premise. The hypothesis specifies that by paying ten dollars, one would be able to see the Royal Opera of Louis XV. Conclusion: Based on the analysis, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. If a person works hard how is their situation improved? - compliments acknowledgment - better life - american dream - complimented - headache The best answer is Answer:","completion":"When a person works hard, they often experience significant improvements in various aspects of their life. Hard work enables an individual to achieve their goals, gain recognition, and ultimately enhance their overall quality of life. This concept is deeply ingrained in many cultures, particularly the American Dream, which emphasizes the opportunity for accomplishments through perseverance and dedication. One way in which a person's situation is improved through hard work is the acknowledgment and compliments they receive from others. When an individual puts in the effort and demonstrates determination, their abilities and successes are often recognized by their peers, supervisors, or mentors. This recognition goes hand-in-hand with compliments, which can boost self-esteem and strengthen personal relationships. Additionally, a strong work ethic and self-discipline can lead to increased confidence and independence, further contributing to personal growth and development. Another key aspect of working hard is the attainment of a better life. By putting in the time, effort, and dedication to their work, an individual can earn a stable income and progress in their career. This, in turn, creates a solid foundation for financial stability and security, which allows for a comfortable lifestyle with opportunities for personal and professional growth. Moreover, financial stability is often complemented by better housing, healthcare, and education opportunities, all contributing factors to an individual's improved situation. The American Dream is a fundamental part of how hard work can lead to an improved situation. It is rooted in the belief that everyone has an equal opportunity to succeed, regardless of their social, economic, or cultural background. Through hard work and determination, individuals can climb the social and economic ladder, achieving personal and financial success. This concept has inspired and motivated countless people to strive for a better life, believing that their efforts will ultimately be rewarded. Being complimented on one's hard work not only serves to affirm the value of their effort but also offers a source of motivation and encouragement to continue pushing boundaries. Compliments help validate personal achievements and reinforce the importance of the individual's contribution to a task or project. This recognition can lead to a sense of satisfaction and allows the individual to feel appreciated, ultimately empowering them to continue working hard and aiming high. However, hard work can sometimes come with its downsides, such as stress and headache. Working tirelessly on a project or task without sufficient breaks or relaxation can take a toll on one's mental and physical well-being. It is crucial to find a balance between the desire to succeed and self-care, ensuring that hard work does not sacrifice one's health and well-being in the long run. In conclusion, when a person works hard, their situation can significantly improve in various ways, ranging from receiving compliments and acknowledgment to realizing the American Dream and enjoying a better overall quality of life. It is essential to remember, though, to seek a balance between work and life, ensuring that the pursuit of success does not come at the cost of one's well-being."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The document also calls for the two countries to jointly work on efforts to build a lasting peace on the Korean Peninsula, to establish new U.S.-North Korea relations and to recover the remains of prisoners of war and military members missing in action. The two sides also promised to hold follow-up negotiations. “We’re going to denuke North Korea,” Trump told VOA contributor Greta Van Susteren. He also said neither side issued ultimatums and that the agreement Tuesday was the result of months of negotiations. “You know that could have ended in a war, that could have ended with many millions of people — you know North Korea very well, Seoul has 28 million people, that could have ended with millions of people dead but we ended with a deal,” he said. Trump also told VOA that U.S. troops stationed in South Korea will remain in place, but announced one concession long-sought by North Korea. \\"We are going to get out of the war games that cost so much money,\\" he said. Trump said at later news conference that existing U.S. sanctions will remain in place until North Korean nuclear weapons \\"are no longer a factor.\\" As for verification, Trump said he and Kim discussed the issue and that monitoring denuclearization efforts would be achieved “by having a lot of people there.” He also predicted Kim would begin work right away to “live up to” the agreement.

Q:Information: - \`\` Der gute Kamerad '' ( \`\` The good Comrade '' ) , also known by its incipit as Ich hatt ' einen Kameraden ( \`\` I had a comrade '' ) is a traditional lament of the German Armed Forces . The text was written by German poet Ludwig Uhland in 1809 . Its immediate inspiration was the deployment of Badener troops against the Tyrolean Rebellion . In 1825 , the composer Friedrich Silcher set it to music , based on the tune of a Swiss folk song . The song is about the immediate experience of a soldier losing a comrade in battle , detached from all political or national ideology ; as a result , its use was never limited to one particular faction and was sung or cited by representatives of all political backgrounds throughout the 19th and 20th centuries , and was translated for use in numerous fighting forces , French , Dutch , Spanish , Japanese and others . \`\` The Good Comrade '' still plays an important ceremonial role in the German Armed Forces and is an integral part of a military funeral , continuing a tradition started at some point around 1871 . The song has also become traditional in obsequies of the Military of Austria , the Austrian firebrigades and the highly prussianized Chilean Army . It is also used to some degree in the French Army , particularly in the Foreign Legion . When the song is played , soldiers are to salute , an honour otherwise reserved for national anthems only . Occasionally the song is played at civil ceremonies , most often when the deceased had been affiliated with the military . It is also commonly sung at the funerals of members of a Studentenverbindung . Finally , the song is often played on Volkstrauertag , the German Remembrance Day , at memorials for the fallen . The above text is Uhland 's original version . Various variants have been recorded over the years . Heyman Steinthal in an 1880 article in Zeitschrift für Völkerpsychologie noted a variant he heard sung by a housemaid , Die Kugel kam geflogen / Gilt sie mir ? Gilt sie dir ?

Although conventionally focused on the emotional response to loss, it also has physical, cognitive, behavioral, social, cultural, and philosophical dimensions. While the terms are often used interchangeably, \\"bereavement\\" refers to the state of loss, and \\"grief\\" is the reaction to that loss. - Mourning is, in the simplest sense, grief over someone's death. The word is also used to describe a cultural complex of behaviours in which the bereaved participate or are expected to participate. Customs vary between cultures and evolve over time, though many core behaviors remain constant. - A song, most broadly, is a single (and often standalone) work of music that is typically intended to be sung by the human voice with distinct and fixed pitches and patterns using sound and silence and a variety of forms that often include the repetition of sections. Written words created specifically for music or for which music is specifically created, are called lyrics. If a pre-existing poem is set to composed music in classical music it is an art song. Songs that are sung on repeated pitches without distinct contours and patterns that rise and fall are called chants. Songs in a simple style that are learned informally are often referred to as folk songs. Songs that are composed for professional singers who sell their recordings or live shows to the mass market are called popular songs. These songs, which have broad appeal, are often composed by professional songwriters, composers and lyricists. Art songs are composed by trained classical composers for concert or recital performances. Songs are performed live and recorded on audio or video (or in some, cases, a song may be performed live and simultaneously recorded). Songs may also appear in plays, musical theatre, stage shows of any form, and within operas. - Music is an art form and cultural activity whose medium is sound and silence, which exist in time. The common elements of music are pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the \\"color\\" of a musical sound). Different styles or types of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs without instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and instruments. The word derives from Greek (\\"mousike\\"; \\"art of the Muses\\"). In its most general form, the activities describing music as an art form include the production of works of music (songs, tunes, symphonies, and so on), the criticism of music, the study of the history of music, and the aesthetic examination of music. Ancient Greek and Indian philosophers defined music as tones ordered horizontally as melodies and vertically as harmonies. Common sayings such as \\"the harmony of the spheres\\" and \\"it is music to my ears\\" point to the notion that music is often ordered and pleasant to listen to. However, 20th-century composer John Cage thought that any sound can be music, saying, for example, \\"There is no noise, only sound.\\" - A poet is a person who writes poetry. Poets may describe themselves as such or be described as such by others. A poet may simply be a writer of poetry, or may perform their art to an audience. - Crying is the shedding of tears in response to an emotional state. The act of crying has been defined as \\"a complex secretomotor phenomenon characterized by the shedding of tears from the lacrimal apparatus, without any irritation of the ocular structures\\". A related medical term is lacrimation, which also refers to non-emotional shedding of tears. Crying is also known as \\"weeping\\", \\"wailing\\", \\"whimpering\\", and \\"bawling\\". - A lament or lamentation is a passionate expression of grief, often in music, poetry, or song form. The grief is most often born of regret, or mourning. Laments can also be expressed in a verbal manner, where the participant would lament about something they regret or someone they've lost, usually accompanied by wailing, moaning and/or crying. Laments constitute some of the oldest forms of writing and examples are present across human cultures. - Johann Ludwig Uhland (26 April 1787 13 November 1862), was a German poet, philologist and literary historian. - Poetry (the term derives from a variant of the Greek term, \\"poiesis\\", \\"making\\") is a form of literature that uses aesthetic and rhythmic qualities of languagesuch as phonaesthetics, sound symbolism, and metreto evoke meanings in addition to, or in place of, the prosaic ostensible meaning.

Read the following paragraph and determine if the hypothesis is true: How to smooth frizzy hair<br>Wash with a moisturizing shampoo. Frizz is often caused by dryness, so it's important to restore moisture to your hair in the shower. Always use a sulfate-free shampoo. Hypothesis: Using a shampoo that contains sulfates is not recommended to fix frizzy hair.","completion":"Upon assessing the given paragraph, it is evident that the hypothesis is true. According to the information provided, frizzy hair is often caused by dryness, which can be resolved by washing it with a moisturizing shampoo. The paragraph advises that a sulfate-free shampoo should be used for this purpose. Sulfates are common ingredients in many shampoos, and they are primarily used as a cleaning and foaming agent. Generally, they help remove dirt, oil, and other impurities from the hair. However, they can be quite harsh and may strip away the hair's natural oils, leading to dryness, which is a primary factor causing frizzy hair. The use of a shampoo that contains sulfates may exacerbate the dryness and frizziness of the hair, defeating the primary objective of restoring moisture and reducing frizz. Consequently, using a sulfate-free and moisturizing shampoo is preferable for improving the hair's overall health and appearance. In summary, the hypothesis that using a shampoo containing sulfates is not recommended for fixing frizzy hair stands true, as it is supported by the provided information. Opting for a sulfate-free and moisturizing shampoo is a more suitable alternative for individuals dealing with frizzy hair, helping them maintain and restore the natural moisture balance of their hair and, in turn, reducing frizziness."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

OPTIONS: a). yes. b). it is not possible to tell. c). no.","completion":"b). it is not possible to tell. The statement \\"The kids are examining the photo holders\\" is open to interpretation, as it does not specify whether the children are holding the photo holders, also known as picture frames, up to their faces or merely looking at them in their hands or on a table. The two premises are similar and interconnected, but they are not explicitly the same. The initial premise, \\"Several children are holding up picture frames to their faces,\\" describes a situation where children are physically holding the picture frames to their faces, perhaps as a playful activity or to see how a photo might look when placed in a particular frame. This premise has a clear visual image and provides a specific detail about how the children are interacting with the picture frames. In contrast, the statement \\"The kids are examining the photo holders\\" is less specific regarding the manner in which the children interact with the picture frames. They could be just holding the frames in their hands, looking closely at the details of the frame's design, or trying to understand how to place a photo inside the frame. Given the lack of clarity in the second statement, we cannot definitively determine whether it supports or contradicts the initial premise. Thus, the correct answer is b).

Sadly, today's children are sometimes being armed with more dangerous tools like weapons, drugs and gangs in the USA. Once a relatively peaceful environment, many schoolyards of today are becoming unsafe for both students and teachers. Home schools are available to give you choices. Home schooling provides top-quality education, flexibility and freedom to create your own schedule. At Sunny Home School we believe the choice should be yours. Thanks to modern technology, home schooling information is becoming readily available across the nation. A recent study by the ITBS (Iowa Tests of Basic Skills) and TAP (Tests of Achievement and Proficiency) shows us that students of home schools do particularly well when compared with the nationwide average. In every subject at every grade level, students of home schooling scored obviously higher than those in public and private schools. If you're new to home schooling, you may be asking yourself, \\"Will home schools really work for my children?\\" Fact: A nationwide study using a random selection of 1,516 families found students of home schooling to be scoring, on average, at or above the 80thpercentile (80) in all areas, on standardized achievement test. (Note: The national average on standardized achievement test is the 50thpercentile.) Collectively, the staff at Sunny Home School brings 65 years of experience in home schooling curriculum. We've placed students in the top 2% of the nation in math and many are successfully moving on to college. One study found that of the home schooled students, 94% said home education prepared them to be independent persons. For more home schooling information, call us today toll free at (1800)542-8668.

How would one describe the sentiment of this tweet? @alperdotr i got bored lunch time?","completion":"In order to describe the sentiment of this tweet, we would first need to break down and analyze its components. The tweet reads: \\"@alperdotr i got bored lunch time?\\" 1. Addressing another user: The tweet begins with the username \\"@alperdotr\\" which indicates that the user is addressing their message to another Twitter user. This suggests that the sentiment is conversational and is meant for a specific recipient. The conversation may be ongoing or a response to a previous statement made by the recipient. 2. Emotional state: The tweeter proceeds to mention that they \\"got bored.\\" This expression suggests feelings of restlessness and dissatisfaction, indicating a negative sentiment. The user may be feeling weary due to a lack of engaging stimuli or activity. This feeling of boredom could also mean that the tweeter is seeking something new or different to rekindle their interest and motivation. 3. Lunch time suggestion: The message continues with the question \\"lunch time?\\". This proposition implies that the user is considering the potential of using lunchtime as a means to alleviate their boredom. There are a few possible interpretations of the overall sentiment behind this suggestion: a. Casual conversation: The tweeter might be looking for a casual social interaction, such as sharing a meal, to alleviate their boredom. In this case, the sentiment would be neutral with a hint of openness and desire for social engagement. b. Seeking a change of pace: The question may signify that the user is looking for a break from their current activity and believes that engaging in a different activity, like eating lunch, could provide a momentary escape from boredom. This interpretation would signify a mixed sentiment, as the user is still feeling bored but is also hopeful that changing the activity will provide relief. c. Sarcasm or humor: The tweeter may be using humor or sarcasm to express their feelings. If the tweet is intended to be humorous, the sentiment could be seen as lighthearted or joking in nature. A sarcastic reading of the tweet, however, would indicate a more negative sentiment, showcasing the user's frustration. In conclusion, the sentiment of this tweet appears to be primarily negative due to the tweeter's feelings of boredom. However, the proposed lunchtime idea introduces a variety of possible interpretations, which could range from neutral to mixed sentiments. The overall sentiment is influenced by the tweeter's intention and relation to the addressed user, @alperdotr, but maintains a conversational element throughout."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In Colombia, the drug-financed guerrillas trying to seize the country and destroy democracy include M-19, which Castro has clearly backed. Robert Merkel, a former U.S. attorney handling drug indictments in Florida, doesn't think for a minute that Castro's much publicized trials of high officials engaged in the drug trade mean he has broken off with the Medellin drug cartel. \\"If the cartel succeeds in blackmailing the Colombian authorities into negotiations, the cartel will be in control and Fidel can exploit his past relationships with them,\\" he told the Journal's David Asman recently. The struggle against the drug lords in Colombia will be a near thing. This week, the government arrested Jose Abello Silva, said to be the fourth-ranking cartel leader. He will probably be extradited to the U.S. for trial under an extradition treaty President Virgilia Barco has revived. Later, another high-ranking trafficker, Leonidas Vargas, was arrested and 1,000 pounds of dynamite seized. Mr. Barco has refused U.S. troops or advisers but has accepted U.S. military aid. President Bush has agreed to meet within 90 days with Mr. Barco, President Alan Garcia of Peru and President Jaime Paz Zamora of Bolivia to discuss the drug problem.

Help as much as you can. I have a new situation: An archipelago in the Indian ocean included two very different islands. Snake island was a reptile paradise, inhabited by many species of reptiles. Bird island had few reptiles on it, but had various birds inhabiting it. But I can use this background: Reptiles are a class of animals comprising turtles, tuataras, lizards, snakes and crocodiles. They are tetrapods, but the snakes and a few species of lizard either have no limbs or their limbs are much reduced in size. Their bones are better ossified and their skeletons stronger than those of amphibians. The teeth are conical and mostly uniform in size. The surface cells of the epidermis are modified into horny scales which create a waterproof layer. Reptiles are unable to use their skin for respiration as do amphibians and have a more efficient respiratory system drawing air into their lungs by expanding their chest walls. The heart resembles that of the amphibian but there is a septum which more completely separates the oxygenated and deoxygenated bloodstreams. The reproductive system has evolved for internal fertilization, with a copulatory organ present in most species. The eggs are surrounded by amniotic membranes which prevents them from drying out and are laid on land, or develop internally in some species. The bladder is small as nitrogenous waste is excreted as uric acid.Turtles are notable for their protective shells. They have an inflexible trunk encased in a horny carapace above and a plastron below. These are formed from bony plates embedded in the dermis which are overlain by horny ones and are partially fused with the ribs and spine. The neck is long and flexible and the head and the legs can be drawn back inside the shell. Turtles are vegetarians and the typical reptile teeth have been replaced by sharp, horny plates. In aquatic species, the front legs are modified into flippers.Tuataras superficially resemble lizards but the lineages diverged in the Triassic period. There is one living species, Sphenodon punctatus. The skull has two openings (fenestrae) on either side and the jaw is rigidly attached to the skull. There is one row of teeth in the lower jaw and this fits between the two rows in the upper jaw when the animal chews. The teeth are merely projections of bony material from the jaw... What is an answer for this question: Which island was inhabited by fewer turtles? A:","completion":"Based on the information provided, it can be inferred that Snake Island was inhabited primarily by reptiles, while Bird Island had fewer reptiles. Since turtles are a type of reptile, we can conclude that Bird Island was inhabited by fewer turtles. So, the answer is: A: Bird Island."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Others are beings with extraordinary powers who have been hiding among us for centuries, but the balance between the two factions is on the verge of collapse. For years, The Others have been oppressed and hunted by the government, in fear their powers could overthrow the established order. The protagonist, Alex Kane, a kind-hearted teenager, discovers she has extraordinary abilities, able of manipulating electricity. Feeling scared and confused, she stumbles across an underground movement called \\"The Awakening,\\" an organization that aims to unite The Others. Its leaders, Jon, a wise and stoic telepath, and Lila, a fierce and skilled strategist with the power of pyrokinesis, are determined to bring together The Others and negotiate peace with the government. As Alex starts to explore her powers, she meets Cyrus, a charming, enigmatic morpher, and develops a romantic connection. Together, they train with other powerful individuals to hone their skills and build a powerful force. Their abilities range from telekinesis, healing, to even the power of control over nature itself. However, the government launches a counter-attack, led by General Harding, who funds a program to create a group of soldiers, called \\"The Hunters,\\" augmented with abilities artificially extracted from captured and imprisoned Others. Throughout their journey, Alex and the group face fearsome encounters with these Hunters, as well as internal discord among The Others. While some want to use their powers to fight for control, others genuinely wish to find a common ground and live peacefully among the humans. As the conflict escalates, tough choices are made, and great sacrifices are required from all sides, testing Alex's beliefs and resolve. In a final confrontation, General Harding reveals that he is also one of The Others – a traitor who has sided with the government in exchange for power. Alex's electrokinetic powers, combined with the abilities of the Awakening members, manage to overthrow the General – but at a significant cost, with the tragic death of Lila. Despite the heavy losses, a sense of hope emerged from the darkness. The government, now aware that many of its own members have hidden abilities, comes to the realization that they cannot win this war and that collaboration is the only way forward. The movie ends with a tentative truce between The Humans and The Others, as the two sides come together to rebuild a society that accepts and celebrates their differences. The Awakening of The Others leaves its audience in awe, showing that the true power lies within unity and understanding – as Alex and her friends learn to embrace their unique abilities and work together towards a brighter future."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Information: - Tripoli (; Berber: \\"rables\\") is the capital city and the largest city of Libya. Tripoli, with its metropolitan area, has a population of about 1.1 million people. The city is located in the northwestern part of Libya on the edge of the desert, on a point of rocky land projecting into the Mediterranean and forming a bay. Tripoli includes the Port of Tripoli and the country's largest commercial and manufacturing centre. It is also the site of the University of Tripoli. The vast Bab al-Azizia barracks, which includes the former family estate of Muammar Gaddafi, is also located in the city. Colonel Gaddafi largely ruled the country from his residence in this barracks. - A militia is generally an army or some other type of fighting unit that is composed of non-professional fighters, citizens of a nation or subjects of a state or government who can be called upon to enter a combat situation, as opposed to a professional force of regular, full-time military personnel, or historically, members of the warrior nobility class (e.g., knights or samurai). Unable to hold their own against properly trained and equipped professional forces, it is common for militias to engage in guerrilla warfare or defense instead of being used in open attacks and offensive actions. - The Battle of Plattsburgh, also known as the Battle of Lake Champlain, ended the final invasion of the northern states of the United States during the War of 1812. A British army under Lieutenant General Sir George Prévost and a naval squadron under Captain George Downie converged on the lakeside town of Plattsburgh, which was defended by New York and Vermont militia and detachments of regular troops of the United States Army, all under the command of Brigadier General Alexander Macomb, and ships commanded by Master Commandant Thomas Macdonough. Downie's squadron attacked shortly after dawn on 11 September 1814, but was defeated after a hard fight in which Downie was killed. Prévost then abandoned the attack by land against Macomb's defences and retreated to Canada, stating that even if Plattsburgh was captured, any British troops there could not be supplied without control of the lake. - Thomas Macdonough , Jr. ( December 21 , 1783 -- November 10 , 1825 ) was an early - 19th - century American naval officer noted for his roles in the first Barbary War and the War of 1812 . He was the son of a revolutionary officer , Thomas Macdonough , Sr. who lived near Middletown , Delaware . He was the sixth child from a family of ten siblings and was raised in the countryside . He entered naval life at an early age , receiving a midshipman 's commission at the age of sixteen . Serving with Stephen Decatur at Tripoli , he was a member of \`\` Preble 's Boys '' , a select group of U.S. naval officers who served under the command of Commodore Preble during the First Barbary War . Macdonough achieved fame during the War of 1812 , commanding the American naval forces that defeated the British navy at the Battle of Lake Champlain , part of the larger Battle of Plattsburgh , which helped lead to an end to that war . - Colonel (abbreviated Col., Col or COL and pronounced , similar to \\"kernel\\") is a senior military officer rank below the general officer ranks. However, in some small military forces, such as those of Iceland or the Vatican, colonel is the highest rank. It is also used in some police forces and paramilitary organizations. - Lieutenant-General Sir George Prévost, 1st Baronet (19 May 1767 5 January 1816) was a British Army officer and colonial administrator. Prévost wrongfully became known as the \\"defender of Canada\\" for his alleged leadership during the War of 1812. See \\"Letters of Veritas\\" as written by various high ranking officials of the time. Born in Hackensack, New Jersey, the eldest son of Swiss French Augustine Prévost, he joined the British Army as a youth and became a captain in 1784. Prévost served in the West Indies during the French Revolutionary Wars and the Napoleonic Wars, and was commander of St. Vincent from 1794 to 1796. He became Lieutenant-Governor of Saint Lucia from 1798 to 1802 and Governor of Dominica from 1802 to 1805. He is best known to history for serving as both the civilian Governor General and the military Commander in Chief in British North America (now part of Canada) during the War of 1812 between Britain and the United States of America. See letters of Veritas by Sewell take note of allegations of treason around p 84. Many concrete examples of questionnable activities, and described as a coward with no honor on p.120. Comments were made in writing by multiple high ranking military personnel - The War of 1812 was a military conflict that lasted from June 1812 to February 1815, fought between the United States of America and the United Kingdom, its North American colonies, and its Native American allies. Historians in the United States and Canada see it as a war in its own right, but the British often see it as a minor theatre of the Napoleonic Wars. By the war's end in early 1815, the key issues had been resolved and peace returned with no boundary changes. - Officer Cadet is a rank held by military cadets during their training to become commissioned officers. In the United Kingdom, the rank is also used by members of University Royal Naval Units, University Officer Training Corps and University Air Squadron. - George Downie (19 January 1778 11 September 1814) was a Scottish officer of the British Royal Navy who, during the War of 1812, commanded a British squadron which fought an American squadron on Lake Champlain in the Battle of Plattsburgh, during which he was killed. - The Royal Navy (RN) is the United Kingdom's naval warfare force. Although warships were used by the English kings from the early medieval period, the first major maritime engagements were fought in the Hundred Years War against the kingdom of France. The modern Royal Navy traces its origins to the early 16th century; the oldest of the UK's armed services, it is known as the Senior Service. - A midshipman is an officer cadet or a commissioned officer candidate of the junior-most rank, in the Royal Navy, United States Navy, and many Commonwealth navies. Commonwealth countries which use the rank include Canada, Australia, Bangladesh, Namibia, New Zealand, South Africa, India, Pakistan, Singapore, Sri Lanka, and Kenya. - The Napoleonic Wars (1803-1815) were a series of major conflicts pitting the French Empire and its allies, led by Napoleon I, against a fluctuating array of European powers formed into various coalitions, primarily led and financed by the United Kingdom. The wars resulted from the unresolved disputes associated with the French Revolution and the Revolutionary Wars, which had raged on for years before concluding with the Treaty of Amiens in 1802. The resumption of hostilities the following year paved the way for more than a decade of constant warfare often categorized into five conflicts: the War of the Third Coalition (1805), the War of the Fourth Coalition (1806-7), the War of the Fifth Coalition (1809), the War of the Sixth Coalition (1813), and the War of the Seventh Coalition (1815). The Napoleonic Wars had profound consequences for global and European history, leading to the spread of nationalism and liberalism, the rise of the British Empire as the world's premier power, the independence movements in Latin America and the collapse of the Spanish Empire, the fundamental reorganization of German and Italian territories into larger states, and the establishment of radically new methods in warfare. - Muammar Mohammed Abu Minyar Gaddafi (20 October 2011), commonly known as Colonel Gaddafi, was a Libyan revolutionary, politician, and political theorist. He governed Libya as Revolutionary Chairman of the Libyan Arab Republic from 1969 to 1977 and then as the \\"Brotherly Leader\\" of the Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya from 1977 to 2011. He was initially ideologically committed to Arab nationalism and Arab socialism, but he came to rule according to his own Third International Theory before embracing Pan-Africanism. Born near Sirte, Gaddafi was the son of an impoverished Bedouin goat herder. He became involved in politics while at school in Sabha, later enrolling in the Royal Military Academy, Benghazi. He founded a revolutionary cell within the military; in 1969, they seized power from the monarchy of King Idris in a bloodless coup. Gaddafi became Chairman of the governing Revolutionary Command Council (RCC); he then abolished the monarchy and proclaimed the Republic, ruling by decree. He implemented measures to remove what he viewed as foreign imperialist influence from Libya, and strengthened ties to Arab nationalist governments, particularly Gamal Abdel Nasser's Egypt. He was intent on pushing Libya towards \\"Islamic socialism\\", introducing \\"sharia\\" as the basis for the legal system and nationalising the oil industry, using the increased revenues to bolster the military, implement social programs, and fund revolutionary militants across the world. In 1973, he initiated a \\"Popular Revolution\\" with the formation of General People's Committees (GPCs), purported to be a system of direct democracy, but retained personal control over major decisions. He outlined his Third International Theory that year, publishing these ideas in \\"The Green Book\\". In 1977, Gaddafi dissolved the Republic and created a new socialist state called the \\"Jamahiriya\\" (\\"state of the masses\\"), officially adopting a symbolic role in governance. He retained power as military commander-in-chief and head of the Revolutionary... What is the relationship between 'thomas macdonough' and 'colonel'? A:","completion":"Thomas Macdonough was an early 19th-century American naval officer who gained fame during the War of 1812.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. I have a new situation: Two mycologists were studying fungi. Max studied regular fungi, while Red studied dimorphic fungi. They were both fascinated by their findings. But I can use this background: Some fungi take on different shapes, depending on their environmental conditions. These fungi are called dimorphic fungi , because they have “two forms.” For example, the fungus Histoplasma capsulatum , which causes the disease histoplasmosis, is thermally dimorphic; it has two forms that are dependent on temperature. In temperatures of about 25°C, it grows as a brownish mycelium, and looks like a mass of threads. At body temperature (37°C in humans), it grows as single, round yeast cells. What is an answer for this question: Which person learned less about fungi that take on different shapes?","completion":"Based on the information provided, it appears that Max, who studied regular fungi, learned less about fungi that take on different shapes. The reason for this is because you specified that Red studied dimorphic fungi, which are known for their ability to assume two distinct forms based on their environmental conditions. Dimorphic fungi, like Histoplasma capsulatum you mentioned, can shift between a mycelium form (that looks like a mass of threads) at cooler temperatures around 25°C to a yeast form (single, round cells) at body temperature around 37°C. This ability to morph based on temperature (thermal dimorphism) is a defining characteristic of dimorphic fungi. On the other hand, regular fungi, which Max investigated, may not display this particular dimorphism trait - the ability to change their physical structure based on environmental conditions. Therefore, it can be inferred that Max learned less about fungi that can change their shape compared to Red."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: My father's reaction to the bank building at 43rd Street and Fifth Avenue in New York city was immediate and definite: \\"You won't catch me putting my money in there!\\" he declared, \\"Not in that glass box!\\" Of course, my father is a gentleman of the old school, a member of the generation to whom a good deal of modern architecture is upsetting, but I am convinced that his negative response was not so much to the architecture as to a violation of his concept of the nature of money. In his generation money was thought of as a real commodity that could be carried, or stolen. Consequently, to attract the custom of a sensible man, a bank had to have heavy walls, barred windows, and bronze doors, to affirm the fact, however untrue, that money would be safe inside. If a building's design made it appear impenetrable , the institution was necessarily reliable, and the meaning of the heavy wall as an architecture symbol reflected people's prevailing attitude toward money. But the attitude toward money has, of course, changed. Excepting pocket money, cash of any kind is now rarely used; money as a has largely been replaced by credit. A deficit economy, accompanied by huge expansion, has led us to think of money as product of the creative imagination. The banker no longer offers us a safe: he offers us a service in which the most valuable element is the creativity for the invention of large numbers. It is in no way surprising, in view of this change in attitude, that we are witnessing the disappearance of the heavy-walled bank. Just as the older bank emphasized its strength, this bank by its architecture boasts of imaginative powers. From this point of view it is hard to say where architecture ends and human assertion begins. Question: 38. The words \\"tangible commodity\\" (Line 2, Para. 4) refer to something _ .

Q: Gunshots rang out once again on a campus in the United States on Wednesday. Students and faculty raced out of harm's way, ducked under furniture, barricaded doors and hid in interior rooms, bathrooms and labs. The short-lived nightmare on the campus of the University of California, Los Angeles came one day before Wear Orange: National Gun Violence Awareness Day. Wear Orange was inspired by friends of Hadiya Pendleton, a 15-year-old Chicago high school student killed by gunfire in 2013. The group decided to honor her life by wearing orange — the color worn by hunters in the woods to protect themselves and others. While the idea has been embraced by civic organizations, politicians and celebrities, it has been rejected by gun rights advocates. The National Rifle Association has attacked the campaign as \\"pointless,\\" and said \\"participating is an easy way of scoring points for being 'socially conscious.'\\" Here is a look at the unique relationship between Americans and their guns. Any law-abiding citizen in the United States is allowed to own or carry a gun. That right comes from the U.S. Bill of Rights and the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. It says: \\"A well-regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.\\" The Second Amendment was based partially on English common law, which describes an auxiliary right, supporting the natural rights of self-defense, resistance to oppression, and the civic duty to act in concert in defense of the state. To purchase a gun in the majority of states, a person needs to be of age, pass the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check and fill out a firearms transaction record. However, background checks are not currently required for private sales, including those conducted at gun shows. Certain people are banned from owning weapons, including convicted criminals, people with mental health illnesses or non-U.S. citizens. But the system has major holes in it. According to the above context, answer the following question. After the events of the story, the NRA still: A:","completion":"Opposes the Wear Orange campaign and calls it \\"pointless,\\" arguing that participating is an easy way of scoring points for being \\"socially conscious.\\""},{"prompt":"Given the question: Title: Granddaughtered loved it Product review: My 4 year old granddaughter wanted to get this from the library so that was an easy yes.

First, let's combine the parts with \\"w\\" in them: (-273 - 316) * w = -589 * w Now the problem looks like: -589 * w + 13621 - 1841 = 0 2. Next, let's deal with the numbers. Subtract 1841 from 13621: 13621 - 1841 = 11780 Now the problem looks like: -589 * w + 11780 = 0 3. To solve for \\"w\\", we need to get it alone on one side of the equation. Let's move the 11780 to the other side by subtracting it from both sides: -589 * w = -11780 4. Finally, let's find the value of \\"w\\" by dividing both sides by -589: w = -11780 / -589 When we divide the numbers, we get: w = 20 So, the solution to the problem is w = 20.

Roy Barnes will spend his first day as a private citizen by starting his new job as a full-time, pro-bono (unpaid) lawyer at the Atlanta Legal Aid Society. The decision by Barnes, the most improbable casualty of Election Day 2002, to go to work for legal aid was almost as unexpected as his November defeat. As a legal services attorney, Barnes will help women escape domestic violence, Mauricio Vivero is vice president seniors fight predatory lending scams and parents obtain child support for their kids. of Legal In doing so, he will take his place on the front line of the U.S. legal community's Services Corporation, the uphill and underpublicized struggle to achieve equal access to justice for millions of Washington-Americans too poor to afford legal representation. based nonprofit corporation chartered by The inaccessibility of the U.S. civil justice system is hardly a new development, but it Congress in took Barnes' decision to put the national media spotlight on our country's ongoing 1974 to promote equal access to access-to-justice crisis. civil justice. The 2000 U.S. census reports that more than 43 million Americans qualify for free federally funded legal assistance, yet fewer than 20 percent of eligible clients (annual income: 11,075 or less) are able to obtain legal help when they need it, according to the American Bar Association. In Georgia, there is just one legal aid lawyer for every 10,500 eligible poor people. Barnes understood this problem long before he became governor. While in private practice, he handled many pro-bono cases and was a frequent volunteer in the Cobb County office of the federally funded Atlanta Legal Aid Society. Most memorably, he secured a 115 million judgment in 1993 against Fleet Finance for victimizing 18,000 homeowners -- many of them senior citizens -- with its widespread predatory lending mortgage practices. His long-standing commitment to the underserved is certainly admirable, but it should not be viewed as a rare and laudable act of civic virtue. To be admitted to practice law, every attorney must take a professional oath to promote justice -- and every state's ethical rules include language indicating lawyers' responsibility to be guardians of fair play for those living in poverty. In Georgia, many law firms, corporations and private attorneys are working pro bono to serve the neediest clients. Yet only 23 percent of the state's 23,598 active lawyers reported meeting the Georgia State Bar's goal of 50 hours of pro-bono service in 2002. The need for volunteers is most severe outside the five-county Atlanta metropolitan area, where 70 percent of the state's poor people are served by only 24 percent of the state's lawyers. National pro-bono participation is even worse. Only 23 percent of the roughly 1 million attorneys in America volunteer even one hour of pro-bono service annually, according to the ABA.

Here is a goal: How to glue your saw blade attachment together? How would you accomplish this goal?","completion":"To accomplish the goal of gluing a saw blade attachment together, please follow these steps: Step 1: Gather materials Gather the broken pieces of the saw blade attachment, a strong adhesive suitable for metal (such as epoxy resin or a metal bonding glue), gloves, a clean cloth or paper towel, and sandpaper or a steel brush. Step 2: Assess the damage Examine the broken pieces of the saw blade attachment to determine whether they can be glued back together effectively. If the damage is too severe or the pieces are missing, it may be more effective and safer to replace the attachment. Step 3: Clean and prep the damaged areas Put on gloves, and use the clean cloth or paper towel to remove any dirt, grease, or debris from the broken surfaces. Then, use the sandpaper or a steel brush to roughen the surfaces to help the adhesive bond more effectively. Step 4: Mix the adhesive Following the instructions on the adhesive's packaging, mix the adhesive as directed. For epoxy-based adhesives, it's usually a 1:1 ratio, but be sure to check the manufacturer's specifications. Step 5: Apply the adhesive Carefully apply a thin layer of adhesive to the broken surfaces, ensuring that the adhesive covers the entire area that will be joined. Step 6: Attach the pieces Press the broken pieces together firmly, and hold them in place for a few seconds to allow the adhesive to begin bonding. Step 7: Secure the attachment while the adhesive cures To ensure a strong bond, find a way to keep the pieces securely in place while the adhesive cures (this may take several hours, depending on the adhesive used). You can use clamps, rubber bands, or tape, but ensure you don't apply pressure directly on the glued surfaces to avoid misplacement. Step 8: Wait for the adhesive to cure Let the adhesive cure for the recommended time listed on the adhesive's packaging (usually 24 hours). Avoid using the saw blade attachment during this time to prevent any strain on the glued area. Step 9: Test the repair After the adhesive has fully cured, remove the clamps, rubber bands, or tape and test the saw blade attachment for any signs of weakness or improper bonding. If the repair is successful and the attachment is securely in place, you can consider the task completed. Note: Keep in mind that depending on the damage, gluing a saw blade attachment may not be the safest or most effective solution. Always evaluate the situation and consider replacing the attachment if it poses a risk during operation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Question: Which job does Ellis obtain? Movie title: Black Book Movie plot: In 1944, Rachel Stein, a Dutch-Jewish singer who had lived in Berlin before the war, is hiding from the Nazi regime in the occupied Netherlands. When the farmhouse where she had been hiding is accidentally destroyed by an American bomber, Rachel manages to escape the area thanks to a local man, Rob, and visits a lawyer named Smaal, who provides her with some of her father's money so that she can flee, helped by a man named Van Gein. Rachel and Rob are reunited with her family and try to flee by boat through the Biesbosch with other Jews from the Nazi-occupied part of the Netherlands to the liberated southern part of the country. However, it turns out to be a trap. They are ambushed on the river by members of the German SS, who kill them and rob the bodies of their cash and other valuables. Rachel alone survives, but she does not manage to escape from occupied territory. Using a non-Jewish alias, Ellis de Vries, Rachel becomes involved with a Dutch resistance group in the Hague, under the leadership of Gerben Kuipers and working closely with a doctor in the Resistance, Hans Akkermans. Smaal is in touch with this Resistance cell. When Kuipers' son and other members of the Resistance are captured, Ellis agrees to help by seducing local SD commander HauptsturmfÃ¼hrer Ludwig MÃ¼ntze, bleaching all of her hair blonde. MÃ¼ntze invites her to a party at the local SD headquarters, and there, Ellis recognises ObersturmfÃ¼hrer GÃ¼nther Franken, MÃ¼ntze's brutal deputy, as the SS officer who oversaw the massacre of her refugee party.

From 1911 to 2013, Seattle's nine city councillors were elected at large, rather than by geographic subdivisions. For the 2015 election, this changed to a hybrid system of seven district members and two at-large members as a result of a ballot measure passed on November 5, 2013. The only other elected offices are the city attorney and Municipal Court judges. All city offices are officially non-partisan.Like some other parts of the United States, government and laws are also run by a series of ballot initiatives (allowing citizens to pass or reject laws), referenda (allowing citizens to approve or reject legislation already passed), and propositions (allowing specific government agencies to propose new laws or tax increases directly to the people). Jenny Durkan was elected as mayor in the 2017 mayoral election and took office on November 28, 2017. The mayor's office also includes two deputy mayors, appointed to advise the mayor on policies; As of 2017, the city's deputy mayors are Michael Fong and Shefali Ranganathan.Seattle's political culture is very liberal and progressive for the United States, with over 80% of the population voting for the Democratic Party. All precincts in Seattle voted for Democratic Party candidate Barack Obama in the 2012 presidential election. In partisan elections for the Washington State Legislature and United States Congress, nearly all elections are won by Democrats. Although local elections are nonpartisan, most of the city's elected officials are known to be Democrats. In 1926, Seattle became the first major American city to elect a female mayor, Bertha Knight Landes. It has also elected an openly gay mayor, Ed Murray, and a third-party socialist councillor, Kshama Sawant.

(October 2015) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Three young American tourists, Alex (Josh Duhamel), his sister Bea (Olivia Wilde), and a friend Amy (Beau Garrett), are backpacking in Brazil. They decide to go by bus and visit parts of the country instead of flying directly to the Northeastern beaches they wish to visit. After a bus crash leaves all the passengers stranded, they are joined by two English men, Finn (Desmond Askew) and Liam (Max Brown), and an Australian woman, Pru (Melissa George), who is fluent in Portuguese. The group find a cabana bar where several other tourists and locals are partying. After spending the day on the beach, they are served drugged drinks and pass out. The next morning, they awaken on the deserted beach, robbed of their luggage, money, and documents. Looking for help in the nearby village, they encounter conflict with locals as they see some of their belongings worn or lying around. Offering help, Kiko (Agles Steib), a local who speaks some English, volunteers to take them to an isolated cabin in the forest, where they can wait for help. In a long walk through the wilderness, Kiko shows them a âsecret\\" cave beneath a waterfall, but, taking a bad dive into the river, Kiko hits the rocky bottom, and is rendered unconscious and begins bleeding profusely from a cut in his head. Proceeding to the cabin in the jungle, they find food, clothes, and a number of prescription drugs, as well as a drawer filled with other peopleâs passports. They manage to heal Kiko's wound and reluctantly decide to spend the night at the cabin. They are awakened in the middle of the night by a helicopter bringing Zamora (Miguel Lunardi), a physician, and a few associates and doctors, surrounded by armed henchmen.

If So as I said, the story of the baby-sitting co-op helps me remain hopeful in times of depression., can we conclude that \\"The story of the co-op of babysitting makes me feel sad.\\"?","completion":"The statement \\"The story of the co-op of babysitting makes me feel sad\\" appears to be contradicting the initial statement, which expresses that the baby-sitting co-op story brings a sense of hope during times of depression. To understand this better, let us analyze the two statements. In the first statement - \\"So as I said, the story of the baby-sitting co-op helps me remain hopeful in times of depression,\\" it is clear that the individual finds a sense of hope, motivation, and positivity from the baby-sitting co-op story when faced with challenging situations like depression. The story could possibly inspire the individual with the valuable lessons of cooperation, shared responsibility, and the ability to overcome obstacles by working together. This suggests that the story serves as a reminder that better times are possible with combined effort and mutual support. On the other hand, the second statement - \\"The story of the co-op of babysitting makes me feel sad\\" - contradicts the positive sentiments expressed in the first statement. This would imply that the baby-sitting co-op story evokes feelings of sadness and is not as inspiring as initially stated. Perhaps the story is bittersweet, or it might have elements that resonate negatively with the individual. However, based on the information provided, it appears that the first statement is more reflective of the individual's true feelings towards the baby-sitting co-op story. As such, we cannot conclude that \\"The story of the co-op of babysitting makes me feel sad\\" without further clarification or context. It is essential to understand the specific aspects of the baby-sitting co-op story that the individual finds hopeful or sad; this will help us better distinguish their emotions and evaluate the role of the story in their emotional state.

Road to Perdition, a movie undeservedly overlooked at that year Oscars is the second work of Sam Mendes (and in my opinion his best work), a director who three years before won Oscar for his widely acclaimed but controversial American Beauty. This is a terrific movie, and at the same time ultimately poignant and sad. It's a story of a relatively wealthy and happy family from outward appearance during difficult times of Depression when the, Michael Sullivan, a father of two children, played by great Tom Hanks (I'm not his admirer but ought to say that) is a hit-man for local mafia boss, played by Paul Newman. His eldest son, a thirteen years boy Michael Sullivan Jr., perfectly played by young Tyler Hoechlin, after years of blissful ignorance finds out what is his father job and on what money their family live. Prompted by his curiosity and his aspiration to know truth he accidentally becomes a witness of a murder, committed by John Rooney, son of his father boss. Such discovery strikes an innocent soul and it caused numerous events that changed his life forever. The atmosphere of the period, all the backgrounds and decorations are perfectly created, editing and cinematography are almost flawless while the story is well written. But the main line of the movie, the most important moments and points of the movie and the key factor of the movie success are difficult father-son relations in bad times. They are shown so deeply, strong and believable. Tom Hanks does excellent and has one of the best performances of his career in a quite unusual role for him and all acting across the board is superb. Finally worth to mention a very nice score by Paul Newman and in the result we get an outstanding work of all people involved in making this beautiful (but one more time sad) masterpiece. I believe Road to Perdition belongs to greatest achievements of film-making of this decade and undoubtedly one of the best films of the year. My grade 10 out of 10 Choose your answer.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Given the question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: Yes. I had a stress heart attack five years ago. My step-son is a heroin addict. He will be on an opioid agonist for the rest of his life. His behavior mirrored the worst of what addicts do to a family. I was desperate to make a change, and my husband was desperate to save his son’s life. That meant having to watch my husband support my step-son as he abused me and my children. Multiple criminal behaviors, many times the police came to the house, two convictions, long-term parole. Watching him threaten to kill me, kill his father, and kill his younger brother and sister. Add to that a very stress job situation with a new boss who decided he needed a new VP, but had no basis to terminate my employment, so instead was determined to make my work life a living hell on earth. So, yep, I had a heart attack. I’m still angry at everything that led up to the heart attack. I’m working really hard on forgiving my husband, forgiving my step-son, and the overwhelming guilt of my children seeing me as an accomplice to their abuse. I found a new job, and then had the pleasure of seeing my former boss fired by the Board of Directors. Since then I find I’m hyper-vigilant in issues of child abuse, worker abuse, addiction, lying and deceit (Trump trigger), and feeling somewhat betrayed by my husband. I honestly think if it had been one of my children doing the abusing, I would have found a way to put my child into long-term rehab. I would not have pretended it wasn’t happening, or “not that bad” or other form of denial. As is, I lived through this hell for two years, and a part of me will never forgive for how it all came about. Probably TMI, sorry.

A new survey suggests these clubs are the only way many students can get a meal before lessons. About 54% of the 552 school staff questioned by the Association of Teachers and Lecturers(ATL)said their school provides a breakfast club for pupils. The biggest reason for them to attend these clubs is that their parents or carer goes to work early, cited by 76.8% of those questioned. About 22.6% said children attended due to lack of money at home because parents or carers are unemployed and 15.2% said lack of money at home due to changes or cuts to benefits. About 17.6% said pupils mainly attend breakfast clubs to socialize. The survey found that teachers believe that offering breakfast to pupils often helps improve their concentration and ability to learn. One primary school teacher said: \\"Although there is a charge for our breakfast club, we have accessed funding for those pupils on free school meals and the breakfast club had an effect on their attendance, concentration and being in school for the start of lessons. ATL general secretary Dr Roper said a nutritious meal at the start of the day has a huge impact on pupils' ability to learn. \\"Many schools do everything they can to ensure children eat well during school term-time.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Answer by taking a quote from the following article: The Illyrians (Ancient Greek: Illurioi, Illyrioi; Latin: Illyrii or Illyri) were a group of Indo-European tribes in antiquity, who inhabited part of the western Balkans. The territory the Illyrians inhabited came to be known as Illyria to Greek and Roman authors, who identified a territory that corresponds to Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Slovenia, Montenegro, part of Serbia and most of central and northern Albania, between the Adriatic Sea in the west, the Drava river in the north, the Morava river in the east and the mouth of the Aoos river in the south. The first account of Illyrian peoples comes from the Periplus of Pseudo-Scylax, an ancient Greek text of the middle of the 4th century BC that describes coastal passages in the Mediterranean. The name \\"Illyrians\\", as applied by the ancient Greeks to their northern neighbors, may have referred to a broad, ill-defined group of peoples, and it is today unclear to what extent they were linguistically and culturally homogeneous. Illyria appears in Greco-Roman historiography from the 4th century BC. The Illyrians formed several kingdoms in the central Balkans, and the first known Illyrian king was Bardyllis. Illyrian kingdoms were often at war with ancient Macedonia, and the Illyrian pirates were also a significant danger to neighbouring peoples. At the Neretva Delta, there was a strong Hellenistic influence on the Illyrian tribe of Daors. Their capital was Daorson located in Osanici near Stolac in Herzegovina, which became the main center of classical Illyrian culture. Daorson, during the 4th century BC, was surrounded by megalithic, 5 meter high stonewalls, composed out of large trapeze stones blocks. Daors also made unique bronze coins and sculptures. The Illyrians even conquered Greek colonies on the Dalmatian islands. Queen Teuta was famous for having waged wars against the Romans. After Philip II of Macedon defeated Bardylis (358 BC), the Grabaei under Grabos became the strongest state in Illyria. Philip II killed 7,000 Illyrians in a great victory and annexed the territory up to Lake Ohrid. Next, Philip II reduced the Grabaei, and then went for the Ardiaei, defeated the Triballi (339 BC), and fought with Pleurias (337 BC). In the Illyrian Wars of 229 BC, 219 BC and 168 BC Rome overran the Illyrian settlements and suppressed the piracy that had made the Adriatic unsafe for Italian commerce. There were three campaigns, the first against Teuta the second against Demetrius of Pharos and the third against Gentius. The initial campaign in 229 BC marks the first time that the Roman Navy crossed the Adriatic Sea to launch an invasion. The Roman Republic subdued the Illyrians during the 2nd century BC. An Illyrian revolt was crushed under Augustus, resulting in the division of Illyria in the provinces of Pannonia in the north and Dalmatia in the south. Were they peaceful or warlike?","completion":"The Illyrians were a group of tribes that lived long ago in the western Balkans, which is now a part of countries like Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Slovenia. They were not always peaceful. In fact, they often fought wars with other kingdoms, like ancient Macedonia. They also had pirates who were dangerous to their neighbors. So, while they might have had some peaceful times, they were often involved in wars and battles."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Saving natural resources: Recycling helps save important materials like trees, water, and minerals. When we recycle, we can use those materials again and again instead of taking more from the Earth. 2. Reducing pollution: Making new things from old materials creates less pollution than making new things from new materials. For example, recycling paper means we don't have to cut down as many trees, which helps keep the air clean. 3. Saving energy: Recycling usually uses less energy than making products from new materials. That means we don't need to use as much electricity, which can help save our environment. 4. Helping wildlife: Recycling helps protect the homes of animals and plants, because we use fewer natural resources. This means there's less disruption to their habitats. 5. Creating jobs: Recycling centers often provide jobs for people in Maryland, so more people can have work to support their families. 6. Saving landfill space: Landfills are places where we put our trash. By recycling, we don't need to put as much trash into landfills.

And protein is the perfect source of amino acid building blocks needed for new muscle growth and repair. Taken together, strength training and sufficient protein will stimulate new muscle protein synthesis. Note that the keyword here is sufficient, because this is where protein supplement marketers like to extend to “the more the better”. So how much protein do sportspeople need? Consensus position statements such as those produced by the American College of Sports Medicine give the range of 1.2 grams to 1.7 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight. But the top end of that range is for elite endurance athletes, power sportspeople and those in the early stages of a strength training phase. The “recreational athlete”, which describes the majority of active sportspeople, should aim for the bottom end of the range. So how do those protein requirement numbers stack up against a regular diet? Protein intake and body weights collected in the 2011-2012 Australian Health Survey, as an example, show the average Australian male already eats 1.2 grams and the average female 1.1 grams of protein per kilogram body weight. And this is for mostly sedentary people who are not following any special “high protein” training diet. Sportspeople do have higher energy needs. But by simply eating a greater volume of food with a focus on higher protein content, it’s very feasible for an athlete to get their protein requirements from food alone. This has been backed up by research; numerous dietary surveys show the normal diet of strength-based athletes provides around two grams of protein per kilogram body weight per day. And that’s before using any protein powders. But protein supplements can’t be dismissed altogether. There are circumstances where supplementation is an appropriate and convenient option for athletes, such as when travelling, or during an intense training schedule. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: When should sportspeople consider taking protein supplements? Options: - When they are fasting - When they are traveling - not enough information - When they are eating a high protein meal Answer:","completion":"When they are traveling"},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

The Rock referred to in the premise is called the Foundation Stone and is deeply entrenched in the religious history of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. According to the sacred texts of these faiths, the Foundation Stone is believed to be the point from which the world was created and a place where significant religious events have taken place. In Judaism, the Foundation Stone is considered the place where creation began and holds significant importance as the site where Abraham almost sacrificed his son, Isaac. While Christians believe that the Foundation Stone lies inside the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, the Islamic tradition points to the stone being located in the Dome of the Rock, a shrine that sits on the Temple Mount alongside the Al-Aqsa Mosque. In Islamic tradition, the Foundation Stone is significant for two main reasons. Firstly, it is believed to be the location where Prophet Ibrahim (Abraham in Islamic tradition) was ordered to sacrifice his son Ismail (Ishmael), not Isaac as stated in the premise. However, the story of the sacrifice is similar in both religions, where God commanded Abraham to sacrifice his son and then stopped him at the last moment as a test of his faith. Secondly, the Foundation Stone is also associated with Prophet Muhammad's Night Journey, known as Al-Isra' and Al-Miraj, during which he led prayers with the previous prophets and then ascended to the heavens to meet Allah. Based on the information provided, the hypothesis – \\"The rock on which Abraham was ordered to sacrifice his son now resides on the floor of the mosque\\" – can be considered as true within the context of the Islamic religious tradition. In this context, the rock, known as the Foundation Stone, is believed to be situated on the floor of the Dome of the Rock on the Temple Mount, adjacent to the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem. It holds deep religious significance in Islamic, Jewish, and Christian traditions and symbolizes the site where significant religious events have occurred, including Abraham's sacrifice and Prophet Muhammad's ascension to the heavens. However, it is important to note that the differing interpretations of this sacred stone across religious traditions mean that this hypothesis's validity may be subjective and vary according to each individual's belief system."},{"prompt":"Some scientists have suggested that it might in some cases be ethically acceptable to clone existing people.

But society ought to be concerned that a couple might not treat naturally a child who is a copy of just one of them. Because other methods are available for the treatment of all known types of infertility, the traditional choice seems more appropriate. None of the suggested uses of cloning for making copies of existing people is ethically acceptable to my way of thinking, because they are not in the interests of the resulting child. It should go without saying that I am strongly opposed to allowing cloned human embryos to develop so that they can be tissue donors. In spite of this, it seems clear that cloning from cultured cells will offer important medical opportunities. Predictions about new technologies are often wrong: societal attitudes change; unexpected developments occur. Time will tell. But biomedical researchers looking into the potential of cloning now have plenty to do. In the author's view, which of the following uses of cloning is reasonable? A) To replace a lost . B) To help childless couples to have a baby. C) To develop tissue donors. D) To culture cells for medical purpose.

However, it is possible to make some assumptions and try to infer whether this review leans more towards a positive or negative view of the movie. \\"Unrelated shorts\\" could suggest a film that is composed of several short stories or scenes that are not directly connected to each other. This term could be interpreted in different ways, depending on the context and the preferences of the reviewer. Some potential interpretations are: 1. If the reviewer enjoys films that feature multiple unrelated stories or favors a disjointed narrative style, the review might lean more towards positive. In this case, the term \\"unrelated shorts\\" could be regarded as a compliment, as the reviewer might appreciate the innovation and variety provided by the film's structure. 2. On the other hand, if the reviewer prefers films with a cohesive plot and clear connections between the different sequences, \\"unrelated shorts\\" might imply a negative opinion. This interpretation could mean that the movie lacks coherence and unity, making it unfulfilling for someone who values a linear structure. To determine whether the review has a positive or negative opinion about the movie, more context would be needed. The tone of the review, any accompanying text, or the scoring (if it involves points or stars) may give some clarity to the reviewer's stance.

Unfortunately, the attainment of such an all-consuming goal has not produced the peace and happiness that was expected. There was a dark side to success. Fairly recently, the question of balance and its impact on mental health and happiness has taken center stage in many circles of psychological research. Dozens of studies have been conducted and published on the subject as companies and individuals alike have noticed that their chaotic lifestyle has not produced the happiness they hoped to achieve. The cost has greatly outweighed the benefits. The majority of these studies agree on one thing – there is potential for incredible benefits from living a balanced life filled with interesting and varied experiences rather than living with an all-consuming focus on career. The studies also included some important findings about the effects of stress. Stress is not always detrimental to health and happiness. In fact, a bit of stress here and there is actually healthy, for both plants and animals – it stimulates growth and development. It depends on the source of the stress, how relentles it is, and how it is managed. The danger comes when relentless stress pounds the mind and body and the individuals accept it as the norm. They cope with it the best they can; but allow no time for recovery from the depletion of resources. Professional burnout from chronic stress debilitates the individual to the point that s/he can no longer function effectively on a personal or professional level. Psychology Today tells us that “Burnout is one of those road hazards in life that high-achievers really should be keeping a close eye out for, but sadly – often because of their “I can do everything” personalities, they rarely see it coming.” Why will stress be detrimental to a person?

Act 1: A Nation Divided The film opens with British India on the brink of gaining independence, with various political and religious factions at odds. The hardline, ambitious Saket Ram is a seasoned intelligence officer working for the British. Assigned to infiltrate Gandhi's inner circle, Saket forms a close bond with the deeply spiritual and altruistic leader. As Saket learns more about Gandhi's non-violent principles and his ultimate aim to unite the country through harmonious coexistence, he is profoundly affected. Despite his initial loathing towards the man, Saket slowly begins to embrace Gandhi's philosophy, and in one climactic scene, drapes himself in the Indian flag, symbolizing his newfound allegiance. Act 2: The Threat Looms Parallel to Saket's journey, we are introduced to Nathuram Godse, an extremist Hindu-nationalist with an unyielding belief in the sanctity of the Hindu religion. Eager to overthrow British rule and establish a purely Hindu state, Godse becomes increasingly enraged by Gandhi's calls for unity amongst all religious factions. As whispers of conspiracy float through the air, Saket, torn between his duty to the British and his loyalty to Gandhi, faces an impossible choice. He gathers intelligence on the brewing plot against Gandhi's life to prove his allegiance to his newfound mentor. As he unearths the dangerous web of intrigue surrounding the leader's enemies, Saket learns that Godse is the prime suspect in the assassination plot. Act 3: The Shadow of Betrayal With Godse tightening his grip around an unsuspecting Gandhi, Saket is given a final directive from his British superiors: Allow the assassination to proceed, or ensure Gandhi’s survival. Weighing the consequences, Saket makes the painful decision to abandon the British and protect his transformative mentor. In a thrilling race against time, Saket strategizes to protect Gandhi without blowing his cover. As January 30, 1948, approaches, Saket orchestrates a secret counterplot to divert Godse's attention, involving a handful of trusted confidants from within Gandhi’s circle and British intelligence. However, betrayal lurks in the shadow, and Godse catches wind of Saket's scheme. Confrontation and Climax On the fateful day, Saket, desperate to stop Godse, engages in a fierce rooftop chase to apprehend the assassin. In a heart-pounding nail-biting sequence, Saket manages to corner the determined extremist. A gripping exchange between the two men ensues, a battle of ideals, setting the stage for an unforgettable final moment. As they struggle, a gunshot rings through the air. Devastated, realizing his efforts were in vain, Saket races to where the heartbroken nation mourns the unthinkable – the assassination of their beloved Mahatma Gandhi. Epilogue In the aftermath, the film's powerful ending depicts a dejected Saket standing amidst the grieving masses. Seeming to make peace with his choice, he resolves to carry on Gandhi's legacy of unity and non-violence, despite the enormous cost it has taken upon him. “The Shadow of Betrayal” is a deeply emotional, intense thriller that explores the complexities of patriotism, loyalty, and the unwavering spirit of those who seek unity and understanding in a world divided."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Information: - A nebula (Latin for \\"cloud\\"; pl. nebulae, nebulæ, or nebulas) is an interstellar cloud of dust, hydrogen, helium and other ionized gases. Originally, \\"nebula\\" was a name for any diffuse astronomical object, including galaxies beyond the Milky Way. The Andromeda Galaxy, for instance, was once referred to as the \\"Andromeda Nebula\\" (and spiral galaxies in general as \\"spiral nebulae\\") before the true nature of galaxies was confirmed in the early 20th century by Vesto Slipher, Edwin Hubble and others. - In astronomy and physical cosmology, the metallicity or Z is the fraction of mass of a star or other kind of astronomical object that is not in hydrogen (X) or helium (Y). Most of the physical matter in the universe is in the form of hydrogen and helium, so astronomers use the word \\"metals\\" as a convenient short term for \\"all elements except hydrogen and helium\\". This usage is distinct from the usual physical definition of a solid metal. The rationale for the astronomical usage is that in the high-temperature and pressure environment of a star, atoms do not undergo chemical reactions and effectively have no chemical properties, including that of being a metal as usually understood. For example, stars and nebulae with relatively high abundances of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and neon are called \\"metal-rich\\" in astrophysical terms, even though those elements are non-metals in chemistry. - AB Doradus Moving Group is a group of about 30 associated stars that are moving through space together with the star AB Doradus . A moving group is distinguished by its members having about the same age , composition ( or metallicity ) and motion through space . Hence they most likely formed in the same location . This group is located about 20 parsecs from the Earth and is the closest known co-moving group . The average space velocity of this group has components of U = 8 , V = 27 and W = 14 km / s. About 10 of these stars form a nuclear group within a volume roughly 10 parsecs across . The proximity of this moving group makes it useful for studies of shared stellar properties , as well as detection of companions through direct imaging . These can be used for refinement of young stellar models , for example . - AB Doradus is a pre-main-sequence quadruple star system in the constellation Dorado. The primary is a flare star that shows periodic increases in activity. - Dorado (English pronunciation: ) is a constellation in the southern sky. It was named in the late 16th century and is now one of the 88 modern constellations. Its name refers to the dolphinfish (\\"Coryphaena hippurus\\"), which is known as \\"dorado\\" in Portuguese, although it has also been depicted as a swordfish.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"If the nasal passages are clear, it can facilitate more efficient air intake, as there will be less resistance and obstruction for the air to pass through. This can potentially lead to more oxygen being brought into the body, as a higher volume of air makes its way through the respiratory system. The perturbation, in this case, has a direct effect on the process. Clear nasal passages allow for easier and more efficient airflow, which in turn enhances the overall effectiveness of the oxygenation process.

Here is a question about this article: Zhejiang's main manufacturing sectors are electromechanical industries, textiles, chemical industries, food, and construction materials. In recent years Zhejiang has followed its own development model, dubbed the \\"Zhejiang model\\", which is based on prioritizing and encouraging entrepreneurship, an emphasis on small businesses responsive to the whims of the market, large public investments into infrastructure, and the production of low-cost goods in bulk for both domestic consumption and export. As a result, Zhejiang has made itself one of the richest provinces, and the \\"Zhejiang spirit\\" has become something of a legend within China. However, some economists now worry that this model is not sustainable, in that it is inefficient and places unreasonable demands on raw materials and public utilities, and also a dead end, in that the myriad small businesses in Zhejiang producing cheap goods in bulk are unable to move to more sophisticated or technologically more advanced industries. The economic heart of Zhejiang is moving from North Zhejiang, centered on Hangzhou, southeastward to the region centered on Wenzhou and Taizhou. The per capita disposable income of urbanites in Zhejiang reached 24,611 yuan (US3,603) in 2009, an annual real growth of 8.3%. The per capita pure income of rural residents stood at 10,007 yuan (US1,465), a real growth of 8.1% year-on-year. Zhejiang's nominal GDP for 2011 was 3.20 trillion yuan (US506 billion) with a per capita GDP of 44,335 yuan (US6,490). In 2009, Zhejiang's primary, secondary, and tertiary industries were worth 116.2 billion yuan (US17 billion), 1.1843 trillion yuan (US173.4 billion), and 982.7 billion yuan (US143.9 billion) respectively. What is the answer to this question: What is Zhejiang's own development model dubbed?","completion":"Zhejiang's own development model is called the \\"Zhejiang model\\".

Pierre Benjamin Monteux (pronounced [pjɛʁ mɔ̃.tø]; 4 April 1875 – 1 July 1964) was a French (later American) conductor. After violin and viola studies, and a decade as an orchestral player and occasional conductor, he began to receive regular conducting engagements in 1907. He came to prominence when, for Sergei Diaghilev's Ballets Russes company between 1911 and 1914, he conducted the world premieres of Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring and other prominent works including Petrushka, Ravel's Daphnis et Chloé, and Debussy's Jeux. Thereafter he directed orchestras around the world for more than half a century. From 1917 to 1919 Monteux was the principal conductor of the French repertoire at the Metropolitan Opera in New York. He led the Boston Symphony Orchestra (1919–24), Amsterdam Concertgebouw Orchestra (1924–34), Orchestre Symphonique de Paris (1929–38) and San Francisco Symphony (1936–52). In 1961, aged eighty-six, he accepted the chief conductorship of the London Symphony Orchestra, a post which he held until his death three years later. Although known for his performances of the French repertoire, his chief love was the music of German composers, above all Brahms. He disliked recording, finding it incompatible with spontaneity, but he nevertheless made a substantial number of records. Monteux was well known as a teacher. In 1932 he began a conducting class in Paris, which he developed into a summer school that was later moved to his summer home in Les Baux in the south of France. After moving permanently to the US in 1942, and taking American citizenship, he founded a school for conductors and orchestral musicians in Hancock, Maine. Among his students in France and America who went on to international fame were Lorin Maazel, Igor Markevitch, Neville Marriner, Seiji Ozawa, André Previn and David Zinman.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. This computer will connect well to the network. Our computers connected together. Does the word \\"connect\\" mean the same thing in the above two sentences?","completion":"The word \\"connect\\" essentially carries the same meaning in both sentences, which is to link or join something together, be it physically or digitally. However, the way \\"connect\\" is used in these two sentences pertains to slightly different contexts and actions. In the first sentence, \\"This computer will connect well to the network,\\" the emphasis is on the computer as an individual unit being able to establish a connection with a more extensive network, typically referring to the internet or a local area network (LAN). In this context, \\"connect\\" implies the act of successfully associating the computer with the network, ensuring proper communication, data transfer, and access to shared resources. It may involve various actions like plugging in an Ethernet cable, setting up a Wi-Fi connection, configuring network settings, and ensuring the computer is capable of communicating with other network devices or accessing the internet seamlessly. On the other hand, the second sentence, \\"Our computers connected together,\\" implies that all the computers being discussed are linked to each other, forming a collective unit. This can be understood as connecting multiple computers in a network, allowing them to interact, share resources, and communicate with each other. The focus is more on the unification of the computers in a closed setup that benefits all parties involved. This connection may be established by physical means like Ethernet cables or wirelessly through a router or other networking devices. In this sentence, \\"connect\\" might also involve the process of setting up shared folders, network printers, or file-sharing services to enhance collaboration and resource utilization among the computers. In conclusion, though the word \\"connect\\" means the same thing in both sentences, which is to join or link together, the contexts differ slightly. The first sentence focuses on a single computer establishing a connection with a network, while the second revolves around multiple computers networking with one another in a collective unit. These differences are subtle, but they emphasize various aspects of connectivity depending on the context."},{"prompt":"Given the question: Combine facts and answer this: Which came first: the birth of Rob Zombie or the formation of the band Wheatus?

Answer the following question: Article: Seven species of carp native to Asia have been introduced into United States waters in recent decades, but it's four in particular-bighead, black, grass and silver-that worry ecologists, biologists, fishers and policymakers alike. Introduced in the southeast to help control weeds and parasites in aquaculture operations, these fish soon spread up the Mississippi River system where they have been crowding out native fish populations not used to competing with such aggressive invaders. The carps' presence in such numbers is also harming water quality and killing off sensitive species. Asian carp are strong to jump over barriers such as low dams. They lay hundreds of thousands of eggs at a time and spread into new habitat quickly and easily. Also, flooding has helped the fish expand into previously unattainable water bodies. And fishers using young carp as live bait have also helped the fish's spread, as they have boats going through locks up and down the Mississippi. The federal government considers the Asian carps to be annoying species and encourages and supports \\"active control\\" by natural resources management agencies. Federal and state governments have spent millions in tax dollars to prevent the carp from making their way into the Great Lakes, but an underwater electric fence constructed to keep them out has not worked as well as hoped, and policymakers are reviewing other options now. In the meantime, state and federal agencies are monitoring the Mississippi and its branches for Asian carp and testing various barrier technologies to prevent their further spread. For instance, the National Park Service is cooperating with the state of Minnesota's Department of Natural Resources to construct new dams that are high enough to prevent Asian carp from jumping over. The Asian Carp Regional Coordinating Committee has funded DNA monitoring in potentially affected water bodies whereby researchers can determine whether the troublesome fish are present just by the biological footprints they leave behind....

Write highlights for this article: Big-spending English Premier League club Manchester City have completed the much-anticipated signing of Argentina international Carlos Tevez. Carlos Tevez faces competiton from seven other forwards in Manchester City's first-team squad. The 25-year-old was presented to the media on Tuesday afternoon ahead of City's departure the following day for a three-match pre-season tour of South Africa. City revealed on Monday night that the striker has agreed a five-year contract and would complete his move from bitter rivals Manchester United after passing a medical. A fee for the transfer has not yet been revealed, but it is reported that City have agreed to pay about 40 million to take over the player's ownership rights from the sports agencies which previously held them. Tevez denied claims by his former manager Alex Ferguson that he had decided to leave Old Trafford as long ago as January. Ferguson also said that he had offered the player a new contract on the night United played Inter Milan in the Champions League in March, but Tevez did not return his calls or text messages. \\"I was there for two years and Sir Alex never called or sent any text messages in that time,\\" Tevez told reporters through an interpreter. \\"The only time he spoke to me was after the Champions League final in Rome when I was going back to Argentina. It doesn't seem that this is the way to treat a player in two years at the club. It doesn't seem there is a line of communication. \\"It is United people talking about signing a contract (in January) but it is not true that it was decided then. I felt Sir Alex Ferguson and (United chief executive) David Gill did not do enough to try to keep me. \\"The fact I did not stay at United was not because of the fans. They must understand a part of my heart will always be with them. They were always extremely supportive, even when I wasn't playing.\\" City manager Mark Hughes confirmed that the club had been in contact with Arsenal over a move for Togo striker Emmanuel Adebayor, who has been linked with a 40 million move to Eastlands. \\"I think there's been discussions between ourselves and Arsenal but, as is my usual response about players that we haven't signed, really it's not the right time or place to discuss that -- only in as much as yes, there has been contact,\\" Hughes told reporters. \\"There's a deal to be done, possibly, but it's not been concluded as we speak. Until it actually happens, really it's not the time or the place to discuss it here.\\" The Mancunians have also made a huge offer for Chelsea captain John Terry, but the London club have insisted that the England defender is not for sale. \\"I have fantastic respect for John Terry, ever since I saw him as a young player when I was at Chelsea as a player myself,\\" Hughes said. \\"He's a great player and an outstanding captain. But he's very much a Chelsea player at this moment in time. I think any manager would covet a player of the type of John Terry, but at this moment in time he's a player for Chelsea, so we have to respect that.\\" The high-profile capture of Tevez is a big boost for the club and its billionaire Abu Dhabi-based owner, who was forced to end his long-running bid to sign Barcelona striker Samuel Eto'o. The Cameroon international, who had been offered a reported 400,000 a week wages, stalled on the move after being offered a new deal by the European champions, with some papers claiming he wanted a big chunk of any transfer fee paid by City. If Hughes does also sign Adebayor then the Welshman will have nine strikers at his disposal. The former Manchester United forward already has new 30 million signing Roque Santa Cruz, January's 23 million acquisition Craig Bellamy and Brazil star Robinho -- who arrived a year ago in a British-record 58 million coup. Felipe Caicedo, Valeri Bojinov, Benjani Mwaruwari and Ched Evans have also been given shirt numbers -- Tevez will wear No. 32 -- in a 57-strong squad named ahead of the new season. Hughes has released former England international striker Darius Vassell, while England Under-20 forward Daniel Sturridge has joined Chelsea for a fee to be resolved by a tribunal. Tevez scored 19 goals in 63 appearances for Premier League champions United after joining from West Ham, who he controversially saved from relegation despite a furor over his part-ownership with agent Kia Joorabchian's MSI Group. He has won 50 international caps, and has recently returned from holidays following Argentina's latest World Cup qualifiers. Tevez, who has won an Olympic gold medal, is the only man to be named South American Player of the Year in three successive seasons.","completion":"Manchester City, a big-spending soccer club, signed Carlos Tevez, a famous player from Argentina. Carlos is 25 years old and he joined the team after agreeing to a five-year contract. He will be playing alongside other talented players in the team.

SnapGoods helps these two groups connect over the Web. SnapGoods is one of many sites that have sprung up to facilitate offline sharing. Some sites have a narrow, obvious focus (like SwapBabyGoods.com) while others are more obscure (Neighborhood Fruit helps people share what's growing in their yards or find fruit trees on public land).

Question: \\"What does Portugal border?\\" Context: \\"Portugal's colonial history has long since been a cornerstone of its national identity, as has its geographic position at the south-western corner of Europe, looking out into the Atlantic Ocean. It was one of the last western colonial European powers to give up its overseas territories (among them Angola and Mozambique in 1975), turning over the administration of Macau to the People's Republic of China at the end of 1999. Consequently, it has both influenced and been influenced by cultures from former colonies or dependencies, resulting in immigration from these former territories for both economic and/or personal reasons. Portugal, long a country of emigration (the vast majority of Brazilians have Portuguese ancestry), has now become a country of net immigration, and not just from the last Indian (Portuguese until 1961), African (Portuguese until 1975), and Far East Asian (Portuguese until 1999) overseas territories. An estimated 800,000 Portuguese returned to Portugal as the country's African possessions gained independence in 1975. By 2007, Portugal had 10,617,575 inhabitants of whom about 332,137 were legal immigrants.\\" Answer: A:","completion":"Portugal, located in the southwestern part of Europe, shares its border with only one country - Spain. With the Atlantic Ocean to the west and south, Portugal's geographic position has played a significant role in influencing its history, culture, and economy. Throughout its colonial history, Portugal established various overseas territories, occupying territories in Africa, Asia, and South America. The colonization of these territories enabled the exchange of culture, resources, and people, shaping Portugal's national identity and its relationships with these regions. Angola and Mozambique in Africa were among these overseas territories. In 1975, they gained independence from Portugal, leading to an influx of about 800,000 Portuguese returning to the mainland. Similarly, Macau, a territory in the Far East Asia, was handed over to the People's Republic of China in 1999, ending Portugal's colonial administration in the region. The Indian territory of Goa was also under Portuguese rule until 1961. These historical ties with former colonies and dependencies have resulted in immigration from these territories to Portugal for both economic and personal reasons. Once a country of emigration, Portugal has transformed into a country of net immigration. By 2007, the total population of Portugal was 10,617,575, with approximately 332,137 legal immigrants. The influence of various cultures and peoples from these former territories has enriched Portugal's diverse cultural landscape. Ties with Brazil, for instance, contribute to the vast majority of Brazilians having Portuguese ancestry. This blend of cultures and the historical impact of Portugal's colonial endeavors continue to play a significant role in shaping the country's national identity and its relationship with these regions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

With members John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr, they became widely regarded as the foremost and most influential act of the rock era. Rooted in skiffle, beat, and 1950s rock and roll, the Beatles later experimented with several musical styles, ranging from pop ballads and Indian music to psychedelia and hard rock, often incorporating classical elements and unconventional recording techniques in innovative ways. In the early 1960s, their enormous popularity first emerged as \\"Beatlemania\\", but as the group's music grew in sophistication, led by primary songwriters Lennon and McCartney, they came to be perceived as an embodiment of the ideals shared by the counterculture of the 1960s. - Portland Bill is a narrow promontory (or bill) at the southern end of the Isle of Portland, and the southernmost point of Dorset, England.

Dolls with movable joints or clay figures are often used in stop motion for their ease of repositioning. Stop motion animation using plasticine is called clay animation or \\"clay-mation\\". Not all stop motion requires figures or models; many stop motion films can involve using humans, household appliances and other things for comedic effect. Stop motion using objects is sometimes referred to as object animation. - Norman Rossington (24 December 1928 21 May 1999) was an English actor best remembered for his roles in \\"The Army Game\\", the \\"Carry On\\" films and the Beatles' film \\"A Hard Day's Night\\". - The Adventures of Portland Bill was a British stop motion animated children 's television series made in 1983 .

To conquer the land and enslave its people. Answer:","completion":"Title: The Shadow of Entharia Plot Summary: 'The Shadow of Entharia' is a dark fantasy-adventure film set in the magical realm of Entharia. The story follows the plight of the people as they face the tyrannical rule of the evil Queen Seraphine, who uses her mastery of black magic to conquer the land and enslave its free-willed citizens. A group of unlikely heroes, each possessing unique skills and abilities, must come together to put an end to Queen Seraphine's reign of terror and restore peace and freedom to their homeland. Act 1: The film begins by introducing the enchanting world of Entharia, a land inhabited by various tribes with diverse magical abilities. Peace and harmony reign supreme until the sudden appearance of the evil Queen Seraphine. In her relentless pursuit of power, Seraphine uses her vast knowledge of black magic, including necromancy and blood rituals, to create an unstoppable army of shadow creatures and enslave key citizens to do her bidding. As Entharia falls under the dark cloud of Queen Seraphine's tyranny, a band of rebels starts forming in secret to resist her rule. The group includes: Rowan, a skilled swordsman and former captain of the Queen's Guard; Elara, a young but powerful sorceress who escaped Seraphine's grasp; Brax, a cunning thief and master of deception; and Nara, a legendary archer and beastmaster with unparalleled command over nature. Act 2: The rebel alliance learns of an ancient prophecy foretelling the rise of a powerful sorceress and her fall at the hands of a hero born from the ashes of her destruction. Believing that Elara is the sorceress from the prophecy and Rowan the destined hero, they set out on a perilous journey to locate the fabled 'Tears of Esariel,' a magical artifact said to possess the power to break the hold of Seraphine's black magic. As the rebels navigate treacherous landscapes, bloodthirsty minions, and deadly traps set to sabotage their mission, they also encounter various allies – a reclusive hermit skilled in ancient magic, a nomadic tribe of mystics commanding the ancient spirits, and a formidable legion of warriors from the southern regions of Entharia. Together, this united front against the evil queen gains strength. Meanwhile, Queen Seraphine, aware of the growing rebellion and the prophecy, stops at nothing to hunt down the heroes, using her dark powers to manipulate and control their actions. She even goes as far as resurrecting fallen enemies and summoning hellish creatures to challenge the rebels at every turn.

Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: The U.S. has long had the unenviable distinction of holding the world's largest prison population, in part because of tough-on-crime policies enacted in the 1990s. But sentencing reforms passed in recent years appear to have made a dent, leading to declines in the population over the past eight years. A criminal justice reform organization reported Friday that in 2017, the U.S. prison population dropped below 1.5 million for the first time in more than a decade. The decline, according to the Washington-based Vera Institute for Justice, was driven by a sharp decrease in the number of inmates in federal prisons and decreases in several states with large prison populations. Total U.S. prison population dropped to 1,486,000 last year, a decline of nearly 16,000. The number of federal prisoners fell to 183,000, and the number of inmates in state prisons declined to 1.3 million, according to the report. (The overall figure does not include the more than 600,000 defendants held in local, state and federal jails.) The decline extended an eight-year downward trend in U.S. prison population that has been driven by federal and state sentencing reforms enacted over the past decade. But the Vera institute cautioned that it was unclear whether the trend would continue. \\"Whether criminal justice reform can continue to fuel this sustained decline in the prison population remains to be seen,\\" said Jacob Kang-Brown, senior research associate at Vera. \\"We must continue to do the hard work, as advocates and agents of change, to ensure that all our communities feel the relief of decarceration.\\" The report came as President Donald Trump called on Congress to pass legislation to help former inmates reintegrate into society and avoid going back to prison, as many do. \\"We want former inmates to find a path to success so they can support their families and support their communities,\\" Trump said at a White House summit on prison reform attended by two state governors and Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law, who is spearheading... Question: What is the topic of the legislation Trump wants to pass?

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: Given the following context: Since the abolition of bishops within the Scottish Church in 1689, ownership of the abandoned cathedral fell to the crown, but no attempt to halt the decline of the building took place. Acknowledging the necessity to stabilise the structure, the Elgin Town Council initiated the reconstruction of the perimeter wall in 1809 and cleared debris from the surrounding area in about 1815. The Lord Provost of Elgin petitioned the King's Remembrancer for assistance to build a new roof for the chapterhouse and in 1824, £121 was provided to the architect Robert Reid for its construction. Reid was significant in the development of a conservation policy for historical buildings in Scotland and was to become the first Head of the Scottish Office of Works (SOW) in 1827. It was probably during his tenure at the SOW that the supporting buttresses to the choir and transept walls were built.In 1824 John Shanks, an Elgin shoemaker and an important figure in the conservation of the cathedral, started his work. Sponsored by local gentleman Isaac Forsyth, Shanks cleared the grounds of centuries of rubbish dumping and rubble. Shanks was officially appointed the site's Keeper and Watchman in 1826. Although his work was highly valued at the time and brought the cathedral back into public focus, his unscientific clearance work may have resulted in much valuable evidence of the cathedral's history being lost. He died on 14 April 1841, aged 82. A fortnight later, the Inverness Courier published a commemorative piece on Shanks, calling him the \\"beadle or cicerone of Elgin Cathedral\\", and writing: Some minor works took place during the remainder of the 19th century and continued into the early 20th century. During the 1930s further maintenance work followed that included a new roof to protect the vaulted ceiling of the south choir aisle. From 1960 onwards the crumbling sandstone blocks were replaced and new windows were fitted in the chapterhouse, which was re-roofed to preserve its vaulted ceiling. From 1988 to 2000, the two western towers... answer the following question: What is the publication that called the Elgin shoemaker the \\"beadle or cicerone of Elgin Cathedral\\"?

That way if your kite line breaks, your kite won’t sink down into the water. Any kind of medium-sized balloon will work. Use a small piece of wiring to secure the tied knot at the end of the balloon to one of the bars on your kite before you go out fishing. Don't inflate the balloon too much or it could pop. The kite line is the line coming off your kite rod. To connect your kite to the line, take your kite swivel (the small metal ring at the end of the lines on your kite) and hook it into the ball-bearing swivel at the end of your kite line. You’ll need to unclasp the ball-bearing swivel and then close it again around the swivel on your kite. Hold the kite by the edge of the boat or shoreline and release the line spooled on your kite reel. When you feel the kite getting pulled away from you by the wind, let go of it.

All we've done is checked that the first two creditors divided their collective share of 125 appropriately Does it follow that \\"The creditors are not allocating their shares correctly.\\"?","completion":"To determine whether the statement \\"The creditors are not allocating their shares correctly\\" follows from the given information, it is crucial to first understand the context and situation in detail. So far, we know that there were at least two creditors who divided their collective share of 125. We don't have the information regarding the total amount to be distributed among creditors or the individual percentages or shares each creditor is entitled to receive. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the creditors are not allocating their shares correctly based solely on the information provided. To determine whether the allocation of shares is correct or not, we will need the following additional information: 1. The total amount of debt to be allocated among creditors: This is the sum of the principal amount and any interest, legal costs, or other charges. Knowing the total amount of debt to be distributed will help us gauge if the 125 allocated to the first two creditors is proportionally correct, given their respective shares. 2. The individual shares or percentages of the creditors: The proportion of the total debt that each creditor is entitled to will help us determine if the 125 allocated to the first two creditors is accurate. We will need to know the exact percentages or proportions allocated to each creditor based on their claims. 3. The actual allocation procedure: It is essential to know the agreed-upon order, priority, or process of sharing debts among the creditors. This might include the priority of statutory or secured creditors, the order of distributing funds to different creditors, and any agreements or legally binding rulings regarding the allocation to specific creditors. Once we have the information mentioned above, we can analyze the allocation of the 125 share to the first two creditors and determine if they allocated their shares correctly or not. If there is a discrepancy in the allocated amounts or the procedure is not followed, we can conclude that the creditors are not allocating their shares correctly.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What cast included Norman Bailey, Rita Hunter and Alberto Remedios?, using the article: The company, retaining the title \\"Sadler's Wells Opera\\", opened at the Coliseum on 21 August 1968, with a new production of Mozart's Don Giovanni, directed by Sir John Gielgud. Though this production was not well received, the company rapidly established itself with a succession of highly praised productions of other works. Arlen died in January 1972, and was succeeded as managing director by Lord Harewood.The success of the 1968 Mastersingers was followed in the 1970s by the company's first Ring cycle, conducted by Goodall, with a new translation by Andrew Porter and designs by Ralph Koltai. The cast included Norman Bailey, Rita Hunter and Alberto Remedios. In Harewood's view, among the highlights of the first ten years at the Coliseum were the Ring, Prokofiev's War and Peace, and Richard Strauss's Salome and Der Rosenkavalier. The company's musical director from 1970 to 1977 was Charles Mackerras. Harewood praised his exceptional versatility, with a range \\"from The House of the Dead to Patience.\\" Among the operas he conducted for the company were Handel's Julius Caesar starring Janet Baker and Valerie Masterson; five Janáček operas; The Marriage of Figaro with pioneering use of 18th century performing style; Massenet's Werther; Donizetti's Mary Stuart with Baker; and Sullivan's Patience. The company took the production of the last to the Vienna Festival in 1975, along with Britten's Gloriana. Sir Charles Groves succeeded Mackerras as musical director from 1978 to 1979, but Groves was unwell and unhappy during his brief tenure. Starting in 1979, Mark Elder succeeded Groves in the post, and described Groves \\"immensely encouraging and supportive\\".A long-standing concern of Arlen and then Harewood was the need to change the company's name to reflect the fact that it was no longer based at Sadler's Wells theatre.

Ignoring the warnings from the peculiar town's folks, Miles moves in with his only companion, Felix, a charming witty black cat. Little did he know, an ancient and mysterious secret lies within the walls, hidden for centuries. As Miles settles into his new life, he begins to discover odd cryptic messages, eerie symbols, and antique artifacts hidden throughout the mansion. Frequent ghostly occurrences keep Miles on edge as he unearths hidden rooms, dusty family heirlooms, and whispers of a dark past, particularly revolving around a clan of powerful and malicious witches, who reportedly met their end on the mansion's grounds. Intrigued, Miles begins researching the legends and finds out that the witches were trapped in a parallel dimension. One night, in a beautifully twisted turn of events, Miles, with Felize by his side, uncovers a magical tome that unknowingly releases the spirits of the witches into the mortal realm. The once-docile town is now plagued by a series of terrifying and inexplicable events, revealing the true nature of the witch clan. Fueled by an insidious, sinister power, the witches devise a plan to regain their physical forms and dominate the world. Miles notices Felix displaying strange behavior, and it becomes clear these witches need a unique host to reclaim their mortal bodies. Miles, determined to undo what he has unleashed, takes desperate measures to save his cat and the town by enlisting the help of a local historian, a benevolent white witch, and a ragtag group of paranormal enthusiasts. Together, they delve deep into the mystical and paranormal, uncovering more secrets and learning to trust each other. In a race against time, the witches begin casting horrifying spells to take control of the town and its residents. It's a high-stakes battle of light versus darkness as Miles and his unexpected allies work tirelessly to find a way to prevent the witches from carrying out their sinister plans. Learning about the family connection to the witches, Miles identifies himself as the bloodline descendant entrusted to destroy the dark clan. As the final showdown looms, the witches take Felix as their host, forcing Miles to make an excruciating decision. Miles manages to defeat the witches, sacrificing Felix in the process. This heart-wrenching, emotional climax not only rids the town of the witch clan's influence, but also leads to a moment of redemption and catharsis for Miles. In the end, the town pays homage to Miles and Felix, who are considered saviors of the town. Miles, after having undergone an incredible transformation, finds a new purpose and builds a life in the town dedicated to researching and protecting it from any future supernatural threats.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Which entity is this text about? Emilie Autumn Liddell (born on September 22, 1979), better known by her stage name Emilie Autumn, is an American singer-songwriter, poet, violinist, and actress. Autumn's musical style has been described by her as \\"Fairy Pop\\", \\"Fantasy Rock\\" or \\"Victoriandustrial\\". It is influenced by glam rock and from plays, novels, and history, particularly the Victorian era. Performing with her all-female backup dancers As part of a recording project, Autumn traveled to Chicago, Illinois, in 2001, and decided to stay because she enjoyed the public transportation system and music scene there. She released the 2001 EP Chambermaid while finishing Enchant--she alternatively labeled the musical style on Chambermaid as \\"fantasy rock\\" and cabaret--and wrote the 2001 charity single \\"By the Sword\\" after the events of September 11, 2001. According to her, the song is about strength, not violence; the act of swearing by the sword represents \\"an unbreakable promise to right a wrong, to stay true\\". On February 26, 2003, she released her concept album Enchant, which spanned multiple musical styles: \\"new-age, pop and trip hop chamber music\\". Written during her late teenage years, Enchant revolved around the supernatural realm and its effect on the modern-day world. Autumn labeled it as \\"fantasy rock\\", which dealt with \\"dreams and stories and ghosts and faeries who'll bite your head off if you dare to touch them\\". The faery-themed \\"Enchant Puzzle\\" appeared on the artwork of the album; her reward for the person who would solve it consisted of faery-related items. Her bandmates consisted of cellist Joey Harvey, drummer Heath Jansen, guitarist Ben Lehl, and bassist Jimmy Vanaria, who also worked on the electronics. At the same time of Enchant's release, Autumn had several side projects: Convent, a musical group for which she recorded all four voices; Ravensong, \\"a classical baroque ensemble\\" that she formed with friends in California; and The Jane Brooks Project, which she dedicated to the real-life, 16th-century Jane Brooks--a woman executed for witchcraft. On the night of the Enchant release party, Autumn learned that Courtney Love had invited her to record an album, America's Sweetheart, and embark on the tour to promote it. Contributing violin and vocals, Autumn appeared in Love's backing band The Chelsea--Radio Sloan, Dvin Kirakosian, Samantha Maloney, and Lisa Leveridge--on the 2004 tour. Much of Autumn's violin work did not get released on the album; she commented: \\"This had to do entirely with new producers taking over the project after our little vacation in France, and carefully discarding all of our sessions.\\" She performed live with Love and The Chelsea on Late Show with David Letterman on March 17, 2004, and at Bowery Ballroom the next day. In September 2004, her father died from lung cancer, even though he had quit smoking twenty years earlier. Near the end of 2004, she was filmed for an appearance on an episode of HGTV's Crafters Coast to Coast, showing viewers how to create faery wings and sushi-styled soap--both products she sold in her online \\"web design and couture fashion house\\", WillowTech House. On December 23, 2004, she appeared on the Chicago-based television station WGN as part of the string quartet backing up Billy Corgan and Dennis DeYoung's duet of \\"We Three Kings\\".","completion":"This text is about Emilie Autumn Liddell, who is better known by her stage name, Emilie Autumn.

Socialite Ching (Angelica Lee), who also attended the party, identified Ling (Karena Lam) as the prime suspect because she found out that Ling was the only stranger presented in the ball room. She is unknown to everyone in the party, even to the hotel staff. During the police investigation, Ching discovers that Ling has been secretly involved with her boyfriend Wai (Andy Hui Chi-On), and this is the very reason why she was in the hotel when the crime was committed.

This event sets off a chain of events, suspicion, and intrigue that form the basis of the movie's plot. The central conflict revolves around the relationship between the two main characters, Ching and Ling. Ching, a wealthy socialite who attended the party, becomes suspicious of Ling, identifying her as the only stranger present in the ballroom during the party. During the police investigation, Ching discovers that Ling has been secretly involved with her boyfriend, Wai, which potentially provides a motive for Ling's presence at the hotel when the crime occurred. Despite being released uncharged due to insufficient evidence, Ling starts stalking Ching in a twisted game of jealousy. Ching initially sees this as harassment but turns the tables and begins to follow Ling instead. Ling seemingly allows this, showing Ching the darker side of life for someone from a less privileged background. The two engage in a subtle cat-and-mouse game, with Ching fearing for her life when Ling begins threatening to remove her kidney as well. The story takes a turn when Ching is kidnapped by a mysterious man who appears to be aligned with Ling. Ching reveals that her kidney is weak and would not hold much value on the black market. She passes out and later wakes up to find Ling injured beside her. This event brings the two women closer, as Ching discovers that Ling is actually kind-hearted and genuine in comparison to her superficial socialite friends. Ching learns that Ling has a childhood sweetheart, whose identity remains a mystery. Ching and Ling ultimately strike a deal with the mysterious man in an effort to secure a kidney for Ching. However, the police have been informed beforehand and arrive on the scene. The film continues to unravel the intricate web of relationships, deception, and uncovering the truth behind the surgically removed kidney.

The village is located close to the A73 motorway between Venlo and Nijmegen. - World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier. It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history. - A country is a region that is identified as a distinct national entity in political geography. A country may be an independent sovereign state or one that is occupied by another state, as a non-sovereign or formerly sovereign political division, or a geographic region associated with sets of previously independent or differently associated people with distinct political characteristics. Regardless of the physical geography, in the modern internationally accepted legal definition as defined by the League of Nations in 1937 and reaffirmed by the United Nations in 1945, a resident of a country is subject to the independent exercise of legal jurisdiction. - Boxmeer ( pronunciation ) is a municipality and a town in the southern Netherlands .

It is a small, densely populated country which covers an area of and has a population of about 11 million people. Straddling the cultural boundary between Germanic and Latin Europe, Belgium is home to two main linguistic groups: the Dutch-speaking, mostly Flemish community, which constitutes about 59% of the population, and the French-speaking, mostly Walloon population, which comprises 41% of all Belgians. Additionally, there is a small group of German-speakers who live in the East Cantons located around the High Fens area, and bordering Germany. - A municipality is usually a single urban administrative division having corporate status and powers of self-government or jurisdiction as granted by national and state laws, to which it is subordinate. It is to be distinguished from the county, which may encompass rural territory and/or numerous small communities such as towns, villages and hamlets. The term \\"municipality\\" may also mean the governing or ruling body of a given municipality.

Question: Who confronts Mrs. Appleyard Movie plot title: Picnic at Hanging Rock Movie plot: At Appleyard College, a girls' private school, near the town of Woodend, Victoria, Australia, the students are dressing on the morning of St. Valentine's Day, 1900. Miranda (Anne-Louise Lambert), Irma (Karen Robson), Marion (Jane Vallis), Rosamund (Ingrid Mason), waifish Sara (Margaret Nelson), and outsider Edith (Christine Schuler) read poetry and Valentine's Day cards. The group prepares for a picnic to a local geological formation known as Hanging Rock, accompanied by the mathematics mistress Miss Greta McCraw (Vivean Gray) and the young and beautiful Mlle. de Poitiers (Helen Morse). On the authority of the stern headmistress Mrs. Appleyard (Rachel Roberts), jittery teacher Miss Lumley (Kirsty Child) advises Sara that she is not allowed to attend. Driven by buggy operator Ben Hussey (Martin Vaughan), the party pass through and arrive at the Rock by mid-afternoon. After a meal, Mr. Hussey notes his watch has stopped at the stroke of twelve, as has the watch of Miss McCraw. With permission from Mlle. de Poitiers, Miranda, Marion and Irma decide to explore Hanging Rock and take measurements, with Edith allowed to follow. The group is observed several minutes later by a young Englishman, Michael Fitzhubert (Dominic Guard), who is lunching at the Rock with his uncle Colonel Fitzhubert (Peter Collingwood), aunt Mrs. Fitzhubert (Olga Dickie), and valet Albert (John Jarratt). At the top of Hanging Rock, the group lies on the ground, apparently dazed by the sun. Miss McCraw, still at the base of the Rock, stares up. Miranda, Marion, and Irma awake and move, as if in a dream, into a recess in the rock face. Edith screams and flees down the Rock.

In 1967 Solti was invited to become music director of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. It was the second time he had been offered the post. The first had been in 1963 after the death of the orchestra's conductor, Fritz Reiner, who made its reputation in the previous decade. Solti told the representatives of the orchestra that his commitments at Covent Garden made it impossible to give Chicago the eight months a year they sought. He suggested giving them three and a half months a year and inviting Carlo Maria Giulini to take charge for a similar length of time. The orchestra declined to proceed on these lines. When Solti accepted the orchestra's second invitation it was agreed that Giulini should be appointed to share the conducting. Both conductors signed three-year contracts with the orchestra, effective from 1969.One of the members of the Chicago Symphony described it to Solti as \\"the best provincial orchestra in the world.\\" Many players remained from its celebrated decade under Reiner, but morale was low, and the orchestra was 5m in debt. Solti concluded that it was essential to raise the orchestra's international profile. He ensured that it was engaged for many of his Decca sessions, and he and Giulini led it in a European tour in 1971, playing in ten countries. It was the first time in its 80-year history that the orchestra had played outside of North America. The orchestra received plaudits from European critics, and was welcomed home at the end of the tour with a ticker-tape parade.The orchestra's principal flute player, Donald Peck, commented that the relationship between a conductor and an orchestra is difficult to explain: \\"some conductors get along with some orchestras and not others. We had a good match with Solti and he with us.\\" Peck's colleague, the violinist Victor Aitay said, \\"Usually conductors are relaxed at rehearsals and tense at the concerts. Solti is the reverse.

While selling produce at a local market, Ned sells marijuana to a uniformed police officer due to the officer's claim that he had a stressful week, which made Ned feel sympathetic after initially being skeptical. Ned is then arrested on a charge of selling drugs. Ned has three sisters: Miranda (Elizabeth Banks) is a journalist for Vanity Fair trying to get her first major article published. Though she has trouble finding a man to keep her interest, she and a neighbor, Jeremy (Adam Scott) have hidden feelings for each other. Natalie (Zooey Deschanel), is an independent, bisexual hipster living with her girlfriend, Cindy (Rashida Jones), and five other roommates.

The term \\"sousveillance\\", coined by Steve Mann, stems from the contrasting French words \\"sur\\", meaning \\"above\\", and \\"sous\\", meaning \\"below\\", i.e. \\"surveillance\\" denotes the \\"eye-in-the-sky\\" watching from above, whereas \\"sousveillance\\" denotes bringing the camera or other means of observation down to human level, either physically (mounting cameras on people rather than on buildings), or hierarchically (ordinary people doing the watching, rather than higher authorities or architectures doing the watching). - The Corps of Royal Marines (RM) is the United Kingdom's amphibious light infantry force, forming part of the Naval Service, along with the Royal Navy. The Royal Marines were formed in 1755 as the Royal Navy's infantry troops. However, the marines can trace their origins back to the formation of the English Army's \\"Duke of York and Albany's maritime regiment of Foot\\" at the grounds of the Honourable Artillery Company on 28 October 1664. - The Honourable Artillery Company (HAC) was incorporated by Royal Charter in 1537 by King Henry VIII and is considered one of the oldest military organisations in the world. Today it is a registered charity whose purpose is to attend to the \\"better defence of the realm\\", this purpose is primarily achieved by the support of the HAC Regiment and a detachment of Special Constabulary to the City of London Police. The word \\"artillery\\" in \\"Honourable Artillery Company\\" does not have the current meaning that is generally associated with it, but dates from a time when in the English language that word meant any projectile, including for example arrows shot from a bow. The equivalent form of words in modern English would be either \\"Honourable Infantry Company\\" or \\"Honourable Military Company.\\" - Behavior is the range of actions and mannerisms made by individuals, organisms, systems, or artificial entities in conjunction with themselves or their environment, which includes the other systems or organisms around as well as the (inanimate) physical environment. It is the response of the system or organism to various stimuli or inputs, whether internal or external, conscious or subconscious, overt or covert, and voluntary or involuntary. - The 30 Commando Information Exploitation Group is a Royal Marines unit of the British Armed Forces . The unit resources include communications , information operations , information systems , intelligence , surveillance , and Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance ( ISTAR ) . It is a redesignation of the former brigade headquarters battalion , the UK Landing Force Command Support Group , which was previously known as HQ & Signals Squadron RM. The unit 's title harks back to the original 30 Commando ( which in turn became 30 Assault Unit RM ) , formed in 1942 . This unit was tasked to move ahead of advancing Allied forces , or to undertake covert infiltrations into enemy territory by land , sea or air , to capture much needed intelligence , in the form of codes , documents , equipment or enemy personnel . In 2013 , 30 Commando Information Exploitation Group were granted the freedom of Littlehampton , West Sussex , in honour of the original unit being based in the town during the Second World War . - The Crown dependencies are three territories of the United Kingdom: the Isle of Man in the Irish Sea, and the Bailiwicks of Jersey and Guernsey in the English Channel. Being independently administered jurisdictions, they do not form part of either the United Kingdom or the British Overseas Territories. They are self-governing possessions of the Crown (defined uniquely in each jurisdiction). Internationally, the dependencies are considered \\"territories for which the United Kingdom is responsible\\" rather than as sovereign states. As a result, they are not member states of the Commonwealth of Nations. However, they do have a relationship with the Commonwealth, the European Union, and other international organisations and are members of the BritishIrish Council. They are not part of the European Union (EU), although they are within the EU's customs area. - The British Armed Forces form the military of the United Kingdom, tasked with defence of the country, its overseas territories, and the Crown dependencies. They also promote the UK's wider interests, support international peacekeeping efforts, and provide humanitarian aid. - The English Army existed while England was an independent state and was at war with other states, but it was not until the Interregnum and the New Model Army (raised by Parliament to defeat the Royalists in the English Civil War) that England acquired a peacetime professional standing army. At the restoration of the monarchy, Charles II kept a small standing army, formed from elements of the Royalist army in exile and elements of the New Model Army, from which the most senior regular regiments of today's British Army can trace their antecedence. Likewise, Royal Marines can trace their origins back to the formation of the English Army's \\"Duke of York and Albany's maritime regiment of Foot\\" at the grounds of the Honourable Artillery Company on 28 October 1664. - Postal interception is the act of retrieving another person's mail for the purpose of ensuring that the mail is not delivered to the recipient, or to spy on them. - The military, also called the armed forces, are forces authorized to use deadly force, and weapons, to support the interests of the state and some or all of its citizens. The task of the military is usually defined as defense of the state and its citizens, and the prosecution of war against another state. The military may also have additional sanctioned and non-sanctioned functions within a society, including, the promotion of a political agenda, protecting corporate economic interests, internal population control, construction, emergency services, social ceremonies, and guarding important areas. The military can also function as a discrete subculture within a larger civil society, through the development of separate infrastructures, which may include housing, schools, utilities, food production and banking. - The Internet is the global system of interconnected computer networks that use the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) to link devices worldwide. It is a \\"network of networks\\" that consists of private, public, academic, business, and government networks of local to global scope, linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless, and optical networking technologies. The Internet carries an extensive range of information resources and services, such as the inter-linked hypertext documents and applications of the World Wide Web (WWW), electronic mail, telephony, and peer-to-peer networks for file sharing. - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union. - Light infantry (or skirmishers) are soldiers whose job was to provide a skirmishing screen ahead of the main body of infantry, harassing and delaying the enemy advance. Light infantry was distinct from medium, heavy or line infantry. Heavy infantry were dedicated primarily to fighting in tight formations that were the core of large battles. Light infantry fought in open-order, often in close co-ordination with heavy infantry, where they could screen the heavy infantry from harassing fire, and the heavy infantry could intervene to protect the light infantry from attacks of enemy heavy infantry or cavalry. Heavy infantry originally had heavier arms and more armour than light infantry, but this distinction was lost as the use of armour declined and gunpowder weapons became standardized. - Humanitarian aid is material and logistic assistance to people in need. It is usually short-term help until the long-term help by government and other institutions replaces it. Among the people in need belong homeless, refugees, victims of natural disasters, wars and famines. The primary purpose of humanitarian aid is to save lives, reduce suffering and respect to human dignity. Humanitarian aid is material or logistical assistance provided for humanitarian purposes, typically in response to humanitarian crises including natural disasters and man-made disaster. The primary objective of humanitarian aid is to save lives, alleviate suffering, and maintain human dignity. It may therefore be distinguished from development aid, which seeks to address the underlying socioeconomic factors which may have led to a crisis or emergency. - Peacekeeping refers to activities intended to create conditions that favor lasting peace. Research generally finds that peacekeeping reduces civilian and battlefield deaths and reduces the risk of renewed warfare. - Surveillance (or ) is the monitoring of the behavior, activities, or other changing information, usually of people for the purpose of influencing, managing, directing, or protecting them. This can include observation from a distance by means of electronic equipment (such as CCTV cameras), or interception of electronically transmitted information (such as Internet traffic or phone calls); and it can include simple, no- or relatively low-technology methods such as human intelligence agents and postal interception. The word \\"\\" comes from a French phrase for \\"watching over\\" (\\"sur\\" means \\"from above\\" and \\"veiller\\" means \\"to watch\\"), and is in contrast to more recent developments such as sousveillance. - The Royal Navy (RN) is the United Kingdom's naval warfare force. Although warships were used by the English kings from the early medieval period, the first major maritime engagements were fought in the Hundred Years War against the kingdom of France. The modern Royal Navy traces its origins to the early 16th century; the oldest of the UK's armed services, it is known as the Senior Service. - A troop is a military sub-subunit, originally a small formation of cavalry, subordinate to a squadron. In many armies a troop is the equivalent element to the infantry section or platoon. Exceptions are the Royal Horse Artillery and the US Cavalry, where troops are subunits that compare to an infantry company or artillery battery. - Internet traffic is the flow of data across the Internet.

The senior U.S. diplomat who shepherded a series of secret U.S. meetings with the insurgents last year will meet with him late next week to ensure he’s on board, officials said. (Musadeq Sadeq/AP) The Obama administration will resume peace talks with the Taliban as soon as Afghan President Hamid Karzai formally blesses the negotiations, according to senior administration officials who indicated that the process could be underway within weeks. Marc Grossman, the senior U.S. diplomat who shepherded a series of secret U.S. meetings with the insurgents last year, will meet with Karzai late next week to ensure that he is on board, officials said. “If Karzai were to tell [the Obama administration] to go ahead, then we’d start talking again,” said one of two officials who discussed the secret negotiations on the condition of anonymity. A tentative U.S.-Taliban deal, including the transfer of five Afghan detainees from the Guantanamo Bay prison to Qatar and an insurgent renunciation of international terrorism, collapsed in December when Karzai refused to go along with it. There have been no meetings with the insurgents since then. Although all parties have publicly said that they agree to one element of the deal — the opening of a Taliban office in Qatar — “we need now to make it real,” one official said. Prime Minister Hamad bin Jasim al-Thani, for the first time acknowledging Qatar’s support for the arrangement, said Wednesday that his government welcomed “any opportunity” to defuse tension in the region. Thani spoke after a meeting with Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton. The administration, which has said that negotiations must be “Afghan-led,” insists that its talks with the Taliban are only a preliminary effort to build confidence before actual negotiations over Afghanistan’s future can begin between the insurgents and the Karzai government. One hurdle is that the Taliban prefers to talk to the United States and is “not willing to sit down with the Afghan government’,” one official said. “Our job is to see if we can break through that door.” Karzai has been under pressure from domestic opponents of negotiations to stand firm against the talks. The officials provided an overview of how the talks have proceeded and where they go now. Officials remain far from certain that the Taliban leadership is seriously interested in a political settlement. “There is an increasing number of Taliban who are tired of having the hell beat out of them,” one said. “I think they want to stop.” But, at the same time, “I imagine there are going to be splits,” the official said. “Some are going to want to talk, some are going to want to fight.” Late last year, the U.S. intelligence community assessed that both military and diplomatic success were unlikely before December 2014, the date that President Obama and NATO allies have set for withdrawal of all combat troops from Afghanistan. Marine Gen. John Allen, the top coalition commander in Afghanistan, was said to be so angered by the recent National Intelligence Estimate that he wrote a blistering formal dissent. The officials said combat against the insurgents would continue and described what they called a “holistic” approach in which diplomatic progress was not possible without gains on the civilian and military fronts. Although ground commanders have been skeptical of negotiations, a senior military official said that all wars “end in a political process” and that “this one is no exception.” He described progress thus far as “getting the car out of the garage” in preparation for “a difficult journey ahead.” An official said meetings with Mohammed Tayeb al-Agha, an aide to Taliban leader Mohammad Omar, began in November 2010. To convince themselves that Agha had authority from the top Taliban leadership, “we tried to develop questions,” the official said, “tests, if you will, to see if he could receive a question, seek an answer from people senior to him and then stick with it.” Agha, the official said, has been “shown on a number of occasions to accurately reflect the leaders” of the organization. “He is very consistent in what he seeks and how he seeks it.” The last meeting, in Qatar, was in October. Throughout the process, the administration briefed Karzai and congressional leaders, officials said, particularly as they neared tentative agreement on confidence-building measures. Among those measures, the United States asked for a public Taliban renunciation of international terrorism — in essence, a repudiation of al-Qaeda — and a separate statement of support for democracy in Afghanistan. The Taliban wanted an office outside Afghanistan where they could operate beyond the supervision of their hosts in Pakistan, the officials said. The Americans said they considered the neutral location a place where the insurgents could begin talking to the Afghan government. The insurgents also presented a list of five Guantanamo detainees, all of whom held positions in the Taliban government in Afghanistan between 1996 and 2001. Human rights organizations have said that several of them were responsible for severe abuses, although U.S. officials said they have ascertained that the militants were not involved in killing Americans. The five were to be transferred to house arrest in Qatar, a move that would require Secretary of Defense Leon E. Panetta to certify to Congress that they would not be released and would not pose a threat to the United States. Qatar also would agree not to transfer them onward to another location, including Afghanistan. The final conversations, before Karzai squelched the deal, were over “sequencing,” one of the officials said. “Who goes first? What do they say?” ||||| KABUL/WASHINGTON A video showing what appears to be American forces urinating on dead Taliban fighters prompted anger in Afghanistan and promises of a U.S. investigation on Thursday but the insurgent group said it would not harm nascent efforts to broker peace talks. The video, posted on YouTube and other websites, shows four men in camouflage Marine combat uniforms urinating on three corpses. One of them jokes: \\"Have a nice day, buddy.\\" Another makes a lewd joke. Afghan President Hamid Karzai condemned the video, describing the men's actions as \\"inhuman\\" and calling for an investigation, in a statement on Thursday evening. In Washington U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta telephoned Karzai to denounce the actions in the video as \\"deplorable\\" and to say it would be investigated immediately, the Pentagon said. General Martin Dempsey, the top U.S. military officer, said actions depicted in the video were illegal. Although the U.S. military has stopped short of confirming the video is authentic, the Pentagon on Thursday came close. Pentagon spokesman Captain John Kirby said, \\"We don't have any indication that it's not authentic.\\" The video is likely to stir up already strong anti-U.S. sentiment in Afghanistan after a decade of a war that has seen other cases of abuse, and that could complicate efforts to promote reconciliation as foreign troops gradually withdraw. \\"Such action will leave a very, very bad impact on peace efforts,\\" Arsala Rahmani, a senior member of the Afghan government's High Peace Council, told Reuters. The administration of U.S. President Barack Obama, seeing a glimmer of hope after months of efforts to broker talks, is launching a fresh round of shuttle diplomacy this weekend. Marc Grossman, Obama's special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan, will fly into the region for talks with Karzai and top officials in Turkey, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. One immediate goal is to seal agreement for the Taliban to open a political office in the Gulf state of Qatar. Despite concerns when the video first emerged that it would not help his efforts to build confidence among the warring parties, a Taliban spokesman said although the images were shocking, the tape would not affect talks or a mooted prisoner release. \\"We know that our country is occupied ... . This is not a political process, so the video will not harm our talks and prisoner exchange because they are at the preliminary stage.\\" CONCERN FOR MORE PROTESTS Panetta called the actions shown in the film \\"utterly deplorable\\" and said he had ordered the Marine Corps and the commander of the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan to investigate. \\"Those found to have engaged in such conduct will be held accountable to the fullest extent,\\" he said in a statement. General James Amos, the commandant of the Marine Corps, said in a statement the video \\"apparently depicts Marines desecrating several dead Taliban in Afghanistan.\\" He said he had asked the Naval Criminal Investigative Service to investigate and had set up another internal inquiry headed by Marine officers. A Marine officer, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters that the Marines in question were believed to be from the 3rd Battallion, 2nd Marines, which is based in Camp Lejeune, North Carolina. White House spokesman Jay Carney said he was not aware of whether President Barack Obama had seen the video or not. News of the footage had yet to spread in Afghanistan - a country where a minority have access to electricity and the Internet is limited to a tiny urban elite - but Afghans who were told about what the tape appears to show were horrified. \\"It may start with just video footage, but it will end with demonstrations around the country and maybe the world,\\" said 44-year-old Qaisullah, who has a shop near the Kabul's Shah-e-dushamshera mosque. Anti-American feeling has boiled over, or been whipped up, into violence several times in Afghanistan in recent years. Protests over reports of the desecration of the Muslim holy book have twice sparked deadly riots. The tape also sparked anger across the Middle East and in Internet chatrooms, prompting reference to earlier scandals involving U.S. soldiers' treatment of prisoners in Iraq and the killing of unarmed civilians in Afghanistan. \\"This is the embodiment of the strong assaulting the weak. It's nothing new for the Americans, it only adds to what they have done in Abu Ghraib prison. This a breach of the sacredness of Islam and Muslims,\\" said Othman al-Busaifi, 45, in Tripoli. The U.S. military has been prosecuting soldiers from the Army's 5th Stryker Brigade on charges of murdering unarmed Afghan civilians while deployed in Kandahar province in 2010, and cutting off body parts as war trophies. \\"They cut off ears and fingers and keep them as medals, and urinate on bodies, then they talk about civilization,\\" wrote user Abu Abdullah al-Janubi on one forum. CRITICAL TIME The video was released at a critical time for what U.S. officials hope might become authentic talks on Afghanistan's political future. In Kabul Grossman will seek approval from Karzai - whose support for a U.S. effort he fears will sideline his government has wavered - to move ahead with good-faith measures seen as an essential precursor to negotiations that could give the Taliban a shared role in governing Afghanistan. The diplomatic initiative includes a possible transfer of Taliban prisoners from the U.S. military detention camp at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. A breakthrough would mark a milestone for the Obama administration, struggling to secure a modicum of stability in Afghanistan as it presses ahead with its gradual withdrawal from a long and costly war. The United States and its allies aim to withdraw combat troops by the end of 2014.

Question: You can use a stick to swat at what growing in a field? Choices: - woods - forest - bicycle spokes - home - grass The rationale to choose \\"grass\\" as the answer is that: The answer to this question is:","completion":"\\"grass\\" The rationale behind choosing \\"grass\\" as the answer to the question \\"You can use a stick to swat at what growing in a field?\\" lies in a careful examination of each of the provided choices and their relevance to the given scenario. Here, we will analyze each option and explain why \\"grass\\" has been determined to be the most appropriate answer. - Woods: Woods, as a collective term, refers to a densely wooded area of land with various types of trees. While it is possible for woods to grow near or adjacent to a field, using a stick to swat at them would not be practical. Trees are much larger and sturdier than a simple stick, making it impossible to swat them in any meaningful way. - Forest: A forest refers to a vast expanse of land covered by trees, which can be dense or sparse. Similar to a wooded area, forests can be located near fields, but using a stick to swat at the trees will have little to no effect. The sheer size and strength of trees make this option unfeasible and irrelevant to the given scenario. - Bicycle spokes: Bicycle spokes are the metal rods that connect the wheel's rim to its central hub. While they may be present in a field, using a stick to swat them is not related to something growing in the field. Spokes are part of a man-made object and are not a natural growth that could be found in a field. - Home: A home, which is typically a structure built and inhabited by people, cannot grow in a field. While it is true that houses can be built near or in the middle of a field, they don't physically grow from the ground, making this option irrelevant to the context of the question. - Grass: Finally, grass is a type of vegetation that is common in fields, meadows, and other open areas. Given its relatively low height and flexible structure, it can be swatted easily with a stick. Grass grows abundantly in fields due to the abundance of sunlight and fertile soil found in these areas. In comparison to the other choices provided, grass is the only option that is both a naturally growing element in a field and can be feasibly swatted using a stick. In conclusion, the rationale for choosing \\"grass\\" as the answer to the question \\"You can use a stick to swat at what growing in a field?\\" lies in its practicality and relevance to the given context. Grass is a naturally occurring, common vegetation that grows consistently in open fields. Unlike the other options presented, it can be effectively swatted with a simple stick, making it the most fitting answer."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

(B). egg carton was too small.","completion":"Bob's egg carton would not fit in his shopping bag from the store because the (A) bag was too small. This situation might arise due to several reasons, as outlined below: 1. Shopping Bag Material: The material of the shopping bag could be inelastic or have low stretchability, preventing it from accommodating the size of the egg carton. For instance, if the bag were made of materials such as recycled paper or non-woven fabric, it might not be as flexible as a plastic or cotton bag. 2. Bag Dimensions: The dimensions of the bag could be insufficient to hold the egg carton. As an example, if the bag were designed to carry smaller items, such as snacks or canned goods, it might not have the necessary width, length, or depth to house an egg carton. 3. Egg Carton Size: The egg carton itself could be larger than an average carton, containing a higher quantity of eggs or designed with added protection for the eggs. This increased size could render it incompatible with the shopping bag's dimensions. 4. Other Items in the Bag: It's also possible that the shopping bag already contained several items, limiting the available space for the egg carton. If this were the case, the egg carton would not fit, regardless of its size or the bag's dimensions. In the given scenario, option (B) \\"Egg carton was too small.\\" would not be a valid choice because it would not prevent the egg carton from fitting into the shopping bag.

Around 1528, a group of Spaniard explorers, led by Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca, first entered the actual territory of what is now Chihuahua. The conquest of the territory lasted nearly one century, and encountered fierce resistance from the Conchos tribe, but the desire of the Spanish Crown to transform the region into a bustling mining center led to a strong strategy to control the area. Which tribe resisted fiercely this conquest?","completion":"The tribe that fiercely resisted the conquest of Nueva Vizcaya (New Biscay) in northern New Spain by the Spanish during the 16th and 17th centuries was the Conchos tribe. The Conchos were an indigenous people residing in the region that is now present-day Chihuahua, Mexico. They were known for their strong resistance against the Spanish colonization and their efforts to protect their lands, culture, and way of life. Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca and his group of explorers were the first to encounter the Conchos tribe as they ventured into the Nueva Vizcaya territory in the early 16th century. Their interactions with the tribe were not always peaceful, as the Conchos made it clear that they did not want to submit to Spanish authority. This resistance led to a series of conflicts that would last for almost a century. The Spanish Crown was determined to establish control over the region, driven by the potential for vast mineral wealth and the desire to expand their empire. To achieve this, the Spaniards employed a combination of military force, diplomacy, and strategic alliances with other indigenous groups in the region. Throughout the various battles and skirmishes against the Conchos tribe, the Spanish were able to gain some control over the Nueva Vizcaya province. However, the resistance put up by the Conchos made the conquest a difficult and long-drawn process. As a result of this prolonged struggle, the Spanish Crown had to reconsider their approach and began focusing on developing the mining industry in the region. The establishment of mining settlements allowed the Spaniards to exert greater control over the area and exploit the abundant natural resources. Ultimately, the Spanish were successful in subjugating the Conchos tribe, leading to the decline of their population and the eventual assimilation of the remaining members into Spanish society. The Spanish conquest of Nueva Vizcaya marked a significant step in the colonization of Northern Mexico and the expansion of the Spanish Empire in the New World. Nevertheless, the fierce resistance put up by the Conchos tribe serves as a testament to the determination and resilience of indigenous peoples in the face of colonial expansion."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can. What society did the man who had poor command of the Czech language become chorus master of after returning from Sweden? Answer the above question based on the context below: In 1861, it was announced that a Provisional Theatre would be built in Prague, as a home for Czech opera. Smetana saw this as an opportunity to write and stage opera that would reflect Czech national character, similar to the portrayals of Russian life in Mikhail Glinka's operas. He hoped that he might be considered for the theatre's conductorship, but the post went to Jan Nepomuk Maýr, apparently because the conservative faction in charge of the project considered Smetana a \\"dangerous modernist\\", in thrall to avant garde composers such as Liszt and Wagner. Smetana then turned his attention to an opera competition, organised by Count Jan von Harrach, which offered prizes of 600 gulden each for the best comic and historical operas based on Czech culture. With no useful model on which to base his work—Czech opera as a genre scarcely existed—Smetana had to create his own style. He engaged Karel Sabina, his comrade from the 1848 barricades, as his librettist, and received Sabina's text in February 1862, a story of the 13th century invasion of Bohemia by Otto of Brandenburg. In April 1863 he submitted the score, under the title of The Brandenburgers in Bohemia. At this stage in his career, Smetana's command of the Czech language was poor. His generation of Czechs was educated in German, and he had difficulty expressing himself in what was supposedly his native tongue. To overcome these linguistic deficiencies he studied Czech grammar, and made a point of writing and speaking in Czech every day. He had become Chorus Master of the nationalistic Hlahol Choral Society soon after his return from Sweden, and as his fluency in the Czech language developed he composed patriotic choruses for the Society; The Three Riders and The Renegade were performed at concerts in early 1863. In March of that year Smetana was elected president of the music section of Umělecká Beseda, a society for Czech artists. By 1864 he was proficient enough in the Czech language to be appointed as music critic to the main Czech language newspaper...

While the review is positive, it lacks detailed commentary. Important details like functionality, value for money, user-friendliness, and customer service, which are often cited in more comprehensive reviews, are absent. Given its brevity along with the positivity, I would rate this review as a 4 on the scale. The reason I didn't rate it a 5 is because although it's positive, it lacks depth and detail that could be more helpful in determining the overall satisfaction of the user. Adding more detail would have increased the rating to a 5. Also, since the scale is relative to other reviews (assuming more detailed positive reviews will be rated as 5), this review can't achieve the highest rating. A rating of 4 aligns with the idea that it's positive without being exceptional."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Is \\"The heavy infantry of the maniples were supported by a number of light infantry and cavalry troops, typically 300 horsemen per manipular legion.\\" the correct answer? Available choices: * yes * no","completion":"No, the statement \\"The heavy infantry of the maniples were supported by a number of light infantry and cavalry troops, typically 300 horsemen per manipular legion\\" slightly oversimplifies the organization and composition of the Roman manipular legion. A Roman legion, particularly during the manipular era, was composed of several types of infantry and cavalry units. A single manipular legion typically consisted of three distinct lines of infantry: hastati, principes, and triarii. These infantry units, organized into maniples, were supported by light infantry (velites) and cavalry (equites), as well as various specialized troops. The actual number of horsemen in a single manipular legion, however, depended on the specific historical period and the overall size of the legion, which could vary due to factors like available resources, military campaigns, and the perceived need for specific types of troops. During the early and mid-Republican period (roughly 6th-3rd centuries BCE), a Roman legion might have included around 300 horsemen, divided into 10 squadrons, called turmae. Each turma was led by a decurion, and the cavalry as a whole was commanded by the senior officer or tribune. However, this is not a universal number for all manipular legions. The Second Punic War (218-201 BCE) saw the Roman army undergo several organizational changes and adjustments in response to military setbacks and Hannibal's innovative tactics. The need for increased mobility and flexibility on the battlefield led to augmenting the cavalry in the Roman legions. In some instances, the number of horsemen might have doubled in a single legion. By the time of Julius Caesar and Augustus, Rome had transitioned from the manipular system to the cohort system, which dictated the organization of the legions. While the basic unit of the cohort system was the cohort rather than the maniple and involved the integration of heavy infantry instead of being divided into distinct lines, cavalry continued to play an essential role in Roman warfare. In the late Republic (1st century BCE) and early Empire (1st century CE), a legion typically consisted of around 5,000-6,000 infantrymen, with approximately 120 horsemen, organized into four squadrons. Thus, the primary focus shifted to heavy infantry, and the cavalry was more likely to be provided by allied forces, making the auxiliary cavalry units (such as the numerus) an increasingly important aspect of Rome's military forces. In conclusion, while it is not incorrect to say that \\"The heavy infantry of the maniples were supported by a number of light infantry and cavalry troops,\\" the number of horsemen in a single manipular legion could vary depending on the specific historical context and operational needs. Instead of specifying an exact figure, it is more accurate to emphasize the essential role played by horsemen in the overall composition and tactical flexibility of the Roman manipular legion."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Walking up it is quite a bit easier than running or cycling up it , I assure you . Ha ! Answer the following question: Why is it easier to walk up the Big Dam Bridge ?","completion":"Walking up the Big Dam Bridge is considered easier than running or cycling up for several reasons. Here's a detailed explanation of the factors contributing to the relative ease of walking as opposed to other modes of traversing the bridge. 1. Muscle Engagement: While walking, your leg muscles are engaged at a more gradual pace, allowing for less fatigue in comparison to cycling or running. Running and cycling require more powerful and continuous contractions from the muscles, which results in quicker exhaustion. 2. Energy Expenditure: Walking consumes less energy per unit of distance than running or cycling, allowing you to conserve more energy as you ascend the bridge. When you run or cycle, more muscle groups are involved, thereby demanding more energy and increasing the chances that you'll tire. 3. Traction and Balance: Walking provides better control over traction and balance. During the ascent, your feet have more time to properly grip the ground, preventing slips, and ensuring better stability. On the other hand, cycling uphill requires a precise balance between maintaining control and applying enough force to keep advancing, while running increases the chances of slips or stumbles. 4. Oxygen Consumption: As walking is a low-intensity activity, it results in slower heart rates, allowing your body to efficiently consume and distribute oxygen. For cycling and running, the intensity level and heart rate are higher, making it more challenging to supply sufficient oxygen to the muscles, ultimately leading to shortness of breath or discomfort during the ascent. 5. Lactic Acid Buildup: Due to lower aerobic intensity, walking reduces the rate at which lactic acid accumulates in the muscles. When running or cycling uphill, lactic acid - a byproduct of anaerobic respiration - increases, causing muscle soreness and fatigue. Walking allows the body more time to metabolize and clear out lactic acid, reducing the risks of muscle cramps or discomfort. 6. Recovery Time: As walking is a low-impact activity, it leads to quicker recovery times for muscles and joints compared to running or cycling. This means that muscles can recuperate faster after you've ascended the bridge, allowing you to recover and continue your journey with less strain. 7. Reduced Injury Risk: Walking reduces the risk of injury. Running and cycling, especially on an uphill climb like the Big Dam Bridge, can put increased stress on joints and muscles, leading to a higher chance of sprains, strains, or other injuries. In summary, walking up the Big Dam Bridge is easier than running or cycling due to its low impact on joints and muscles, reduced energy expenditure, better balance and traction, efficient oxygen consumption, lower lactic acid buildup, shorter recovery times, and lower injury risks. These factors combine to make walking a more comfortable and enjoyable way to experience the Big Dam Bridge."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Shoe creams polish and add color to leather, so make sure you choose a color you don’t mind wearing. Try to select a cream that matches the color of your shoes. Creams work very well on repaired cracks, but you can also use them to color the rest of the leather. Use a cotton or microfiber cloth to restore the leather back to its normal state. Starting at the top of each shoe, rub the leather with small, circular motions. Buff both shoes equally to get them to look the same. Make sure you treat all parts of the shoe the same way so the leather looks uniform all over. Check the shoes again to see how they look. With proper treatment, the cracks will no longer be visible. Use more filler, cream, or other products as needed. A great time to start conditioning is after you finish with the repairs. Use a clean cotton or microfiber cloth to avoid working dirt into the leather. Apply the conditioner in a thin, even layer by buffing the leather with small, circular motions. Work on one part of the shoe at a time until you have it completely covered. As an animal material, leather needs regular oiling to prevent it from drying out and cracking.

Q:Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the name of the band that did not foresee \\"Under the Bridge\\" as being equally viable due to the success of \\"Give it Away\\"? Blood Sugar Sex Magik was released on September 24, 1991, the same day as Nirvana's breakthrough album Nevermind. It was certified gold just over two months later on November 26, 1991, and certified platinum on April 1, 1992; since then it has gone seven times platinum in the United States. The album peaked at number 3 on the Billboard 200. Originally, \\"Give it Away\\" did not fare well in the mainstream; several of Warner Bros.' target radio stations refused to air it, telling the band to \\"come back to us when you have a melody in your song\\". KROQ (of Los Angeles), however, began to play the single several times daily, and that, according to Kiedis, \\"was the beginning of the infusion of 'Give It Away' into mass consciousness.\\" The single ultimately peaked at number 9 on the UK Top 40 and number 73 on the Billboard Hot 100. Blood Sugar Sex Magik has sold over 13 million copies worldwide.Due to the success of \\"Give it Away\\", the band did not foresee \\"Under the Bridge\\" as being equally viable. Warner Bros. sent representatives to a Chili Peppers' concert in order to figure out what would ultimately be the next single. When Frusciante began playing \\"Under the Bridge\\", Kiedis missed his cue; the entire audience began singing the song, instead. Kiedis was initially \\"mortified that I had fucked up in front of Warner's people ... I apologized for fucking up but they said 'Fucking up? Are you kidding me? When every single kid at the show sings a song, that's our next single.'\\" \\"Under the Bridge\\" was, therefore, selected as Blood Sugar Sex Magik's second single. By January 1992, \\"Under the Bridge\\" had exploded, peaking at number 2 on the Billboard Hot 100.To promote the album in Europe, Kiedis and Frusciante both agreed they would make the trip. However, it proved difficult for Frusciante to adapt to life outside of the mansion, after being in near-seclusion for almost 30 days.

Unfavorable comparison: The reviewer explicitly states their preference for Milepost, which they used extensively in Alaska. The implication here is that they were expecting a similar level of detail and quality from the Explore! guide for Montana. By expressing dissatisfaction in finding that Explore! does not come close to Milepost's level of detail, the reviewer is essentially implying that the product did not meet their expectations or needs. 2. Explicit disappointment: The reviewer voices their disappointment by stating that if Milepost were available for every state, that's what they would choose. This indicates that the reviewer would have preferred to use Milepost over Explore! had the option been available. 3. Future intentions: The reviewer concludes their review by expressing their intention to find an alternative to Explore! for their next trip out west. They do not mention any positive attributes of Explore! nor do they show any intent to recommend it to others. This further demonstrates that the reviewer's experience with the product was negative, and they would avoid using it again in the future.

This ensures that the process is completed safely and efficiently.

But Brafman portrayed Shkreli as a self-educated scientific boy wonder who slept nights in a sleeping bag in his office as he worked to develop a cure for a deadly disease afflicting children, while at the same time making millions of dollars for his investors. Brafman said that contrary to the government's suggestions, the investors in the MSMB funds not only got their original investment amount back, but often much more. The attorney also depicted Shkreli as an \\"odd duck\\" prone to wearing furry bunny slippers and a stethoscope around the corporate offices while serving as CEO of Retrophin. Brafman said Shkreli was bullied and called names behind his back by co-workers as well as Retrophin board members who eventually ousted him because he didn't look or act like a conventional CEO. Shkreli's colleagues made fun of him among themselves, calling him \\"Rain Man\\" because they believed he was autistic, and challenging his sexuality by suggesting he was gay or bisexual, Brafman said. \\"As Lady Gaga said, he was born this way,\\" Brafman said, referring to Shkreli's often awkward nature. \\"You wanna call him names? Call him names. Just don't call him guilty. 'Cause he's not guilty.\\" Shkreli, sitting at the defense table, sometimes nodded in agreement with Brafman's broad defense of him and with the lawyer's attack on expected witnesses against him. The lawyer said that all of the people who placed their money with Shkreli's funds were sophisticated investors, or had top-notch financial advisors, and were \\"high rollers\\" who wanted to exploit Shkreli's genius to make big returns. Brafman also said that the many consulting agreements and settlement deals that Shkreli cut, which the government claims were used to cover up his looting of Retrophin, were signed off by the corporation's board and lawyers. Brafman suggested that Retrophin board members and its current CEO would lie when they took the witness stand against Shkreli, and told jurors that they would be able to discern those lies from how the witnesses answered questions and were contradicted by documents, emails and other evidence. The question at the end of the trial, Brafman told jurors, will be \\"not whether Martin Shkreli is nuts, but whether the case is nuts.\\" ||||| After Mr. Shkreli lost millions of dollars in a trade, draining the remaining money from MSMB Capital, a few days later he founded MSMB Healthcare, in early 2011, the prosecutor said. About the same time, he formed the pharmaceutical company Retrophin, and had MSMB Healthcare invest in Retrophin. “The defendant was on both sides of the deal,” Mr. Srinivasan said. When his debt for the trading loss came due, “he stole money from MSMB Healthcare” to pay the debt, which the health care fund did not owe, Mr. Srinivasan said. Mr. Shkreli then told investors that he was shutting down the two funds, and told them they could have stock in Retrophin or cash for their shares. Those who wanted cash could not get it and threatened to sue, he said, and that is when Mr. Shkreli arranged for Retrophin to “pay off” the MSMB investors. “Retrophin owed these investors nothing — the defendant owed these debts,” Mr. Srinivasan said. When accountants told him to stop, Mr. Shkreli arranged to hire the investors as consultants, a sham, the prosecutor said. Investors may have made their money back, Mr. Srinivasan said, but Mr. Shkreli still committed fraud. In his opening, Mr. Brafman flipped the setup that Mr. Srinivasan had constructed in trying to portray the investors and Retrophin board as victims and Mr. Shkreli as a villain. Actually, Mr. Brafman said, Mr. Shkreli was pushed out of Retrophin because its board thought he did “not conform to their idea of what a public company C.E.O. should look like or walk like or talk like,” he said. ||||| At start of securities fraud trial, US prosecutor accuses ex-pharmaceutical CEO of building a bogus hedge fund empire by telling ‘lies on top of lies on top of lies’ Martin Shkreli is either a con man who scammed hedge fund investors out of millions or a nerdy genius who made them even richer. The conflicting portraits were offered Wednesday in opening statements at Shkreli’s securities fraud trial, a case colored by the ex-pharmaceutical CEO’s antics on social media which, despite the urging of his lawyers to lay low, have never subsided. Potential Martin Shkreli jurors: we can't be impartial over 'most hated man' in US Read more “Is he strange? Yes,” the defense attorney Benjamin Brafman told the jurors in federal court in Brooklyn. “Will you find him weird? Yes. But Martin Shkreli, despite all his flaws and dysfunctional personality, is brilliant beyond words.” In his opening, the assistant US attorney Karthik Srinivasan accused Shkreli of building a bogus hedge fund empire by telling “lies on top of lies on top of lies”. Though he portrayed himself as a Wall Street wizard, “in reality, he was just a con man”, the prosecutor said. Shkreli, sometimes dubbed Pharma Bro, often slumped in his chair and looked bored during jury selection but listened intently and took notes during the government’s opening. As his lawyer spoke, he beamed at times. Shkreli, 34, became a pariah in 2015 after a drug company he founded, Turing Pharmaceuticals, spent 55m for the US rights to sell a life-saving medicine called Daraprim and promptly raised the price from 13.50 to 750 per pill. The spotlight intensified later that year with his arrest on charges – unrelated to Daraprim – focusing on a pair of failed hedge funds he founded. After he lost investors’ money through bad trades, he secretly looted Retrophin, another pharmaceutical company where he was CEO, for 10m to pay back his disgruntled clients, Srinivasan said. “Rather than owning up to his lies and admitting his investments were a failure, the defendant doubled down by engaging in an even bigger fraud,” he said. The alleged victims in the case were high-rolling investors who were drawn to Shkreli’s quirky personality and ended up getting their money back – and more – because Retrophin eventually became a successful startup worth 1bn, Brafman said. Board members of his companies who made fun of Shkreli behind his back – questioning his sexuality, wondering if he was autistic and calling him Rain Man after the movie character – misunderstood his talents, said the defense lawyer, who referred to his client as a “nerd”, “odd duck” and a “mad scientist”. He added: “As Lady Gaga said, ‘He was Born This Way.” Jury selection, which started Monday, dragged out until late Wednesday afternoon as the judge sought to find jurors who could ignore the negative press over the price-gouging scandal. Also hard to ignore was Skhreli’s footprint on social media, where he boasted about buying a one-of-a-kind Wu-Tang Clan album for 2m and got kicked off Twitter for trolling a female freelance journalist in creepy ways. Questioned by the judge during sidebars, prospective jurors described Shkreli as “the face of corporate greed” and “a snake”. “In this particular case,” another dismissed juror said Wednesday, “the only thing I’d be impartial about is what prison he goes to.” Shkreli is free on 5m bond. If convicted, he faces up to 20 years in prison. ||||| Summary:","completion":"Martin Shkreli, the controversial former pharmaceutical CEO, is either a con man who scammed hedge fund investors or a nerdy genius, lawyers in his securities fraud trial argued in their opening statements.

Write an article based on this summary: A project to publish every letter ever written or received by Charles Darwin is expected to be completed after a £5m funding boost. Article:","completion":"Title: Charles Darwin's Complete Correspondence Collection to See the Light of Day After £5m Funding Boost Introduction A monumental project to publish every letter ever written or received by Charles Darwin, the renowned naturalist and biologist, is expected to reach completion following a substantial funding infusion of £5 million. The enterprise, spear-headed by the Darwin Correspondence Project (DCP), intends to shed light on the life and work of the scientist, offering insight into his relationships, personal thoughts, and the manner in which his scientific theories developed and evolved over time. Background on Charles Darwin Charles Darwin, born in 1809, was an English naturalist, geologist, and biologist, notable for his work on the science of evolution. His most famous contribution, the theory of natural selection, argues that species evolve over generations through a process of heritable traits that enhance an organism's ability to survive and reproduce in its given environment. Darwin's groundbreaking book, \\"On the Origin of Species,\\" published in 1859, introduced this theory and has since become the cornerstone of evolutionary biology. The Darwin Correspondence Project (DCP) Established in 1974 at the University of Cambridge, the Darwin Correspondence Project aims to publish the entire collection of Darwin's letters, providing a unique window into the private world of the influential scientist. The project's mission is to make the letters accessible for scholarly and public use, enabling researchers and enthusiasts around the globe to gain an intimate perspective on Darwin's thought process, scientific inquiries, and exchanges with acquaintances. Over the span of nearly five decades, the project has managed to transcribe and annotate more than half of the 15,000 letters in their possession. However, with the recent £5 million funding boost provided by the Oldbury Trust, DCP is expected to realize its goal of publishing all of Darwin's letters in the next ten years. The Significance of the Letters Darwin's letters encompass an extensive range of topics, covering scientific treaties, personal thoughts, and communication with fellow scientists, friends, and family members. Among these correspondences are key exchanges with colleagues such as Thomas Henry Huxley, Joseph Dalton Hooker, and Alfred Russel Wallace, who were prominent figures in the scientific community at the time. The letters provide an unparalleled opportunity to study Darwin's philosophies, argumentations, and evolving beliefs in a way that formal scientific publications cannot capture. They offer a narrative of scientific discovery and collaboration in the 19th century, illuminating the challenges and triumphs that Darwin experienced throughout his personal and professional life. Moreover, the letters serve as a treasure trove for historians, biologists, and the general public interested in understanding the formulation of the theory of natural selection and the development of evolutionary biology. As crucial artifacts documenting the history of science, these letters have the potential to foster a deeper appreciation for Darwin's contributions and their enduring significance in various domains of human knowledge and inquiry. Conclusion The Darwin Correspondence Project's efforts to publish Charles Darwin's complete collection of letters will profoundly enrich our grasp of the great scientist's contributions to our understanding of life on Earth. With the generous £5 million funding boost, devotees of Darwin's work can anticipate a comprehensive understanding of his life and mind in the near future. This achievement not only underscores the historical importance of his discoveries but also serves as a testament to the enduring impact of his theories and ideas in shaping our comprehension of the natural world."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Analyzing the words in isolation, \\"point\\" and \\"purpose\\" can come across as neutral or even slightly positive expressions. However, the sentiment behind the entire phrase ultimately depends on the context in which it is used, the tone of surrounding statements, and even the individual reader's perspective. Let's delve into a detailed and long exploration of the possible interpretations. 1. Neutral sentiment: In some contexts, the phrase \\"point and purpose\\" might be perceived as a neutral statement. It may be used to emphasize the importance of having a meaningful reason behind an action or decision, without necessarily expressing a positive or negative emotion. For instance, someone could say, \\"In every project, it is crucial to understand the point and purpose before proceeding.\\" Here, the sentiment neither leans positive nor negative but is simply a reminder or assertion. 2. Positive sentiment: At times, the phrase can carry a positive sentiment, especially when it is used to describe the meaningful, focused, or goal-oriented nature of something. For example, during a review of a book or movie, a critic may mention, \\"The narrative is well-constructed, with every scene having a clear point and purpose.\\" In this context, \\"point and purpose\\" becomes a positive quality, reflecting the strength of the work in having every aspect thought out and directed towards a common goal. 3. Negative sentiment: Conversely, the phrase can also be used to express dissatisfaction or confusion with a lack of an actionable direction. An example might be a person saying, \\"I walked out of that meeting with no idea of the point and purpose behind the discussion.\\" This statement would suggest that the speaker found the conversation pointless or directionless, leading to a negative view of the meeting. 4. Questioning sentiment: In some circumstances, this phrase is used to prompt further explanation or inquiry. In this case, the sentiment might be a bit critical or challenging, as it questions the rationale behind someone's choices or actions: \\"What is the point and purpose of spending so much money on this event?\\" Here, the respondent is demanding justification for a decision, inviting a response that could either satisfy their curiosity or draw further criticism. 5. Slightly sarcastic sentiment: Depending on tone and context, the phrase \\"point and purpose\\" might carry a sarcastic or ironic undertone. In a situation where the speaker feels the subject matter is nonsensical, irrelevant, or needlessly complicated, they may use the phrase to derisively highlight its futility. For example: \\"Sure, let's keep arguing about the font size – the real point and purpose of this project.\\" In summary, the sentiment behind the phrase \\"point and purpose\\" can be neutral, positive, negative, questioning, or sarcastic, based on the context in which it is employed, the tone and intent of the speaker, and how the listener interprets it. To accurately gauge its intended impact, one should consider the surrounding conversation, intended audience, and delivery tone."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

My family and I went to this restaurant last night, looking forward to a lovely dining experience but instead, we left with a sour taste in our mouths (figuratively and literally). Upon arrival, it took a long time for the host to seat us, even though there were several empty tables available. When we were finally seated, we observed that the tables weren't very clean, with crumbs left over from the previous guests. This should have been an indication of what to expect, but we decided to give it a chance and stay. The interior of the restaurant was quite noisy, and the music was playing excessively loud, making it difficult to maintain a conversation. This severely undercut the ambiance and affected the enjoyment of our meal. Our server seemed overwhelmed and uninterested in providing us with attentive customer service. It took a while before someone came to take our order, and even then, the server didn't seem knowledgeable enough to offer recommendations or answer questions about the menu items. We had to call the server's attention multiple times to refill our water glasses and bring condiments, which made us feel neglected. The food itself left a lot to be desired. We ordered a variety of dishes, hoping to sample the best that [Restaurant Name] had to offer, but sadly, everything we tried lacked flavor and depth. The presentation was unimpressive, and some dishes appeared as if they had been hastily thrown together. My steak was overcooked and tough to chew, while the accompanying vegetables were under-seasoned and almost tasteless. My wife's pasta dish was drowning in sauce, yet somehow still dry. Our daughter's meal was equally disappointing, as her chicken was dry and her side dish seemed like it had been sitting under the heating lamp for too long. The final straw came when we received the bill. The prices were steep, and considering the poor quality of food, lack of ambiance, and subpar service, we felt it was not worth the cost. I really wanted to enjoy our visit to [Restaurant Name], but unfortunately, this experience has deterred us from returning. In conclusion, I cannot recommend dining at [Restaurant Name] due to the lack of cleanliness, poor customer service, unimpressive food quality, and high prices.

The overall performance of this app has been consistently poor, and it has become more of a source of inconvenience rather than a helpful tool. To begin with, the app's installation process was unintuitive and filled with unnecessary steps. I was hopeful that, once installed, the app would be more user-friendly, but my optimism was short-lived. It is evident that the developers put little thought into an efficient user experience, as the app's interface is cluttered, disorganized, and hard to navigate. Frequent crashes and unresponsive features have only worsened my experience with the com.google.android.gms app. Oftentimes, a simple attempt to access a menu or an in-app setting would lead to an unresponsive screen, followed by a complete app crash. This level of instability has proven to be extremely frustrating and time-consuming, as I have had to relaunch the app multiple times just to complete a simple task. Additionally, the app proved to be a significant drain on my device's battery life and performance. Even when running in the background, it consumed a considerable amount of battery, causing my device's battery to deplete much faster than usual. Furthermore, the app's impact on my device's performance was highly noticeable, causing it to lag and freeze repeatedly. Lastly, I cannot overlook the lack of effective customer support for this app. When I encountered issues and sought assistance, I was greeted by unhelpful and unresponsive support channels. It was as if the developers had no interest in resolving issues for their users, which made me feel even more undervalued as a customer. In conclusion, I cannot recommend the com.google.android.gms app to anyone in its current state. The app's poor performance, instability, high battery consumption, and unresponsive customer support make it severely lacking in all aspects. Users would be better off seeking alternative solutions, as this app fails to deliver a competent and positive experience."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

As Harvey's interests shifted to the Pyramid, Monte Ne's resort days effectively ended and the number of visitors slowly dwindled. Activities and events at Monte Ne continued, supported by locals who still visited in large numbers. Harvey sold the Hotel Monte Ne. The hotel went through several name changes and owners, becoming the White Hotel circa 1912, the Randola Inn in 1918, the Hotel Frances in 1925, and in 1930 the Sleepy Valley Hotel. Monte Ne's larger hotels continued to be active after they, along with the dance pavilion and Elixir Spring, were foreclosed and sold at public auction. From 1927 to 1932, Missouri Row and Oklahoma Row (often called the Club House Hotels at this point) were home to the Ozark Industrial College and School of Theology, a nonsectarian school run by Dan W. Evans. The hotels housed pupils—Missouri Row for boys, Oklahoma Row for girls—and Oklahoma Row also provided classroom and dining spaces. Evans and his family lived in the tower. The dance pavilion was enclosed and served as the school chapel. In May 1932, following a mortgage foreclosure against the school, school officials were evicted and the property was sold.After he announced the building of the Pyramid, at age 69, Harvey began suffering a series of serious health problems, but continued to work tirelessly. In 1926, blood poisoning in his foot put him in a coma that lasted several days resulting in surgery, and three months of recuperation. In 1929 he and Anna were finally divorced. Three days later Harvey married his long-time personal secretary May Leake. In 1930, he came down with double pneumonia.

The bakery didn't like it at all. So, the bakery reached out to their friend Google and said, \\"Hey Google, we saw a not-so-nice logo on your search page!

Question: Information: - The Haplogynae are a clade of araneomorph spiders, one of the two main groups into which the araneomorphs are divided. - The Prodidomidae are a spider family with about 300 species in 31 genera. They are sometimes called long-spinneret ground spiders. - Mesothelae is a suborder of spiders (order Araneae) that includes a single living (extant) family, Liphistiidae, and a number of extinct families. This suborder is thought to form the sister group to all other living spiders, and retain ancestral characters, such as a segmented abdomen with spinnerets in the middle and two pairs of book lungs. Members of Liphistiidae are medium to large spiders with eight eyes grouped on a tubercle. They are only found in China, Japan, and southeast Asia. - The Thomisidae are a family of spiders, including about 175 genera and over 2,100 species. The common name crab spider is often applied to species in this family, but is also applied loosely to many other species of spiders. Among the Thomisidae, \\"crab spider\\" refers most often to the familiar species of \\"flower crab spiders\\", though not all members of the family are limited to ambush hunting in flowers. - The Entelegynae or entelegynes are a subgroup of araneomorph spiders, one of the two main groups into which the araneomorphs are divided. Almost all members of this group, unlike most members of Haplogynae (the other main group), have eight eyes, and females have a genital plate. However, some entelegyne species have no (or reduced) eyes, and six-eyed spiders do occur, for example in the genus \\"Lygromma\\" (Prodidomidae, Gnaphosoidea). - The Mygalomorphae or mygalomorphs are an infraorder of spiders. The name is derived from the Greek \\"mugal\\", meaning \\"shrew\\", plus \\"morph\\" meaning form or shape. An older name for the group is Orthognatha, derived from the orientation of the fangs which point straight down and do not cross each other (as they do in the araneomorphs). - The Dionycha are a phylogenetic group of spiders ( Araneomorphae : Entelegynae ) with about 10,000 species . 17 families belong to this group , amongst others : Salticidae ( jumping spiders ) , Gnaphosoidea , Thomisidae ( crab spiders ) , and the Clubionidae . Spiders in this group have better senses ( sight , hearing ) than others , some even show courtship dances and songs . The Dionycha probably evolved from the web - building Trionycha . Unlike these , the Dionycha have only two instead of three tarsal claws . The central third claw of the Trionycha is responsible for tracking the silk thread . Instead of this claw , Dionycha have dense tufts of scupula hairs that produce strong adhesion , enabling some species to climb glass . Most species hunt their prey instead of building webs , although some species of Trionycha ( members of Lycosoidea ) also hunt . There are no cribellate members in the Dionycha . The monophyly of the Dionycha has been disputed . Today it is thought that the reduction of the third claw evolved several times independently . - Lygromma is a spider genus of Central and South America. There are species with eight, six (e.g. \\"L. senoculatum\\", \\"L. valencianum\\") and no eyes. The eyeless \\"L. anops\\" is endemic to Galapagos, while the not closely related blind \\"L. gertschi\\" is found only on Jamaica. - Tarantulas comprise a group of large and often hairy arachnids belonging to the Theraphosidae family of spiders, of which approximately 900 species have been identified. This article only describes members of Theraphosidae, although some other members of the same suborder are commonly referred to as \\"tarantulas\\". Except in cases of anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction) no species of tarantula are dangerous to humans, and some species have become popular in the exotic pet trade. - Opisthothelae is a taxon within Order Araneae, consisting of the Mygalomorphae and the Araneomorphae, but excluding the Mesothelae. Opisthothelae is sometimes presented as an unranked clade and sometimes as a suborder of the Araneae. In the latter case, Mygalomorphae and Araneomorphae are treated as infraorders. - Araneomorphae (sometimes referred to as Labidognatha) is an infraorder of spiders. They are distinguished by having fangs that oppose each other and cross in a pinching action, in contrast to the Mygalomorphae (tarantulas and their close kin), which have fangs that are nearly parallel in alignment. Both Araneomorphae and Mygalomorphae belong to the suborder Opisthothelae, which comprises nearly all extant species of spider. Mesothelae, the only other suborder in Aranea, includes only about 100 living species. - The Gnaphosoidea or gnaphosoids are a superfamily of araneomorph spiders with seven families. A 2014 study did not find the group to be monophyletic. What object entity has the relation of 'instance of' with the subject 'dionycha'?

The fact that the 1996 Australian television film McLeod's Daughters was a huge success, being the highest rated telemovie of all time in Australia, and holding this record even today, provides a strong hint to the popularity of the story and the characters. The success of the television film prompted the development of a television series adaptation of the same name. The television series McLeod's Daughters ran for a remarkable 8 seasons, airing from 2001 to 2009, which further suggests its significant popularity among viewers. A series that lasts for multiple seasons is usually a sign of continued viewer interest and a dedicated following. Throughout its eight seasons, the show garnered numerous awards and nominations, some of which include the Australian Film Institute Awards, the Logie Awards (Australia's television industry awards), and the Australian Writers' Guild Awards. McLeod's Daughters focused on the lives of two sisters who reunite after several years apart and decide to take over their father's cattle farm in the Australian Outback. The show's prominent themes of family, friendship, romance, and rural life certainly appealed to a wide audience, both in Australia and internationally. The relatable storylines and engaging characters resonated with viewers, making McLeod's Daughters a beloved and successful series. In addition to the awards and positive critical feedback, the show's fan initiatives, such as online forums, fan-generated artwork, and social media accounts dedicated to the series, indicate a strong and engaged fanbase. Moreover, the show was popular enough to spawn merchandise, books, a DVD box set, and even international adaptations, which further supports the inference of the television series' popularity and influence.

Article: Is it possible that the sinking of the Titanic was caused by a ghost? A plot of the story below is true ... but did it really happen quite like this? Our story begins not in the icy cold waters of the North Atlantic, but rather thousands of miles away in Egypt. It is here, perhaps, that we can find the start of the mystery of the Titanic, in the year 1910, in the great city of Cairo. One day, a famous professor of Egyptian history called Douglas Murray was staying in Cairo, when he was contacted by an American adventurer. The American had something unusual to offer Murray, something that was certain to thrill him: a beautiful ancient Egyptian mummy case, containing the mummy of an Egyptian queen. It was over 3,000 years old, but in beautiful condition -- gold, with bright paintings on it. Murray was delighted with both the object and the askingprice. He gave the man a cheque immediately. The cheque was never cashed. That evening the American adventurer died. For his part, Murray arranged to have the treasure sent back to Britain. However, it was not long before he learnt more about the beautiful mummy case: On the walls of the tomb in which it had been discovered, there were messages which warned of terrible consequences to anyone who broke into the tomb. Murray was disbelieving of these warnings until a few days later, when a gun he was holding exploded in his hand, shattering his arm. The arm had to be cut off. After the accident, Murray decided to return to his homeland. On the return journey, two of his companions died mysteriously, and two servants who had handled the mummy also passed away.

Question: suppose there is no kidney's in the body happens, how will it affect less chemical compounds produced. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect The answer is:","completion":"C: no effect The question seems to combine two different concepts: acid rain and the role of kidneys in the human body. Let's discuss these concepts separately to better understand the answer. 1. The process described in the question refers to acid rain - a consequence of air pollution. When human industry produces chemical compounds like sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx), they are released into the air and mix with other natural substances in the atmosphere. These compounds then dissolve in water droplets within clouds, forming acidic solutions. When it rains, the affected (acidic) rain falls to the earth, potentially harming natural ecosystems and man-made structures. 2. Kidneys are essential organs in the human body responsible for filtering waste products from the blood, regulating blood pressure, electrolyte balance, and red blood cell production. They have no direct influence on the chemical compounds produced by human industry related to acid rain. Therefore, the absence of kidneys in the human body would not affect the production of industrial chemical compounds related to acid rain.

This would be a human characteristic when preparing lobsters for eating. +Produce light: While some marine organisms have the ability to produce light (bioluminescence), lobsters are not known to have special structures specifically for producing light. +Staying warm: Lobsters, being cold-blooded animals, do not have any special structures for staying warm. +Butter: This answer does not make sense as lobsters are not involved in butter production or connection with their biological structures. +Maine: This answer refers to a geographical location, not a specific biological structure of lobsters. +Layers of fat: Lobsters do not have layers of fat as mammals do. They store energy in different ways, such as glycogen and lipoproteins in their hepatopancreas. +Tastiness: While lobsters are often considered a delicacy, \\"tastiness\\" is not a special structure.

Background: Namdev, also transliterated as Namdeo and Namadeva, (traditionally, c. 1270 - c. 1350) was a poet-saint from Maharashtra, India who is significant to the Varkari sect of Hinduism. He is also venerated in Sikhism, as well as Hindu warrior-ascetic traditions such as the Dadupanthis and the Niranjani Sampraday that emerged in north India during the Islamic rule. The details of Namdev's life are unclear. He is the subject of many miracle-filled hagiographies composed centuries after he died. Context: Namdev's padas are not mere poems, according to Callewaert and Lath. Like other Bhakti movement sants, Namdev composed bhajans, that is songs meant to be sung to music. A Bhajan literally means \\"a thing enjoyed or shared\\". Namdev's songs were composed to be melodious and carry a spiritual message. They built on one among the many ancient Indian traditions for making music and singing. Namdev's bhajans, note Callewaert and Lath, deployed particular species of Raag, used Bhanita (or Chhap, a stamp of the composer's name inside the poem, in his case Nama), applied a Tek (or dhruva, repeated refrain) and a meter than helps harmonise the wording with the musical instrument, all according to Sangita manuals refined from the 8th to 13th centuries. The musical genre of Namdev's literary works was a form of Prabandha - itself a very large and rich genre that includes dhrupad, thumri, tappa, geet, bhajan and other species. In some species of Indian music, it is the music that dominates while words and their meaning are secondary. In contrast, in Namdev's bhajan the spiritual message in the words has a central role, and the structure resonates with the singing and music. The songs and music that went with Namdev's works, were usually transmitted verbally across generations, in a guru-sisya-parampara (teacher-student tradition), within singing gharanas (family-like musical units). Callewaert and Lath state that, \\"each single song of Namdev is a musical and textual unit and this unit is the basis for textual considerations\\". The unit contained Antaras, which are the smallest independent unit within that can be shifted around, dropped or added, without affecting the harmony or meaning, when a bhajan is being sung with music. In Namdev's songs, the dominant pattern is Caturasra, or an avarta with the 4x4 square pattern of musical matras (beat). Question: What is Bhajans?. Whats the answer?","completion":"Bhajans are special songs that people sing to show their love and devotion to God. They are like happy and enjoyable songs that make people feel closer to God. People usually sing Bhajans in groups, with music and lots of instruments, making them sound beautiful and fun. These songs often have a deep and meaningful message about being a good person and loving God.

There, he discovers a series of illegal full-contact Mixed Martial Arts matches dominated by inmate Yuri Boyka. The prison officials arrange these fights and place large side-bets to make a personal profit, often at the expense of the fighters.Once inside, the warden and legal adviser for Chambers state that if he fights Yuri in the ring, he will likely get an expedited appeal and early release. He initially refuses, but after spending time in demeaning physical labor in the prison's sewer system and experiencing firsthand the brutality of the guards, he reluctantly agrees. He is rescued from both forms of humiliation by a crippled inmate, Crot (Eli Danker). Both fighters train hard for the match, though Chambers still relies on his boxing background while Boyka prepares a series of deadly kicks, throws, and grappling combinations designed to humiliate his opponent in the ring. Prior to the fight however, Boyka's friends force George's cellmate, Steven, who is acting as his cornerman, to spike his water with a light sedative during the fight.During the fight, Chambers is somewhat taken by surprise at the flurry and variety of Boyka's attacks, but manages to hold his own through the first round by keeping his distance, staying calm, and dealing out painful punching combinations whenever possible. At the end of the first round, Steven slips the drugged water into Chambers' mouth and he takes a few sips. During the second round, he starts to lose his focus and begins taking more and more punishment until Boyka knocks him out with a devastating flying kick. Following the fight, Steven kills himself out of guilt.After the fight, Chambers (having learnt of the truth from Crot) confronts Boyka, believing that he was responsible for drugging him, and the warden, for going back on the deal.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. PUT THE CAMERA ON ME is a deceptively cute film. It is actually a complex glimpse at the psychology of children and offers interesting insights into the development of adults and an artist. On the surface this is a nostalgic look at some home movies made in the 80's by a group of upper class neighborhood kids. One of the film's directors, Darren Stein, had access to a video camera and quickly took over as the artistic leader for all of the movies. Sure, these are just some cute kids having fun. But, this is also much more. This is a look into some moments in time as children grapple with a number of confusing issues that all of us face in life --- fear, sexual awakening, unrequited love, loneliness and just trying to make sense of the adult world which seems to explode all around us. As we get older we tend to forget how overwhlelming the realities of life were when we were little. What makes this film all the more valid is to watch a young Darren Stein turn into a little general of a filmmaker. It is clear that Darren is running this show and these little movies are his vision but they are all informed by his friends, their problems, the interpersonal dynamics and the general confusion regarding the horrors of adult life. A lot of children make home movies, but I've never heard of or seen children create \\"little\\" movies about the holocaust, homosexuality, nuclear war and the inability to fit in and make friends. These kids are confronting and dealing with some heavy stuff! The power of this film is the way Stein and Shell pull various scenes together so tightly with running interviews with the kids --- all now adults and all still friends. This adds a new angle to the film. How many of us have stayed in touch with our childhood friends? These guys have. And, many of the issues with which they were dealing are still running between them two decades later. Among the conflicts -- a confession of a crush reveals a heart still broken, a very normal childhood sexual experience continues to be a \\"sticky\\" subject between two of the men, some ongoing resentments over the dynamics of relationships and there is still a member of this team who remains very much in charge and in center stage! Which makes perfect sense as one watches these home movies progress over the course of a couple of years. Darren Stein is a director. No doubt about it. Stein and Shell take turns chatting with each other from time to time and one can't help but imagine the awkwardness of allowing us to peek into the young lives of these people. This is particularly true for Stein who has gone on to a great deal of success in the entertainment industry as a film producer, writer and director. From the first moment of PUT THE CAMERA ON ME we can see the emergence of a gay little boy trying to figure it all out. We also see sides of the artistic mind and personality that are not always \\"nice\\" or \\"caring\\" --- and, this is a bold move for any artist to share with an audience. There are so many revealing moments, but the most disturbing and complex moments involve a movie in which we see a Jewish concentration camp victim being tortured and killed by a Nazi. We discover thru interviews and narration that the Nazi is played by a Jewish child and the part of the victim is played by a gentile child. It is a painfully disturbing moment that glimpses into the darker side of fear and the way children work thru the horrors of the adult world that are beyond adult understanding much less that of a child. This is much more than some home movies. This documentary captures the pain, beauty, joy and sadness of growing up.

The book also encourages children to face their fears.\\"I think it's really good to show that Max is friends with the monsters,\\" Davis said.\\"Kids can find out monsters aren't always the thing under the bed that's going to scare them.I think this is good because it shows that the children can go to scary places but still have a positive experience.\\" Since the book has been successful throughout the years,a movie was recently made and many people are excited to see it.Davis said she thinks the movie will be wonderful but it might be a little scary for younger children.\\"You don't want bad dreams over a book that's extremely wonderful'\\" Davis said.

Answer the following question: Information: - Murder is the unlawful killing of another human without justification or valid excuse, especially the unlawful killing of another human being with malice aforethought. This state of mind may, depending upon the jurisdiction, distinguish murder from other forms of unlawful homicide, such as manslaughter. Manslaughter is a killing committed in the absence of \\"malice\\", brought about by reasonable provocation, or diminished capacity. \\"Involuntary\\" manslaughter, where it is recognized, is a killing that lacks all but the most attenuated guilty intent (\\"mens rea\\"), recklessness. - William Palmer ( 6 August 1824 -- 14 June 1856 ) , also known as the Rugeley Poisoner or the Prince of Poisoners , was an English doctor found guilty of murder in one of the most notorious cases of the 19th century . Charles Dickens called Palmer \`\` the greatest villain that ever stood in the Old Bailey '' . Palmer was convicted for the 1855 murder of his friend John Cook , and was executed in public by hanging the following year . He had poisoned Cook with strychnine , and was suspected of poisoning several other people including his brother and his mother - in - law , as well as four of his children who died of \`\` convulsions '' before their first birthdays . Palmer made large sums of money from the deaths of his wife and brother after collecting on life insurance , and by defrauding his wealthy mother out of thousands of pounds , all of which he lost through gambling on horses . - Charles John Huffam Dickens (7 February 1812 9 June 1870) was an English writer and social critic. He created some of the world's best-known fictional characters and is regarded by many as the greatest novelist of the Victorian era. His works enjoyed unprecedented popularity during his lifetime, and by the twentieth century critics and scholars had recognised him as a literary genius. His novels and short stories enjoy lasting popularity. - Homicide refers to one human being killing another. Homicides can be divided into many overlapping types, including murder, manslaughter, justifiable homicide, killing in war, euthanasia, and capital punishment and abortion, depending on the circumstances of the death. These different types of homicides are often treated very differently in human societies; some are considered crimes, while others are permitted or even ordered by the legal system. Given the information, choose the subject and object entities that have the relation of 'penalty'. Answer:","completion":"The subject entity in relation to 'penalty' is William Palmer, and the object entity is the public hanging as his punishment for the crime of murder."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It curls up, feeds and grows stronger when its host is afraid, effectively crushing the person's spine if curled up long enough. The host can weaken the creature and stop its curling by screaming. Movie theater owner Oliver Higgins (Coolidge), who shows exclusively silent films, is an acquaintance of Dr. Chapin. Higgins's wife Martha (Evelyn), who is deaf and mute, dies of fright after weird, apparently supernatural events have occurred in her room. During her autopsy, Chapin removes the Tingler from her spine. After they have contained the Tingler and return to Higgins' house, it is revealed that Higgins is the murderer; he frightened his wife to death knowing that she could not scream because she was mute. The centipede-like creature eventually breaks free from the container that held it in and is released into the theater where the deaf mute woman ran before she died. Chapin wishes not to tell anyone, knowing it would start a panic. The Tingler latches onto a woman's leg, and she screams until it releases its grip. Chapin controls the situation by shutting off the lights and telling everyone in the theater to scream. When the Tingler has left the showing room, they resume the movie and go to the projection room where they find the Tingler and capture it. Guessing that the only way to neutralize the Tingler is to reinsert it inside Martha's body, Chapin does so. After he leaves, Higgins, who has admitted his guilt to Chapin, is alone in the room. As if by supernatural forces, the door slams shut and locks itself and the window closes, echoing what happened just before Martha was frightened to death. The Tingler causes the body of Martha to rise from the bed, staring at her husband. Higgins is so terrified that he is unable to scream. The screen fades, and there is the...

Question: What would use an account book? Choices: - desk drawer - purse - bank - keep accounts - keep track of emails The rationale to choose \\"bank\\" as the answer is that: Answer:","completion":"The most appropriate answer to the question \\"What would use an account book?\\" is \\"bank.\\" The rationale for choosing \\"bank\\" as the answer in comparison to the other options is based on the primary function and purpose of account books and their relevance to banking processes. The detailed reasoning behind this choice can be broken down into several aspects: 1. Relevance to Banking Activities: Banks handle various financial transactions and maintain records of all the account activities of their customers. An account book serves as a tool to record and keep track of these transactions systematically. Usage of account books has deep historical roots in banking activities, dating back to early banking systems. 2. Account Management: Within the context of banks, account books are used to keep accounts. This choice refers to the act of maintaining precise records of financial transactions in individual customer accounts, ensuring accuracy and completeness. Account books provide a systematic approach to record debits and credits, along with noting the details of each transaction. 3. Auditing and Compliance: Banks are required to adhere to various regulatory guidelines and must be able to provide accurate and reliable financial records for auditing purposes. Account books serve as essential tools for maintaining records that can be audited and used as documentation by regulatory bodies for ensuring compliance of banks with the necessary financial laws and regulations. 4. Historical Progression: Although modern banks have mostly transitioned to digital record-keeping, account books were once a ubiquitous tool for maintaining records of various financial transactions and events. Account books hold historical significance in the field of banking and remain relevant to the understanding of the evolution of banking practices. 5. Inadequacy of Alternative Choices: a. Desk Drawer: This choice is irrelevant to the question since a desk drawer is merely a physical storage space and does not utilize an account book. b. Purse: A purse is a personal item used for carrying money and small belongings, and it is not an appropriate choice for utilizing an account book. Accounting records are typically maintained in more formal settings such as ledgers and digital databases, rather than purses. c. Keep accounts: Although this choice reflects the actual usage of an account book, it lacks a specific subject to associate it with. Within the context of the question, \\"bank\\" is the most relevant subject that keeps accounts. d. Keep track of emails: This option is unrelated to the purpose of an account book, which deals primarily with financial transactions and not electronic communication. Thus, based on the most fitting application and relevance of account books in relation to banking, it is reasonable to choose \\"bank\\" as the answer to the given question."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

What is the answer?","completion":"Scott McKenzie sang about San Francisco in his 1967 hit song \\"San Francisco (Be Sure to Wear Flowers in Your Hair).\\" The song was written by John Phillips, a member of The Mamas and the Papas, and it became an iconic anthem for the 1967 Summer of Love. During the mid to late 1960s, the Haight-Ashbury district in San Francisco became a gathering place for thousands of counterculture youth who identified themselves as \\"hippies.\\" They were attracted to the area's unique blend of art, music, and progressive political thought at the time. The Summer of Love was a social phenomenon that took place in San Francisco during the summer of 1967, and it was characterized by the sharp increase in the number of young people who traveled to the city to experience this burgeoning countercultural movement. \\"San Francisco (Be Sure to Wear Flowers in Your Hair)\\" ultimately became a symbol and reflection of that time, capturing the spirit and essence of the movement. The song's lyrics encouraged people to come to San Francisco in search of peace, love, and a sense of unity that had come to define the city during the 1960s. As a result, it served as a rallying cry for the young, artistic, and politically impassioned individuals who sought to change the world during that iconic summer. The song was a huge success upon its release, reaching the top 10 in the United States, the United Kingdom, and several other countries around the world. Although it was McKenzie's only major hit, the song has continued to resonate and has been featured in various films, television programs, and advertisements that have sought to evoke the atmosphere of the 1960s counterculture over the ensuing decades. To sum up, \\"San Francisco (Be Sure to Wear Flowers in Your Hair)\\", the 1967 song sung by Scott McKenzie, was about the city of San Francisco in California. It became a symbol of the Summer of Love and played a significant role in the countercultural movement, making it an important artistic piece from that era."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Fred, the son of Scrooge's deceased sister Fan, has kindly invited his uncle to join them for Christmas dinner in the beginning of the story. However, Scrooge refuses the invitation with disdain, showing his disinterest and contempt for the festivity. Despite this, Fred holds no grudge against Scrooge and genuinely wishes him a Merry Christmas. In Charles Dickens' \\"A Christmas Carol,\\" when the Ghost of Christmas Present brings Scrooge to Fred's home, they witness a warm and festive scene where a group of family members and friends have gathered to share in the Christmas cheer. They are engaging in fun games, eating delicious food, and enjoying each other's company. There is laughter, joy, and lively banter, and even Scrooge's cold-heartedness becomes a subject of light-hearted mockery. During their time observing Fred's household, Scrooge begins to notice the infectious happiness of his nephew and the people around him. He begins to realize how isolating and joyless his life has been, rejecting the warmth, fellowship, and love that could have been a part of his life as well. This visit evokes a sense of regret in Scrooge for not accepting his nephew's invitation and serves as a pivotal moment in his transformation towards understanding the true meaning of Christmas. The visit to Fred's home becomes crucial for Scrooge as it teaches him the value of family and social connections, the importance of kindness and generosity, and the impact that these positive values can have on a person's life.

A single-select problem: Is the question answered in a satisfactory fashion? pick from the following. a). yes. b). no.","completion":"b). no. An example of a videophone call program is Skype, which is a widely popular and free communication software that allows users to make video and voice calls, send instant messages, and share files with other Skype users, as long as they have an internet connection. Skype was first released in 2003 by the founders of the popular file-sharing service Kazaa, and it quickly gained popularity for its ease of use, stable performance, and high-quality audio and video. Skype utilizes Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) technology to transmit calls, data, and multimedia content over the internet. This enables users to communicate with their contacts without the need for traditional telephone lines or cell phone service plans. Instead, users can simply connect their devices, such as computers, smartphones, tablets, or dedicated Skype-compatible hardware, to a stable internet connection. One key feature that differentiates Skype from other messaging and call services is the ability to conduct video calls, which allow people to see each other while they communicate. To do this, Skype users need compatible devices with built-in cameras and microphones. By combining high-quality audio and video in real-time, Skype allows users to experience a more personal way of communication than traditional telephone calls or text-based online messaging. Aside from one-on-one video calls, Skype also offers group video calls, which allows multiple people to join a video call simultaneously. This feature is particularly useful for remote meetings, online classrooms, or social gatherings with friends and family who are far away. In addition to voice and video calls, Skype also supports instant messaging and file sharing, which enhance the communication experience by allowing users to exchange information and documents quickly and easily. Moreover, Skype offers integrations with other software and platforms like Microsoft Office, allowing for seamless collaboration and increased productivity. Over the years, Skype has faced competition from other video call services like Google Hangouts, Apple's FaceTime, and Facebook Messenger. However, with its wide range of features, user-friendly interface, and a ubiquitous presence across different devices and operating systems, Skype continues to be a popular choice for personal and professional videophone call programs."},{"prompt":"The answer to the question: Who falls for the real estate agent? is inside the article: Jordan Sands is an awkward and nerdy 17-year-old girl with a bad case of allergies, who just became the woman of the house after the recent death of her mother.

Miskatonic University Answer:","completion":"Title: \\"The Whispering Halls\\" Genre: Horror, Mystery, Thriller Logline: Dr. Albert Wilmarth, a renowned professor at Miskatonic University, stumbles upon an ancient and dangerous secret while researching the university's cryptic past. With the help of his students, he must navigate a web of supernatural conspiracies, deceit, and terror to unveil the horrifying truth that threatens mankind's very existence. Plot: Act 1: Dr. Albert Wilmarth, a dedicated professor of folklore and ancient civilizations, teaches at the prestigious Miskatonic University in Arkham, Massachusetts. He is known for his passion for unraveling mysteries and has a close-knit group of senior students who work closely with him on his various research projects. Late one night, after giving a captivating lecture on the ancient origins of Miskatonic University, Dr. Wilmarth discovers a cryptic and forgotten manuscript in the university's vast underground library, a relic of its past. The manuscript contains mentions of secret societies, otherworldly entities, and rituals performed deep within the university's mysterious history. Fascinated by this revelation, Dr. Wilmarth enlists the help of his most trusted students: the curious and resourceful Jane; the skeptical and analytical Richard; and the perceptive and gifted artist, Olivia. Together, they embark on a mission to investigate the dark and foreboding passages of Miskatonic University’s history. Act 2: As their investigation deepens, the team slowly begins to uncover the truth behind the university's founding members, who were heavily involved with secretive and blasphemous rituals drawn from the Necronomicon, a fabled book said to contain the darkest knowledge of the universe. These men, the founders of the university, sought to harness the power of ancient gods in order to obtain limitless knowledge, but inevitably lost control, leaving behind a hidden legacy of horror that still lurks behind the veneer of academia. As they dig further, Dr. Wilmarth and his students start to experience unexplained occurrences - whispering voices in the night, ghostly apparitions, and haunting nightmares. The closer they get to the truth, the more ominous the events become, and they soon realize they are in grave danger. Act 3: Despite mixed feelings of fear and disbelief, Dr. Wilmarth and his students persist in their investigation. They discover a hidden passage leading from the heart of the university to a cavernous chamber below, where the founders once performed their eldritch rituals. Here they find a horrifying secret - the summoning of an ancient and malevolent god, which has been lying dormant for centuries. Realizing the danger they have awakened, Dr. Wilmarth and his team race against time to uncover a way to banish the entity once and for all. As the ancient god grows stronger, the team faces numerous obstacles - betrayal from within their ranks, opposition from the university's administration, and the temptation of the god's promise of boundless knowledge. In a thrilling climax, Dr. Wilmarth and his remaining students retrieve the stolen missing pages of the Necronomicon, decipher the banishment ritual, and confront the ancient god. In a final battle of wits and courage, they manage to successfully banish the entity back to its dark dimension, potentially preventing an apocalypse. Act 4: In the aftermath of their harrowing ordeal, Dr. Wilmarth and his students are left shaken but ultimately wiser. Though their experiences have forever changed them, they continue to carry the burden of the knowledge they obtained. Miskatonic University hails them as heroes who saved the world from unknown danger, but they remain forever haunted by the unspeakable things they encountered in the whispering halls. And as Albert Wilmarth continues his teaching, he now better understands the true meaning of knowledge and responsibility, warning future generations of the unseen terrors lingering beyond the boundaries of human perception. With themes of knowledge, power, and humanity's predisposition for secrecy and ambition, this film explores our fascination with the unknown and the consequences that come with delving into the darkest corners of our history and ourselves. \\"The Whispering Halls\\" is a chilling, gripping tale that will leave viewers on the edge of their seats, questioning their own desire to seek out the forbidden."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Is Unicode has the explicit aim of transcending the limitations of traditional character encodings, such as those defined by the ISO 8859 standard, which find wide usage in various countries of the world but remain largely incompatible with each other. a good answer to this question?","completion":"Multilingual computer processing refers to the ability of a computer system to process, analyze, and manipulate text, data, and communication in multiple languages. It involves the use of various techniques, algorithms, and tools to handle different character sets, language rules, and cultural nuances, thus enabling the exchange of information between people and systems across diverse language barriers. The given statement about Unicode as an answer to the question is partly correct as it addresses only one component of multilingual computer processing. To provide a more comprehensive answer, the focus should be on broader aspects of multilingual processing, which includes but is not limited to character encodings like Unicode. Multilingual computer processing comprises various levels of language processing, such as: 1. Character encoding: This is the first level of multilingual processing, which deals with representing characters from multiple languages in computer systems. Unicode is an essential milestone in this regard, as it aims to standardize character encoding and provide a unique code point for every character in use worldwide. By transcending the limitations of traditional character encoding schemes like the ISO 8859 standard, Unicode allows computer systems to handle text from diverse languages consistently and efficiently. 2. Text processing: At this level, multilingual computer processing involves handling different writing systems, word segmentation, normalization, text directionality, and other language-specific features. For example, certain languages don't have spaces between words, and some have right-to-left writing systems. Computer systems need to be able to identify and process these variations to support multilingual text processing. 3. Natural language processing (NLP): This is a higher level of multilingual processing, which deals with understanding, interpreting, and generating human language in a form that computers can understand. It involves tasks like language detection, translation, information extraction, sentiment analysis, and text generation. NLP algorithms need to be designed and trained to work effectively with multiple languages, considering their grammar, syntax, and semantics. 4. Localization and internationalization: Localization refers to the process of adapting a software application's user interface and content for different languages, cultures, and locales. Internationalization involves designing software applications to support multiple languages and cultural conventions without modifications. To achieve this, developers follow programming practices and standards that ensure easy adaptation for diverse languages and regions. In conclusion, Unicode is an essential aspect of multilingual computer processing as it facilitates the representation of characters and symbols from multiple languages. However, it is only one aspect of the broader field of multilingual computer processing, which encompasses text processing, natural language processing, localization, and internationalization. To provide a comprehensive answer to the question, it's crucial to widen the discussion to include these additional elements and demonstrate how they collectively contribute to effective multilingual processing in computer systems."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: In 1966,Allen and Beatrice Garden, two professors at the University of Nevada in Reno, had a bright idea.They were interested in the evolution of language and the language abilities of great apes . Previous attempts to teach chimpanzees to talk had ended in failure and the matter was considered by most people to be closed. But the Gardens realized that speech and the language are not the same thing. Many deaf people, for example, are unable to speak but are perfectly able to communicate by gestures that have all the features of spoken language. The Garders suspected that previous experiments had failed because chimpanzees are physically unable to speak. They therefore decided to try teaching a chimpanzee to sign in the way that deaf people do. And their chosen _ , a female chimpanzee named Washoe after the country in which the university is, proved to be a skillful pupil. Though there is still debate about whether what Washoe learned was really equal to human language, there is no doubt that she learned a lot of words. All of this, however, raises a second question. If Washoe can learn a complex vocabulary of gestures from people, do they have such vocabularies naturally ? To examine that possibility, Amy Pollick and Frans de Waal of Emory University have looked at gestures and expressions in chimpanzees, Signaling by facial and oral expressions is common among primates . Signaling by gestures is limited to great apes. The researchers supposed that the meaning of expressions has been fixed by evolution while the meaning of gestures is learnt. If that were true, particular sorts of facial and oral expressions would occur only in particular circumstances, and this would be the same across groups and even species. The same gestures, on the contrary, would be used in different circumstances. The researchers found exactly what they expected. Expressions almost always occurred in the same circumstances in different groups and different species. Gestures seemed to have completely different meanings.... Question: According to Pollick and Waal gestures are different from facial and oral expressions in that _ . - the meaning of facial and oral expressions can vary with circumstances. - particular gestures occur only in particular circumstances. - facial and oral gestures are not born but learnt. - gestures are limited to a certain type of primates.

He is in a healthy relationship with his girlfriend Grace Connelly (Jennifer Aniston), but also has a mild crush on his co-worker, Susan Ortega (Catherine Bell), who barely seems to notice him. Bruce, however, suffers from constant bad luck, and reaches breaking point when he is passed over for promotion by his rival, Evan Baxter (Steve Carell), who then steals dialogue from Bruce's segment while accepting the promotion on-air. Furious, Bruce aggressively and profanely criticizes the station during his first live report, and is promptly fired. Following a series of other misfortunes, Bruce takes out his frustration on God (Morgan Freeman), blaming Him and claiming that He is \\"the one who should be fired.\\" Bruce later receives a message on his pager directing him to an empty warehouse, where he meets God. God offers to give Bruce His powers, to prove that He is doing His job correctly. God gives Bruce two rules that he must follow: firstly, Bruce cannot tell anyone else that he has God's powers; and secondly, Bruce cannot use the powers to interfere with free will. Bruce ignores God and is initially jubilant with the powers, using them for personal gain such as potty-training his dog, exposing a woman by blowing up her dress, transforming his beat-up car into a Saleen S7, and sexually impressing Grace. Bruce also finds ways of using the powers to cause miraculous events to occur at otherwise mundane events that he covers, such as discovering Jimmy Hoffa's body or causing a meteor to harmlessly land near a cook-off, earning him his job back. Bruce then uses his powers to cause Evan to humiliate himself on-air, causing Evan to be fired in favor of Bruce as the new anchor.

But he found the design of older car more attractive. Which car would contribute to less cleaner atmosphere, car A or car B? Hint: Catalytic converters in cars increase the rates of several important reactions. Unburned hydrocarbons can more easily be converted to carbon dioxide and water in the presence of a catalyst. Additionally, carbon monoxide (a harmful gas produced by incomplete combustion of fuel) is further oxidized to carbon dioxide, and nitrous oxide compounds (which contribute to smog and acid rain) are transformed back into nitrogen and oxygen gases. By passing car exhaust over these catalysts before their release into the air, the emissions from a combustion engine are made into much less harmful substances, resulting in a much cleaner atmosphere.","completion":"Based on the information provided, car B (the older car without a catalytic converter) would contribute to a less clean atmosphere. This is because car A has a catalytic converter installed, which helps to reduce the harmful emissions produced by the exhaust system. Catalytic converters facilitate the conversion of unburned hydrocarbons to carbon dioxide and water, oxidize carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide, and transform nitrous oxide compounds back into nitrogen and oxygen gases. These reactions make the emissions from car A's engine less harmful to the atmosphere. On the other hand, car B lacks a catalytic converter, so its exhaust gases do not undergo these cleaning processes. As a result, it releases a higher amount of harmful substances, such as carbon monoxide and nitrous oxide compounds, which contribute to air pollution, smog, and acid rain.

Answer the following question: Question: \\"Where is it?\\" Context: \\"The archipelago is formed by high points on the rim of the caldera of a submarine volcano that forms a seamount. The volcano is one part of a range that was formed as part of the same process that formed the floor of the Atlantic, and the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. The top of the seamount has gone through periods of complete submergence, during which its limestone cap was formed by marine organisms, and during the Ice Ages the entire caldera was above sea level, forming an island of approximately two hundred square miles.\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"Based on the context provided, it is clear that the archipelago in question is associated with a seamount, the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, and the formation of the floor of the Atlantic Ocean. Although the exact location of this particular archipelago is not specifically mentioned in the context, the information provided allows us to infer that it must be somewhere in the Atlantic Ocean, along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. The Mid-Atlantic Ridge is a massive underwater mountain range running down the center of the Atlantic Ocean, stretching over a distance of 10,000 miles, from the Arctic Ocean to the Southern Atlantic Ocean, near Antarctica. It is formed by tectonic plates separating and creating new ocean floor as molten rock rises from the Earth's mantle. This process results in the formation of submarine volcanoes and seamounts, contributing to the development of various seamounts and archipelagos along the ridge. The description of this archipelago being formed by the high points on the rim of a caldera of a submarine volcano, which is part of the same process that formed the floor of the Atlantic and the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, situates it most likely within the Atlantic Ocean, although the precise location cannot be determined without further information. Furthermore, it is mentioned that during the Ice Ages, the entire caldera was above sea level, forming an island of approximately 200 square miles. This suggests that the archipelago could have been substantially larger and more prominent in the past than it is now. This gives us another clue that this archipelago is located in the Atlantic Ocean since the sea level changes during the Ice Ages affected various landmasses and islands across the globe. In conclusion, while the exact location of the archipelago cannot be pinpointed without additional context, it can be inferred that it is situated somewhere within the Atlantic Ocean, along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, and it has experienced significant geological changes over time due to tectonic activity and fluctuations in global sea levels."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The portrait, which was acquired by an anonymous buyer, highlights the continuous global demand for Bacon's work and cements him further as one of the most important artists of the 20th century. Moreover, this exceptional sale shines a new light on George Dyer, who played a major role in Bacon's personal life and creative output. This article delves into the background of this phenomenal portrait sale, Francis Bacon's relationship with George Dyer, and its significance in the art world. Background of the Portrait Sale The iconic portrait of George Dyer was part of a larger auction by a prestigious international auction house. Estimated to fetch a price around £28 million, the artwork piqued the interest of art collectors worldwide, given Bacon's reputation and the strong emotions portrayed in the painting. As the bidding war escalated, the portrait ultimately sold for a staggering £42.2 million, marking a historic moment in the world of art sales. Francis Bacon and George Dyer's Relationship The story of Francis Bacon and George Dyer began in a serendipitous encounter back in 1963 when Dyer, a small-time criminal, broke into the painter's London studio. Rather than turning Dyer into the authorities, Bacon offered him a substantial sum of money to return later that evening. This initial meeting led to a turbulent six-year love affair, which was both passionate and volatile. Their relationship was marked by tumultuous exchanges, periodic breakups and reunions, emotional turmoil, and even violence. Consequently, George Dyer became one of the principal subjects of Francis Bacon's work, featuring in over 40 of his paintings. The impact of their relationship is evident in several of Bacon's most celebrated triptychs which showcase the trajectory of their relationship, from courtship to discord. Bacon's Artistic Vision and Painting Style Known for his distinctive and dark style, Francis Bacon captured the complexity of human emotions and showcased them through his powerful figurative paintings. His daring and innovative approach to the depiction of the human body and psyche marked him as one of the most important British artists in the post-World War II era. The portrait of George Dyer only serves to reaffirm the boldness and strength of the artist's vision. The portrait possesses a haunting beauty as it conveys the torment and vulnerability of Dyer, a man who faced the consequences of his troubled past and struggled with substance abuse. The image encapsulates Bacon's signature style—raw in emotion and unsettling in its display of intimacy. The unique blend of vulnerability and power within the portrait adds to its value, both monetarily and artistically. Significance and Impact on the Art World The outstanding sale of George Dyer's portrait serves as a testament to the enduring legacy and influence of Francis Bacon in the art world. As the demand for his works continues to grow, the sale not only highlights the investment value of his artwork but also underscores the significance of his creative contributions to modern art. Furthermore, the story behind the portrait of George Dyer provides insight into Francis Bacon's personal life and creative process, offering a unique window into the tumultuous relationship that profoundly impacted his art. In conclusion, the historic sale of Francis Bacon's portrait of George Dyer has broken new ground in the art world. As the anonymous collector now revels in owning this piece of art history, the tremendous enthusiasm for Bacon's work remains unstoppable. The poignant portrait of Dyer not only serves as an emblem of the artist's unrivaled skill and vision but also offers an intimate look at the complexity and vulnerability of the human condition—a reason why his art continues to captivate art enthusiasts globally."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the missing first step of the following process: - As the plates move, they exert a great force - When the force is large enough, the crust breaks - The stress is released as energy - The energy moves through the Earth in the form of waves - We feel the earthquake - Answer:","completion":"The missing first step in the process of the formation and occurrence of an earthquake is the gradual accumulation of stress and strain along the boundaries of tectonic plates. To provide a more detailed and comprehensive explanation, let's consider the following steps: 1. Gradual accumulation of stress and strain: The Earth's lithosphere is broken into enormous slabs known as tectonic plates. These plates are constantly moving, gradually shifting against one another due to the convection currents in the Earth's mantle. The boundaries between these plates are areas of intense geological activity, where stress and strain build up over time due to their relative motion. 2. As the plates move, they exert a great force: The constant movement of tectonic plates creates significant forces that push, pull, and grind against one another along the plate boundaries. This force can lead to the deformation of the Earth's crust and the formation of various geological features such as mountains, volcanoes, and rift valleys, as the crust is slowly compressed, stretched, or sheared. 3. When the force is large enough, the crust breaks: Eventually, the stress accumulated along the plate boundaries exceeds the strength of the rocks forming the Earth's crust. This causes the crust to fracture or slip along pre-existing faults, which are zones of weakness in the Earth's crust created by previous geological activity. 4. The stress is released as energy: When the crust breaks, it releases the accumulated stress and strain in the form of seismic energy. This energy is then converted into seismic waves, which are generated at the focus of the earthquake, which is the point within the Earth where the initial breaking or slipping occurs. 5. The energy moves through the Earth in the form of waves: Seismic waves travel through the Earth's interior and along its surface in the form of two main wave types: body waves (P and S waves) and surface waves (Love and Rayleigh waves). The body waves can travel through the Earth's interior, while surface waves are restricted to the Earth's surface, causing the ground to shake. 6. We feel the earthquake: As the seismic waves travel through the Earth and reach the surface, the ground shakes, causing the motion we perceive as an earthquake. The intensity of the shaking and the potential damage caused by an earthquake depend on factors such as the magnitude of the seismic event, the depth of the focus, the distance from the epicenter (the point on the Earth's surface directly above the focus), local geological conditions, and the built environment."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Told by Max, he explains that anyone that says his name will awaken him and have him get that person. Richie, a cocky teenager, awakens Marz by shouting his name and throws a rock into his old home. Annoyed, Max then ends the campfire session and sends everyone to their cabins while he goes into town to stock up on supplies. Richie stays behind when he sees Madman Marz hidding in a tree and sneakily follows him back to his house. While everyone is inside their cabins, Chef Dippy is then killed by Marz outside. After the kids have gone to sleep, the rest of the counselors go to the rec room to relax; T.P. and Betsy kiss in a hot tub, unbeknownst that Marz is watching them from outside. Meanwhile, Dave finds out that Richie didn't follow them back, and informs the counselors about this. T.P. searches out into the woods for Richie, and is hung by Marz with a noose up on a tree; he is killed when Marz pulls down his legs and the noose snaps his neck. Marz later returns to the camp and grabs the axe out of the log. While Richie tries looking for a way back to camp, Dave ventures out into the woods due to Betsy worrying about T.P.'s disapperance, and is decapitated by Marz. Stacy tells Betsy to watch the kids in the meantime, and gets Ellie and Bill back to the camp due to the disappearances. Stacey drives out into the woods and, panicking from discovering Dave's headless body, tries to escape in her car in which stalls. She opens the car's hood, and Marz stands on top of the car just before he jumps down onto the hood, decapitating Stacy.

Please answer the following question: Jan prolonged their time with Lee because they really liked spending time with them. Given the context: How would you describe Jan? Possible answers: they needed more time, As someone who's sneaky, As someone who talks about Lees company A:","completion":"In this context, Jan can be described as someone who truly values and appreciates Lee's company. Jan's decision to prolong their time with Lee indicates that they genuinely enjoy spending time with Lee and connect with them on a personal level. This demonstrates that Jan may be a warm, caring, and attentive person who cherishes meaningful bonds and seeks to nurture them. The fact that Jan actively extends their time together also suggests that they are proactive in pursuing and nurturing friendships, highlighting their strong interpersonal skills and emotional intelligence. However, it is essential to acknowledge that one's perception of Jan may vary, considering the limited information available. From another perspective, someone might perceive Jan as someone who needed more time with Lee to accomplish a specific goal or deepen their connection, rather than solely being sneaky or manipulative. In this case, the emphasis would be placed on Jan's determination and assertiveness, which are praiseworthy qualities. Alternatively, one could describe Jan as someone who talks about Lee's company in a positive light, indicating their satisfaction and admiration for the time spent together. This aspect highlights Jan's ability to recognize and appreciate the valuable experiences they share with others, which can be an essential quality for building long-lasting and fulfilling relationships. In short, while multiple interpretations could be drawn from the context provided, Jan appears to be someone who values Lee's company and actively seeks to spend more time with them, emphasizing their positive character traits such as warmth, attentiveness, and emotional intelligence.

Write a title for this article: Champion sailors have been known to learn their craft on Lake Travis, just outside Austin. The hills and topography surrounding the body of water whip up challenging winds, making it a sublime place for budding athletes to refine their tacking and jibbing skills ahead of a lifetime of competition. SailPoint, a digital-identity-management firm with headquarters two miles from the lake, is preparing for a race of its own. Like many companies, SailPoint has contemplated an initial public offering. But global economic headwinds have given the company pause. “The markets are certainly uncertain,” says Mark McClain, CEO and founder of the firm, which has more than 100 million in annual revenue. At presstime, just two U.S. tech companies had gone public this year: SecureWorks scwx , a cybersecurity unit spun off from Dell, and Acacia Communications acia , a fiber-optics purveyor. Dell shoved SecureWorks out the door in April on its way to a 67 billion mega-merger with EMC emc , only to watch the fledgling company’s share price sag. Acacia made a far stronger debut in May. In June the Bain Capital–backed Blue Coat filed for a public offering before reversing course and selling out to Symantec symc , the lumbering antivirus software firm, for 4.6 billion. Line, Twilio, and AppDynamics appear most likely to go public next. The biggest IPO drought in years has put a damper on an otherwise vibrant cybersecurity sector. Not long ago investors plowed funds into the firms at lofty valuations. Now there is a backlog of companies waiting for an exit, among them Veracode, Carbon Black, ForeScout, Okta, Zscaler, and Optiv. For more on tech IPOs, watch this Fortune video: “Financially, SecureWorks is making us all sit back and reevaluate,” says Mike DeCesare, CEO of ForeScout, a network security company with 125 million in annual revenue and a billion-dollar valuation. “The question is, Why would you go public right now? If you don’t need the money, what is it about the current environment that you find attractive?” The clock is ticking. In the business of digital defense, the race to stay ahead of hackers’ attacks means that innovative strategies steadily depreciate. “One of the risks of delaying an IPO is that you could miss your window,” cautions David Cowan, an investor at Bessemer Venture Partners. “You don’t want to be an old private cybersecurity company.” Furthermore, many cybersecurity firms aren’t well suited for public markets, says Asheem Chandna, an investor at Greylock Partners. “We’ll see over the coming couple of years a steady clip of M&A,” he says. SailPoint’s McClain continues to hold his breath. “To use a silly sailing analogy,” he says, “why would you launch your boat in this storm?” A version of this article appears in the July 1, 2016 issue of Fortune with the headline “Fish or Cut Bait.”","completion":"Navigating Uncertain Waters: How Cybersecurity Firms Wrestle with the IPO Drought"},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Problem:CONTEXT: Estilo e influencia en bandas posteriores Led Zeppelin ha sido una de las más influyentes formaciones dentro del desarrollo del hard rock, sentando a su vez las bases de lo que después sería conocido como heavy metal junto con grupos como Black Sabbath o Deep Purple durante la década de 1970. Esto último vino dado con la publicación del disco debut de la banda, Led Zeppelin I, en 1969, el cual incluía un sonido mucho más duro y contundente que el de muchas bandas de la época sin abandonar el sonido orientado hacia el blues presente en el anterior grupo de Jimmy Page, The Yardbirds, en el que se explotaba más dicha tendencia. Durante toda su discografía también se puede observar trazos de música psicodélica heredada de músicos como Jimi Hendrix. El sonido presente en el siguiente trabajo de la formación, Led Zeppelin II, continúa con el sonido de su antecesor mezclando blues, hard rock y psicodelia a partes iguales. El primer cambio de rumbo dentro de la discografía de la banda se da en Led Zeppelin III, en el que el estilo más acústico y folk predomina a lo largo de gran parte de las canciones incluidas en el trabajo, aunque sin abandonar el hard rock presente en los dos anteriores discos del grupo. Sin embargo, el trabajo más importante en la carrera del grupo es para muchos el cuarto álbum, el cual no tiene nombre, pero es conocido como Led Zeppelin IV. Dicha observación viene respaldada por el número de ventas del disco, hasta la fecha el más exitoso de Led Zeppelin en este campo, gracias en gran medida a la inclusión de Stairway to Heaven, la canción más famosa de la banda. El álbum está considerado como pieza clave en la posterior evolución del rock. Después de la publicación del cuarto trabajo del grupo, estos editan Houses of the Holy, en el que se fusiona el hard rock y el blues con elementos tomados del reggae o del funk. De vuelta de nuevo a sus raíces, la banda publica Physical Graffiti bajo la constante estilística de los trabajos de debut, así como Presence y In Through the Out Door.

Write an article based on this summary: – Just three months after welcoming a child together, Janet Jackson and husband Wissam Al Mana are splitting up, according to multiple sources including People and Page Six. The singer and the billionaire Qatari businessman wed in 2012, and TMZ notes that the separation appears to have come exactly at the five-year mark of the marriage—which could have financial implications if the pair had a prenup. Al Mana, 41, is worth significantly more than Jackson, 50, and prenups typically allot more money to the spouse the longer the marriage goes on; they usually include 5- and 10-year marks at which more money is doled out. Their new son, Eissa, could also have prenup implications, TMZ notes. Why the split? Page Six's sources are conflicted, with one claiming the split is amicable and the other saying Jackson thought Al Mana \\"had become too controlling during the pregnancy and she had already allowed him to dictate her appearance and even the way she performed at concerts.\\" She also moved to London at his request—and her mother, Katherine Jackson, recently spent two months there with the family, which the source says is a factor in the split. Janet is worried about her mom, who alleges elder abuse at the hands of her nephew Trent, and the source says she's frustrated that her husband doesn't seem to share her concerns. The split news was reported soon after Katherine Jackson returned to LA. But TMZ says she may not actually have gone to London in the first place to get away from Trent, but rather because of the looming separation.","completion":"Once upon a time, a lady named Janet Jackson and a man named Wissam Al Mana got married in 2012. They were very happy and had a baby named Eissa just three months ago. But now, Janet and Wissam have decided to split up, which means they won't be living together as husband and wife anymore. This news has been talked about by many people, like those from the websites People and Page Six. Since Wissam has a lot of money, more than Janet, they might have made an agreement before getting married called a \\"prenup.\\" A prenup usually says that one person will give the other more money if they are married for a certain amount of time, like 5 or 10 years. The reason why Janet and Wissam are splitting up is still not very clear. Some people say it's a friendly decision, which means they are still friends. Others say that Wissam was too controlling during Janet's pregnancy, telling her how to dress and perform on stage. Janet even moved to London because Wissam wanted her to. Another important thing is that Janet's mom, Katherine, was staying with them in London for two months. She is also having a problem with her nephew, Trent, who she says is mean to her. Janet is worried about her mom and feels her husband doesn't care enough. So, it looks like Janet Jackson and Wissam Al Mana aren't going to be together anymore. Sometimes, grown-ups have problems and decide it's better for them to be apart.

The ship risked being overcome by the wave, as the Available options: A). ship was so tiny in comparison.; B). wave was so tiny in comparison.; Answer:","completion":"The ship risked being overcome by the wave, as the ship was so tiny in comparison. As the massive wall of water towered above the vessel, it became apparent that the combination of size, force, and angle of the incoming tidal wave made it a significant threat to the survival and integrity of the small nautical structure. As the ocean churned, the waves grew taller and more imposing, casting ominous shadows on the surrounding waters. The crew aboard the ship worked frantically to secure all hatches, equipment, and sails, understanding the urgent nature of the situation. The ship's captain, a weathered and seasoned sailor, began barking out orders, ensuring that each task was carried out with precision and haste. Despite the size difference between his ship and the waves, he was determined to see them through this perilous event. Understanding the physics of waves and boat stability, the captain knew that smaller ships generally have a higher likelihood of being capsized, inundated, or crushed in the grip of such colossal waves. As the wave approached the tiny ship, it became essential to adopt a course of action that would maximize the chances of making it through the wall of water without succumbing to its overwhelming power. As the distance between the ship and the wave closed in, the captain turned the ship into the wind, ensuring that it was properly aligned to take on the wave head-on. This maneuver, called \\"pointing into the wind,\\" allowed the ship to strategically use its bow to slice through the wave's surface and minimize the amount of surface area exposed to the wave's force. All crew members braced themselves as the ship lunged forward into the towering mass. With a deafening roar, the wave crashed onto the deck of the ship, sending torrents of water gushing across the vessel. Though the ship shuddered and threatened to break under the immense pressure, it persevered, taking the brunt of the wave's impact on the fortified bow. As they emerged on the other side of the wave, the shaken but intact crew let out a sigh of relief. Despite the ship's minuscule size in comparison to the colossal wave, its crew's knowledge, skill, and determination had seen them through the terrifying ordeal. The waves subsided, and the ocean's temperament eased as the storm weakened. As the ship sailed past the remnants of the behemoth waves, each member of the crew was filled with gratitude and respect for the power of Mother Nature and the tenacity of the human spirit. In that moment, they were a living testament to the ability for even the smallest vessel to overcome the mightiest challenges when backed by the knowledge, skill, and determination of its crew."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Read this and answer the question Egypt has a developed energy market based on coal, oil, natural gas, and hydro power. Substantial coal deposits in the northeast Sinai are mined at the rate of about 600,000 tonnes (590,000 long tons; 660,000 short tons) per year. Oil and gas are produced in the western desert regions, the Gulf of Suez, and the Nile Delta. Egypt has huge reserves of gas, estimated at 2,180 cubic kilometres (520 cu mi), and LNG up to 2012 exported to many countries. In 2013, the Egyptian General Petroleum Co (EGPC) said the country will cut exports of natural gas and tell major industries to slow output this summer to avoid an energy crisis and stave off political unrest, Reuters has reported. Egypt is counting on top liquid natural gas (LNG) exporter Qatar to obtain additional gas volumes in summer, while encouraging factories to plan their annual maintenance for those months of peak demand, said EGPC chairman, Tarek El Barkatawy.

Cut exports of natural gas: This move was intended to ensure that more natural gas would be available for domestic consumption, helping to meet the increasing energy demands of the country. 2. Encouraged major industries to slow output during summer: This step aimed at reducing energy consumption during peak demand months. By slowing output, industries would require less energy, thus easing the pressure on the energy supply. 3. Counting on Qatar for additional gas volumes: Egypt sought assistance from the top liquid natural gas (LNG) exporter, Qatar, to obtain additional gas supplies during the summer months.

Please answer the following question: SEOUL — North Korea shut down its Punggye-ri nuclear test site on Thursday to demonstrate its commitment to denuclearization in advance of the planned U.S.-North Korea summit. The development came hours before President Donald Trump called off the highly anticipated meeting. The South Korean government welcomed the North's unilateral nuclear concession to help facilitate a broader agreement with the United States to completely end its nuclear weapons program in exchange for ending punishing sanctions and security guarantees. \\"We are hoping that this action will become the opportunity for complete denuclearization in the future,\\" South Korea Foreign Ministry spokesman Noh Kyu-duk said. However, while the closure of the nuclear test complex is a significant symbolic gesture, analysts are skeptical it will seriously inhibit the Kim Jong Un government's ability to carry out further nuclear tests in the future. \\"That renders the test site unusable, but not forever and it's not like North Korea has a shortage of mountains or people to make new tunnels,\\" said Jeffrey Lewis, the director of the East Asia Nonproliferation Program at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies in California, during an interview with Vice News. North Korea conducted all six of its nuclear tests at the Punggye-ri underground site that includes at least two extensive tunnel systems, according the 38 North website that monitors the North's nuclear activities. Each nuclear test conducted at the site was progressively more powerful, with the first bomb detonated in 2006 producing an estimated 1-2 kiloton yield, much less powerful than the 16-kiloton bomb the United States used on Hiroshima during World War II, and the last test in 2017 producing close to a 250-kiloton yield.

Q: A ploynomial equation is a sum of terms. Here each term is either a constant number, or consists of the variable x raised to a certain power and multiplied by a number. These numbers are called weights. For example, in the polynomial: 2x^2+3x+4, the weights are: 2,3,4. You can present a polynomial with the list of its weights, for example, equation weights = [6, 4] represent the equation 6x + 4 and equation weights = [1, 3, 4] represent the equation 1x^2 + 3x + 4. In this task, you need to compute the result of a polynomial expression by substituing a given value of x in the given polynomial equation. Equation weights are given as a list. x = 0, equation weights = [9, 5, 0, 7, 1] A:","completion":"To compute the result of the polynomial expression, we can use the definition of a polynomial and substitute the given value of x into the equation.

Decent fight scenes or not, the acting is REALLY bad, like you can tell they're reading their lines from a card. With painful line delivery by everyone in the cast. Think watching a high school play and cringing at the obvious lack of smoothness in the actor's interactions (weird pauses between different character's lines, combined with hurried line delivery by others). If the movie were all action, this might be forgivable, but a lot of the movie includes plot set-up and Family Guy style, irreverent cut aways (Oh, wow, are they badly done). I'm assuming they were attempting to be funny with these, but it again came off as a bunch of high-schoolers/ college entry students goofing off for the afternoon trying to set up a funny Youtube clip. Now to the fight scenes. They're not too bad, considering the level of quality seen everywhere else in the film. Nothing great either, certainly not anywhere near the same level as other posters have stated (Nothing like Drunken Master).

They go to the corner, introduce themselves and chat. She says she is learning to be an actress.Next scene we jump immediately to the end of a play, as the curtain is about to come down. We see April on stage upset, and Frank in the audience with a huge frown on his face. Some people clap and cheer and some are really disappointed with the play, walking by Frank as they go on about how terrible it was. Mrs. Helen Givings (Kathy Bates) walks by and compliments Frank that his wife was terrific in the play. Frank smiles and walks away.Frank goes backstage looking for April. On the way he sees Milly Campbell (Kathryn Hahn), who was also in the play. She tells Frank that she and her husband Shep (David Harbour) are ready for a drink. Frank agrees and goes to the private dressing room where he finds a devastated April changing. She asks Frank to tell Milly and Shep they cannot go out for a drink, using their nanny as an excuse. Frank and April argue a bit but Frank obliges. We then see a far shot of Frank and April leaving in the hallway of a high school with obvious distance between the two of them, not saying a word, even when they are in the car.While driving, Frank turns and tells April that it wasn't her fault that the play was bad, it was because it was unprofessional with lousy scripts and amateur actors and actresses around her. Not only does April not appreciate his comments, she asks Frank not to talk about it. They argue some more and Frank pulls the car over. Frank tells April that it's not his fault the play sucked -he is being very supportive and he is not going to put up with anymore of the bullshit she is giving him. April gets out of the car and Frank follows angrily. They scream at each other about how Frank is always trying to talk things out while all she wants to do is have peace and quiet to deal with it herself.

A:","completion":"Frank starts screaming at April because he believes he has been nothing but supportive of her and doesn't deserve the treatment he's receiving from her. Upon receiving negative feedback about the play, April emotes her disappointment and frustration by withdrawing and lashing out at Frank. He tries to console her by reassuring her it wasn't her fault but the fault of the unprofessional production, but April does not appreciate this and asks him not to discuss it. This dismissal of his support results in Frank's frustration building up, which eventually leads to him pulling the car over and vehemently defending himself, insisting that he's been supportive and does not deserve the hostile treatment she's giving him.

Briarcliff Manor is home to seven Christian churches and two synagogues; three churches (Holy Innocents Anglican Church, Saint Mary's Church and Scarborough Presbyterian Church) are in Scarborough. Other churches in the village are All Saints' Episcopal Church, St. Theresa's Catholic Church, Faith Lutheran Brethren Church, and Briarcliff Congregational Church (United Church of Christ). Jewish synagogues Congregation Sons of Israel and Chabad Lubavitch of Briarcliff Manor & Ossining are in Chilmark.Saint Mary's Episcopal Church, founded in 1839 by William Creighton as Saint Mary's Church, Beechwood, is Briarcliff Manor's oldest church; it was reincorporated in 1945 as Saint Mary's Church of Scarborough. The granite church was built by local stonemasons and paid for by Creighton's wealthy neighbors, including Commodore Matthew Perry, James Watson Webb, William Aspinwall, and Ambrose Kingsland.

Exit 13 was originally slated for a fall 2006 release, however, after a 2-year delay, it was released September 9, 2008 without 50 Cent as the executive producer. Tracks that the two worked on were leaked to the internet and some of the tracks produced with 50 made it to Exit 13. LL Cool J partnered with DJ Kay Slay to release a mixtape called \\"The Return of the G.O.A.T.\\". It was the first mixtape of his 24-year career and includes freestyling by LL Cool J in addition to other rappers giving their renditions of his songs. A track entitled \\"Hi Haterz\\" was leaked onto the internet on June 1, 2008. The song contains LL Cool J rapping over the instrumental to Maino's \\"Hi Hater\\". He toured with Janet Jackson on her Rock Witchu tour, only playing in Los Angeles, Chicago, Toronto, and Kansas City. In September 2009, LL Cool J released a song about the NCIS TV series. It is a single and is available on iTunes. The new track is based on his experiences playing special agent Sam Hanna. \\"This song is the musical interpretation of what I felt after meeting with NCIS agents, experienced Marines and Navy SEALs,\\" LL Cool J said. \\"It represents the collective energy in the room. I was so inspired I wrote the song on set.\\" In March 2011 at South by Southwest, LL Cool J was revealed to be Z-Trip's special guest at the Red Bull Thre3Style showcase. This marked the beginning of a creative collaboration between the rap and DJ superstars. The two took part in an interview with Carson Daly where they discussed their partnership. Both artists have promised future collaborations down the road, with LL Cool J calling the duo \\"organic\\" One early track to feature LL's talents was Z-Trip's remix of British rock act Kasabian's single \\"Days Are Forgotten\\", which was named by influential DJ Zane Lowe as his \\"Hottest Record In The World\\" and received a favorable reception in both Belgium and the United Kingdom. In January 2012, the pair released the track \\"Super Baller\\" as a free download to celebrate the New York Giants Super Bowl victory. The two have been touring together since 2011, with future dates planned through 2012 and beyond.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. A boy racer who killed his 19-year-old girlfriend while driving at 'ludicrous' speeds was jailed for six years today. Reckless Paul Reddan, 21, was racing another car when he lost control of his silver Vauxhall Corsa SRi at 70mph in a 50mph zone, hit a war memorial and crashed into a wall. The car burst into flames and Leanne Davies, a trainee hairdresser who was in the front passenger seat, died at the scene from severe head injuries. Leanne Davies, a trainee hairdresser, had sneaked away from her parents on the night of the fatal tragedy because they disapproved of her on-and-off relationship with her boyfriend Paul Reddan, an engineer. A number of witnesses said Paul Reddan had been driving on the wrong side of the road while he had been allegedly racing with Matthew Creed on a stretch of road for at least two miles before the fatal crash. Reddan, an engineer, was found guilty of death by dangerous driving and jailed for six years and banned from driving for five years at Gloucester Crown Court today. Sentencing, Judge Jamie Tabor said: 'Leanne was by all accounts a lovely young girl. 'She had the world before her – then her life was taken away by this absolutely ludicrous driving.' He told Reddan, who turned 21 today: 'I have no doubt at all that you were racing that night. From the moment you got in the car you were driving too fast. 'You were racing in such a way that one witness thought someone would get killed. 'You had been racing for a very long part of your journey in a very dangerous manner. You lost control of your vehicle and you killed Leanne – that is the long and short of it.' The crumpled Vauxhall Corsa which Reddan had bought just three months before the crash in Gloucester. The court heard how Leanne, of Lydbrook, Glos., secretly met up with Reddan on the night of May 31 last year because her parents did not approve of their on-off relationship. She told them she was going to meet her grandmother, but actually went for food at McDonald's with Reddan before getting into his car at around 9pm. But while travelling along the A4136 near Longhope, Glos., he lost control on a bend, hit a war memorial and crashed into a wall. Matthew Creed, 19, was cleared of causing death by dangerous driving in the six-day trial which ended today. It was alleged he was racing Matthew Creed, 19, who was also charged with causing death by dangerous driving but was cleared after a six-day trial. A number of witnesses described how Reddan's Corsa had been very close to Mr Creed's Renault Clio and at one point it was even being driven on the wrong side of the road. The prosecution alleged that the two men had been racing each other for at least two miles before the fatal crash which left Reddan hospitalised for three weeks. One witness, Andrew Barnes, who saw the two cars flash past less than a car length apart, only a few hundred metres before the collision, said 'someone is going to die', the court heard. Leanne's parents, Paul and Heather, said their whole family had been affected by the loss of the hairdresser. An examination of Reddan's car following the incident showed the speedometer stuck at 60mph, the back tyres under-inflated and a defect in the brake pipe. It was concluded that the car's faults, in combination with the 'manner of driving', could have caused the vehicle to become unstable. In a victim impact statement read in court, Leanne's father Paul Davies said: 'The hardest thing to come to terms with is to think about all the things we can no longer do as a family. 'We recently attended a family wedding and I could not stop thinking about the fact I will never get to walk my only daughter down the aisle. Father Paul Davies said in a victim impact statement read in court today that the 'the hardest thing to come to terms with is to think about all the things we can no longer do as a family' and that he was 'angry' over the loss. 'Whatever the outcome of this case and whatever the sentence, Paul will always have his life and future, but Leanne will never have that.' Mr Davies said the loss of his daughter had affected 'every single aspect of my life' and he was angry he would never be able to walk her down the aisle for her wedding one day. His two sons Luke and Mitch had been badly affected, too and the whole family had received counselling and support, he said. 'The biggest surprise after this incident is that there has been absolutely no remorse shown by Paul Reddan whatsoever. 'We received one letter from him but he didn't even say he was sorry. He did say 'I am sorry you lost Leanne' but there was no hint of sorrow or regret about what had happened. Leanne Davies' parents Paul and Heather (pictured left) with the family liaison officer PC Steve Martin and one of Leanne's brothers Luke Davies, outside Gloucester Crown Court following the sentencing of Paul Reddan. 'It appears to have had no effect on him whatsoever.' Heather Davies, Leanne's mother, said: 'At just 19 she had her whole life ahead of her. Her dreams and ambitions will now be unfulfilled because of the events of that night.' She said Leanne had an argument with her dad that night about a forthcoming family holiday and whether Reddan would be joining them because of the on-off nature of their relationship at that time. Mr Davies had regretted the row ever since because it had been the last time he saw his daughter. The couple were asleep on the sofa in front of the TV at midnight when police arrived to tell them Leanne had been killed, said Mrs Davies. 'I will never be able to forgive Paul Reddan for what happened that night,' she said. The crumpled Corsa after the fatal crash which claimed the life of trainee hairdresser Leanne Davies, 19. 'My only hope is that one day life will become easier and I can remember Leanne for who she was: my beautiful loving daughter.' Jason Coulter, acting for Reddan, said he had led an honest and industrious life and had no previous convictions - and was never likely to offend again. He accepted, however, that not long before the tragedy Reddan had been driving at 120mph, when a passenger took a picture of his speedometer. Mr Coulter said that although Reddan had not appeared remorseful in public his mother had seen him in tears at home and he 'very much mourns the passing of Leanne.' The solicitor also handed the judge a letter written by Reddan expressing his sorrow. Reddan had worked for his employers for two and a half years, had completed an engineering apprenticeship, and was earning £25,000 as a buyer of equipment for industrial pipework, he added. The court heard that the back tyres of Reddan's Corsa were under-inflated and there was a defect in the brake pipe and, in combination with the 'manner of driving', could have caused the vehicle to become unstable. Reddan, of Broadwell, Glos., had passed his test in January 2012 and had got the 1.8 litre car less than three months before the smash, the court heard. Passing sentence Judge Tabor told Reddan he had not seen any remorse from him and he had 'cut an arrogant figure in the witness box' showing a lack of sensitivity to Leanne's parents. The judge said he was satisfied Reddan had been 'racing for a very prolonged period in a very dangerous manner.' Reddan was told he will have to take an extended test before driving again and he will have to pay a £120 surcharge in addition to the jail term and ban. Leanne's family released a statement after today's sentencing in which they said 'We, the family of Leanne Davies, welcome the verdict handed down by the court today. 'We wish to thank the court, Mr Tully and his team at the CPS, and the police for their meticulous investigation into the truth of what happened that tragic evening. 'Our lives have been on hold since that night, whilst Mr Reddan has been able to carry on with his, showing no remorse whatsoever for his actions. 'We hope that with this trial now over we can start to move on with our lives and focus on our many fond memories of Leanne. 'And finally we would like to thank all of our friends and family for their continued support.' The officer in charge of the case, PC Tim Griffiths, said: 'It is nearly 18 months since the collision and during that time the family of Leanne Davies have been supported by one of the Constabulary's Family Liaison Officers. 'Leanne's family have remained dignified throughout the investigation and court process. 'It has been a long, painstaking investigation which has been reliant on the local community from Longhope and across the Forest of Dean who have supported our investigation. 'During this period my thoughts have remained with the family whilst focused on establishing one thing, what happened to Leanne. 'I remember one thing, a promise that I made to them: on behalf of the investigation team, that we would do our utmost to find out what happened to their daughter. 'This investigation and trial I hope has done just that, and though they will never ever get over the loss of their much loved and well-liked daughter, I hope that in some small way it helps them to move forward in their lives and to put this terrible tragedy behind them. 'My thoughts and condolences are with all of Leanne's family and friends at this very difficult time. 'The investigation team and I take no pleasure in this guilty conviction, as clearly we would prefer never to have had to conduct this investigation into what is clearly a very sad matter. 'It serves as a reminder to us all that cars, particularly when they are driven in such a manner, are killers in the wrong hands. 'Therefore, we must all strive to not only continue to improve the way in which we drive every day, but also accept the responsibility that we all have when we take to the road. He added: 'During the course of this trial this young man has not taken responsibility for his actions or the part he played in Leanne's death.'

Maria got an A in English class, while Angela got an F because","completion":"Maria got an A in English class, while Angela got an F because their approach to academics and learning vastly differed. Throughout the semester, Maria committed herself to studying diligently and engaging in class discussions, whereas Angela neglected her academic responsibilities and struggled to stay focused on her coursework. From the very beginning of the semester, Maria recognized the importance of effective time management and organization in her pursuit of academic success. Each week, Maria created a detailed study schedule which carved out specific blocks of time for reading, writing, grammar exercises, and reviewing the lessons learned in class. Maria also made a conscious effort to participate actively in class, taking extensive notes, asking questions, and offering insightful commentary during group discussions. By doing so, Maria gained a deeper understanding of the material and reinforced her knowledge, allowing her to excel in quizzes, essay assignments, and class discussions. Conversely, Angela faced difficulties in prioritizing her schoolwork and maintaining a regular study routine. She often procrastinated on assignments, waited until the last minute to study for exams, and seldom completed her reading assignments on time. Although Angela had the intellectual capacity to succeed in the course, she struggled to stay motivated due to her poor organizational skills. Furthermore, Angela's participation in class was minimal, and she frequently missed classes due to her lack of schedule management. Another factor in Maria's success was her willingness to seek help when needed. Whenever Maria encountered a challenging concept or had difficulty with an assignment, she would approach her instructor or fellow classmates for guidance. Maria also utilized online resources and supplemental reading material, which helped her improve her academic performance. Angela, on the other hand, was reluctant to ask for assistance and often felt embarrassed to admit that she was struggling with the course material. This reluctance further hindered her academic progress and led to a decline in her English class performance. As the semester progressed, the gap between Maria and Angela's academic achievements widened. Maria continued to embrace her work ethic and consistently kept up with the course requirements. She made a conscious effort to improve her essay writing skills, which greatly contributed to her earning top marks in the subject. Moreover, Maria's active participation in class discussions had a positive impact on her critical thinking and comprehension skills, enabling her to effectively analyze and interpret texts. Meanwhile, Angela's situation deteriorated, as her lack of diligence and commitment to the course material resulted in the F grade. Her poor time management and irregular study habits took their toll on her academic standing, and she frequently struggled with the class material. Additionally, Angela's inability to seek assistance further isolated her from possible sources of support, such as her classmates and instructor. In conclusion, Maria's A and Angela's F in English class served as a reflection of their contrasting approaches to academics, personal organization, and time management. Maria's success resulted from her dedication, active engagement, and willingness to seek help when needed. Conversely, Angela's poor performance could be attributed to her disorganization, lack of focus, and reluctance to ask for assistance. Ultimately, their differing academic experiences reveal that achieving success in any subject requires dedication, perseverance, and an openness to both giving and receiving support from others."},{"prompt":"Question: Question: what two empires fought to control afghanistan I found the following answer on Google: Following the 1919 Anglo-Afghan War , King Amanullah began a European style modernization of the country but was stopped by the ultra-conservatives.

Every year, my wife asks the following: \\"So, besides Ribs, beer and margaritas, what else will be served?\\" I reply: \\"Nothing comes to mind.\\" She replies: \\"No.\\" As you might expect, she wins this discussion year in, year out.

Washington (CNN) -- The efforts by leaders of Turkey and Brazil to broker a nuclear deal with Iran reflects growing dissatisfaction with the traditional world order in which the United States is the only superpower, which they view as outdated and unjust. And their intervention on the Iran issue reflects a growing perception among many countries that the United States is unable to resolve international conflicts alone. The visit this week to Tehran by Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva was a rare show of personal, high-stakes diplomacy by a pair of world leaders.

There are five main friends (the leaders) who can say \\"no\\" to any game choice. If any one of these leaders says \\"no,\\" you all can't play that game, even if everyone else wants to. The United Nations (U.N.) is similar to this situation. It's like a big club where countries come together to make big decisions and solve problems. In this club, there are five important countries (the United States, Russia, China, France, and the United Kingdom) that have a special power called the \\"veto power.\\" It allows them to say \\"no\\" to any decision, even if the majority of the other countries want it to happen. Sometimes, using the veto power can be good, like when it stops a decision that might be harmful to people. However, when one of these five countries uses their veto power because of their own interests, it can stop important actions that can help people in need or solve conflicts. So, one could say that the veto power is a barrier to discourse or conversation in the U.N., because it can stop the club from doing important things that most of its members want to do, just like how one friend saying \\"no\\" stops you and your friends from playing a game that everyone else wants to play."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Given the question: SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear agreement is not expected to derail diplomatic momentum to reach a deal to end North Korea’s nuclear weapons program, but it could complicate the negotiation process, analysts say. Trump on Tuesday announced that the United States is ending its participation in the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) that lifted sanctions on Iran in exchange for Tehran limiting its nuclear program, and would re-impose U.S. economic sanctions on Iran. The agreement was negotiated by the administration of Trump’s predecessor, President Barack Obama, and involved five other world powers; Great Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia. Trump’s National Security Adviser John Bolton said the U.S. decision to re-impose sanctions on Iran will set a higher standard for North Korea nuclear talks by sending, “a very clear signal that the United States will not accept inadequate deals.” The U.S. policy reversal on Iran should not seriously impede diplomatic progress underway with North Korea, said Victor Cha, a noted Korea scholar with the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. “In terms of how the North Koreans would take it, I don’t think they’d take it one way or the other. I don’t think they’d see it as negative or positive because they think they’re different from anybody else anyway. They think they’re a very special case,” Cha said at a CSIS conference this week. While the Iran deal limited that country’s efforts to develop a nuclear bomb, North Korea already possesses 20 to 60 nuclear warheads, according assessments by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency and the Defense Intelligence Agency, and between 40 to 100 nuclear development facilities, according a report from the RAND Corporation security research organization. But apprehension over whether future U.S. presidents would uphold a nuclear deal reached by Trump could reinforce the North Korean demand for early concessions. John Delury, a North...

Surveyors are looking for specific types of people, and while you won't qualify for every survey (if you're a 25-year-old healthy hipster and they're looking for a 60-year-old couch potato, you're just not going to make the cut). Many survey companies offer screener surveys when you register, which usually don't pay. However, it's an important first step, and worth the little extra time it takes to fill these screening surveys out because the more demographic information the market research companies have on you, the more surveys they can send you. Remember, you will only be matched with surveys that you can actually contribute to, so if you leave all your screener information blank to get through it more quickly, you will receive fewer survey opportunities. Keep an eye out on both the site and your email regularly for survey opportunities. Some companies offer surveys more often than others—and you certainly don’t want to miss any of them! Any individual survey site may only offer a couple of surveys to you in a given month. The more companies you sign up with, the more surveys you'll be able to complete. Set up a rule for your email so that any survey emails that come in are flagged, make noise when they arrive, and appear at the top of your list. Everything you do to make them stand out will help. Once you have lots of surveys available, you can be more selective and pick the ones that seem like the best use of your time. If time isn’t an issue, on the other hand, you can do them all. You're under no obligation to complete any surveys if you don't want to. Summary:","completion":"To increase your chances of qualifying for and receiving survey opportunities, follow these steps: 1.

В данном контексте речь идёт об обязательстве Великобритании, в рамках которого страна обязана тратить указанный процент своего ВВП на финансирование различных программ и проектов, направленных на содействие развитию международных проектов. Это делается с целью интеграции стран развивающегося мира в мировую экономику, создания устойчивых условий для роста и развития местной экономики и инфраструктуры. Таким образом, Великобритания стремится содействовать экономическому и социальному росту развивающихся стран и вмешаться в решение таких задач, как истребление бедности, содействие равноправию, образованию, охране здоровья, а также участие в решении экологических и климатических вопросов на глобальном уровне. Принятие обязательства по расходованию определенной доли ВВП на международную развивающуюся помощь подчеркивает ответственность и лидерскую роль Великобритании на мировой арене. Благодаря такой политике, страна успешно взаимодействует со многими развивающимися странами, укрепляя сотрудничество и обмен опытом, а также повышая степень доверия и прозрачности в мировых отношениях. Однако стоит отметить, что позиция по расходованию 0,7% ВВП на международную развивающуюся помощь вызывает определенные дискуссии и контраргументы. Некоторые политики и экономисты считают, что часть этих средств могла бы быть направлена на развитие внутренних программ и инфраструктуры, а также на поддержку малого и среднего бизнеса в стране. Такая точка зрения предполагает, что более прямая инвестиция в национальную экономику может иметь более значительный эффект на долгосрочный рост и развитие Великобритании.

Answer: oxygen A:","completion":"Supporting Fact 1: The functional groups of aldehydes and ketones both contain a carbonyl group (C=O), in which an oxygen atom forms a double bond with a carbon atom. Supporting Fact 2: Carboxylic acids have a carboxyl group (COOH) in their structure, which consists of a carbonyl group (C=O) and a hydroxyl group (OH) bonded to the same carbon atom. In this functional group, there are two oxygen atoms. Supporting Fact 3: Esters have a functional group called an ester group (R-COO-R'), which is formed by the combination of a carbonyl group (C=O) and an ether group (R'-O). In this structure, one oxygen atom forms a double bond with a carbon atom, and another oxygen atom forms a single bond with another carbon atom. Supporting Fact 4: Ethers possess an ether group (R-O-R'), where an oxygen atom is bonded to two carbon-containing groups. This functional group exemplifies the unique ability of oxygen to create a strong bridge between two carbon atoms, facilitating its presence in the ethers' structure.

Step 2: Estimate the distances each individual would have to walk - The 45 year-old woman: If she throws less distance than the 21 year-old baseball player, she will likely have to walk a shorter distance to retrieve her ball. - The 21 year-old baseball player: If he throws a greater distance than the 45 year-old woman, he will likely have to walk a longer distance to retrieve his ball. Step 3: Determine which individual would have to walk the shortest distance Based on the assumed throwing abilities, it is more likely that the 45 year-old woman would have to walk the shortest distance to get her ball as she might not throw as far as the 21 year-old baseball player.

Question: The answer to the question: What were the first names of the people who compiled their tunebook both for public worship and revivals? is inside the article: When originally used in Olney, it is unknown what music, if any, accompanied the verses written by John Newton. Contemporary hymnbooks did not contain music and were simply small books of religious poetry. The first known instance of Newton's lines joined to music was in A Companion to the Countess of Huntingdon's Hymns (London, 1808), where it is set to the tune \\"Hephzibah\\" by English composer John Husband. Common meter hymns were interchangeable with a variety of tunes; more than twenty musical settings of \\"Amazing Grace\\" circulated with varying popularity until 1835 when William Walker assigned Newton's words to a traditional song named \\"New Britain\\", which was itself an amalgamation of two melodies (\\"Gallaher\\" and \\"St. Mary\\") first published in the Columbian Harmony by Charles H. Spilman and Benjamin Shaw (Cincinnati, 1829). Spilman and Shaw, both students at Kentucky's Centre College, compiled their tunebook both for public worship and revivals, to satisfy \\"the wants of the Church in her triumphal march\\". Most of the tunes had been previously published, but \\"Gallaher\\" and \\"St. Mary\\" had not. As neither tune is attributed and both show elements of oral transmission, scholars can only speculate that they are possibly of British origin. A manuscript from 1828 by Lucius Chapin, a famous hymn writer of that time, contains a tune very close to \\"St. Mary\\", but that does not mean that he wrote it.\\"Amazing Grace\\", with the words written by Newton and joined with \\"New Britain\\", the melody most currently associated with it, appeared for the first time in Walker's shape note tunebook Southern Harmony in 1847. It was, according to author Steve Turner, a \\"marriage made in heaven ... The music behind 'amazing' had a sense of awe to it. The music behind 'grace' sounded graceful.

A subplot in the film involves an American couple who encounter difficulties in their relationship because of the ongoing war. Inchon begins with North Korean soldiers moving past the 38th parallel north into South Korea in June 1950. People flee into the country's capital, Seoul. One of the displaced people is Barbara Hallsworth (Jacqueline Bisset), a U.S. Army major's wife who lives in a village on the 38th Parallel. She is chauffered to Seoul in a limousine, picking up five South Korean children along the way. After her chauffeur is killed, she drives them to a safe location called the Inn of the Sixth Happiness. Along the way, she shoots a North Korean soldier. Meanwhile, her husband, Frank Hallsworth (Ben Gazzara), is attempting to break off an affair with a young South Korean woman (Karen Kahn). Her father (Toshiro Mifune) is aware of his daughter's affair with Hallsworth and does not disapprove. Hallsworth receives word of the invasion by the North Koreans, and he travels north in an attempt to locate his wife with the assistance of army sergeant August Henderson (Richard Roundtree). Henderson encounters Hallsworth's wife and fixes her vehicle's battery, and then reunites her with her husband. Journalists David Feld Park (David Janssen) and Longfellow (Rex Reed) are attending a press conference held by MacArthur in Tokyo. MacArthur, however, does not show.

Answer the following question given this paragraph: Introduction Plants are as essential to human existence as land, water, and air. Without plants, our day-to-day lives would be impossible because without oxygen from photosynthesis, aerobic life cannot be sustained. From providing food and shelter to serving as a source of medicines, oils, perfumes, and industrial products, plants provide humans with numerous valuable resources. When you think of plants, most of the organisms that come to mind are vascular plants. These plants have tissues that conduct food and water, and they have seeds. Seed plants are divided into gymnosperms and angiosperms. Gymnosperms include the needle-leaved conifers—spruce, fir, and pine—as well as less familiar plants, such as ginkgos and cycads. Their seeds are not enclosed by a fleshy fruit. Angiosperms, also called flowering plants, constitute the majority of seed plants. They include broadleaved trees (such as maple, oak, and elm), vegetables (such as potatoes, lettuce, and carrots), grasses, and plants known for the beauty of their flowers (roses, irises, and daffodils, for example). While individual plant species are unique, all share a common structure: a plant body consisting of stems, roots, and leaves. They all transport water, minerals, and sugars produced through photosynthesis through the plant body in a similar manner. All plant species also respond to environmental factors, such as light, gravity, competition, temperature, and predation. Q: Angiosperms are also known as what?

He notices that organism A has enzymes, but organism B lacks enzymes. He needs to figure out how these conditions would affect the organisms. Would organism A see speedier or slower chemical reactions than organism B? Hint: Most chemical reactions within organisms would be impossible under the normal conditions within cell. For example, the body temperature of most organisms is too low for reactions to occur quickly enough to carry out life processes. Reactants may also be present in such low concentrations that it is unlikely they will meet and collide. Therefore, the rate of most biochemical reactions must be increased by a catalyst. A catalyst is a chemical that speeds up chemical reactions. In organisms, catalysts are called enzymes . A:","completion":"Based on the information provided, it is apparent that enzymes play a crucial role in facilitating biochemical reactions within organisms. These enzymes function as catalysts, which significantly increase the rate of chemical reactions, enabling organisms to carry out life processes effectively and efficiently. Since organism A possesses enzymes, the chemical reactions within its cells would be noticeably faster compared to organism B, which lacks enzymes. This difference in reaction speeds can be attributed to the catalytic properties of enzymes present in organism A. Enzymes work by lowering the activation energy required for a reaction to occur, which results in a higher likelihood of reactants colliding and forming products. In essence, enzymes optimize the biochemical reactions occurring within cells, making it possible for these reactions to proceed at a rapid pace. On the other hand, organism B, which does not contain enzymes, would have a much slower rate of chemical reactions. The slower reactions are due to the fact that non-catalyzed reactions tend to require higher activation energy. Moreover, as the hint suggests, the body temperature of most organisms is not conducive to rapid reaction rates, so the absence of enzymes in organism B would further hinder the progress of chemical reactions. Furthermore, the low concentration of reactants in the absence of a catalyst makes collisions among them rarer, reducing the overall reaction rate in organism B. This, combined with suboptimal environmental conditions for chemical reactions, would likely hinder organism B's ability to efficiently carry out life-sustaining processes. In summary, organism A, which contains enzymes, would experience speedier chemical reactions compared to organism B, which lacks these essential catalysts. The presence of enzymes in organism A permits biochemical reactions to proceed at a much faster pace, enabling the organism to effectively maintain its physiological processes and overall functionality. Conversely, organism B would likely struggle to support its life processes efficiently due to the slower reaction rates associated with the absence of enzymes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who has a hallucination that they are buried alive? After a textual montage summarizing Edgar Allan Poe's life, the film begins in late September 1849 with Poe awakening from a hallucination where he is buried alive. He prepares to take a trip to New York City via a ferry steamboat from Richmond, Virginia, to Baltimore, and from there, another ferry to New York City itself. He discusses his plans to marry his childhood sweetheart Sarah Elmira Royster with a stranger taking the same steamboat, who suggests that he meet with a few potential investors for his planned magazine The Stylus. Though Poe had intended only to pass through Baltimore, he agrees to meet the investors who, one by one, turn down his request for funding. Poe is depicted as having some type of memory loss, which is first evident when he offers to pay his boat fare twice after forgetting he had already paid. In Baltimore, he more than once forgets the arrangements he has made at his hotel as his stay in the city is extended. One night, he chooses to dine in a local tavern rather than at the hotel. There, he meets an old friend from his days at West Point. In desperation, he asks his former classmate and the classmate's companion for money to help start a magazine, saying proudly he has already raised 1,000. Poe leaves the tavern to retrieve his prospectus for the magazine. His classmate follows him and beats him up to steal the 1,000 he had collected. An injured and delirious Poe is then found by organizers of a cooping ring. The author, along with several others, are forced to multiple polling locations around Baltimore to place multiple votes for the candidate for mayor.

Make sure you're getting at least 600 IU of vitamin D every day.You may not be able to get all of your vitamin D from diet alone. Talk to your doctor about taking vitamin D supplements. Vitamin E supports your body's production of B-cells and natural killer cells. To get the benefit, you will need to take between 100 to 400 milligrams per day. People who are generally healthy need less, while people who are less healthy may require more. Since vitamin E is a fat soluble vitamin, you should take it with a meal that contains at least 3 grams (0.11 oz) of fat. If you want to eat your vitamin E, great options include sunflower seeds, almonds, spinach, safflower oil, beet greens, canned pumpkin, red peppers, asparagus, collard greens, mango, avocado, and peanut butter. You can find vitamin E supplements at drug stores, vitamin stores, and online. Selenium helps your body produce more white blood cells. Since you may not get it easily in your diet, selenium can be taken as a supplement. When taken along with zinc, both minerals are more effective at supporting your immune function. The recommended daily allowance of selenium for adults is 55 mcg per day. If you are pregnant, you should aim for 60 mcg, while nursing women should consume 70 mcg. You can also eat your selenium if you like to consume a lot of seafood. It's present in foods like oysters, crabs, and tuna.","completion":"This article says that not getting enough vitamin D can make your body weaker and make it harder for it to fight off germs.
