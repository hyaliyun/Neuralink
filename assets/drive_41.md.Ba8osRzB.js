Help as much as you can. Given the question: Information: - In epistemology, rationalism is the view that \\"regards reason as the chief source and test of knowledge\\" or \\"any view appealing to reason as a source of knowledge or justification\\". More formally, rationalism is defined as a methodology or a theory \\"in which the criterion of the truth is not sensory but intellectual and deductive\\". - A capital market is a financial market in which long-term debt or equity-backed securities are bought and sold. Capital markets are defined as markets in which money is provided for periods longer than a year. Capital markets channel the wealth of savers to those who can put it to long-term productive use, such as companies or governments making long-term investments. Financial regulators, such as the Bank of England (BoE) or the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), oversee the capital markets in their jurisdictions to protect investors against fraud, among other duties. - Medicine (British English ; American English ) is the science and practice of the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of disease. The word \\"medicine\\" is derived from Latin \\"medicus\\", meaning \\"a physician\\". Medicine encompasses a variety of health care practices evolved to maintain and restore health by the prevention and treatment of illness. Contemporary medicine applies biomedical sciences, biomedical research, genetics, and medical technology to diagnose, treat, and prevent injury and disease, typically through pharmaceuticals or surgery, but also through therapies as diverse as psychotherapy, external splints and traction, medical devices, biologics, and ionizing radiation, amongst others. - The University of Siena (abbreviation: UNISI) in Siena, Tuscany is one of the oldest and first publicly funded universities in Italy. Originally called \\"Studium Senese\\", the institution was founded in 1240. It had around 20,000 students in 2006, nearly half of Siena's total population of around 54,000. Today, the University of Siena is best known for its Schools of Law and Medicine. - Latium is the region of central western Italy in which the city of Rome was founded and grew to be the capital city of the Roman Empire. Latium was originally a small triangle of fertile, volcanic soil on which resided the tribe of the Latins or Latians. It was located on the left bank (east and south) of the Tiber river, extending northward to the Anio river (a left-bank tributary of the Tiber) and southeastward to the Pomptina Palus (Pontine Marshes, now the Pontine Fields) as far south as the Circeian promontory. The right bank of the Tiber was occupied by the Etruscan city of Veii, and the other borders were occupied by Italic tribes. Subsequently, Rome defeated Veii and then its Italic neighbors, expanding Latium to the Apennine Mountains in the northeast and to the opposite end of the marsh in the southeast. The modern descendant, the Italian \\"Regione\\" of Lazio, also called \\"Latium\\" in Latin, and occasionally in modern English, is somewhat larger still, but not as much as double the original Latium. - Rome is a city and special \\"comune\\" (named \\"Roma Capitale\\") in Italy. Rome is the capital of Italy and of the Lazio region. With 2,870,336 residents in , it is also the country's largest and most populated \\"comune\\" and fourth-most populous city in the European Union by population within city limits. The Metropolitan City of Rome has a population of 4.3 million residents. The city is located in the central-western portion of the Italian Peninsula, within Lazio (Latium), along the shores of Tiber river. The Vatican City is an independent country geographically located within the city boundaries of Rome, the only existing example of a country within a city: for this reason Rome has been often defined as capital of two states. - Marxism is a method of socioeconomic analysis that analyzes class relations and societal conflict using a materialist interpretation of historical development and a dialectical view of social transformation. It originates from the mid-to-late 19th century works of German philosophers Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. - Kantian ethics refers to a deontological ethical theory ascribed to the German philosopher Immanuel Kant. The theory, developed as a result of Enlightenment rationalism, is based on the view that the only intrinsically good thing is a good will; an action can only be good if its maximthe principle behind itis duty to the moral law. Central to Kant's construction of the moral law is the categorical imperative, which acts on all people, regardless of their interests or desires. Kant formulated the categorical imperative in various ways. His principle of universalizability requires that, for an action to be permissible, it must be possible to apply it to all people without a contradiction occurring. His formulation of humanity as an end in itself requires that humans are never treated merely as a means to an end, but always also as ends in themselves. The formulation of autonomy concludes that rational agents are bound to the moral law by their own will, while Kant's concept of the Kingdom of Ends requires that people act as if the principles of their actions establish a law for a hypothetical kingdom. Kant also distinguished between perfect and imperfect duties. A perfect duty, such as the duty not to lie, always holds true; an imperfect duty, such as the duty to give to charity, can be made flexible and applied in particular time and place. - Vatican City , officially Vatican City State or the State of Vatican City, is a walled enclave within the city of Rome. With an area of approximately 44 hectares (110 acres), and a population of 842, it is the smallest State in the world by both area and population, but formally it is not sovereign, sovereignty being held by the Holy See, the only entity of public international law that has diplomatic relations with almost every country in the world. - Friedrich Engels (or 28 November 1820 5 August 1895) was a German philosopher, social scientist, journalist, and businessman. He founded Marxist theory together with Karl Marx. In 1845, he published \\"The Condition of the Working Class in England\\", based on personal observations and research in Manchester. - Karl Marx (5 May 1818 14 March 1883) was a German-born scientist, philosopher, economist, sociologist, journalist, and revolutionary socialist. Born in Trier to a middle-class family, he later studied political economy and Hegelian philosophy. As an adult, Marx became stateless and spent much of his life in London, England, where he continued to develop his thought in collaboration with German thinker Friedrich Engels and published various works, the most well-known being the 1848 pamphlet \\"The Communist Manifesto\\". His work has since influenced subsequent intellectual, economic, and political history. - Capitalism is an economic system based on private ownership of the means of production and their operation for profit. Characteristics central to capitalism include private property, capital accumulation, wage labor, voluntary exchange, a price system, and competitive markets. In a capitalist market economy, decision-making and investment is determined by the owners of the factors of production in financial and capital markets, and prices and the distribution of goods are mainly determined by competition in the market. - Economic determinism is a theory that economic relationships (such as being an owner or capitalist, or being a worker or proletarian) are the foundation upon which all other social and political arrangements in society are based. The theory stresses that societies are divided into competing economic classes whose relative political power is determined by the nature of the economic system. In the version associated with Karl Marx, the emphasis is on the proletariat who are considered to be locked in a class struggle with the capitalist class, which will eventually end with the revolutionary overthrow of the capitalist system and the gradual development of socialism. Marxist thinkers have dismissed plain and unilateral economic determinism as a form of \\"vulgar Marxism\\", or \\"economism\\", nowhere included in Marx's works. - Economism is reduction of all social facts to economic dimensions. The term is often used to criticize economics as an ideology, in which supply and demand are the only important factors in decisions, and outstrip or permit ignoring all other factors. It is believed to be a side effect of neoclassical economics and blind faith in an \\"invisible hand\\" or \\"laissez-faire\\" means of making decisions, extended far beyond controlled and regulated markets, and used to make political and military decisions. Conventional ethics would play no role in decisions under pure economism, except insofar as supply would be withheld, demand curtailed, by moral choices of individuals. Thus, critics of economism insist on political and other cultural dimensions in society. - Law is a system of rules that are created and enforced through social or governmental institutions to regulate behavior. State-enforced laws can be made by a collective legislature or by a single legislator, resulting in statutes, by the executive through decrees and regulations, or established by judges through precedent, normally in common law jurisdictions. Private individuals can create legally binding contracts, including arbitration agreements that may elect to accept alternative arbitration to the normal court process. The formation of laws themselves may be influenced by a constitution, written or tacit, and the rights encoded therein. The law shapes politics, economics, history and society in various ways and serves as a mediator of relations between people. - Italy, officially the Italian Republic, is a unitary parliamentary republic in Europe. Located in the heart of the Mediterranean Sea, Italy shares open land borders with France, Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia, San Marino and Vatican City. Italy covers an area of and has a largely temperate seasonal climate and Mediterranean climate; due to its shape, it is often referred to in Italy as \\"lo Stivale\\" (the Boot). With 61 million inhabitants, it is the fourth most populous EU member state. - Determinism is the philosophical position that for every event there exist conditions that could cause no other event. \\"There are many determinisms, depending on what pre-conditions are considered to be determinative of an event or action.\\" Deterministic theories throughout the history of philosophy have sprung from diverse and sometimes overlapping motives and considerations. Some forms of determinism can be empirically tested with ideas from physics and the philosophy of physics. The opposite of determinism is some kind of indeterminism (otherwise called \\"nondeterminism\\"). Determinism is often contrasted with free will. - Competition is, in general, a contest or rivalry between two or more organisms, animals, individuals, economic groups or social groups, etc., for territory, a niche, for resources, goods, for mates, for prestige, recognition, for awards, for group or social status, or for leadership and profit. It arises whenever at least two parties strive for a goal which cannot be shared, where one's gain is the other's loss (a zero-sum game). - The concept of universalizability was set out by the 18th-century German philosopher Immanuel Kant as part of his work \\"Groundwork of the Metaphysic of Morals\\". It is part of the first formulation of his categorical imperative, which states that the only morally acceptable maxims of our actions are those that could rationally be willed to be universal law. - A market economy is an economic system where decisions regarding investment, production, and distribution are based on the interplay of supply and demand, which determines the prices of goods and services. The major defining characteristic of a market economy is that investment decisions, or the allocation of producer good, are primarily made through capital and financial markets. This is contrasted with a planned economy, where investment and production decisions are embodied in an integrated plan of production established by a state or other organizational body that controls the factors of production. - A revolution (from the Latin \\"revolutio\\", \\"a turn around\\") is a fundamental change in political power or organizational structures that takes place in a relatively short period of time when the population rises up in revolt against the current authorities. Aristotle described two types of political revolution: Revolutions have occurred through human history and vary widely in terms of methods, duration, and motivating ideology. Their results include major changes in culture, economy, and socio-political institutions. - The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of member states that are located primarily in Europe. It has an area of , and an estimated population of over 510 million. The EU has developed an internal single market through a standardised system of laws that apply in all member states. EU policies aim to ensure the free movement of people, goods, services, and capital within the internal market, enact legislation in justice and home affairs, and maintain common policies on trade, agriculture, fisheries, and regional development. Within the Schengen Area, passport controls have been abolished. A monetary union was established in 1999 and came into full force in 2002, and is composed of 19 EU member states which use the euro currency. - Ernesto Screpanti ( born 1948 , Rome ) is a professor of Political Economy at the University of Siena . He worked on the \`\` rethinking Marxism '' research programme , in the attempt to update Marxist analysis by bringing it in line with the reality of contemporary capitalism , on the one hand , and to liberate Marxism from any residue of Hegelian metaphysics , Kantian ethics and economic determinism , on the other .

The nostalgia associated with the sound of a CD spinning up and the familiar tones resounding from its grooves cannot be denied. However, as with any technology, there's always the possibility of encountering some issues. One of the most common problems is getting a CD stuck inside the player. Fear not, for in this article, we will guide you through a simple process to safely remove that stuck CD using nothing more than another blank or useless CD in a few easy steps. Step 1: Prepare Your Materials For this method, you will need: 1. A blank or useless CD - This could be an old data CD that has no more use or a blank CD that you're willing to part with. 2. Your CD player - We will be focusing on slot-loading CD players in this article. Step 2: Power Off The Device To avoid causing any further damage to the CD player or harming yourself, it is essential to turn off the device before attempting to remove the stuck CD. For car CD players, ensure that the engine is off and that the key is removed from the ignition. Step 3: Insert The Second CD Hold the blank or useless CD with its shiny side facing up. Gently place it into the CD player slot, about 1 inch (2.5 cm) deep. This will help you to make contact with the edge of the stuck CD inside the player. Step 4: Press the \\"Eject\\" Button While keeping the second CD in place, press the \\"Eject\\" button on your CD player. It may require a few tries, but you should eventually hear the familiar sound of the CD player attempting to eject the stuck CD. Step 5: Gently Wiggle The CD As the CD player attempts to eject the stuck CD, gently wiggle the second CD (that you've inserted) from side to side and apply slight upward or downward pressure on the CD player slot itself. This will aim to help dislodge the stuck CD and guide it out of the slot. Step 6: Remove The CDs Upon successful ejection, carefully remove both CDs from the player. It is possible that the stuck CD may be slightly scratched or damaged during the process. Inspect both CDs for any visible damage before attempting to use them in any other device. Conclusion: Even with advancing technology, it doesn't mean that we should leave behind the days of CDs. The simple method detailed in this article will breathe life back into your CD player, enabling you to reminisce with your favorite albums or enjoy your audiobooks in your car. In addition, this method prevents you from the expenses of bringing the unit to a professional or replacing it altogether. However, if the outlined method is unsuccessful or the issue persists, it may be necessary to consult a professional technician for help. Always handle electronic devices with care and remember to power them off before attempting any fixes yourself."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Many people rely on a cup of coffee or two to wake them up in the morning or refresh them during the working day, but now a chemist has come up with a speedy alternative to drinking coffee. U.S. biochemist Ben Yu has created 'Sprayable Energy', which claims to be the world's first caffeine - based topical energy spray. He said tired workers can spray a 'shot' of caffeine onto their skin without experiencing a strong noise, taking in unnecessary calories or being stuck with a nasty aftertaste like they might get from drinking energy drinks or coffee. The tasteless caffeine spray is absorbed through the skin and spread through the body over a number of hours to deliver a caffeine hit that lasts longer than drinking a cup of coffee. The only active ingredient in the spray is caffeine, which is very similar to nicotine in structure. Each spray 'Sprayable Energy' contains around a quarter of the amount of caffeine found in a cup of coffee, but apparently has the same effect as a full cup. The website said: \\"The reason for this is our product isn't entirely metabolized by the liver before entering your system and becoming available to your body.\\" Sprayable Energy's website recommends that users apply the spray in places where they normally spritz perfume, such as wrists, the neck or behind the ears, but warns users not to exceed 20 times a day. It claims that after spraying the product on the skin, users will feel awake and focus without being over-excited, which is common with coffee and energy drinks.

Context: The rate of incarceration in the U.S. is the world’s highest, leading to what many lawmakers and policy analysts say is a nationwide imprisonment epidemic. But the beginning of the end of that epidemic started Tuesday, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, a Democrat from New York, told VOA. A bipartisan prison reform bill that passed the U.S. House of Representatives by a 360-59 vote “strikes an opening blow against the overcriminalization of the nation,” Jeffries, one of the bill's co-sponsors, said. U.S. President Donald Trump said “the strong bipartisan vote paces the way for action by the Senate.” Last week, Trump endorsed the bill at a White House summit on prison reform, saying, “Our whole nation benefits if former inmates are able to reenter society as productive, law-abiding citizens.” If the bill reaches the president's desk for a signature, it would provide 50 million in funding for five years to provide job training, education and substance abuse treatment for prisoners as well as a number of quality-of-life measures aimed at reducing chronically high rates of recidivism among former inmates. But the contentious issue of criminal justice reform has split Democrats and Republicans within their own parties, possibly jeopardizing the bill’s chances of passage as it heads to the U.S. Senate. In a letter to colleagues last week, Democratic Senators Kamala Harris, Dick Durbin and Cory Booker joined two House Democratic colleagues, Representatives John Lewis and Sheila Jackson Lee, in saying the bill could not be implemented effectively and could possibly lead to prison privatization. Jeffries told VOA many of the arguments against the First Step Act “were anchored in falsehoods.” He added the legislation passed today “is a first step towards eradicating the cancer of mass incarceration” a move also welcomed by many House Republicans. “Rather than allowing the cycle of crime to continue, this legislation takes a practical, intelligent approach to rehabilitation,” House Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte, a Republican...

Ellie Zolfagharifard. Take a look at a map today, and you’re likely to see that North America is larger than Africa, Alaska is larger than Mexico and China is smaller than Greenland. But in reality China is four times bigger than Greenland, Africa is three times bigger than North America and Mexico is larger than Alaska. The distortion is the result of the Mercator projection, the map most commonly seen hanging in classrooms and in text books, which was created in 1596 to help sailors navigate the world. The Mercator projection, the map most commonly seen hanging in classrooms and in text books, was created in 1596 to help sailors navigate the world. The familiar map gives the right shapes of land masses, but at the cost of distorting their sizes in favour of the wealthy lands to the north. You might think that the advent of satellite imagery and tools such as Google maps has improved our view of the world, but this isn’t necessarily the case, according to James Wan writing in the Guardian. Much of this is due to technical reasons, said Mr Wan, while others inconsistences are caused by ideological assumptions that can change the way we see the world. The biggest challenge is that it is impossible to portray the reality of the spherical world on a flat map – a problem that has haunted cartographers for centuries. One of the best alternatives to the Mercator projection was presented in 1974 by D. Arno Peters (pictured). The Gall-Peters projection makes seeing the relative size of places much easier. However it also has its flaws as certain places appear stretched, horizontally near the poles and vertically near the Equator. A depiction of the world by Henricus Martellus. It's said that Columbus used this map or one like it to persuade Ferdinand of Aragon and Isabella of Castile to support him in the early 1490s. The map was made by a German cartographer living in Florence and reflects the latest theories about the form of the world and the most accurate ways of portraying it on a flat surface. Africa is around 14 times larger than Greenland and yet on the map both are almost same size. Brazil is more than five times larger than Alaska, yet Alaska is larger than Brazil on the map. The map suggests that Scandinavian countries are larger than India, whereas in reality India is three times the size of all Scandinavian countries put together. While it looks like Europe is larger than North America on this map, in reality the reverse is true. Russia also isn't as large as it is depicted, with Africa larger than Russia in reality. As a result, shapes of world maps have typically been diverse, ranging from hearts to cones. But the diversity gradually faded away with one model, invented by Gerardus Mercator, surpassing the others. The familiar 'Mercator' projection gives the right shapes of land masses, but at the cost of distorting their sizes in favour of the wealthy lands to the north. For instance, in the Mercator projection, north America looks at least as big, if not slightly larger, than Africa. And Greenland also looks of comparable size. But in reality Africa is larger than both. In fact, you can fit north America into Africa and still have space for India, Argentina, Tunisia and some left over, notes Mr Wan. Greenland, meanwhile, is 1/14th the size of the continent as can be seen in Gall-Peters equal projection, which provides the correct proportion of land mass to the continents. The map suggests that Scandinavian countries are larger than India, whereas in reality India is three times the size of all Scandinavian countries put together. As well, as this, it seems the fact that our maps typically put north at the top is a mere convention but has been accepted as correct in most of the world. Looking back, the diversity of maps can reveal a history of the world. The Chinese Globe which was made for the Chinese Emperor in 1623. The creators exaggerated the size of China and placed it in the middle of a world that otherwise consisted mainly of small offshore islands. The Werner heart-shaped project of the world (left) The fact that our maps typically put north at the top is a mere convention but has been accepted as correct in most of the world. Pictured on the right is a Mercator map turned on its head. For instance, The ‘Be On Guard!’ map was. created in 1921 when infant USSR was threatened with invasion, famine. and social unrest. To counter this, designers such as Dimitri Moor were employed to create pro-Bolshevik propaganda. Using a map of European Russia and its neighbours, Moor's image of a heroic Bolshevik guard defeating the invading 'Whites' helped define the Soviet Union in the Russian popular imagination. An earlier map, called the Hinese Globe, created in 1623 reveals the ancient Chinese view of the world. Made for the Chinese Emperor, this is the earliest known Chinese terrestrial globe, and a fusion of East and Western cultures. The creators exaggerated the size of China and placed it in the middle of a world that otherwise consisted mainly of small off¬shore islands. A century earlier, the 1507 Waldseemuller map named and envisaged America as a separate continent for the first time. Photo of a genuine hand drawn world map, it was drawn in 1844 and therefore the countries are named as they were in that period. The biggest challenge is that it is impossible to portray the reality of the spherical world on a flat map. Perhaps to emphasise the independent existence of the Americas, the map shows what we now know is the Pacific lapping the western coast of South America, though its existence was only confirmed years late. In 2005, Google Earth presented a world in which the area of most concern to the used could be at the centre, and which - with mapped content overlaid - can contain whatever you think is important. Almost for the first time, the ability to create an accurate map has been placed in the hands of everyone, and it has transformed the way we view the world. But it comes at a price. There are few, if any, agreed standards about what should be included, and the less populated and 'less important' regions get ignored. The infant USSR was threatened with invasion, famine and social unrest. To counter this, brilliant designers such as Dimitri Moor were employed to create pro-Bolshevik propaganda. Using a map of European Russia and its neighbours, Moor's image of a heroic Bolshevik guard defeating the invading 'Whites' helped define the Soviet Union in the Russian popular imagination.

Today, billions of searches are made on Google Maps each day, helping people navigate their way around, streets, towns and countries. Google Maps claims that it is on a ‘never-ending quest for the perfect map’, but Jerry Brotton, historian of cartography and the author of A History of the World in Twelve Maps, isn’t so sure. He argues that all maps are of their time, their place and serve certain purposes. ‘No world map is, or can be, a definitive, transparent depiction of its subject that offers a disembodied eye onto the world,’ he writes. ‘Each one is a continual negotiation between its makers and users, as their understanding of the world changes.’ This map was used in 1782 by British diplomats negotiating an end to the American War of Independence in Paris. Richard Oswald, secretary to the delegation, annotated it with coloured lines to show where it was thought past treaties established the U.S./Canada border.","completion":"This article highlights the distortions and inaccuracies of the Mercator projection, a map created in 1596, which is commonly seen in classrooms and textbooks. While the map accurately shows the shapes of land masses, it distorts their true size. For example, on the Mercator projection, North America appears larger than Africa, Alaska appears larger than Mexico, and Greenland appears larger than China. In reality, Africa is three times larger than North America, Mexico is larger than Alaska, and China is four times larger than Greenland. Due to the impossibility of depicting the true spherical world on flat maps, cartographers have sought alternatives. One of the most well-known alternatives is the Gall-Peters projection, created in 1974, which makes it easier to see the relative sizes of different places. However, it still has some flaws, such as making certain places appear horizontally stretched near the poles or vertically stretched near the Equator. Maps tend to exaggerate the size of wealthy northern countries, including North America and Europe, while diminishing the size of large and powerful Southern Hemisphere nations such as Africa and India. This distortion has led some to question the objectivity and reliability of maps in general. While satellite imagery and tools like Google Maps have improved our view of the world, the article argues that this hasn't necessarily corrected the flaws in traditional maps. Technological advances, as well as ideological assumptions, have changed the way we view the world, but have not eliminated the inherent challenges of representing a spherical planet on two-dimensional maps. In conclusion, maps are never perfect; they are always a negotiation between their creators and users, made using certain perspectives and ideologies. As our understanding of the world changes, so too will the maps that we create and use to navigate it."},{"prompt":"Instructions: In this task, you are given inputs i and A, where i is an integer and A is a list.

Rose, an autodidact with a dominating presence, supervised his music and literature studies and engaged other tutors for languages, art and drama. From his earliest lessons, Percy developed a lifelong fascination with Nordic culture; writing late in life, he said that the Icelandic Saga of Grettir the Strong was \\"the strongest single artistic influence on my life\\". As well as showing precocious musical talents, he displayed considerable early gifts as an artist, to the extent that his tutors thought his future might lie in art rather than music. At the age of 10 he began studying piano under Louis Pabst, a German immigrant then considered to be Melbourne's leading piano teacher. Grainger's first known composition, \\"A Birthday Gift to Mother\\", is dated 1893. Pabst arranged Grainger's first public concert appearances, at Melbourne's Masonic Hall in July and September 1894. The boy played works by Bach, Beethoven, Schumann and Scarlatti, and was warmly complimented in the Melbourne press.After Pabst returned to Europe in the autumn of 1894, Grainger's new piano tutor, Adelaide Burkitt, arranged for his appearances at a series of concerts in October 1894, at Melbourne's Royal Exhibition Building. The size of this enormous venue horrified the young pianist; nevertheless, his performance delighted the Melbourne critics, who dubbed him \\"the flaxen-haired phenomenon who plays like a master\\". This public acclaim helped Rose to decide that her son should continue his studies at the Hoch Conservatory in Frankfurt, Germany, an institution recommended by William Laver, head of piano studies at Melbourne's Conservatorium of music.

They put on their colorful backpacks filled with books, pencils, and crayons. They held hands and skipped all the way to the big yellow school bus. The bus was like a giant on wheels that took them on a fun adventure every day. When they reached school, the two friends entered their classroom with big smiles on their faces. Their teacher, Miss Applebee, greeted them with a warm hug. She was the kindest teacher, and she made learning so enjoyable, just like playing games. During the day, they learned about letters, numbers, shapes, and colors. They read stories about princesses and pirates, and they even got to draw pictures of the characters they imagined in their head. Victoria drew a picture of a brave pirate, while Katrina painted a beautiful princess. At lunchtime, Victoria and Katrina sat together under the big shady tree in their school's playground. They opened their lunch boxes and found yummy sandwiches made by their moms. They happily munched on their food, talking about the things they learned that morning. After lunch, they went back to the classroom to learn about animals and their habitats. They watched a movie about lions, bears, and whales, and they thought it was so fascinating to see creatures from all around the world. Finally, it was time for recess. Victoria and Katrina raced to the swings and played tag with their classmates. They laughed and chased each other, feeling the cool wind on their faces as they ran.

Question: Given the following context: Former Division I collegiate wrestler Scott Voss is a 42-year-old bored and disillusioned biology teacher at the failing Wilkinson High School. Budget cutbacks at the school jeopardize the continuation of its music program, which would result in its teacher, Marty Streb, being laid off. Concerned for both his colleague and his students, Scott attempts to raise the 48,000 necessary to keep the music program alive. He moonlights as a night instructor for an adult citizenship class, where student Niko asks him for outside tutoring. When Scott arrives at Niko's apartment, he learns that Niko was a former mixed martial arts fighter. While watching the UFC at Niko's apartment, Scott learns that the loser of a fight receives 10,000, which gives him the idea of raising the money by fighting and losing in MMA. Scott, helped by Niko and Marty, begins with small unsanctioned bouts paying only 750 to the loser. Niko begins training him in defense, later adding trainer Mark to teach offense, after Scott knocks out an opponent and realizes that wins give larger payouts, needing fewer fights to achieve his 48,000 goal. While Mark trains with Scott, Malia De La Cruz, one of Scott's students and a band member, helps Niko study for his citizenship test by putting the information into songs.

Please answer the following question: Information: - Christian democracy is a political ideology which emerged in nineteenth-century Europe under the influence of conservatism and Catholic social teaching, as well as Neo-Calvinism. It was originally conceived as a combination of traditional Catholic beliefs and modern democratic ideas, and it grew to incorporate the social teaching of other Christian denominations, such as the Lutheran Church and the Reformed Church. After World War II, the Protestant and Catholic movements of the Social Gospel and Neo-Thomism, respectively, played a role in shaping Christian democracy. Christian democracy continues to be influential in Europe and Latin America, although it is present in other parts of the world too. - The Centrist Democrat International is Christian Democrat political international. Until 2001 it was known as the Christian Democrat International (CDI) and before that the \\"Christian Democrat and People's Parties International\\" (until 1999) (this earlier name is, since October 2000, still sometimes used colloquially). It was formed in 1961 in Santiago, Chile as the \\"Christian Democrat World Union\\", building on the legacy of other Christian Democrat internationals who tried to create a Christian-inspired third way alternative to the socialist internationals; in 1982 it was renamed for the first time Christian Democrat International. The name officially changed due to the participation of groups of various faiths. It is the global international political group dedicated to the promotion of Christian democracy. Although it gathers parties from around the globe, its members are drawn principally from Europe and Latin America. Some of them are also members of the International Democrat Union (IDU), although the CDI is closer to the political centre and more communitarian than the IDU. - A European political party (formally, a political party at European level; informally a Europarty) is a type of political party organisation operating transnationally in Europe and in the institutions of the European Union. They are regulated and funded by the European Union and are usually made up of national parties, not individuals. Europarties have the exclusive right to campaign during the European elections and express themselves within the European Parliament by their affiliated political groups and their MEPs. Europarties, through coordination meetings with their affiliated heads of state and government, influence the decision-making process of the European Council. Europarties also work closely and co-ordinate with their affiliated members of the European Commission and, according to the Lisbon Treaty the Europarty that wins the European elections has the right to nominate to the European Council its candidate for President of the European Commission. - The Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) is a global inter-parliamentary institution established in 1889 by Frédéric Passy (France) and William Randal Cremer (United Kingdom). It was the first permanent forum for political multilateral negotiations. Initially, the organization was for individual parliamentarians, but has since transformed into an international organization of the parliaments of sovereign states. The national parliaments of 170 countries are members of the IPU, and 11 regional parliamentary assemblies are associate members. The IPU has permanent observer status at the United Nations General Assembly and general consultative status with the Economic and Social Council. - Santiago de Chile is the capital and largest city of Chile. It is also the center of its largest conurbation. Santiago is located in the country's central valley, at an elevation of above mean sea level. - The European People's Party (EPP) is a European political party. A transnational organisation, it is composed of other political parties, not individuals. Founded by primarily Christian democratic parties in 1976, it has since broadened its membership to include liberal-conservative parties and parties with other centre-right political perspectives. - Lorenzo Cesa (born 16 August 1951 in Arcinazzo Romano, Rome) is an Italian politician, and was elected to the Italian Chamber of Deputies in the 2006 General election representing the Union of Christian and Centre Democrats. He was elected on October 27, 2005 as new party leader, replacing resigning secretary Marco Follini. - The Union of the Centre ( Italian : Unione di Centro , UdC ) is a Christian democratic political party in Italy . Its secretary is Lorenzo Cesa , but its most popular figure and actual leader is Pier Ferdinando Casini . The party is a member of the European People 's Party and the Centrist Democrat International , of which Casini is president . The party was formed in December 2002 as the Union of Christian and Centre Democrats ( Unione dei Democratici Cristiani e di Centro , UDC ) as the merger of the Christian Democratic Centre , the United Christian Democrats and European Democracy . In 2008 the party was the driving force behind the UdC , an alliance comprising , among others , The Rose for Italy , the Populars for the Constituent Assembly of the Centre , the Liberal Clubs , the Party of Christian Democracy , Christian Democratic Party , Veneto for the European People 's Party , the Democratic Populars and the Autonomist Democrats . Since then , the party 's official name was neglected in favour of \`\` Union of the Centre '' and , since most of the UdC member parties have joined the UDC too , the UDC and the UdC started to overlap almost completely to the point that they are now undistinguishable . The UDC was part of the Pole / House of Freedoms from its establishment through 2008 . Later it has been affiliated neither to the centre - right nor the centre - left at the national level . Despite this , the party takes part in several regional , provincial and municipal governments with Forza Italia , the largest force of the Italian centre - right ( notably in Campania and Calabria ) , but recently formed alliances also with the centre - left Democratic Party in other regions ( notably in Marche ) and at the very local level . In the 2013 general election the UdC was part of With Monti for Italy , the coalition formed around Mario Monti 's Civic Choice . More recently the party , which sits in the Renzi Cabinet , has sided with the Angelino Alfano 's New Centre - Right . - The International Democrat Union (IDU) is an international alliance of centre-right political parties.

If things went as planned, there was no limit to what she could have. She smiled to herself as a crowd of sunburned, middle-aged men broke ranks to let her pass on her way toward Mallory Square. They had no idea who she was, but she liked to think that they could sense her strength and that it intimidated them. Not enough to stop them from staring openly at her chest of course, but what did she expect? They were still men. Duval Street, Key West's main tourist drag, buzzed with early evening activity.

Question 1: Why in Japan is subway free Wi-Fi only for tourists? Question 2: Is free Wi-Fi really required in the whole of Delhi? Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","completion":"No, Questions 1 and 2 are not asking the same thing. They are asking about different aspects of free Wi-Fi services in different locations. Let's analyze them separately and provide detailed answers for each. Question 1: Why in Japan is subway free Wi-Fi only for tourists? One possible reason for offering subway free Wi-Fi specifically to tourists in Japan might be to support and promote tourism in the country. By providing this service only for tourists, Japan wants to ensure that visitors to the country have a seamless and convenient experience while traveling on public transportation. Foreigners can access free Wi-Fi on the subway by entering their passports to register for the service. Tourists often rely on internet access to navigate, look up information about the area, and stay connected with friends, family, and work when they are traveling. Providing free Wi-Fi on subways allows Japan to cater to the needs of tourists who would appreciate these features. This can be seen as a way of welcoming and acknowledging the importance of international visitors to the country's economy. In addition, subway free Wi-Fi may incentivize more travelers to use public transportation, which could help in managing traffic congestion and environmental concerns. It is important to note that besides free Wi-Fi in subway stations for tourists, there are other free Wi-Fi options for residents in Japan, such as in cafes, libraries, and some public spaces. Question 2: Is free Wi-Fi really required in the whole of Delhi? Whether free Wi-Fi is required across the entire city of Delhi depends on various factors. Each city has its own set of unique circumstances, opportunities, and challenges. Implementing free Wi-Fi across the whole of Delhi could have multiple advantages and drawbacks that must be considered. Some of the potential advantages include: 1. Digital accessibility: Providing free Wi-Fi could help bridge the digital divide and improve access to information and resources for those who cannot afford an internet connection. 2. Economic growth: Easy access to the internet can contribute to the economy by facilitating business activities, attracting start-ups, and fostering innovation. 3. Quality of life: Free Wi-Fi in public spaces might encourage citizens to spend more time outdoors, promoting a sense of community and social engagement. 4. Educational opportunities: Students and researchers could benefit from increased access to online resources, which may improve learning outcomes. 5. Government services: Digitalization of various governmental services can be facilitated with the availability of free Wi-Fi, leading to increased efficiency and reduced corruption. However, there are also potential drawbacks or challenges associated with implementing free Wi-Fi across Delhi: 1.

Given the fact that: The voice becomes deeper as the larynx in the throat grows larger. Answer the question: Eric underwent surgery to increase the size of his larynx. His voice is now higher or deeper? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Eric's voice is now deeper. The larynx, also known as the voice box, is an organ in the throat responsible for vocal production. The size and shape of the larynx determine many qualities of the voice that it produces. One fundamental principle is that a larger larynx produces a deeper voice, while a smaller larynx produces a higher voice. This principle is reflective of the way physical properties contribute to the generation of sound. In general, larger objects or spaces tend to resonate at lower frequencies, creating deeper sounds, while smaller objects or spaces resonate at higher frequencies, creating higher sounds. This is true for musical instruments, rooms in a building, geological features like canyons or caves, and also biological structures like the larynx. The vocal cords, housed within the larynx, are a pair of flexible muscular structures that vibrate to produce sound when air passes over them. Their length, tension, and mass can all affect the pitch of the sound they produce. A larger larynx typically accommodates longer, thicker vocal cords that vibrate at a lower frequency, resulting in a deeper voice. On the basis of the given information that Eric underwent surgery to increase the size of his larynx, it is reasonable to infer that his voice is now deeper. This is because the larger larynx, most likely housing larger vocal cords, would produce lower-frequency, deeper vocal sounds. However, it's important to note that this conclusion is genuinely indicative and while generally true, individual differences and surgical factors might influence the final outcome. Hence, for a comprehensive and concrete understanding of Eric's voice change, specific details of his surgical procedure and individual physiological differences would need to be taken into consideration."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

SEOUL South Korea's military on Monday threatened retaliation against North Korea after accusing the North of planting land mines inside the Demilitarised Zone border that wounded two soldiers last week, in what it called a cowardly act of provocation. There was evidence to conclude that soldiers from the North crossed the Military Demarcation Line recently to plant the mines, and Pyongyang would be made to \\"pay a severe price\\", the South's military told a news briefing. \\"We strongly condemn this cowardly act, which would be unthinkable for a normal military,\\" Major General Ku Hong-mo of South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said, calling it a violation of the armistice agreement that ended the 1950-53 Korean War. The denunciation is likely to provoke an angry response from the North and further raise tensions on the Korean peninsula. Later on Monday, as part of its countermeasures, the South Korean military used loudspeakers to blare anti-Pyongyang rhetoric across the border, a defense ministry official said, resuming broadcasts that had been suspended since 2004. The United Nations Command, headed by the U.S. military and which oversees the armistice, also condemned what it called the North's violation of the truce. It said it would call for a meeting with North Korea's military. The area around last Tuesday's blast had been swept for mines and the terrain made it impossible for mines planted elsewhere to have drifted due to rain or shifting soil, South Korea's military said. Fragments from the exploded mines also had paint typically used by the North, it said. Two soldiers who were part of a team conducting a routine search operation inside the heavily fortified DMZ near the town of Paju, about 50 km (30 miles) north of Seoul, were seriously wounded in the blast. (Reporting by Ju-min Park; Editing by Jack Kim and Clarence Fernandez) ||||| Seoul, South Korea (CNN) South Korea says it will resume broadcasting propaganda messages over its heavily armed border with North Korea in retaliation for landmine blasts that wounded two of its soldiers. The use of loudspeakers to blare government messages into North Korean territory is a form of psychological warfare that the South Korean Defense Ministry stopped more than a decade ago during a thaw in relations between the two sides. Restarting the broadcasts is all but certain to infuriate North Korea, which has threatened in the past to destroy the groups of huge speakers that the South set up at the demilitarized zone that separates the two countries. But the South Korean government is upset over the serious leg injuries suffered by two soldiers who stepped on landmines last week in the demilitarized zone, which is considered to be the most heavily fortified border in the world. South Korea and the U.S.-led United Nations Command in Korea said Monday that the North Korean military planted the mines in the southern half of the zone along a route patrolled by South Korean troops. Wounded soldiers forced to have amputations One of the soldiers had to have part of each leg amputated, and the other had to have one foot removed at the ankle, the South Korean Defense Ministry said. Before South Korea announced the resumption of propaganda broadcasts, Maj. Gen. Koo Hong-mo, director of operations of the South's Joint Chiefs of Staff, warned that North Korea would \\"pay a harsh price\\" for laying the mines. He demanded that Pyongyang apologize for planting the landmines and severely punish whoever is responsible. There was no immediate comment on the matter Monday in North Korean state media. The South Korean Defense Ministry declined to specify when exactly the propaganda broadcasts would resume. It said sound from the the giant loudspeakers can travel about 24 kilometers (15 miles) at night and about 12 kilometers on weekdays. Professor Lee Jung-hoon said we have not heard the end of the tensions. \\"When we have the psychological warfare -- the leaflets or the loudspeakers -- basically the message is: the current leader is doing a very bad job, that their human rights are being violated, and that there's a much better world outside that they should be aware of,\\" said Lee, an associate professor of international relations at Yonsei University in Seoul. He said North Korea will not take kindly to criticism against Kim. \\"For them Kim Jong Un, as his father and his father's father was, is not just a political leader, he's a deity figure,\\" he said. \\"For the leadership, just the fact that there's the public condemnation and criticism of this godlike figure is just totally unacceptable.\\" And North Korea, he said, will have some sort of reaction. \\"Absolutely they will respond,\\" he said. \\"I can't say in what way.\\" U.N. Command condemns truce violations The U.S.-led United Nations Command in Korea said that its investigation into the explosions found that the North's Korean People's Army had breached several parts of the armistice on the Korean Peninsula by planting landmines along a South Korean patrol route in the southern half of the demilitarized zone. \\"The United Nations Command condemns these violations of the Armistice Agreement, and will call for a general officer level-dialog with the Korean People's Army,\\" the U.N. Command statement said. The U.N. Command, which monitors the armistice, said that the investigation had found that the wooden box landmines were recently planted, ruling out the possibility that they were old mines that might have been displaced by rain or other elements over the years. Staff members from South Korea, the United States, New Zealand and Colombia took part in the investigation, the U.N. Command said. Previous border tensions The demilitarized zone has divided North and South Korea since the Korean War ended in 1953 with an armistice rather than a formal peace treaty. As a result, the two countries technically remain at war. Tension has flared in the past around sensitive points on the their de facto border, including North Korea's shelling of an island in 2010 that killed two South Korean marines. Roughly 28,000 U.S. troops are based in South Korea. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","completion":"South Korea's military has accused North Korea of planting landmines inside the Demilitarised Zone border that wounded two South Korean soldiers last week.

Select the correct sentiment of the following review: Love it or loathe it, it's hard to not find Warren Beatty's take on \\"Dick Tracy,\\" the 1990 film adaptation of Chester Gould's famous comic strip, anything short of a genre classic. Superhero films have been coming out of the woodwork in recent years, and may soon become a genre all on its own. Beatty's film liberally uses Gould's source material to full effect, shooting in all six of the strip's primary colors, and thus giving this unique yet familiar world of trigger-happy mutant gangsters and loose, seductive women a lush visual style and tone. It can be stated that the film's strong visual aesthetics drastically short-change the characters and their acting abilities, which I don't think can be any further from the truth. \\"Dick Tracy\\" relishes in its look and ghastly characters, and Beatty himself, who plays the dogged and incorruptible detective of the title, is appropriately stoic and ready to bust the bad guys at any and all costs. Other than the visual treats and Oscar-winning makeup, there is a plot, and Big Boy Caprice (Al Pacino, deliciously over-the-top in an Oscar-nominated performance), seeks to eliminate Tracy in one well-planned move, but also seeks to gain control of all criminal action in the city by uniting all the feuding gangs under him. Tracy, meanwhile, is juggling his relationship with Tess Trueheart (Glenne Headly), who as her name would have it, remains faithfully by his side and cares for The Kid (Charlie Korsmo), who eventually finds a father figure to look up to in our crime-busting hero. Tracy's fidelity to Tess is tested by the tempting advances of Breathless Mahoney (Madonna), who is also Big Boy's main squeeze. At the same time that all of this is going down, things become heated when a new criminal figure arrives in town, and decides to play both sides against the middle. The performances are good, as Beatty's focus on the strained and romantic relationships between each of the leads becomes the center of the material, as opposed to just concentrating on pointless action and special effects. Pacino freely chews up the scenery in a role that's truly standout from the rest. \\"Dick Tracy\\" is one of the best and most overlooked of the comic book movie genre.

President Obama defied congressional opposition and designated five new national monuments Monday, using his executive authority to put historic sites and wild landscapes in a half-dozen states off limits to development.. The designations affect three areas managed by the National Park Service, including one honoring abolitionist Harriet Tubman and the Underground Railroad in Maryland and a collection of sites commemorating Delaware as the nation's first state. Obama also used his power under the 1906 Antiquities Act to protect two swaths of land under the Bureau of Land Management’s control: Washington’s San Juan Islands and New Mexico’s Rio Grande del Norte. “These sites honor the pioneering heroes, spectacular landscapes and rich history that have shaped our extraordinary country,” the president said. “By designating these national monuments today, we will ensure they will continue to inspire and be enjoyed by generations of Americans to come.” House Natural Resources Committee Chairman Doc Hastings (R-Wash.), who has opposed the creation of new wilderness areas and national parks, questioned why the president would extend public lands protection at a time when the federal budget is under pressure. “The Obama Administration not only sees the sequester as an opportunity to make automatic spending reductions as painful as possible on the American people,\\" Hastings said in a statement, \\"it’s also a good time for the President to dictate under a century-old law that the government spend money it doesn’t have on property it doesn’t even own.\\" But Conservation Fund president Lawrence A. Selzer, whose group donated land to help create both the Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad National Monument and Delaware's First State National Monument, said nearly half of the nation's national parks started out as national monument designations. In the case of Delaware, the state's Mt. Cuba Center gave 20 million to the Fund so it could purchase the 1,100-acre property Woodlawn in Delaware and Pennsylvania and donate it to the National Park Service. \\"This is by no means unusual,\\" Selzer said. \\"The fact that the president is stepping forward and using his authority is a reflection of the support at the local level.\\" It remains unclear whether Obama will designate other national monuments in the future; last Congress marked the first one since 1966 which failed to designate a single new national park or wilderness areas. Even the three national moments Obama has designated on Park Service land will not become national parks without an act of Congress. White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters Monday that \\"in terms of future decisions along these lines, I don't have anything to announce at this point.\\" He did challenge Hastings' suggestion that these new monuments would put a financial burden on taxpayers, noting that local communities often benefit from tourism once an areas has been designated. \\"And in terms of the immediate costs -- in terms of the management of the land, I think they're pretty minimal in the early stages,\\" he said. Mike Matz, who heads the Pew Charitable Trusts' Campaign for America's Wilderness, said there are several other large landscapes that enjoy significant local and bipartisan support. These include Idaho's Boulder-White Clouds proposed wilderness area and Cedar Mesa plateau in Utah. Since the Rio Grande del Norte is the only large wild area Obama has declared a national monument so far, Matz said, \\"We would like to see him do more on that scale.\\" Republicans may try to repeal the Antiquities Act, though it is unclear whether they would succeed. Sen. David Vitter (R-La.) offered an amendment revoking the president's authority last week as part of the budget debate, but it didn't come up for a vote. ||||| Today, President Obama signed proclamations establishing five new national monuments that celebrate our nation’s rich history and natural heritage. The monuments, located in Delaware, Maryland, New Mexico, Ohio and Washington, help tell the story of significant people and extraordinary events in American history, and also help protect natural resources and supporting economic growth in local communities through tourism and outdoor recreation. “These sites honor the pioneering heroes, spectacular landscapes and rich history that have shaped our extraordinary country,” President Obama said. “By designating these national monuments today, we will ensure they will continue to inspire and be enjoyed by generations of Americans to come.” Check out images from each of the new monuments above, and read on below to find out more about these unique sites. Charles Young Buffalo Soldiers National Monument in Ohio. The monument will preserve the home of Col. Charles Young (1864–1922), a distinguished officer in the United States Army who was the third African American to graduate from West Point and the first to achieve the rank of Colonel. Young also served as one of the early Army superintendents of Sequoia and General Grant National Parks, before the establishment of the National Park Service in 1916. The national headquarters of the Omega Psi Phi fraternity, of which Col. Young was a member, made the property available for acquisition by the federal government for the purpose of establishing the national monument commemorating Young’s life and accomplishments. The monument, located in Wilberforce, Ohio, will be managed by the Department of the Interior’s National Park Service. First State National Monument in Delaware. The monument will tell the story of the early Dutch, Swedish, Finnish and English settlement of the colony of Delaware, as well as Delaware’s role as the first state to ratify the Constitution. The park is comprised of three historic areas related to Delaware’s rich history: the Dover Green, the New Castle Court House complex (including the courthouse, Green and Sheriff’s House), and the Woodlawn property in the Brandywine Valley. The monument will be managed by the Department of the Interior’s National Park Service. Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad National Monument in Maryland. The monument commemorates the life of the most famous conductor on the Underground Railroad who was responsible for helping enslaved people escape from bondage to freedom. The new national park, located on Maryland’s Eastern Shore, includes large sections of landscapes that are significant to Tubman’s early life in Dorchester County and evocative of her life as a slave and conductor of the Underground Railroad. The park includes Stewart’s Canal, dug by hand by free and enslaved people between 1810 and the 1830s and where Tubman learned important outdoor skills when she worked in the nearby timbering operations with her father. Lands that are part of Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge, although part of the new national monument, will continue to be managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad National Monument also includes the home site of Jacob Jackson, a free black man who used coded letters to help Tubman communicate with family and others. The monument will also partner with the State of Maryland’s Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad State Park Visitor Center when it opens in 2015. The monument will be managed by the Department of the Interior’s National Park Service. Río Grande del Norte National Monument in New Mexico. Located northwest of Taos, the Río Grande del Norte contains stretches of the Río Grande Gorge and extinct volcanoes that rise from the Taos Plateau. The area is known for its spectacular landscapes and recreational opportunities – like rafting, fishing and hiking – and serves as important habitat for many birds and wildlife. The monument is also home to a dense collection of petroglyphs and extraordinary archaeological and cultural resources dating from the Archaic Period to the more recent passage of Hispanic settlers. The monument will be managed by the Department of the Interior’s Bureau of Land Management, which currently manages the more than 240,000 acres of the monument. San Juan Islands National Monument in Washington. Home to bald eagles, orca whales, harbor seals and other rare species, the San Juan Islands is a chain of 450 islands, rocks and pinnacles. Located in Washington State’s Puget Sound, the archipelago provides an opportunity for visitors, campers, kayakers and birdwatchers to experience the natural beauty of the undeveloped, rugged landscape. A number of historic lighthouses are located on the islands, as well as cultural resources and fossils dating back 12,000 years. The monument will be managed by the Department of the Interior’s Bureau of Land Management. ||||| What is a summary?","completion":"In 2013, President Obama used his executive authority to designate five new national monuments in an effort to preserve historic sites and landscapes and protect them from development.

David pays a visit with his ex-girlfriend, Noel, who returns his belongings and refuses to move back in with him. Their conversation is cut short by a call from Kate reporting that Woody has taken off once again. David retrieves Woody and decides to drive him all the way to Lincoln, much to Kate's dismay. While in Rapid City, South Dakota, Woody goes on a bender and hits his head while stumbling back to their motel room. David takes him to the hospital to get his head stitched up. David learns that they will be passing through Woody's hometown of Hawthorne, Nebraska, and suggests they spend the night with Woody's family. Woody is against the idea, but they end up going anyway. They stay with Woody's brother Ray, his wife, and their two sons, Cole and Bart. Woody and David visit a mechanic shop Woody once co-owned, followed by some beers at a bar. When David brings up Woody's alcoholism and problems within the family—with Woody implying that he did not love Kate nor really want children—they get into an argument. At another bar, they meet Ed Pegram, whom the family blames for stealing Woody's air compressor decades ago. Over David's objections, Woody mentions winning the money and the barflies toast his good fortune. The next day, they learn that the news has spread through the town like wildfire.

Dr. Donald Blake, a science professor at Dunsford University, receives delivery of a coelacanth. A student, Jimmy, asks Blake if the fish is really a million years old. Blake replies, \\"It's the species that's old. No change in millions of years. See, the coelacanth is a living fossil, immune to the forces of evolution\\". Blake lectures his students about evolution and devolution, telling them that man is the only creature that can decide whether to move forwards or backwards, and that \\"unless we learn to control the instincts we've inherited from our ape-like ancestors, the race is doomed\\". Inside the lab, Blake scratches himself on its teeth of the Partially-thawed coelacanth, accidentally sticking his bloody hand into the water-filled container which held the fish. Molly Riordan, assistant to Dr. Cole Oliver, is with Blake and offers him a ride home. When they get to Molly's car, Blake says he doesn't feel well and passes out. At Blake's home, Molly is attacked by person or persons unknown.

Although already in her forties, she still lives in an apartment with her domineering mother. Her father is a long-standing resident in a psychiatric asylum. The audience is gradually shown truths about Erika's private life. Behind her assured faÃ§ade, she is a woman whose sexual repression is manifested in a long list of paraphilia, including (but by no means limited to) voyeurism and sadomasochistic fetishes such as sexual self-mutilation. When Erika meets Walter Klemmer, a charming 17-year-old engineering student from a middle class background, a mutual obsession develops. Even though she initially attempts to prevent consistent contact and even tries to undermine his application to the conservatory, he eventually becomes her pupil. Like her, he appreciates and is a gifted interpreter of Schumann and Schubert. Erika destroys the musical prospects of an insecure but talented girl, Anna Schober, driven by her jealousy of the girl's contact with Walterâand also, perhaps, by her fears that Anna's life will mirror her own. She does so by hiding shards of glass inside one of Anna's coat pockets, damaging her right hand and ruining her aspirations to play at the forthcoming jubilee concert. Erika then pretends to be sympathetic when Anna's mother asks for advice on her daughter's recuperation. (The sub-plot of the pupil and her mother, mirroring the main relationship in the film, is absent in Jelinek's novel.)

Erika finally responds to his passion, but insists on repeatedly controlling, humiliating and frustrating Walter.

Q:Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Alexis Pilkington was a popular 17-year-old and a well-liked athlete who had already won a soccer scholarship to college. But none of that stopped Alexis from becoming the target of online bullying . Alexis began to receive hundreds of online unpleasant comments via the latest social networking site called www.formspring.com. In March 2010, Alexis committed suicide and although all agreed that the online bother was not the single factor that led to Alexis' death, everyone did agree that it was a contributory factor. Unfortunately, Alexis' story is not unique. A 2010 study conducted by the Cyberbullying Research Center showed that cyberbullying victims were almost twice as likely to have attempted suicide compared to youth who had not experienced cyberbullying. Suicide is obviously the extreme and no one can minimize the tragedy of it. However, there are other damages that occur as a result of aggressive bullying. It can damage self-esteem and lead to feelings of worthlessness, and also increase social isolation and make victims become withdrawn, depressed, anxious, and insecure. So what causes girls to be so unkind towards each other? A term known as relational aggression may best describe the cause of girl-on-girl bullying. It starts with a clique usually led by a girl with a high level of social status and popularity. In order not to lose her position, she will control girls within the clique and take action if she feels threatened. At the leader's directive the girls within the clique will spread rumors and lies and annoy other girls continuously. The bullying starts at school but will quickly go to cyberbullying due to anonymity . Girls will easily do so in the anonymity of the Internet. Ultimately the cause will be summarized as the insecurity and jealousy of one girl and the twisted loyalty of members within her clique. Underneath the confident exterior of a female bully lie desperate insecurities. A:","completion":"What was a significant factor contributing to Alexis Pilkington's suicide according to the article?

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Norman Clifford Louis O'Neill OAM (19 February 1937 - 3 March 2008) was a cricketer who played for New South Wales and Australia. A right-handed batsman known for his back foot strokeplay, O'Neill made his state debut aged 18, before progressing to Test selection aged 21 in late 1958. Early in his career, O'Neill was one of the foremost batsmen in the Australian team, scoring three Test centuries and topping the run scoring aggregates on a 1959-60 tour of the Indian subcontinent which helped Australia win its last Test and series on Pakistani soil for 39 years, as well as another series in India. His career peaked in 1960-61 when he scored 181 in the Tied Test against the West Indies, and at the end of the series, had a career average of 58.25. Identified as a future Test prospect, he was selected in a Western Australia Combined XI for a match against the touring England cricket team at the start of the 1958-59 season in Perth. Prior to the match, O'Neill was hounded by the media. The tourists decided to test him with short-pitched bowling, especially Fred Trueman. O'Neill decided to abstain from hooking, while attacking the spin of Jim Laker with a series of sweep shots. After four and a half hours of uncharacteristic restraint, he compiled 104 with an emphasis on off side play. He took a total of 2/67, removing Fred Trueman and Arthur Milton. He scored 85 against Western Australia and then made 84 not out for New South Wales against England. He was selected for an Australian XI, which played the tourists in a dress rehearsal before the Tests. He made one and two as Australia were crushed by 345 runs. Nevertheless, O'Neill was selected to make his debut in the five-Test series against England, playing in all of the matches. The First Test in Brisbane was a low scoring match described by Australian captain Richie Benaud as producing \\"some of the slowest and worst cricket imaginable\\", O'Neill made 34 in Australia's first innings of 186 to help secure a lead of 52. He then top-scored with an unbeaten 71 in the second innings, guiding Australia to an eight-wicket victory. O'Neill scored 71 of the last 89 runs scored while he was at the crease, refusing to be dried up by the England's usage of leg theory. It enlivened a match plagued by time-wasting, and best remembered for a depressingly slow innings by England's Trevor Bailey, who scored 68 from 426 balls in seven and a half hours. England captain Peter May described O'Neill's innings as \\"sparkling\\" and said that it made \\"everything which had gone before look even more wretched\\". Retired English player Ian Peebles, writing in the Sunday Times, said \\"Although O'Neill is in the very early stages of his career, it is already something of an occasion when he comes to the wicket, and one can sense the expectancy of the crowd and the heightened tension of the opposition\\". Wisden opined that O'Neill had \\"saved a game that had been tortuous for days\\". For his part, O'Neill said that the dour play was \\"unbelievable\\" and that he was \\"just about falling to sleep\\" in the field. He struck 77 in the rain-affected drawn Third Test at the Sydney Cricket Ground and followed this with 56 in the Fourth Test in Adelaide. Despite making a duck in the Fifth Test, he ended the series as the second highest runscorer with 282 at 56.40 as Australia took the series 4-0. He bowled two overs without success. Outside the Tests, O'Neill scored 155 and 128 against Victoria and Western Australia respectively as New South Wales completed their sixth successive Sheffield Shield win.

The fetuses have been taken from the Phai-nguern Chotinaram temple in central Bangkok to the Chulongkorn Forensic Institute for investigation, police said. \\"I think [the fetuses were at the temple] because the new incinerators are under construction,\\" nearby resident Puak Eiamchan said. \\"So the temple can't receive any dead bodies to cremate for almost two months now.\\" \\"I believe that people who did this must have done it for some time and it was exposed because they can't burn the fetuses and they were accumulated to hundreds and the smell started to tell.\\" Abortion is illegal in Thailand, but women are allowed to one if they are the victims of rape, or if the pregnancy endangers the life of the mother, according to Pavena Hongskul, founder of the Pavena Foundation for Children and Women.

Question: Information: - The pond slider (\\"Trachemys scripta\\") is a common, medium-sized semi-aquatic turtle. There are three subspecies of sliders. The most recognizable subspecies is the red-eared slider (\\"T. s. elegans\\"), which is popular in the pet trade and has been introduced to other parts of the world by people releasing it to the wild. Baby and juvenile pond sliders have a green shell (carapace) and yellow green skin with dark green striped markings. Markings and colors fade in adults to a muted olive green to brown or orange carapace. Some individuals become almost black with few visible markings. The carapace is oval and flattened for females, round and complex for males. The underside of the shell is yellow with dark markings in the center of each scute, making it easier to determine their sex. However, the markings underside the shell fade as the turtle age. - A carapace is a dorsal (upper) section of the exoskeleton or shell in a number of animal groups, including arthropods, such as crustaceans and arachnids, as well as vertebrates, such as turtles and tortoises. In turtles and tortoises, the underside is called the plastron. - Organisms of many species are specialized into male and female varieties, each known as a sex, with some falling in between being intersex. Sexual reproduction involves the combining and mixing of genetic traits: specialized cells known as gametes combine to form offspring that inherit traits from each parent. Gametes can be identical in form and function (known as isogamy), but in many cases an asymmetry has evolved such that two sex-specific types of gametes (heterogametes) exist (known as anisogamy). - The red-eared slider (\\"Trachemys scripta elegans\\"), also known as the red-eared terrapin, is a semiaquatic turtle belonging to the family Emydidae. It is a subspecies of the pond slider. It is the most popular pet turtle in the United States and is also popular as a pet in the rest of the world. It has, therefore, become the most commonly traded turtle in the world. It is native to the southern United States and northern Mexico, but has become established in other places because of pet releases, and has become an invasive species in many areas, where it outcompetes native species. The red-eared slider is included in the list of the world's 100 most invasive species published by the IUCN. - Puerto Rico, (Spanish for \\"Rich Port\\") officially the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico (\\"Free Associated State of Puerto Rico\\") and briefly called Porto Rico, is an unincorporated territory of the United States located in the northeast Caribbean Sea. - The Puerto Rican slider ( Trachemys stejnegeri stejnegeri ) is found mainly in Puerto Rico and surrounding areas . It is a relative of the pond slider . - Bean is a common name for large seeds of several genera of the flowering plant family Fabaceae (also known as Leguminosae) which are used for human or animal food.

Does \\"Thus, in classical western philosophy the gender of this one-and-only deity is most likely to be an analogical statement of how humans and God address, and relate to, each other.\\" contain the correct answer to \\"In what ways can the gender of God be viewed?\\"","completion":"This statement does provide one perspective on the question of God's gender in the context of classical western philosophy. However, to provide a detailed and long answer, we should explore in-depth the various ways in which the gender of God has been viewed and debated among theologians, philosophers, and the general populace. 1. Anthropomorphic perspective: In many religious texts, including the Bible and the Qur'an, God is often described using anthropomorphic language, assigning human-like attributes such as gender, emotions, and actions. In these texts, God is frequently referred to using masculine pronouns and titles, such as \\"Father\\" and \\"Lord\\". However, this portrayal may be more a reflection of the patriarchal societies in which these texts arose, and not a definitive statement on the actual gender of God. 2. Feminist perspective: Feminist theologians have challenged the traditional masculine representation of God and called for more inclusive language, as well as exploring the historical and cultural reasons for the predominance of male imagery in religious texts. They argue that presenting God as male can lead to a belief that men are considered superior or more divine than women. The feminist perspective seeks to highlight the feminine aspects of the divine, such as the concept of wisdom in ancient philosophy (Sophia in Greek) and the many female deities found in ancient religions. 3. Gender-neutral perspective: Some thinkers advocate for recognizing God as a gender-neutral or androgynous divinity, transcending gender roles and human understanding of binaries. In this view, God can be understood as encompassing and transcending the full range of human characteristics, incorporating masculine, feminine, and gender-neutral aspects. This can be supported by scriptures that describe God as beyond human conception or categorization. 4. Metaphorical perspective: Some philosophers argue that applying human concepts of gender to God is inherently limiting and not theologically necessary. Instead, they suggest that the language used to describe God in religious texts should be seen as metaphorical or symbolic, emphasizing the deeper truth about the nature of God and the divine-human relationship rather than making literal assertions about God's gender. This would align with the quote in question, suggesting that the gender of God may be \\"an analogical statement of how humans and God address, and relate to, each other.\\" 5. Pantheon perspective: In polytheistic traditions, such as ancient Greek and Roman religions, the gender of individual gods and goddesses is often clearly defined, representing various aspects of nature, human experiences, and society. In these religions, the division of divine attributes between male and female deities does not imply a strict gender hierarchy but rather serves as a reflection of human culture and the forces at work in life. 6. Personal perspective: Finally, it is worth noting that people's experiences, sentiments, and preferences may shape their individual views on the gender of God. Some believers may feel more connected to a feminine image of the divine or more inclined to address God in gender-neutral terms. In this sense, the gender of God, and the way we talk or think about it, can be deeply personal and subjective. In conclusion, the gender of God can be viewed from multiple angles, ranging from traditional anthropomorphic portrayals, feminist reinterpretation, and gender-neutral advocacy, to metaphorical understanding, polytheistic diversity, and personal preference. Nevertheless, it is essential to recognize that our understanding of the divine is contingent on human imagination and language, and any discussion of God's gender should be approached with nuance, humility, and openness to differing perspectives."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The hypothesis, \\"The dirt biker falls off the ramp,\\" is connected to the premise as it deals with the same subject (the dirt biker and the ramp) but explores the potential outcome of the dirt biker's actions. To determine if the premise tells us whether the hypothesis is true, we need to analyze if the information provided in the premise is enough to establish a clear connection or if it leads us to conclude the hypothesis. The premise states that the dirt biker successfully lands on a ramp, which indicates that they have reached the ramp's surface, but it does not provide further details on what happens afterward. For instance, we don't know if the biker maintains control after landing, if they successfully navigate the ramp, or if any external factors like terrain, weather, or crowd distractions could affect their performance. The hypothesis, on the other hand, presents an undesirable outcome, which is the dirt biker falling off the ramp. This hypothesis is plausible because various factors could cause the dirt biker to fall off the ramp, such as losing balance or control, improper landing, equipment malfunction, or other circumstances. However, based on the given premise, we do not have enough evidence or context to support or refute the hypothesis. Therefore, the premise does not tell us whether the hypothesis is true. Without additional information that explicitly connects the dirt biker's landing with the possibility of falling off the ramp or the biker's actions after landing, we cannot conclusively ascertain if the hypothesis is true or false. The premise only introduces us to the situation, while the hypothesis explores a potential outcome that may or may not happen.

Read this: Until recently, in the absence of prior agreement on a clear and precise definition, the concept was thought to mean (as a shorthand) 'a division of sovereignty between two levels of government'. New research, however, argues that this cannot be correct, as dividing sovereignty - when this concept is properly understood in its core meaning of the final and absolute source of political authority in a political community - is not possible. The descent of the United States into Civil War in the mid-nineteenth century, over disputes about unallocated competences concerning slavery and ultimately the right of secession, showed this. One or other level of government could be sovereign to decide such matters, but not both simultaneously. Therefore, it is now suggested that federalism is more appropriately conceived as 'a division of the powers flowing from sovereignty between two levels of government'. What differentiates the concept from other multi-level political forms is the characteristic of equality of standing between the two levels of government established. This clarified definition opens the way to identifying two distinct federal forms, where before only one was known, based upon whether sovereignty resides in the whole (in one people) or in the parts (in many peoples): the federal state (or federation) and the federal union of states (or federal union), respectively. Leading examples of the federal state include the United States, Germany, Canada, Switzerland, Australia and India. The leading example of the federal union of states is the European Union.

Question: what is the second to last product mentioned? Context: In 1931, RCA Victor introduced their vinyl-based Victrolac compound as a material for some unusual-format and special-purpose records. By the end of the 1930s vinyl's advantages of light weight, relative unbreakability and low surface noise had made it the material of choice for prerecorded radio programming and other critical applications. When it came to ordinary 78 rpm records, however, the much higher cost of the raw material, as well as its vulnerability to the heavy pickups and crudely mass-produced steel needles still commonly used in home record players, made its general substitution for shellac impractical at that time. During the Second World War, the United States Armed Forces produced thousands of 12-inch vinyl 78 rpm V-Discs for use by the troops overseas. After the war, the wider use of vinyl became more practical as new record players with relatively lightweight crystal pickups and precision-ground styli made of sapphire or an exotic osmium alloy proliferated. In late 1945, RCA Victor began offering special transparent red vinyl De Luxe pressings of some classical 78s, at a de luxe price. Later, Decca Records introduced vinyl Deccalite 78s, while other record companies came up with vinyl concoctions such as Metrolite, Merco Plastic and Sav-o-flex, but these were mainly used to produce \\"unbreakable\\" children's records and special thin vinyl DJ pressings for shipment to radio stations.

Harriette M. Hoyt, of Sayre, was charged with felony attempted second-degree murder, according to the Elmira Police Department. She put her daughter in a white plastic bag and abandoned her near bushes in the back yard of a residence in the 600 block of Walnut Street, court records state. The infant girl, who was at an out-of-town hospital Tuesday, was discovered about 1 p.m. Tuesday by neighbors who heard what sounded like a cat crying outside a residence in the 600 block of Walnut Street, according to media partner WENY-TV. Then they saw the girl's feet sticking out of the bag. \\"Her legs were just dangling in the bag, her head was in the bag, her whole head was covered all the way down. I tore it,\\" Kayla Seals, who rescued the girl, told WENY. The neighbor said the child was filthy and covered in waste. After taking her out of the bag, they called the police and cleaned her up. The infant was transported to a local hospital for evaluation and treatment. Although she was in stable condition, she was transported to another out-of-town hospital for further evaluation. Police credited neighbors for rushing to alert authorities and rescue the child. \\"Obviously, it's very heroic on their part to render aid, immediately get inside, as you would expect any decent human being to do,\\" Elmira Police Sgt.

They say the teen has been arraigned in Elmira City Court and is facing attempted murder charges. \\"You ain't got no right to do that to that baby. Ain't no right. And it really hurt my feelings. And I ain't got no kids, and you do that to a child, Lord,\\" says Karen Seals, who noticed the bag moving Tuesday afternoon. Around 1:00 p.m., Elmira Police responded to a home on the 600 block of Walnut Street after a child had been found inside a plastic bag outside. \\"Our officers responded and we did locate a small infant child approximately 12 - 16 months old that had apparently been abandoned behind a residence here,\\" says Sgt. William Solt, with EPD. Police say the neighbors who found the baby girl began to give her aid until emergency personnel arrived on scene. \\"The good samaritans who found the child brought it inside, tried washing it up and immediately called 911. They rendered as much first aid as possible until emergency responders could arrive on scene. The child was immediately transferred to a local hospital and is currently in stable condition,\\" Sgt. Solt says. While the child was found Tuesday afternoon, police say she may have been left in the plastic bag overnight. \\"Estimates of how long the baby was outside vary. We do believe that it's more than 12 hours at this point. We have people who said they thought they heard noises last evening. So there's no way to confirm this because, like I said, the child wasn't found until today,\\" says Sgt. Solt. The neighbors who made the initial discovery describe hearing odd noises, first thinking it may be an animal in distress. \\"My sister came out off the porch and went to the side to the backyard of my neighbor's house with a stick, thinking it was a dog. We thought it was a dog honey, and it wasn't. It was a baby!\\" Karen Seals says. \\"I was going to go poke it to see what it was. I dropped that stick, looked down. I dropped it so fast, I walked up and I seen my baby - I'm calling it my baby - the baby, a little girl. Her legs were just dangling in the bag, her head was in the bag, her whole head was covered all the way down. I tore it,\\" says Karen's sister, Kayla Seals, who rescued the baby girl.

Question: Joe found that shopping was dangerous for him. Even though he had a great job, or maybe because of it, he found himself doing this a great deal. There were always funds left over, but not enough for his taste. What was he doing when he was shopping? Choices: - overspending - loss of money - run out of money - spending money - deficit The rationale to choose \\"overspending\\" as the answer is that: The answer to this question is:","completion":"overspending. The rationale behind choosing \\"overspending\\" as the answer can be understood by closely analyzing the information given in the question and eliminating the other options systematically. Firstly, the question states that \\"Joe found that shopping was dangerous for him,\\" indicating that there is a negative aspect associated with his shopping habits. Moreover, it is mentioned that \\"he found himself doing this a great deal,\\" which suggests that the negative aspect is a repetitive, habitual behavior. Now let us examine the other choices and understand why they are not the correct answer: 1. Loss of money: The term \\"loss of money\\" suggests an unplanned expenditure or a financial loss, which might be a one-time or occasional occurrence. However, Joe's issue is with shopping, and the question emphasizes his repetitive behavior. Loss of money doesn't necessarily imply a repetitive habit tied to shopping, disqualifying it as the correct answer. 2. Run out of money: This choice is not the correct answer because the question clearly states that Joe has a great job, which implies that he has a stable income. Additionally, the question mentions that \\"there were always funds left over,\\" implying that he does not completely run out of money due to his shopping. 3. Spending money: This option does not highlight the negative aspect associated with Joe's shopping habit. It only states the obvious, which is that Joe spends money while shopping. However, it fails to address the \\"dangerous\\" aspect that the question emphasizes. 4. Deficit: The term \\"deficit\\" suggests a shortage or lack of something. Although it could imply a financial deficit due to shopping, the question states, \\"there were always funds left over.\\" Thus, Joe's situation does not align with the concept of a deficit, making this choice incorrect. Now that we have eliminated the other options, we can assert that the answer is, indeed, \\"overspending.\\" The rationale for choosing \\"overspending\\" lies in the fact that it directly addresses the negative aspect of Joe's shopping habits – spending more money than necessary on a consistent basis. This aligns with the information provided in the question, as Joe's \\"great job\\" might enable him to spend more than he should, leading to the danger associated with his shopping. Furthermore, it explains why there are still some leftover funds, but \\"not enough for his taste,\\" indicating that Joe would prefer to have more money available after his shopping sprees, but his overspending habit hinders this."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Canadian described the London 2012 Olympic Games as \\"corrupted on an unprecedented scale\\". Collins, chairman of the Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee, added: \\"It does taint the London Games.

The severe allegations have prompted concerns over the upcoming FIFA World Cup in Russia, with voices like that of Collins suggesting that FIFA seriously reconsider the arrangements. The veracity and compliance of anti-doping measures that will be in place during the World Cup have been called into question, shedding doubt on Russia's overall sporting integrity. Despite Russia's Sports Ministry denying the claims, evidence suggests that the doping was state-sanctioned and systematic. The report implied that the doping system was planned and executed under the authority and support of the Russian government, thereby tainting the image of past sporting events like the London 2012 Olympic Games. One prominent figure under scrutiny is Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko, who was the sports minister during the period detailed in the McLaren report. Mutko is seeking re-election to the FIFA ruling committee, raising concerns over the role of Russian sports administrators who may be implicated in this scandal.

There are about 445 living Indo-European languages, according to the estimate by \\"Ethnologue\\", with over two-thirds (313) of them belonging to the Indo-Iranian branch. The most widely spoken Indo-European languages by native speakers are Spanish, English, Hindustani (Hindi and Urdu), Portuguese, Bengali, Russian, Persian and Punjabi, each with over 100 million speakers. Today, 46% of the human population speaks an Indo-European language natively, by far the highest of any language family. - Opera (English plural: \\"operas\\"; Italian plural: \\"opere\\" ) is an art form in which singers and musicians perform a dramatic work combining text (libretto) and musical score, usually in a theatrical setting. In traditional opera, singers do two types of singing: recitative, a speech-inflected style and arias, a more melodic style. Opera incorporates many of the elements of spoken theatre, such as acting, scenery, and costumes and sometimes includes dance. The performance is typically given in an opera house, accompanied by an orchestra or smaller musical ensemble, which since the early 19th century has been led by a conductor. - A cultural movement is a change in the way a number of different disciplines approach their work. This embodies all art forms, the sciences, and philosophies. Historically, different nations or regions of the world have gone through their own independent sequence of movements in culture, but as world communications have accelerated this geographical distinction has become less distinct. When cultural movements go through revolutions from one to the next, genres tend to get attacked and mixed up, and often new genres are generated and old ones fade. These changes are often reactions against the prior cultural form, which typically has grown stale and repetitive. An obsession emerges among the mainstream with the new movement, and the old one falls into neglect - sometimes it dies out entirely, but often it chugs along favored in a few disciplines and occasionally making reappearances (sometimes prefixed with \\"neo-\\"). - A manuscript (abbreviated MS for singular and MSS for plural) is any document written by hand or typewritten, as opposed to being mechanically printed or reproduced in some automated way. More recently, it is understood to be an author's written, typed, or word-processed copy of a work, as distinguished from the print of the same. Before the arrival of printing, all documents and books were manuscripts. Manuscripts are not defined by their contents, which may combine writing with mathematical calculations, maps, explanatory figures or illustrations. Manuscripts may be in book form, scrolls or in codex format. Illuminated manuscripts are enriched with pictures, border decorations, elaborately embossed initial letters or full-page illustrations. - A troubadour was a composer and performer of Old Occitan lyric poetry during the High Middle Ages (11001350). Since the word \\"troubadour\\" is etymologically masculine, a female troubadour is usually called a trobairitz. - The mass market is the largest group of end consumers for a specified product. It is the opposite of the term niche market. - Musical theatre is a form of theatrical performance that combines songs, spoken dialogue, acting, and dance. The story and emotional content of a musical humor, pathos, love, anger are communicated through the words, music, movement and technical aspects of the entertainment as an integrated whole. Although musical theatre overlaps with other theatrical forms like opera and dance, it may be distinguished by the equal importance given to the music as compared with the dialogue, movement and other elements. Since the early 20th century, musical theatre stage works have generally been called, simply, musicals. - A composer (Latin \\"compn\\"; literally \\"one who puts together\\") is a person who creates or writes music, which can be vocal music (for a singer or choir), instrumental music (e.g., for solo piano, string quartet, wind quintet or orchestra) or music which combines both instruments and voices (e.g., opera or art song, which is a singer accompanied by a pianist). The core meaning of the term refers to individuals who have contributed to the tradition of Western classical music through creation of works expressed in written musical notation (e.g., sheet music scores). - A chansonnier (, Galician and , ) is a manuscript or printed book which contains a collection of chansons, or polyphonic and monophonic settings of songs, hence literally \\"song-books,\\" although some manuscripts are so called even though they preserve the text but not the music (for example, the Cancioneiro da Vaticana and Cancioneiro da Biblioteca Nacional, which contain the bulk of Galician-Portuguese lyric). The most important chansonniers contain lyrics, poems and songs of the troubadours and trouvères of the Middle Ages. Prior to 1420, many song-books contained both sacred and secular music, one exception being those containing the work of Guillaume de Machaut. Around 1420, sacred and secular music was segregated into separate sources, with large choirbooks containing sacred music, and smaller chansonniers for more private use by the privileged. Chansonniers were compiled primarily in France, but also in Italy, Germany and in the Iberian peninsula. - The classical Latin alphabet, also known as the Roman alphabet, is a writing system originally used by the ancient Romans to write the Latin language. The Latin alphabet evolved from the visually similar Cumaean Greek version of the Greek alphabet, which was itself descended from the Phoenician abjad, which in turn was derived from Egyptian hieroglyphics. The Etruscans who ruled early Rome adopted the Cumaean Greek alphabet which was modified over time to become the Etruscan alphabet, which was in turn adopted and further modified by the Romans to produce the Latin alphabet. - An art song is a vocal music composition, usually written for one voice with piano accompaniment, and usually in the classical art music tradition. By extension, the term \\"art song\\" is used to refer to the collective genre of such songs (e.g., the \\"art song repertoire\\"). An art song is most often a musical setting of an independent poem or text, \\"intended for the concert repertory\\" \\"as part of a recital or other relatively formal social occasion\\". While many pieces of vocal music are easily recognized as art songs, others are more difficult to categorize. For example, a wordless vocalise written by a classical composer is sometimes considered an art song and sometimes not. - Latin (Latin: ) is a classical language belonging to the Italic branch of the Indo-European languages. The Latin alphabet is derived from the Etruscan and Greek alphabets. - A classical language is a language with a literature that is \\"classical\\". According to UC Berkeley linguist George L. Hart, \\"it should be ancient, it should be an independent tradition that arose mostly on its own, not as an offshoot of another tradition, and it must have a large and extremely rich body of ancient literature.\\" - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries. - Music is an art form and cultural activity whose medium is sound and silence, which exist in time. The common elements of music are pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the \\"color\\" of a musical sound). Different styles or types of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs without instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and instruments. The word derives from Greek (\\"mousike\\"; \\"art of the Muses\\"). In its most general form, the activities describing music as an art form include the production of works of music (songs, tunes, symphonies, and so on), the criticism of music, the study of the history of music, and the aesthetic examination of music. Ancient Greek and Indian philosophers defined music as tones ordered horizontally as melodies and vertically as harmonies. Common sayings such as \\"the harmony of the spheres\\" and \\"it is music to my ears\\" point to the notion that music is often ordered and pleasant to listen to. However, 20th-century composer John Cage thought that any sound can be music, saying, for example, \\"There is no noise, only sound.\\" - A song, most broadly, is a single (and often standalone) work of music that is typically intended to be sung by the human voice with distinct and fixed pitches and patterns using sound and silence and a variety of forms that often include the repetition of sections. Written words created specifically for music or for which music is specifically created, are called lyrics. If a pre-existing poem is set to composed music in classical music it is an art song. Songs that are sung on repeated pitches without distinct contours and patterns that rise and fall are called chants. Songs in a simple style that are learned informally are often referred to as folk songs. Songs that are composed for professional singers who sell their recordings or live shows to the mass market are called popular songs. These songs, which have broad appeal, are often composed by professional songwriters, composers and lyricists. Art songs are composed by trained classical composers for concert or recital performances. Songs are performed live and recorded on audio or video (or in some, cases, a song may be performed live and simultaneously recorded). Songs may also appear in plays, musical theatre, stage shows of any form, and within operas. - France, officially the French Republic, is a country with territory in western Europe and several overseas regions and territories. The European, or metropolitan, area of France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea, and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean. Overseas France include French Guiana on the South American continent and several island territories in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans. France spans and had a total population of almost 67 million people as of January 2017. It is a unitary semi-presidential republic with the capital in Paris, the country's largest city and main cultural and commercial centre. Other major urban centres include Marseille, Lyon, Lille, Nice, Toulouse and Bordeaux. - Trouvère, sometimes spelled trouveur , is the Northern French (langue d'oïl) form of the langue d'oc (Occitan) word \\"trobador\\". It refers to poet-composers who were roughly contemporary with and influenced by the troubadours (composers and performers of Old Occitan lyric poetry during the High Middle Ages) but who composed their works in the northern dialects of France. The first known \\"trouvère\\" was Chrétien de Troyes (\\"fl\\". 1160s-1180s) (Butterfield, 1997) and the \\"trouvères\\" continued to flourish until about 1300. Some 2130 \\"trouvère\\" poems have survived; of these, at least two-thirds have melodies. - Classical music is art music produced or rooted in the traditions of Western music, including both liturgical (religious) and secular music. While a more accurate term is also used to refer to the period from 1750 to 1820 (the Classical period), this article is about the broad span of time from roughly the 11th century to the present day, which includes the Classical period and various other periods. The central norms of this tradition became codified between 1550 and 1900, which is known as the common-practice period. The major time divisions of Western art music are as follows: European art music is largely distinguished from many other non-European and some popular musical forms by its system of staff notation, in use since about the 16th century. Western staff notation is used by composers to indicate to the performer the pitches (e.g., melodies, basslines, chords), tempo, meter and rhythms for a piece of music. This can leave less room for practices such as improvisation and \\"ad libitum\\" ornamentation, which are frequently heard in non-European art music and in popular-music styles such as jazz and blues. Another difference is that whereas most popular styles adopt the song (strophic) form, classical music has been noted for its development of highly sophisticated forms of instrumental music such as the concerto, symphony, sonata, and mixed vocal and instrumental styles such as opera which, since they are written down, can sustain larger forms and attain a high level of complexity. - In the Middle Ages, the Galician-Portuguese lyric, sometimes called trovadorismo in Portugal and trobadorismo in Galicia, was a lyric poetic school or movement. All told, there are around 1680 texts in the so-called secular lyric or \\"lírica profana\\" (see Cantigas de Santa Maria for the religious lyric). At the time Galician-Portuguese was the language used in nearly all of Iberia for lyric (as opposed to epic) poetry. From this language derives both modern Galician and Portuguese. The school, which was influenced to some extent (mainly in certain formal aspects) by the Occitan troubadours, is first documented at the end of the twelfth century and lasted until the middle of the fourteenth, with its zenith coming in the middle of the thirteenth century, centered on the person of Alfonso X, \\"The Wise King\\". It is the earliest known poetic movement in Galicia or Portugal and represents not only the beginnings of but one of the high points of poetic history in both countries and in Medieval Europe. Modern Galicia has seen a revival movement called Neotrobadorismo. - The Cancioneiro da Vaticana (, Vatican Songbook) is a compilation of troubadour lyrics in Galician-Portuguese. It was discovered c. 1840 in the holdings of the Vatican Library and was first transcribed by D. Caetano Lopes de Moura in 1847, sponsored by Viscount of Carreira, end again by Ernesto Monaci in 1875. - A chanson ( French pronunciation : ( s ) , \`\` song '' , from Latin cantio , gen. cantionis ) is in general any lyric - driven French song , usually polyphonic and secular . A singer specializing in chansons is known as a \`\` chanteur '' ( male ) or \`\` chanteuse '' ( female ) ; a collection of chansons , especially from the late Middle Ages and Renaissance , is also known as a chansonnier . - Lyrics are words that make up a song usually consisting of verses and choruses. The writer of lyrics is a lyricist. The words to an extended musical composition such as an opera are, however, usually known as a \\"libretto\\" and their writer, as a \\"librettist\\". The meaning of lyrics can either be explicit or implicit. Some lyrics are abstract, almost unintelligible, and, in such cases, their explication emphasizes form, articulation, meter, and symmetry of expression. Rappers can also create lyrics with a variation of rhyming words or words that create and tell a story or song. - The Cancioneiro da Biblioteca Nacional (, \\"The National Library Songbook\\"), commonly called Colocci-Brancuti, is a compilation of Galician-Portuguese lyrics by both troubadours and \\"jograes\\" (non-noble performers and composers) . These \\"cantigas\\" (songs) are classified, following indications in the poems themselves and in the manuscript tradition, into three main genres: \\"cantigas de amigo\\" (female-voiced love songs, about a boyfriend), \\"cantigas de amor\\" (male-voiced love songs) and \\"cantigas de escárnio e mal-dizer\\" (songs of mockery and insult). - Germany, officially the Federal Republic of Germany, is a federal parliamentary republic in central-western Europe. It includes 16 constituent states, covers an area of , and has a largely temperate seasonal climate. With about 82 million inhabitants, Germany is the most populous member state of the European Union. After the United States, it is the second most popular immigration destination in the world. Germany's capital and largest metropolis is Berlin. Other major cities include Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and Düsseldorf. - The Renaissance was a period in European history, from the 14th to the 17th century, regarded as the cultural bridge between the Middle Ages and modern history. It started as a cultural movement in Italy in the Late Medieval period and later spread to the rest of Europe, marking the beginning of the Early Modern Age. - A songwriter is an individual who writes the lyrics, melodies and chord progressions for songs, typically for a popular music genre such as rock or country music. A songwriter can also be called a composer, although the latter term tends to be used mainly for individuals from the classical music genre. The pressure from the music industry to produce popular hits means that songwriting is often an activity for which the tasks are distributed between a number of people. For example, a songwriter who excels at writing lyrics might be paired with a songwriter with a gift for creating original melodies. Pop songs may be written by group members from the band or by staff writers songwriters directly employed by music publishers. Some songwriters serve as their own music publishers, while others have outside publishers. - In the history of Europe, the Middle Ages or medieval period lasted from the 5th to the 15th century. It began with the fall of the Western Roman Empire and merged into the Renaissance and the Age of Discovery. The Middle Ages is the middle period of the three traditional divisions of Western history: classical antiquity, the medieval period, and the modern period. The medieval period is itself subdivided into the Early, High, and Late Middle Ages. - History (from Greek , \\"historia\\", meaning \\"inquiry, knowledge acquired by investigation\\") is the study of the past as it is described in written documents. Events occurring before written record are considered prehistory. It is an umbrella term that relates to past events as well as the memory, discovery, collection, organization, presentation, and interpretation of information about these events. Scholars who write about history are called historians. - The Greek alphabet has been used to write the Greek language since the late 9th century BC or early 8th century BC It was derived from the earlier Phoenician alphabet, and was the first alphabetic script to have distinct letters for vowels as well as consonants. It is the ancestor of the Latin and Cyrillic scripts. Apart from its use in writing the Greek language, in both its ancient and its modern forms, the Greek alphabet today also serves as a source of technical symbols and labels in many domains of mathematics, science and other fields. - Italy, officially the Italian Republic, is a unitary parliamentary republic in Europe. Located in the heart of the Mediterranean Sea, Italy shares open land borders with France, Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia, San Marino and Vatican City. Italy covers an area of and has a largely temperate seasonal climate and Mediterranean climate; due to its shape, it is often referred to in Italy as \\"lo Stivale\\" (the Boot). With 61 million inhabitants, it is the fourth most populous EU member state. - Guillaume de Machaut (sometimes spelled Machault; c. 1300 April 1377) was a medieval French poet and composer. He is one of the earliest composers on whom significant biographical information is available. According to Daniel Leech-Wilkinson, Machaut was \\"the last great poet who was also a composer\\". Well into the 15th century, Machaut's poetry was greatly admired and imitated by other poets, including Geoffrey Chaucer.

Prior to 1420, many song-books contained both sacred and secular music, one exception being those containing the work of Guillaume de Machaut. Around 1420, sacred and secular music was segregated into separate sources, with large choirbooks containing sacred music, and smaller chansonniers for more private use by the privileged. Chansonniers were compiled primarily in France, but also in Italy, Germany, and in the Iberian peninsula. A chanson is a French polyphonic or secular song, usually lyric-driven, that is sometimes also referred to as a genre. In general, a chanson is any song in the French language, typically composed for a singer or choir. Chansons are often performed in a chansonnier, a collection of chansons, particularly those created during the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. The term \\"chanson\\" can also refer to an art song, which is a vocal music composition in the classical art music tradition, typically written for one voice with piano accompaniment. Chansonniers were significant repositories of the poetic and musical works of their time. They preserved the texts and melodies of troubadours and trouvères, two categories of poets and composers who were known for their lyric poetry during the High Middle Ages. While there are many surviving chansonniers, some of the most notable ones include the Cancioneiro da Vaticana, the Cancioneiro da Biblioteca Nacional, and the chansonnier of Guillaume de Machaut. These songbooks provide valuable insight into the artistic and cultural practices of their time and offer a window into the rich history of music and poetry in medieval Europe."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

They entered the Meadowlands against a New York Giants team trying to gain momentum that could lead them to a playoff spot. Hoping they could capitalize off the Saints loss, the Giants' first drive saw a 55-yard touchdown pass from Eli Manning to Plaxico Burress. The Saints' offense opened with a three-and-out, but they successfully recovered their punt. A field goal narrowed the score to 7-3. A subsequent Saints drive ended with another field goal. With 10:30 left in the second quarter, the Saints directed a huge, time-eating drive that ended with a touchdown on fourth-down with just 1:56 left in the half. Seven minutes into the third quarter, Reggie Bush sped past the Giants' linebacker corps and scored on a one-yard touchdown, to lengthen the score to 20-7. In the middle of the third quarter, Reggie Bush returned a punt, fell onto his knees (but because nobody touched him he was not down by contact), and he then ran the ball in for a touchdown. However, a challenge revealed that the Giants' punter just barely nicked the leg of Bush, and he was ruled down by contact. Early in the fourth quarter, Deuce McAllister ran it in for the final touchdown of the day, and John Carney sealed it with a 38-yard field goal. The Saints defense was stout throughout the game, shutting out the Giants after their opening touchdown, and never allowing the Giants to run a play in their territory. With the win, the Saints improved to 10-5. The following day, the Dallas Cowboys fell to the revitalized, Jeff Garcia-led Philadelphia Eagles, and the Saints secured the #2 spot in the NFC, and a first-round bye.

Choices: -- install window insulation film, seal with a hair dryer -- install window insulation washer fluid, seal with a hair dryer","completion":"To winterize your windows effectively, the first method, \\"install window insulation film, seal with a hair dryer,\\" makes more sense and is the more commonly used approach. Here is a detailed guide on how you can do this: 1. Gather Your Supplies: The first step to winterizing your windows with insulation film is to gather your supplies. What you'll need includes the insulation film itself (which is often sold in kits with enough material for multiple windows), a pair of scissors, a tape measure, a utility knife, and a hairdryer. 2. Measure Your Window: Before you cut your insulation film, you need to measure your window. Measure both the height and width, and then add an extra inch to each measurement. 3. Cut Insulation Film: After you've taken the measurements, unroll your film on a clean, flat surface and cut it according to the measurements you have. 4. Clean the Window Surface: Before applying the film, make sure to clean the window surface thoroughly. Dirty windows can hinder the adhesive tape from sticking properly. 5. Apply Double-Sided Tape: Once your window is clean and dry, install the double-sided tape around the outside of the window frame. It's important to apply the tape around the perimeter of the glass, ensuring that the film stays flattened against the window. 6. Attach Insulation Film: Carefully stick the edge of the film to one corner of the window, using the tape to hold it in place. Slowly unfold the film, pressing it onto the tape around the whole window. Do your best to avoid wrinkles and creases. 7. Tighten Film with Hair Dryer: Lastly, use a hair dryer on a low heat setting to \\"seal\\" the film. Move in about a two-inch distance around the edges of the window, slowly moving from the top of the window to the bottom. This will tighten the film, improving its insulating properties by creating an air pocket. The options given do not include \\"install window insulation washer fluid\\" as it's not a recognized or effective window winterizing method. Washer fluid is typically used in vehicle maintenance and is not designed or suitable for home window insulation purposes. The principle behind window insulation film is to create an additional insulating layer of air between the window and the room, thereby reducing heat transfer and helping to maintain a more comfortable temperature in the room. Using a hair dryer to seal the film helps create this insulating layer. Therefore, the first option of installing window insulation film and sealing with a hair dryer is the best and most conventional method to winterize windows."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The first night of filming at the Thornbury Bowls Club was for a test shoot with mine and Rosie’s camera, to work out which one we wanted to use for her film. The second night of filming involved us getting establishing shots of the location. The third night of filming involved us mainly shooting Rosie’s script. And the fourth night of shooting involved us mainly shooting Bell’s script and getting any other shots we needed to get. Perhaps we didn’t need an entire night of filming just to get establishing shots and filler shots, but it certainly made it a lot easier having multiple shots to choose from. For the two nights of shooting we certainly didn’t get that much coverage, which meant in the edit we were somewhat stuck using certain shots because we didn’t have other options. This was mainly because of time limitations with actors and batteries on cameras dying and such. I’m so neurotic I would have happily spent two nights shooting establishing shots and filler shots and two nights on each shoot, but not everyone wants to rearrange the rest of their life to fit around such projects.

Article: Dash cam video of Zachary Hammond shooting On July 26, 2015, 19-year-old Zachary Hammond, of Seneca, was shot and killed by Lt. Mark Tiller of the Seneca Police Department. SLED closed its investigation of the shooting and recommended that no charges should be filed against Tiller. ||||| Lieutenant Mark Tiller, who shot and killed the 19-year-old in South Carolina in July 2015, fired from Seneca police force for unspecified reason A police officer who was not charged in the shooting death of an unarmed South Carolina teenager is being fired from the force more than a year after the incident. Zachary Hammond shooting: officer who killed teen avoids criminal charges Read more The family of Zachary Hammond, who was 19 when he was shot and killed by Lieutenant Mark Tiller in July 2015, said they had “never lost hope” of such an outcome. Seneca police chief John Covington said in a short statement that Tiller was being terminated and would stay on the payroll until Friday. He refused to give a reason, calling it a personnel matter. A state prosecutor did not press charges against Tiller for the killing of Hammond, saying while Tiller might have made a bad decision in heading toward Hammond’s moving car, the officer had less than three seconds to react and broke no law. Hammond was killed while driving away from a drug sting operation. A dashboard recording showed that the teen was shot from the side as he passed the officer. The FBI and US justice department are still investigating the case. Hammond’s family, who in March reached a 2.15m settlement with the city of Seneca, released a statement saying they were glad Tiller would no longer be a police officer. “After Zachary’s death, the Hammonds placed their faith in the justice system and were hoping that Lieutenant Tiller was going to have to answer for his actions and the decisions he made which resulted in such a senseless death,” the statement said. “With each passing day the Hammonds never lost hope that Lieutenant Tiller would in the future never again have the highest honor of serving the public as a police officer, wear the uniform and carry a weapon. It appears that today is such a day.” ||||| Video A South Carolina police lieutenant who fatally shot a 19-year-old man during an attempted drug arrest in a Hardee’s parking lot last year has been fired from his job, the police chief said. The officer contended that he was acting in self-defense when the suspect drove a car toward him. John Covington, the chief of the police in Seneca, S.C., said in an emailed statement on Monday that Lt. Mark Tiller had been terminated from his position on the force. In the statement, which was sent over the weekend to local media including The State newspaper, Chief Covington gave no reason for the termination and declined to answer further questions on what he called a personnel matter. The lieutenant’s final day on the payroll will be Sept. 9, he said. Lt. Tiller had been on paid administrative leave since the shooting, which took place on July 26, 2015, during a sting operation targeting a 19-year-old man, Zachary Hammond, and a female companion. Police officers suspected a drug deal, and Lt. Tiller used his patrol car to block Mr. Hammond’s vehicle when he pulled into a Hardee’s parking lot. According to an Oconee County coroner’s report, Lt. Tiller then “felt threatened” as Mr. Hammond drove his car toward him. The officer fired two shots through the open window on the driver’s side, striking Mr. Hammond once in the shoulder and once fatally in the chest, the report said. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Prosecutors declined to press charges against Lt. Tiller, saying a dashboard video of the shooting supported his contention that he believed he was going to be run over. The officer, who had not faced any disciplinary action since he started working with the Seneca police in 2010, was put on leave while under investigation by the Justice Department for possible civil rights violations. The video elevated the shooting in Seneca, a town of about 8,000 people in the northwest part of the state, into the national debate about police conduct that spread after the fatal shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., in August 2014. Unlike that case, in which a white policeman killed an unarmed black man, both the officer and Mr. Hammond were white. Even so, supporters said the case was yet another example of questionable police behavior that had shaken communities around the country. The Seneca case also rejuvenated calls for police to wear body cameras, and the department was criticized for letting the situation evolve from an effort to trap his companion into selling a small amount of marijuana. A lawyer for Lt. Tiller, John M. Mussetto, said the department had been “very tight lipped” about the reasons for his client’s termination from the force and said it made “no sense” after the state determined there was no basis to press criminal charges. “After many years of service in law enforcement, it is unfortunate that Lt. Tiller was given such short notice,” he said. “Lt. Tiller looks forward the day when he can share his account of the unfortunate July 2015 incident.” Eric S. Bland, a lawyer for the Hammond family, had urged the news media to treat the killing of Mr. Hammond as they had shootings of unarmed black men. Advertisement Continue reading the main story On Saturday, after the termnation was first announced, Mr. Bland said Chief Covington’s decision was “admirable.” “As one would suspect, the last year has been extremely difficult for the Hammond Family,” he said in an email. “One of the nagging questions for the Hammond Family was how could Lt. Tiller remain employed after Chief Covington and the City Administration saw the video of Zachary’s killing,” he said. “Today, that question was answered.” In March this year, the Hammond family agreed to a 2.15 million settlement to drop their lawsuit against the police. ||||| Rating is available when the video has been rented.

Background: The Joker is a fictional supervillain created by Bill Finger, Bob Kane, and Jerry Robinson who first appeared in the debut issue of the comic book Batman (April 25, 1940), published by DC Comics. Credit for the Joker's creation is disputed; Kane and Robinson claimed responsibility for the Joker's design, while acknowledging Finger's writing contribution. Although the Joker was planned to be killed off during his initial appearance, he was spared by editorial intervention, allowing the character to endure as the archenemy of the superhero Batman. In his comic book appearances, the Joker is portrayed as a criminal mastermind. Context: The Joker was one of the few popular villains continuing to appear regularly in Batman comics from the Golden Age into the Silver Age, as the series continued during the rise in popularity of mystery and romance comics. In 1951, Finger wrote an origin story for the Joker in Detective Comics #168, which introduced the characteristic of him formerly being the criminal Red Hood, and his disfigurement the result of a fall into a chemical vat. By 1954, the Comics Code Authority had been established in response to increasing public disapproval of comic book content. The backlash was inspired by Frederic Wertham, who hypothesized that mass media (especially comic books) was responsible for the rise in juvenile delinquency, violence and homosexuality, particularly in young males. Parents forbade their children from reading comic books, and there were several mass burnings. The Comics Code banned gore, innuendo and excessive violence, stripping Batman of his menace and transforming the Joker into a goofy, thieving trickster without his original homicidal tendencies. The character appeared less frequently after 1964, when Julius Schwartz (who disliked the Joker) became editor of the Batman comics. The character risked becoming an obscure figure of the preceding era until this goofy prankster version of the character was adapted into the 1966 television series Batman, in which he was played by Cesar Romero. The show's popularity compelled Schwartz to keep the comics in a similar vein. As the show's popularity waned, however, so did that of the Batman comics. After the TV series ended in 1968, the increase in public visibility had not stopped the comic's sales decline; editorial director Carmine Infantino resolved to turn things around, moving stories away from schoolboy-friendly adventures. The Silver Age introduced several of the Joker's defining character traits: lethal joy buzzers, acid-squirting flowers, trick guns, and goofy, elaborate crimes. Question: Are there any other interesting aspects about this article? Answer:","completion":"Yes, there are some interesting aspects about this article! One interesting thing is the change in the Joker's character over time. In the beginning, he was a very scary and dangerous criminal. But then, because of the Comics Code Authority, he became more of a silly and harmless trickster. This change made him less scary, but also less popular. Another interesting thing is how the 1966 Batman TV series with Cesar Romero as the Joker made the character popular again. This show was very successful, and it made people like the Joker even though he was still a goofy prankster in it. Finally, it's interesting to see how the Joker's character changed again after the TV show ended. The Batman comics started making the Joker more dangerous and scary again, which brought back some of his original appeal. Some of the silly things about the Joker from the Silver Age, like his special gadgets and funny tricks, still remained part of his character. So, the Joker has had a lot of different versions over the years, but he has always been an important and interesting part of Batman's story."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Getting the dictator in his telescopic sight, he pulls the trigger on his unloaded rifle and gives a wave. He ponders a moment, then loads a live round, but is discovered at the last second by a guard, and the shot goes wild.After being beaten up, Thorndike is taken to Major Quive-Smith (George Sanders). Quive-Smith is also a devoted hunter and an admirer of Thorndike. Thorndike explains that it was a \\"sporting stalk\\", not to kill, but just for the thrill of going after the biggest game of all. The Nazi half-believes him, but insists he sign a confession that he was in fact working for His Majesty's government. When Thorndike refuses, he is tortured, but remains steadfast and warns of \\"questions being asked in high places\\" if he is killed, as his brother, Lord Risborough (Frederick Worlock), is a very important diplomat.

The answer to this question is:","completion":"George Oliver was a Welsh rugby union player born on April 3, 1891, in Pontypool, Wales. He was known for his skills as a lock and had a significant rugby career during the early 20th century. Oliver played for multiple clubs, including Talywain RFC, Pill Harriers RFC, and Pontypool RFC. He began his rugby career before 1920 and maintained a strong presence in the game until 1921. In the year 1920, he started making appearances on the international stage as a player for the Wales national team. Throughout his time playing for Wales, George Oliver had four appearances and managed to make a lasting impact on the rugby field. Despite his efforts, he did not score any tries or goals during his international matches, resulting in zero points for his career. Though he was not able to add any points to his name, Oliver's dedication and skills in the lock position were undoubtedly valuable for his team. During his career, George made no field goals and had a total of four appearances for Wales. It’s important to note that Oliver primarily played rugby union, a sport that emphasized teamwork and endurance. After an influential and noteworthy career, George Oliver decided to retire from rugby. Although no specific date regarding his retirement is provided, it can be inferred that he retired sometime after his last international appearance in 1921. George Oliver passed away on July 21, 1977, in Pontypool, Wales, his birthplace, leaving behind a legacy as a prominent rugby player for the Welsh national team and various rugby clubs.

Choose the most suitable option to answer the above question. Options: - show - in cinema - theatre - bench - martorell Answer:","completion":"The play was nearly starting, everybody took their seat in the theatre. This option is the most suitable because a play is typically performed live on stage in a theatre. The term \\"theatre\\" refers to a building or structure specifically designed for the presentation of live dramatic performances, where the audience is seated in an auditorium facing the stage. The unique atmosphere and excitement of a live play make the experience more engaging and memorable for the audience. In this context, the best answer is undoubtedly the theatre. Here is a brief explanation of why the other options are less suitable: - Show: This term is too general and could refer to various types of performances, including television shows, movies, and even concerts. It does not specifically refer to a building or location where the audience would be seated, as the question suggests. - In cinema: While a cinema is a place where people take their seats to watch movies, it is not the appropriate setting for a live play. Plays are performed in theaters, whereas cinemas are designed for screening films. - Bench: Although a bench can provide seating, it is not typically found in a setting designed for the presentation of live plays. A bench would be more commonly found in a park or other outdoor setting, not within the confines of a theater where a play would be taking place. - Martorell: This term does not seem related to the question at all. Martorell is a municipality located in Catalonia, Spain, and has no direct connection to the context of the question, which seeks to identify a suitable location where people would take their seats to watch a play."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

San Francisco: As the city that holds its nose highest in the sky, San Francisco takes the top spot on the list. Known for its stunning architecture, diverse culture, and passion for gourmet cuisine, it's no wonder that it's considered a snobby city. Residents pride themselves on their city's unique character, innovative tech scene, and progressive values, which may contribute to their air of superiority. 2. New York City: As the quintessential cosmopolitan city, New York City claims second place on the list. With a gritty yet glamorous image and an unparalleled arts and fashion scene, NYC boasts an impressive array of snobbish elements. The city's innumerable high-end shopping destinations, gourmet restaurants, and exclusive events practically scream snobbery. 3. Boston: Third on the list is the historic and highbrow city of Boston. The city's intellectual atmosphere, courtesy of prestigious universities like Harvard and MIT, as well as its rich cultural offerings, makes it a haven for the upper crust. With a strong sports team following, well-manicured parks, and upscale shopping districts, Boston's snobbery is hard to deny. 4. Minneapolis-St. Paul: Sharing fourth place are the twin cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul. They boast a thriving arts scene, an icy-cool atmosphere, and a penchant for fine dining and high-end shopping. The Minneapolis-St. Paul area's growing culinary reputation is a source of pride for its residents, further contributing to its snob appeal. 5. Santa Fe/Seattle: Tied for fifth place are Santa Fe and Seattle, two cities with unique personalities. Santa Fe's rich history and strong artistic roots create an air of sophistication, while Seattle's eco-friendliness, penchant for high-quality coffee, and booming tech scene make it a popular destination for the elite. Both cities value sustainability and culture, further cementing their spots on the list. 6. Chicago: With its stunning skyline, Chicago exudes an aura of snobbery that cannot be ignored. The city's wealth of hotspots like the Magnificent Mile, charming neighborhoods, and undefeated art scene makes it a hub for the elite. Chicago's dedication to deep-dish pizza and world-class shopping elevates its position on the list. 7. Los Angeles: Home to the legendary Hollywood elite, Los Angeles stands in seventh place on the list. The city's dazzling blend of palm trees, luxury vehicles, and designer boutiques is the epitome of snob appeal. With a celebrity-driven culture and a constant competition for appearances, Los Angeles is undeniably a snobby city. 8. Austin: Eighth on the list is Austin, the quirky capital of Texas. Known for its \\"please keep Austin weird\\" slogan, the city offers an exclusive vibe with upscale neighborhoods, high-end shopping, and a thriving music and arts scene. The increasingly competitive culinary landscape also adds to Austin's snobbiness. 9. Philadelphia: As the birthplace of American democracy, it's perhaps fitting that Philadelphia ranks ninth on the list. The City of Brotherly Love boasts prestigious universities, historical sites, and a passionate loyalty to its sports teams. With numerous upscale restaurants and bars, the city is rich in cultural offerings and snob appeal. 10. Denver: Last but not least, Denver rounds out the top 10. Known for its great outdoors and affinity for craft beer, Denver attracts an elite crowd dedicated to the finer things in life. A thriving food scene, unique art districts, and the nearby Rocky Mountains add to the city's snobbish charm.

That means that it wouldn't calculate the water vapor part of the equation. A call to the tech. department confirmed this! Buy the 2x c155 instead. Answer: A:","completion":"Based on the given review, it appears that the user would not recommend this product. The reviewer has experienced issues with the unit's capability to read gross efficiency on 90+ furnaces, which indicates a fundamental limitation in the product's performance. This particular issue prevents the calculation of the water vapor part of the equation, which is a critical aspect of evaluating the performance of these high-efficiency furnaces. Furthermore, the reviewer's experience with the technical support department has only confirmed this shortcoming in the product's operation. As a result, the user's dissatisfaction with the product is apparent, and they have gone as far as to suggest an alternative product, the 2x c155, for potential buyers to consider instead. When a reviewer explicitly recommends a different product, it is safe to conclude that they would not encourage others to purchase the product they initially tested. In this case, due to the functional limitations and a verified lack of necessary features, the user would not recommend this product to others."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Step 1: Analyze the given statement - \\"A man holding a trophy after a race.\\" The statement tells us that a man is holding a trophy and it is after a race. The statement does not mention the position or ranking of this man, only that he has a trophy. Step 2: Identify if there are any assumptions or other information required to come to the conclusion - \\"The man got first place.\\" In order to conclude that the man got first place, we need more information about the type of trophies given at the event and under what circumstances they are awarded. This information is not provided in the given statement. Step 3: Determine if there is enough evidence to come to the conclusion - \\"The man got first place.\\" Since the given statement only mentions that the man is holding a trophy, but does not provide any information about the trophy or the reason for it being awarded, we cannot logically conclude that the man got first place. There might be possibilities like the trophy is for a different achievement, or the race might award trophies to the top 3 or top 5 finishers, and so on.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Here is a goal: How should you act if bitten by a Shark in the ocean? Which way makes more sense to accomplish this goal?","completion":"If bitten by a shark in the ocean, it is crucial to act promptly and effectively to minimize damage and maximize your chances of survival. The following steps and guidance make the most sense to accomplish this goal: 1. Stay Calm: Panicking or thrashing will increase your heart rate, which may make you more vulnerable to blood loss and attract more sharks. It is essential to stay as calm as possible despite the adrenaline rush and fear. 2. Defend Yourself: If the shark is still present, prepare to defend yourself. Target the sensitive areas of the shark such as the eyes, gills, and snout. Use any available objects such as a camera, dive knife, or snorkel to strike these areas. If no objects are available, use your fists or elbows. 3. Minimize Movement: Minimizing your movement will help you conserve energy and reduce blood loss. Instead, try to slowly and steadily move towards safety while keeping an eye out for the shark. 4. Control Bleeding: Once the shark has left, immediately attend to the wound. Using any clean and available materials, apply direct pressure to the wound to minimize blood loss. Use a tourniquet if necessary to control bleeding from a limb. Remember that controlling blood loss is crucial to survival. 5. Signal for Help: If you're with a group, immediately alert them of the situation and ask for assistance. If you have a signaling device such as a flare or whistle, use it to call for help. Raising one arm above your head is a universal distress signal. 6. Make Your Way to Safety: As cautiously and quickly as possible, move towards the shore, a boat, or any nearby platform. If you are with other people, swim together as a group to appear larger to the shark, which may deter it from attacking again. 7. Stay Warm: As you make your way to safety, try to keep yourself warm. Hypothermia may occur due to blood loss, which can negatively affect your chances of survival. 8. Seek Medical Attention: Once you are safely ashore or on board a vessel, seek immediate medical attention. No matter how minor the injury may seem, a shark bite can introduce bacteria and other harmful organisms into your body, potentially resulting in infection. 9. Report the Incident: Notify local authorities about the shark attack to help protect other beachgoers and swimmers. Share any details about the shark, the location, and any warning signs that might help prevent future incidents. By following these steps and advice, you maximize your chances of survival and recovery if bitten by a shark in the ocean. Remember, the most effective way to prevent shark attacks is by being aware of your surroundings and adhering to local warnings and guidelines when swimming in the ocean."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The choice of the next Speaker was the first act of the new Parliament before newly elected MPs are sworn in. Mr Bercow told MPs that he would be the \\"champion of backbenchers\\" and ensure the Commons remained at \\"the heart of our democratic system\\". Mr Bercow has divided opinion among MPs since first being elected in 2009. Efforts by the Conservatives on the final day of the last Parliament to change the procedures for the Speaker's re-election - which would have made it easier to oust him - were defeated after rebel Tories joined forces with Labour and others to block them. Mr Bercow was re-elected without a vote on Monday, as was the case after the 2010 election. If a single MP had objected to him continuing in the role, a vote of all MPs would have been held. Mr Bercow said he had been honoured to serve as Speaker for the past six years and would be honoured to continue in that role for a \\"little longer\\". He said he would discharge his responsibilities \\"effectively, efficiently and fairly\\", holding the government \\"properly to account\\". Prime Minister David Cameron, who has clashed with the Speaker in the past, congratulated Mr Bercow and acknowledged the \\"inclusive way in which he had upheld this office - always putting backbenchers first\\". Acting Labour leader Harriet Harman paid a fulsome tribute to Mr Bercow, saying he was a \\"giant in the office\\" and, in her opinion, the best holder of the position she had known in more than 30 years in the House. His re-appointment was also welcomed by Angus Robertson, the leader of the SNP's 56 MPs in Parliament as well as by Nigel Dodds, leader of the Democratic Unionists in the Commons and Dr Alasdair McDonnell, leader of the SDLP in Parliament. Former Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael welcomed Mr Bercow's re-appointment on behalf of the Lib Dems, joking that he was speaking on behalf of the \\"elite cadre\\" of his party's representatives left in Parliament after they were reduced from 57 to eight MPs. Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg, who nominated Mr Bercow, said it was vital for \\"constitutional reasons\\" that Speakers were not removed against the will of the Commons. \\"The Speaker is the champion of the House of Commons against all comers,\\" he said. \\"The champion of the Commons against the Lords, sometimes against the judges, but perhaps most particularly against the executive.\\" Many MPs have praised Mr Bercow's reforms to Commons procedure, insisting they breathed new life into Parliament and gave the opposition and backbenchers more opportunity to question ministers on urgent matters. But some Conservatives regard Mr Bercow - who used to be a Conservative MP but as Speaker is independent and non-partisan - as a polarising figure and suggest that he unduly favoured Labour and the Lib Dems in the last Parliament. Mr Bercow, who is responsible for maintaining discipline in the Commons, was first elected in the wake of the scandal over MPs' expenses, which led to the resignation of his predecessor Michael Martin. Mr Cameron and Ms Harman also paid tribute to Sir Gerald Kaufman, the Labour MP who has become the Father of the House - an honorific status denoting the longest-serving MP in the Commons. MPs will be sworn in over the next three days prior to the State Opening of Parliament on 27 May, when the Queen's Speech - the government's legislative programme for the year ahead - will be announced.

Q:Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the full name of the person whose portrait is described as one of Dürer's most exact and honest portraits? Portrait Diptych of Dürer's Parents (or Dürer's Parents with Rosaries) is the collective name for two late-15th century portrait panels by the German painter and printmaker Albrecht Dürer. They show the artist's parents, Barbara Holper (c. 1451–1514) and Albrecht Dürer the Elder (c. 1427–1502), when she was around 39 and he was 63 years. The portraits are unflinching records of the physical and emotional effects of ageing. The Dürer family was close and Dürer may have intended the panels either to display his skill to his parents or as keepsakes while he travelled soon after as a journeyman painter. They were created either as pendants, that is conceived as a pair and intended to hang alongside each other, or diptych wings. However this formation may have been a later conception; Barbara's portrait seems to have been executed some time after her husband's and it is unusual for a husband to be placed to the viewer's right in paired panels. His father's panel is considered the superior work and has been described as one of Dürer's most exact and honest portraits. They are among four paintings or drawings Dürer made of his parents, each of which unsentimentally examines the deteriorating effects of age. His later writings contain eulogies for both parents, from which the love and respect he felt toward them is evident. Each panel measured 47.5 cm x 39.5 cm (18.7 in x 15.6 in), but the left hand panel has been cut down. They have been separated since at least 1628, until Barbara's portrait—long considered lost—was reattributed in 1977. The panels were reunited in the Germanisches Nationalmuseum's 2012 exhibition \\"The Early Dürer\\".

And I was wondering What does Cameron need to do before this? The answer is:","completion":"Before Cameron held the important documents delicately to ensure they wouldn't be damaged, he needed to take several precautionary measures: 1. Clean hands: Cameron should ensure that his hands are clean and free from any dirt or oils that could potentially harm the documents. He can either wash his hands thoroughly with soap and water or wear clean, lint-free gloves. 2. Prepare workspace: Cameron should prepare a clean, flat, and uncluttered workspace where he can comfortably examine and handle the documents. The workspace should also be free from potential hazards, such as liquids, direct sunlight, or unstable surfaces. 3. Acclimate the documents: If the documents have been stored in an environment with different temperature and humidity levels, it is important for Cameron to let them acclimate to the new environment before handling them. This can take a few hours or even a day, depending on the materials. 4. Gather necessary tools: Depending on the nature of the documents, Cameron may need various tools for handling them, such as a bone folder, a soft brush, paperweights, or archival sleeves. These tools can help him handle the documents without causing damage. 5. Remove jewelry and watches: To avoid accidental scratches or tears, Cameron should remove any jewelry or watches before handling the documents. 6. Use proper technique: Cameron should always support the documents with both hands and avoid touching their surface directly as much as possible.

To do that, subtract the constant (276) from both sides of the equation: 46*s + 276 - 276 = 0 - 276 46*s = -276 Step 3: Solve for variable s Now, to find the value of s, you will divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of the variable, which is 46: 46*s / 46 = -276 / 46 s = -6 So, the solution to the equation 46*s + 208 + 68 = 0 is s = -6."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The economy of the town is mostly agricultural, and the town is surrounded by vast cornfields. One particular year the corn crop fails and the people of Gatlin turn to prayer in an attempt to ensure a successful harvest. A 12-year-old young boy, Isaac Chroner, takes all the children of Gatlin into a cornfield and preaches to them about the prophecies of a strange, bloodthirsty incarnation of the Abrahamic God called \\"He Who Walks Behind The Rows\\". Isaac, through his 17-year-old lieutenant Malachai, leads the children in a revolution, brutally killing all of the adults in the town. Over the ensuing years, the children take any adults passing through as sacrifices. Three years later, Vicky and her boyfriend Burt pass through Nebraska while driving cross-country to Burt's new job as a physician in Seattle, Washington. As they travel in their car they hit a small boy out on the highway, one of the Gatlin children who tried to escape the iron hand of the syncretistic death cult. After inspection of the boy's body Burt determines that the child had his throat slit before being hit by the car and had stumbled on to the road from inside the cornfield. They take the blood-soaked suitcase as evidence, load the body in the trunk and set out to find the nearest telephone to call for help. Pulling into a rundown service station, they encounter an old man who refuses to help due to his secret agreement with the children to supply them with oil and gasoline in exchange for his life. However, Malachai breaks the pact against Isaac's will and murders the old man and his dog once Burt and Vicky leave.

Fifteen-year-old Ellis Whitman is leaving his home in Tucson, Arizona, for his freshman year at Gates Academy, an East Coast prep school. He leaves behind Wendy, his flaky, New Age mother and Goat Man, a weed-smoking goat trekker and botanist. Goat Man is the only real father Ellis has ever known, since his biological father, Frank, left when he was a baby. Upon arriving Gates Academy, Ellis befriends his roommate Barney Cannel, a cross-country runner, and Rosenberg, who usually does not get anything higher than a C in his classes, but is smart enough to sneak in marijuana. Ellis also takes an interest in Minnie, a local girl who works in the school library; his friends often refer to her as a prostitute, according to rumors. Meanwhile, Goat Man and Wendy have been incommunicado, which Barney points out often. On a phone call, Ellis discovers that his mother has a new boyfriend named Bennet, who is rude and disrespectful. One day, Ellis receives a letter in the mail from his long-estranged father from Washington, DC, requesting for Ellis to spend Thanksgiving dinner with him. Ellis decides to fly to Washington with Barney, who is also having Thanksgiving with his mother there. Ellis finally meets his father and his father's pregnant and kind-hearted wife, Judy. One night, Ellis gets a call from Barney telling him that he is in possession of marijuana. Ellis sneaks out for the night, but Frank finds out that he left.

Researchers have found that those who eat a handful of peanuts every day significantly decrease their risk of dying from all causes compared to those who do not eat nuts. A new study concludes that all types of nuts seem to be protective. Researcher Ying Bao is with the Department of Medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard University Medical School in Boston, Massachusetts. She and her colleagues looked at the impact of nut consumption by analyzing two huge studies that began in 1980 - the Nurses' Health Study, which tracks the of more than 76,000 women, and 42,000 men enrolled in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study. Among the questions asked at the beginning of the studies was, 'how frequently do you eat nuts?' The information was updated every two to four years. Bao says the participants were followed for three decades. \\"What we observed is that people who eat more nuts are less likely to die over the next 30 years,\\" said Bao. \\"So, for example, if a person eat(s) nuts once per day, that person has a 20 percent lower risk of dying.\\" Bao says eating a handful of nuts five or more times per week was associated with a 29 percent reduced risk of dying from heart disease and an 11 percent lower risk of cancer death. A serving size is 28 grams. Nuts contain nutrients, including high quality proteins, vitamins and minerals, all of which have anti-cancer effects and may help protect the heart. Bao says researchers are planning studies to find out how nuts are beneficial to human health. The study on the health benefits of nuts was funded by the International Tree Nut Council Research and Education Foundation. Question: The passage is most probably from a journal of _ .

Bowie was born David Robert Jones on 8 January 1947 in Brixton, London. His mother, Margaret Mary \\"Peggy\\" (née Burns; 2 October 1913 – 2 April 2001), was born at Shorncliffe Army Camp near Cheriton, Kent. Her paternal grandparents were Irish immigrants who had settled in Manchester. She worked as a waitress at a cinema in Royal Tunbridge Wells. His father, Haywood Stenton \\"John\\" Jones (21 November 1912 – 5 August 1969), was from Doncaster, and worked as a promotions officer for the children's charity Barnardo's. The family lived at 40 Stansfield Road, on the boundary between Brixton and Stockwell in the south London borough of Lambeth. Bowie attended Stockwell Infants School until he was six years old, acquiring a reputation as a gifted and single-minded child—and a defiant brawler.In 1953, Bowie moved with his family to Bromley. Two years later, he started attending Burnt Ash Junior School. His voice was considered \\"adequate\\" by the school choir, and he demonstrated above-average abilities in playing the recorder. At the age of nine, his dancing during the newly-introduced music and movement classes was strikingly imaginative: teachers called his interpretations \\"vividly artistic\\" and his poise \\"astonishing\\" for a child. The same year, his interest in music was further stimulated when his father brought home a collection of American 45s by artists including the Teenagers, the Platters, Fats Domino, Elvis Presley, and Little Richard. Upon listening to Little Richard's song \\"Tutti Frutti\\", Bowie would later say that he had \\"heard God\\".Bowie was first impressed with Presley when he saw his cousin dance to \\"Hound Dog\\". By the end of the following year, he had taken up the ukulele and tea-chest bass, begun to participate in skiffle sessions with friends, and had started to play the piano; meanwhile, his stage presentation of numbers by both Presley and Chuck Berry—complete with gyrations in tribute to the original artists—to his local Wolf Cub group was described as \\"mesmerizing ... like someone from another...

John is interested in the history of science. He went to a science museum to learn more about microscopes. First he saw a Leeuwenhoek microscope, which was labeled as item A, then he saw a compound microscope of Leeuwenhoek's time, which was labeled as item B. At the very end of his museum tour he saw a modern compound light microscope, which was labeled as item C. Hint: During the 1670s, the Dutch tradesman Antony van Leeuwenhoek, shown in Figure below , used microscopes to observe many microbes and body cells. Leeuwenhoek developed an interest in microscopy and ground his own lenses to make simple microscopes. Leeuwenhoek was so good at making lenses that his simple microscopes were able to magnify much more clearly than the compound microscopes of his day. His microscope's increased ability to magnify over 200x is comparable to a modern compound light microscope. Compound microscopes , which are microscopes that use more than one lens, had been invented around 1595 by Zacharias Jansen, a Dutch spectacle-maker.

It looks blue because we are looking at the blue sunlight. The sunlight is shining on little bits of dust in the air. Is the sky full of air? I'm sure that you have asked this question, too. We know that there is air all around the world, but we couldn't fly very high because as we go high, the air gets thinner. If we go far enough away from the earth, we find there is no air. Maybe we can answer some questions now. What is the sky? Where is it? It is all round the world. The sky is space . In space there is nothing, but only the sun, the moon, the earth and all the other stars. Question: We can't fly very high because _ . Yes or no, is the answer \\"there's no air in the high enough sky\\"? Answer:","completion":"Yes, the statement \\"We can't fly very high because there's no air in the high enough sky\\" is accurate. In the context of the provided article, the scenario discussed outlines humans' inability to fly significantly high due to the nature of the Earth's atmosphere. To delve further, the Earth's atmosphere is composed of several layers, each with varied density levels. Closest to the surface is the troposphere, where we experience regular weather, birds fly, and airplanes reach typical cruising altitudes. Up to about 8 to 15 kilometers, the air is thick with oxygen necessary for human life and for supporting the combustion engines of most aircraft. Beyond the troposphere is the stratosphere. Above this, stratospheric air becomes progressively thinner in the mesosphere and thermosphere and almost non-existent in the exosphere extending out into space. The air is so thin higher up that it cannot support human life or most conventional aircraft. This is partially why we need specially designed spacecraft to travel beyond our atmosphere. Hence, the diminishing level of air, or its thinness, is an inhibitive factor for us to fly very high. If we ascend too high, the rarity of air would prevent our lungs from getting enough oxygen to sustain life. Additionally, it would make it impossible for most aircraft to generate enough lift or for their engines to function properly. Briefly said, once we are far enough away from the Earth, there is no air – a fact that confirms the reason we primarily can't fly exceedingly high is indeed the absence of air. This situation is what creates the boundary of our salient exploration being the surface of our planet and the immediate atmosphere."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Given the two facts above, transpiration is when steam moves from _ into the atmosphere? The answer is:","completion":"Transpiration is when steam moves from plants into the atmosphere. To provide an in-depth explanation, let's break down the process of transpiration and its role in the water cycle. Transpiration is a crucial component of the water cycle, whereby water from the Earth's surface is converted into water vapor and returns to the atmosphere. Plants play a vital role in this process, as they uptake water through their root systems and subsequently release it back into the atmosphere through their leaves. The process of transpiration involves the transportation of water from a plant's root system, up its stems, and finally to the tiny openings located on the leaves' undersides, known as stomata. At the stomata, the water is turned into water vapor (also referred to as steam in this case) and released into the surrounding atmosphere. This process helps the plant to regulate its temperature, maintain an optimal turgor pressure within its cells, and obtain vital nutrients from the soil. Considering Fact 1, which states that transpiration is the movement of water vapor from plants into the atmosphere, and Fact 2, which identifies steam as an example of water vapor, it is clear that transpiration involves the movement of steam from plants into the surrounding atmosphere. In other words, when plants undergo transpiration, they release steam (water vapor) into the air, contributing to the water cycle and providing a way for water to travel from the Earth's surface back into the atmosphere. This process plays a crucial role in maintaining the planet's water balance and ensuring that water is distributed throughout ecosystems for the survival and growth of various life forms, including plants, animals, and humans."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The industrial average was first calculated on May 26, 1896. Currently owned by S&P Dow Jones Indices, which is majority owned by S&P Global, it is the most notable of the Dow Averages, of which the first (non-industrial) was first published on February 16, 1885. The averages are named after Dow and one of his business associates, statistician Edward Jones. It is an index that shows how 30 large publicly owned companies based in the United States have traded during a standard trading session in the stock market. It is the second-oldest U.S. market index after the Dow Jones Transportation Average, which was also created by Dow. The \\"Industrial\\" portion of the name is largely historical, as many of the modern 30 components have little or nothing to do with traditional heavy industry. The average is price-weighted, and to compensate for the effects of stock splits and other adjustments, it is currently a scaled average. The value of the Dow is not the actual average of the prices of its component stocks, but rather the sum of the component prices divided by a divisor, which changes whenever one of the component stocks has a stock split or stock dividend, so as to generate a consistent value for the index. Since the divisor is currently less than one, the value of the index is larger than the sum of the component prices. Although the Dow is compiled to gauge the performance of the industrial sector within the American economy, the index's performance continues to be influenced by not only corporate and economic reports, but also by domestic and foreign political events such as war and terrorism, as well as by natural disasters that could potentially lead to economic harm. - West Germany is the common English name for the Federal Republic of Germany or FRG (or \\"RFA\\") in the period between its creation on 23 May 1949 to German reunification on 3 October 1990.

After 1961 West Berlin was physically separated from East Berlin as well as from East Germany by the Berlin Wall. This situation ended when East Germany was dissolved and its five states joined the ten states of the Federal Republic of Germany along with the reunified city-state of Berlin. With the reunification of West and East Germany, the Federal Republic of Germany, enlarged now to sixteen states, became known simply as \\"Germany\\". This period is also referred to as the Bonn Republic (\\"Bonner Republik\\") by historians, alluding to the interwar Weimar Republic and the post-reunification Berlin Republic. - Banaadir (or \\"Bandir\\") is an administrative region (\\"gobol\\") in southeastern Somalia.

It occupies a total area of , and its capital and largest city is Addis Ababa. - The German Autumn was a set of events in late 1977, associated with the kidnapping and murder of industrialist Hanns Martin Schleyer, president of the Confederation of German Employers' Associations (BDA) and the \\"Federation of German Industries\\" (BDI), by the Red Army Faction (RAF) insurgent group, and the hijacking of the Lufthansa airplane \\"Landshut\\" by the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP). They demanded the release of ten RAF members detained at the Stammheim Prison plus two Palestinian compatriots held in Turkey and US15 million in exchange for the hostages. The assassination of Siegfried Buback, the attorney-general of West Germany on 7 April 1977, and the failed kidnapping and murder of the banker Jürgen Ponto on 30 July 1977, marked the beginning of the German Autumn. It ended on 18 October, with the liberation of the \\"Landshut\\", the death of the leading figures of the first generation of the RAF in their prison cells, and the death of Schleyer. - Kenya, officially the Republic of Kenya, is a country in Africa and a founding member of the East African Community (EAC).

News article: Banks fiddled while Rome burned: how to predict the next global financial crisis A broker reacts at the stock exchange in Frankfurt in September 2008 as world markets responded to the US financial crisis. Photograph: Daniel Roland/AP Looking back, it was easy to see that the crash was coming. There had been too much cheap money. Debt had exploded. Speculation was rife. The gap between rich and poor had widened. Welfare spending had risen. The financial system was so stretched that even a modest tightening of policy was enough to make it impossible for over-borrowed debtors to service their debts. The US in 2007? No, this was imperial Rome during the reign of Tiberius in AD33. It was not the first documented financial crisis; that dubious accolade goes to the states of the Delian League in ancient Greece, which defaulted on their debts following a naval blockade by Sparta. But a time traveller would see remarkable similarities between the unfolding of the Roman crisis of almost two millennia ago and the 2007-09 crash. The calling in of loans led to a credit crunch. Debtors went to the wall. Prices fell. The emperor arranged for the most heavily indebted to get interest-free loans for three years. A \\"bad bank\\" was set up. Tiberius financed his own version of quantitative easing, not by selling imperial bonds but by confiscating wealthy Romans' assets. All of this is documented in an excellent new book by Bob Swarup called Money Mania*, which looks at booms, panics and busts down the ages. His message is that nothing is really new. Put together people, credit and structural fragility and you create the perfect conditions for a crisis. Swarup's book comes out at an opportune moment. The past week has seen a shudder pass through stock markets as investors have taken a closer look at some of the more highly valued technology stocks. Easter traditionally marks the start of the British house-buying season, and this year's begins with sales at a six-year high and prices up almost 10% on a year ago. The appetite for risk was highlighted by the demand for the five-year bonds issued by the Greek government. Inevitably, the talk is of bubbles about to pop, of a new speculative mania, of lessons not learnt. This talk is a bit premature but the warning signs are there. History suggests that certain conditions have to be in place for a crisis to develop. The first is that a decent period of time has to elapse after the previous crash. When bubbles burst, a cavalier approach to risk is replaced, almost instantaneously, by risk aversion. It takes time for those burned by their losses to forget. In the UK, for example, there was a property boom in the early 1970s, another in the late 1980s and a third in the early to mid 2000s. A 15-year gap is the norm. The second condition is a sustained period of solid growth, by the end of which individuals convince themselves that the good times will go on and on. Accordingly, the property boom of the early 1970s came after 25 years of strong growth; the overheated market in the late 1980s stemmed from a belief that Thatcher's reforms had eradicated all the economy's problems; that in the 2000s came amid a period of uninterrupted growth lasting more than 60 quarters. A third crucial factor is belief in those running the show. The runup to the Great Recession of 2007-09 was the heyday of independent central banks, which preened themselves on their ability to deliver solid non-inflationary growth. There were a few, such as Bill White at the Bank for International Settlements, who warned that bubbles could develop in low-inflationary periods, but they were ignored. The public assumed that central banks were fully in control – a misplaced confidence as it turned out. Central banks, no matter how clever, cannot prevent crises. The establishment of the independent Bank of Amsterdam in 1609 did not prevent the tulip mania of the 1630s; the founding of the Bank of England in 1694 was followed a quarter of a century later by the South Sea Bubble. The Wall Street Crash occurred 16 years after the creation of the Federal Reserve. Whip these three ingredients together and you have the recipe for a crisis. As Swarup notes, humans don't like to stand still. \\"Growth is a strong psychological impetus, and if we are not growing in our lives in some way, we feel trapped and miserable.\\" So a recent period of growth plus confidence in policymakers allows us to extrapolate the past into the future, even if that means ignoring inconvenient facts. But more is needed to create the perfect bubble dish. Crises do not occur unless there is an abundance of credit to allow debt to build up and to permit speculators to take ever bigger bets. When economies become saturated with debt, as they were in the mid-2000s, it is time to prepare for the worst. That is certainly the case if complex financial systems are badly flawed. Nobody really understood what the web of banks, hedge funds and shadow banks were up to as they traded credit default swaps and collateralised debt obligations. Regulators certainly didn't. These two final ingredients matter. In the absence of credit and a functioning framework, economies grow only very slowly, as they did in the 1,000 years after the Roman empire collapsed. But too much debt plus poorly managed and regulated financial systems will, sooner or later, lead to trouble. The fact that we are still bubble conscious suggests that the right conditions for a bubble do not yet exist. Insufficient time has passed. Investors are able to differentiate between tech companies that are not making profits and firms in the real economy that do have a track record of earnings growth. In the UK as a whole, house prices have yet to return to their pre-crisis peak, although they have already done so in London. Regulation is still being tightened as policymakers seek to avoid the mistakes of the past. The eurozone is only just emerging from a triple-dip recession and Britain's national output is still lower than it was six years ago. A much longer period of expansion will, on past form, be necessary for the onset of amnesia. All that said, there are a couple of reasons to beware. One is that central banks could leave policy too loose for too long. Dario Perkins, of Lombard Street Research, is one analyst cautioning that if the Fed leaves policy as loose as forecasts suggest, it could create new asset bubbles. The other is that in the age of Facebook and Twitter, only \\"now\\" matters. If we have lost our capacity to remember, trouble may come sooner than we think. *Money Mania: Bob Swarup; Bloomsbury What are the most important parts of this news article?","completion":"The most important parts of this news article are: 1.

Deputy Bean, who is visiting his wife's grave, discovers Joe and Mutt. As the boys watch from behind a tombstone, Joe brutally murders Bean who tried to hit him with a shovel, frames Mutt and captures Rebel.

Two neighboring police Departments took different approaches to fighting crime, Greenville P.D. did not invest in DNA testing, improved forensics, and information technology, while Grayville took extensive measures of that nature. Hint: Law enforcement officers are often unfamiliar with information technology, and so lack the skills and interest in pursuing attackers. There are also budgetary constraints. It has been argued that the high cost of technology, such as DNA testing, and improved forensics mean less money for other kinds of law enforcement, so the overall rate of criminals not getting dealt with goes up as the cost of the technology increases. In addition, the identification of attackers across a network may require logs from various points in the network and in many countries, the release of these records to law enforcement (with the exception of being voluntarily surrendered by a network administrator or a system administrator) requires a search warrant and, depending on the circumstances, the legal proceedings required can be drawn out to the point where the records are either regularly destroyed, or the information is no longer relevant.

Given the following context: Vita Sackville-West, poet, author, and gardener, was born at Knole, about 25 miles from Sissinghurst, on 9 March 1892. The great Elizabethan mansion, home of her ancestors but denied to her through agnatic primogeniture, held enormous importance for her throughout her life. Sissinghurst was a substitute for Knole, and she greatly valued its familial connections. In 1913 Sackville-West married Harold Nicolson, a diplomat at the start of his career. Their relationship was unconventional, with both pursuing multiple, mainly same-sex, affairs. After breaking with her lover Violet Trefusis in 1921, Sackville-West became increasingly withdrawn. She wrote to her mother that she would like \\"to live alone in a tower with her books\\", an ambition she achieved in the tower at Sissinghurst where only her dogs were regularly admitted. From 1946 until a few years before her death, Sackville-West wrote a gardening column for The Observer, in which, although she never referred directly to Sissinghurst, she discussed a wide array of horticultural issues. In an article, \\"Some Flowers\\", she discussed the challenge of writing effectively about flowers: \\"I discovered this only when I started to do so. Before ... I found myself losing my temper with the nauseating phraseology ... and sickly vocabulary employed.\\" In 1955, in recognition of her achievement at Sissinghurst, \\"bending some stubborn acres to my will\\", she was awarded the Royal Horticultural Society's Veitch Medal.

Aaron Cresswell's first goal for West Ham handed them victory over Newcastle. CLICK HERE see the stats behind the game with our Match Zone. Eventually, when it came to Newcastle conceding a goal, there was little they could do about it. Eight hours and eight minutes had lapsed on the watch, their net having been safely guarded for almost two months, when Aaron Cresswell sensed trouble as everybody else stood and watched. Cheikhou Kouyate sent a hopeless volley towards goal, Cheick Tiote failed to react and the full-back, signed from Ipswich in the summer, crept up behind him and thrashed home past goalkeeper Rob Elliot, who was deputising for the injured Tim Krul. They may look at these three points and wonder of the significance because, make no mistake, OPTIONS: - Aaron Cresswell were second best for long spells. - Alan Pardew were second best for long spells. - Boleyn Ground were second best for long spells. - Cheick Tiote were second best for long spells. - Cheikhou Kouyate were second best for long spells. - Hammers were second best for long spells. - Ipswich were second best for long spells. - Match Zone were second best for long spells. - Moussa Sissoko were second best for long spells. - Newcastle were second best for long spells. - Premier League were second best for long spells. - Rob Elliot were second best for long spells. - Tim Krul were second best for long spells. - Tranmere Rovers were second best for long spells. - West Ham were second best for long spells.","completion":"They may look at these three points and wonder of the significance because, make no mistake, West Ham were second best for long spells. Despite Aaron Cresswell's heroics, the Hammers struggled to maintain control throughout the game, often ceding possession and territory to a persistent Newcastle side. In the first half, Newcastle showed dominance with a string of attacks and near misses that had West Ham's fans on the edge of their seats. The superior ball control and movement by Newcastle players like Moussa Sissoko and Cheick Tiote seemed to hint at a reversal of fortunes for the struggling team. However, West Ham's defense proved resilient, and a key moment in the match swung in their favor when Cresswell capitalized on Tiote's momentary lapse of concentration with an instinctive strike. Despite being on the back foot for much of the game, West Ham's ability to make the most of their opportunities and shut down Newcastle's attackers in crucial moments allowed them to clinch a narrow victory. West Ham manager Alan Pardew will undoubtedly be pleased with the result, but he will also be aware that there is much room for improvement—even in victory, his side was often overshadowed by their determined opponents. Still, the result is vital for West Ham as it moves them up the Premier League table, and though they may not have been the dominant force for much of the match, the old adage rings true: the important thing in football is not how well you play, but whether you can secure the three points when the final whistle blows. On this occasion, the Hammers' grit, determination, and clinical finishing from Cresswell proved to be the decisive factors in a hard-fought victory that will likely be remembered for its significance rather than its beauty."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What does a long landing mean?","completion":"No, the two questions are not the same as they refer to distinct topics. Let me provide you with detailed answers for each question to clarify the difference between the two inquiries: 1. Is a person with bipolar disorders considered mentally ill? Bipolar disorder, previously known as manic-depressive illness, is a mental health condition characterized by extreme mood swings which include emotional highs, known as mania or hypomania, and lows, known as depression. These mood shifts are far more intense than normal ups and downs experienced by most people and can seriously impact an individual's daily life, relationships, and ability to function effectively. Mental illnesses are health conditions involving changes in emotion, thinking, or behavior (or a combination of these) that causе distress and difficulty in functioning. While there is a wide range of mental illnesses, they share some common characteristics, such as affecting a person's thoughts, emotions, and behaviors. Since bipolar disorder involves significant changes in mood and functioning, it falls under the category of mental illnesses. It is important to recognize that having bipolar disorder or any other mental illness is not a personal failing, nor does it suggest weakness or moral shortcomings. Mental health conditions are medical issues that can be effectively treated and managed with appropriate care, medication, and therapy. 2. What does a long landing mean? A long landing refers to an aviation scenario in which an aircraft touches down significantly farther down the runway than intended, thus using up more runway length than necessary for a safe landing. This can be caused by various factors, such as pilot error, adverse weather conditions, or inaccurate estimation of the aircraft's speed or altitude on approach. When an aircraft makes a long landing, it may lead to potential safety risks or complications, including: - Reduced stopping distance: As a result of the long landing, there may be insufficient runway distance remaining for the aircraft to come to a complete stop. This increases the risk of a runway overrun, which may cause damage to the aircraft and pose a threat to the safety of passengers and crew members. - Compromising subsequent takeoffs and landings: The long landing may disrupt the schedule of other aircraft operating at the airport, as the aircraft must remain on the runway until it has safely slowed down and cleared the active runway. - Increased wear and tear on the aircraft: Long landings often lead to increased utilization of the aircraft's brakes, which can result in additional wear and subsequently increase maintenance costs. To avoid long landings, pilots undergo rigorous training to accurately judge the approach and landing parameters of their aircraft, taking into account weather conditions, aircraft weight, and other factors. Additionally, modern aviation technology, such as advanced flight control systems and approach aids, plays a crucial role in ensuring that pilots can safely land in various conditions and minimize occurrences of long landings. In summary, the first question deals with mental health, specifically bipolar disorder, while the second question is concerned with aviation and the concept of long landings. These two questions are not the same and address entirely different subjects."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Liaoning is China's first aircraft carrier, commissioned in 2012, and is a training vessel used to gain experience in aircraft carrier operations. Step 3: Determine the answer.

He is to pose as a deserter, and to make his disguise more convincing, he is given twenty lashes. When he arrives in Diego-Suarez, he arouses the suspicions of the pirates, especially Captain Roc Brasiliano. Brasiliano orders him to appear before a tribunal of the Coast Captains to decide his fate. If they do not like him, he will be executed. Meanwhile, Hawke has caught the eye of Spitfire Stevens - the only woman among the Coast Captains - who inherited her position from her father. At the tribunal, Hawke duels one of the pirates with boarding pikes, managing to outfight him. Hawke is therefore allowed to join Brasiliano's crew to prove his worth. While cruising the shipping lanes, they come across a Moghul vessel crammed with luxuries and vast wealth. After a tough battle, it is taken and looted. Captured aboard is Patma, the daughter of the Moghul Emperor, who is disguised by her chaperone as just another ordinary woman. She falls in love with Hawke after he rescues her from the burning ship, admitting he is only the third man she has ever seen. When they return to Diego-Suarez, Spitfire becomes jealous of Patma. When Patma is put up for auction, she outbids Hawke (who had wanted to protect her from the other pirates) and takes the Indian woman into her service. In a candid moment, Spitfire tells Hawke she is planning to leave for England via Brazil, where she can catch a legal ship. She wants Hawke to accompany her there, after which he can take ownership of her ship. Brasiliano's hatred of Hawke grows, as he has a fancy for Spitfire himself.

Q: Read the following context and answer the question. Context: Not as a nurse, but as a patient. I had my appendix removed in about 1970 before keyhole surgery and the surgeon had not properly stitched the inside incision. This meant I was slowly “leaking” blood into the area between my abdominal cavity lining and my skin. I was kept in the hospital for two weeks and every day the same nurse would come along and open the end of the incision in my skin to relieve the pressure caused by the pooling of my blood. That was fine for the first five days, but the weekend came and she was off duty. Apparently, nobody else knew what to do. By Monday morning, I was in agony and when she arrived, she was appalled I had not been drained during the weekend. The other thing that happened during the weekend was the end of the skin incision, which she had opened, had mostly healed meaning there was no convenient hole for the blood to be drained. The nurse used a sharp pair of scissors to reopen one end of the partly-healed incision, but still the blood would not simply drain of its own accord. She used both hands to squeeze downwards onto the swollen blood reservoir. At first, there was no reaction except agonizing pain, but after a few seconds and a very hard squeeze, the stinking, coagulated blood jetted out of the hole she’d made squirting across the ceiling, down the wall and down her full-length coating her face and the front of her uniform. Despite the pain, I couldn’t keep myself from laughing loud and long. She then dressed the wound, directed some junior nurses to clean the ceiling and the wall while she went to clean herself. I apologized for laughing the following day when she returned. She told me she appreciated the humor of the situation so there was no “hard feelings.” Question: The author's blood was not drained after the first five days in the hospital for how long?

Introduction: The recent burial of Osama Bin Laden, conducted by the U.S. administration on the USS Carl Vinson, has sparked various discussions and debates on whether the process adhered to Islamic requirements or not. Body: An administration official has stated that the burial of Osama Bin Laden conformed to Islamic requirements. The religious rites for the notorious terrorist leader were conducted aboard the USS Carl Vinson shortly after his death in 2011. Bin Laden's body was wrapped in a white sheet, laid on a board, and tipped into the sea. This was done to ensure that the burial procedure conformed to Islamic tradition. However, a religion professor with expertise in Islamic studies believes that while some requirements were indeed followed, there are lingering questions around the overall conformity of the burial process. It is important to note that proper Islamic burial includes a series of intricate religious rites which can vary from one Islamic community to another. In order to be considered in accordance with Islamic requirements, the body must first be washed and shrouded in a clean cloth, preferably white. The burial should also include a funeral prayer, typically led by an Imam or a knowledgeable person in the community. Following the respectful disposal of the body, it is crucial to provide a proper burial plot in which the body is placed facing Mecca, the holy city of Islam. The administration has argued that burying Bin Laden at sea fulfilled these obligations, as there was no available burial plot on land and no country or community willing to claim his body. The sea burial allowed for a swift and respectful disposal, thus being in line with Islamic requirements. While the white sheet and tipping into the sea seem to validate their claims, the act of performing the required funeral prayer and correctly positioning the body remain uncertain. Conclusion: The exact conformity of Osama Bin Laden's burial to Islamic requirements remains open for interpretation, with opposing views from administration officials and religious experts. While some aspects of the burial appear to have adhered to Islamic tradition, other questions regarding the funeral prayer and body positioning continue to divide opinions. Further investigation might be needed to fully determine the extent of compliance with Islamic religious rites."},{"prompt":"Question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: New Yorkers are gradually getting used to more bicyclers on those hot blue City Bikes.But what about local bike shops?

You can practice writing each word a dozen times, which will get you used to using the word itself. {\\"smallUrl\\":\\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/4/4d/Learn-Any-Language-Step-04Bullet01.jpg/v4-460px-Learn-Any-Language-Step-04Bullet01.jpg\\",\\"bigUrl\\":\\"/images/thumb/4/4d/Learn-Any-Language-Step-04Bullet01.jpg/aid67111-v4-728px-Learn-Any-Language-Step-04Bullet01.jpg\\",\\"smallWidth\\":460,\\"smallHeight\\":345,\\"bigWidth\\":\\"728\\",\\"bigHeight\\":\\"546\\",\\"licensing\\":\\"<div class=\\"mw-parser-output\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\"nofollow\\" class=\\"external text\\" href=\\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\\">Creative Commons</a><br>n</p><p><br />n</p></div>\\"} Try using the words in various and different sentences. This will help you practice the words and make it easier to recall the words when you need them. Don't forget to keep practicing the words once you move on to memorizing other words. If you don't practice them you will forget them. Especially if you're learning a language which operates on a different alphabetical system, you will need to know what the letters look like and how they operate. For example, this can be a crucial step if you're an English speaker who's learning Chinese. Try associating images with each letter and sound, so that your brain will have an easy path to remembering the letter and the sound that accompanies it. For instance: In Thai the letter \\"า\\" is pronounced \\"ah.\\" If you're a guy you can think of this as the path taken by your pee if you're urinating against a tree and the accompanying sigh you make as you relieve yourself. Associations can be as simple, or as silly as you want, as long as they help you remember. You may also have to accustom yourself to reading from right to left, or from the top of the page to the bottom. Start simple and work up to more difficult things like newspapers and books.

Answer this: In a large forest with many animals, there are only a small number of bears. Which of these most likely limits the population of bears in the forest?","completion":"To determine which factors most likely limit the population of bears in the forest, we need to consider the key factors that influence a bear population's growth and sustainability. Here is a step-by-step process for identifying the most likely primary factor: 1. Identify the species of bear: Different bear species have different habitat requirements, prey availability, and population densities. Knowing the species can help narrow down specific limiting factors. 2. List the potential limiting factors: Some potential limiting factors for bear populations might include food availability, habitat quality, mating opportunities, predation, hunting, and disease. 3. Analyze each factor individually: a) Food availability: A bear's diet can be primarily plant-based with some animal tissue like berries, nuts, fish, smaller mammals, and insects. If any of these food sources are in short supply, that can limit the bear population. b) Habitat quality: Bears typically prefer large, undisturbed forests with ample denning sites for hibernation. Habitat fragmentation, loss, or insufficient space can negatively impact their success and limit their population. c) Mating opportunities: If the forest's bear population is too sparse or male-female ratios are skewed, this could impact reproduction opportunities and limit population growth. d) Predation: While bears have few natural predators, hunting by humans or other large predators could impact their numbers. e) Hunting: If hunting is allowed in the area and the bear population is not well managed, it may lead to overharvesting, affecting the overall population. f) Disease: Bear populations can be affected by diseases and parasites, which may limit their population growth if the prevalence is high. 4. Identify the most likely factor: Considering the above factors in the context of a large forest with many animals, food availability, and habitat quality most likely contribute to the limitation of the bear population. The presence of other animals suggests there might be competition for food resources, while the large forest may not necessarily provide optimal habitat or protection for bears. Therefore, the most likely limiting factor for the bear population in the large forest with many animals is a combination of food availability and habitat quality."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In a speech to the National Association of Manufacturers in Washington, Trump promised to deliver on a “giant, beautiful, massive, the biggest ever in our country, tax cut.” Trump is eager to move past setbacks on health care reform and the results of a Republican Senate primary Tuesday in Alabama where he found himself on the losing side. The president and his administration also have been on the defensive over hurricane recovery efforts in Puerto Rico. Senate Republicans put off a vote on a plan to repeal and replace Obamacare after it became clear they did not have enough votes to pass the measure, thanks to a handful of Republican defectors. Democrats expressed relief they had beaten back another attempt to undo former President Barack Obama’s signature achievement, the Affordable Care Act. “The reason this bill failed is because millions of Americans didn’t want it,” Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer told reporters at the Capitol. On the same day, Christian conservative and former judge Roy Moore easily won a Republican Senate primary in Alabama, defeating incumbent Luther Strange, whom Trump had supported. “We are put here on Earth for a short time, and for that short time our duty it to serve almighty God,” Moore said in his victory speech. Moore has made controversial statements on a number of issues in the past, but he is considered the favorite in a race against Democrat Doug Jones in a general election Dec. 12. Trump had appeared with Strange the week before at a rally in Alabama, but even some analysts said his heart did not appear to be in it. “Trump was campaigning for Luther Strange, but you could tell he was having some second thoughts about that,” said Republican strategist John Feehery. Moore’s victory, aided by the active support of former Trump White House strategist Steve Bannon, signals what could be a series of divisive Republican primary battles heading into next...

Please answer the following question: Two groups of people were part of a nutrition study that lasted 2 years. Group A had a normal diet, while group B consumed an extra 1000 calories a day for 2 years. Group B gained lots of weight. Which group had more people with a B.M.I. greater than 30.0?? Hint: Any unused energy in food—whether it comes from carbohydrates, proteins, or lipids—is stored in the body as fat. An extra 3,500 Calories of energy results in the storage of almost half a kilogram (1 pound) of stored body fat. People who consistently consume more food energy then they need may become obese. Obesity occurs when the body mass index is 30.0 kg/m 2 or greater. Body mass index (BMI) is an estimate of the fat content of the body. It is calculated by dividing a person’s weight (in kilograms) by the square of the person’s height (in meters). Obesity increases the risk of health problems such as type 2 diabetes and hypertension. A:","completion":"Based on the information provided in the scenario and the hint, we can infer that Group B inevitably had more individuals with a B.M.I. greater than 30.0. Here's why: Step 1: Understand the task. In this task, I need to determine which group of people had more people with a B.M.I. greater than 30.0 from a nutrition study where one group had a normal diet (Group A) and the other (Group B) consumed an extra 1000 calories a day for a span of 2 years. Step 2: Analyze the provided information. Taking into consideration the hint, it's implied that consuming extra food energy than needed causes the body to store this as fat. An extra 3,500 Calories of energy results in about half a kilogram (1 pound) of stored body fat. Obesity occurs when the B.M.I. is 30.0 kg/m^2, or greater. Step 3: Apply the information to the scenario. Given that Group B members consistently consumed an extra 1000 calories per day for 2 years, they consumed much more energy than they needed daily. This extra energy was stored as fat in their bodies, causing them to gain weight. Step 4: Make the final conclusion. Therefore, from the information provided and considering the condition concerning inactive additional Calories being stored as fat, leading to obesity (B.M.I. greater than 30), we deduce that Group B, the group consuming an extra 1000 calories per day for two years, had a higher likelihood of having more people with a B.M.I. greater than 30.0.

Chill With A Cerveza By The Coup Two days ago, Honduran military forces surrounded the country's presidential palace in Tegucigalpa, ousting President Manuel Zelaya. A day later, the U.S. State Department issued a statement warning Americans not to travel to the country, as it has an \\"unstable political and security situation.\\" But that's no reason to write off Honduras' neighbors to the north and south. For tourists in the rest of Central America, it's business as usual. No paramilitary, just piña coladas--not to mention low prices. According to Kelly Grumbach, travel expert for personal concierge service Quintessentially, the average round-trip airline ticket to Central America is about 500. Partly for this reason, she notes, tourists aren't staying away from Central America due to the turmoil in Honduras. Grumbach says she's only seen increases in travel to Panama City recently, and they have yet to level off. \\"With the current state of the economy, Panama City has seen a large increase in tourism and incoming travel requests,\\" says Kelly Anne Walsh, head of Quintessentially's Panama office. \\"We are a relatively inexpensive destination with great nightlife, beaches and culture.\\" John Clifford, president of luxury travel consulting firm International Travel Management, suggests trying for a reservation at the Bristol Panama, \\"a European style, five-star boutique hotel located in the Marbella district.\\" The deluxe room rate for the Panama City hotel is only 249 per night, including a butler service. For a quieter spot, try the archipelago of Bocas del Toro, with its crystal-clear waters perfect for snorkeling and diving. In fact, nature is the main draw in nearly all of Central America, not just Panama. Costa Rica, renowned for its eco-tourism, hosts about 2 million visitors a year. Most of them steer clear of the busy capital city of San Jose, nestled in the middle of the country, and instead opt for any of several coastal oases. For vacation spots on the coast Clifford suggests Quepos, a town on the Pacific coast and the gateway to the Manuel Antonio National Park. Though the park is the smallest in the country, there's no shortage of adventure there, from hiking to biking to getting close to nature. One can catch a glimpse of a rare brown-throated three-toed sloth in the luscious forests as well as as scuba dive within feet of playful dolphins. Adventures also abound in Belize, on the Atlantic side of Central America. The Belizean territory consists of more ocean than land, and just offshore is Ambergris Cay island, home of the Mata Chica Resort. Costing 249 per night during the just-begun low season, the resort is right on the Belize Great Barrier Reef, the second-largest reef in the world. For those wishing to stay on the mainland, Clifford recommends the Blancaneaux Lodge on Belize's southern coast, a resort owned by film director Francis Ford Coppola. \\"It's a jungle sanctuary overlooking a creek complete with rapids and a stunning waterfall,\\" Clifford says. Just the sort of thing that makes it easy to forget there's a government upheaval occurring right nearby.

In 1937 he composed his first major liturgical work, the Mass in G major for soprano and mixed choir a cappella, which has become the most frequently performed of all his sacred works. Poulenc's new compositions were not all in this serious vein; his incidental music to the play La Reine Margot, starring Yvonne Printemps, was pastiche 16th-century dance music, and became popular under the title Suite française. Music critics generally continued to define Poulenc by his light-hearted works, and it was not until the 1950s that his serious side was widely recognised.In 1936 Poulenc began giving frequent recitals with Bernac. At the École Normale in Paris they gave the premiere of Poulenc's Cinq poèmes de Paul Éluard. They continued to perform together for more than twenty years, in Paris and internationally, until Bernac's retirement in 1959. Poulenc, who composed 90 songs for his collaborator, considered him one of the \\"three great meetings\\" of his professional career, the other two being Éluard and Landowska. In Johnson's words, \\"for twenty-five years Bernac was Poulenc's counsellor and conscience\\", and the composer relied on him for advice not only on song-writing, but on his operas and choral music.Throughout the decade, Poulenc was popular with British audiences; he established a fruitful relationship with the BBC in London, which broadcast many of his works. With Bernac, he made his first tour of Britain in 1938. His music was also popular in America, seen by many as \\"the quintessence of French wit, elegance and high spirits\\". In the last years of the 1930s, Poulenc's compositions continued to vary between serious and light-hearted works. Quatre motets pour un temps de pénitence (Four Penitential Motets, 1938–39) and the song \\"Bleuet\\" (1939), an elegiac meditation on death, contrast with the song cycle Fiançailles pour rire (Light-Hearted Betrothal), which recaptures..., can you guess it ?

I loved the new art at the hospital instead of the old design, because the OPT: (A). art was terrible.. (B). design was terrible..","completion":"I loved the new art at the hospital instead of the old design, because the design was terrible. It is essential to understand the importance of a well-thought-out and aesthetically pleasing design when it comes to the interiors and exteriors of buildings, especially in places like hospitals, where people are going through difficult and challenging moments in their lives. The previous design of the hospital was dull and dreary, characterized by monotonous colors and unimaginative patterns. The walls were covered in shades of beige and gray, giving the space a worn-out, tired appearance. This could easily lower patients' spirits and make them feel even more miserable than they already were. Moreover, the lack of any inviting or comforting visuals often left patients anxious and overwhelmed. The old design also lacked any cohesive theme or sense of identity. The artworks, if any, were haphazardly placed without any thought being given to their ability to impact patients positively. The decorations mostly consisted of stock prints of landscapes and abstract shapes, which failed to resonate with patients and their families, as they served more as generic placeholders than thought-provoking conversation starters. Fortunately, the hospital administration recognized the shortcomings of their existing design and took decisive action to revamp their premises with an entirely new and innovative artistic direction. They not only sought input from professional designers and artists but also consulted with patients, their families, and hospital staff on what they would like to see around them. This collaborative approach resulted in a remarkable transformation of the hospital's interiors. The new design incorporated various colors, textures, and materials that encouraged warmth, tranquility, and serenity, allowing patients to feel more comfortable in their surroundings. The walls were adorned with modern murals, abstract paintings, and uplifting messages that spoke to people from all walks of life, making the atmosphere more welcoming and eliciting a sense of belonging among the community. Another key aspect of the new design was the attention paid to the spatial layout and planning. Open spaces, indoor gardens, and natural sunlight were prioritized, fostering a sense of interconnectedness between the indoors and outdoors. Well-defined walkways and seating areas were added for the convenience of patients, families, and staff, making it easy to navigate the building and find places to rest and gather. Art also extended beyond the walls, with local sculptors being commissioned to create unique pieces for the outdoor landscaping. These stunning installations sparked curiosity, wonder, and admiration while staying true to the hospital's mission of promoting health and wellness. The hospital's artistic transformation demonstrates the power of creative expression and the significant impact it can have on people's well-being. The new and improved design bridges the gap between functionality and beauty, providing spaces that not only address patients’ physical needs but also cater to their emotional and mental well-being. As a result, the hospital has become a place where patients and their families can draw strength, support, and hope in trying times, and where staff find renewed motivation to continue their essential work in healing and nurturing those who need it most."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Cosmo Kramer, usually referred to as simply \\"Kramer\\", is a fictional character on the American television sitcom Seinfeld (1989-1998), played by Michael Richards. The character is loosely based on comedian Kenny Kramer, Larry David's ex-neighbor across the hall. Kramer is the friend and neighbor of main character Jerry, residing in Apartment 5B, and is friends with George and Elaine. Of the series' four central characters, only Kramer has no visible means of support; what few jobs he holds seem to be nothing more than larks. In \\"The Trip\\", Kramer admits that a man in a park exposed himself to him when he was a young boy. In \\"The Big Salad\\" Kramer reveals to Jerry that he grew up in a strict household where he had to be in bed every night by 9:00PM. In \\"The Letter\\", Kramer tells two art patrons that he ran away from home at age seventeen and stowed away aboard a steamer bound for Sweden. Kramer never completed high school; however, it is made clear in \\"The Barber\\" that Kramer has a GED. Kramer was estranged for a long period from his mom, Babs Kramer, who works as a restroom matron at an upscale restaurant. Unlike George and Jerry, Kramer's character does not have a well-developed network of family members shown in the sitcom. He is the only main character on the show whose dad never makes an appearance; however, in \\"The Chinese Woman\\", Kramer mentions that he is the last male member of his family, implying that his father had died. He also mentions in \\"The Lip Reader\\" that he has or had a deaf cousin, from whom he learned fluent American Sign Language, but when Kramer tries to communicate in ASL, he speaks complete gibberish and cannot correctly translate the ASL he sees others using. He also apparently has no biological children, although he adopted mile 114 of the Arthur Burkhardt Expressway in \\"The Pothole\\". During an opening discussion, Kramer reveals to Jerry that in 1979 he was struck on the head by a falling air conditioner while walking on the sidewalk. Jerry asks if that was when Kramer lived in Greenwich Village, to which Kramer replies that he cannot remember. This is discussed in the beginning of \\"The Little Kicks\\". In \\"The Strong Box\\", it is revealed that Kramer spent a brief time in the Army, although info about this time is \\"classified\\".

To do this, we'll add 1210 * b to both sides: (-1361 * b) + (1210 * b) = (-1210 * b) + (1210 * b) - 4228 This simplifies to: -151 * b = -4228 Now, we need to get b all by itself.

At least eight bombs were dropped in the area Wednesday during the school's first day of classes, according to a statement by Samaritan's Purse, Graham's Christian humanitarian group, which supports the school. Two bombs landed inside the compound -- located in the region's Nuba Mountains -- destroying two Heiban Bible College buildings and igniting grass fires across the area, the group said in a statement No injuries were reported. \\"It was a miracle that no one was injured,\\" the statement added. Graham, who has called on the international community to take out Sudan's air assets and establish a no-fly zone in the region, said in a statement Thursday that he blamed Sudan's air force for the strike. At least four churches have been destroyed since August, the group said. \\"We are deeply concerned for the welfare and lives of the people of South Kordofan and we condemn the bombing of churches and Christian facilities,\\" added Graham, son of the famed Rev.

Ironically, one of Nazarbayev's most implacable foes is Rakhat Aliyev, ex-husband of his daughter Dariga, and father of both Aysultan and Venera.

Article: Washington (CNN) -- Solar panels and a solar hot water heater will soon be installed at the White House, Energy Secretary Steven Chu said Tuesday. Chu announced the conversion at the 2010 GreenGov Symposium in Washington, accompanied by Nancy Sutley, chairwoman of the Council of Environmental Quality. \\"This project reflects President Obama's strong commitment to U.S. leadership in solar energy and the jobs it will create here at home,\\" Chu said in a written statement released by the Energy Department. \\"Deploying solar energy technologies across the country will help America lead the global economy for years to come.\\" By installing the solar panels on the White House, Sutley said the president is underscoring a commitment to \\"lead, and the promise and importance of renewable energy in the United States.\\" The solar panel system, which should be installed by next spring, will convert sunlight directly to electricity, while the solar hot water heater will have a solar collector facing the sun to heat water for use in the White House residence. The Energy Department said a competitive procurement process will be used to select the company that will make the installations. This is not the first time solar energy has been tapped at the White House. Former President Jimmy Carter had solar panels installed on the roof of the White House residence during his term. They were removed during the Reagan administration. Former President George W. Bush also used solar energy to help power a maintenance building on the White House grounds, and to assist in heating the swimming pool there. The announcement comes on the one-year anniversary af an executive order signed by the president that called on the federal government to lead in the establishment of a clean energy economy. ||||| FILE - This file photo released by Solar Design Associates shows the solar thermal system produced by the Harvard, Mass., company, installed on the roof of the White House pool cabana in Washington during...

(Associated Press) FILE - In this June 20, 1979, file photo President Jimmy Carter, center, is surrounded by reporters and photographers as he inspected new White House solar hot water heating system located on the roof... (Associated Press) The most famous residence in the United States, which has already boosted its green credentials by planting a vegetable garden, plans to install solar panels atop the White House's living quarters. The solar panels are to be installed by spring 2011, and will heat water for the first family and supply some electricity. Energy Secretary Steven Chu announced the plans Tuesday in Washington at a conference of local, state, academic and nonprofit leaders aimed at identifying how the federal government can improve its environmental performance. Former Presidents Jimmy Carter and George W. Bush both tapped the sun during their days in the White House. Carter in the late 1970s spent 30,000 on a solar water-heating system for West Wing offices. Bush's solar systems powered a maintenance building and some of the mansion, and heated water for the swimmint pool. Obama, who has championed renewable energy, has been under increasing pressure by the solar industry and environmental activists to lead by example by installing solar at the White House, something White House officials said has been under consideration since he first took office. The decision perhaps has more import now after legislation to reduce global warming pollution died in the Senate, despite the White House's support. Obama has vowed to try again on a smaller scale. Last month, global warming activists with 350.org carried one of Carter's solar panels _ which were removed in 1986 _ from Unity College in the state of Maine to Washington to urge Obama to put solar panels on his roof. It was part of a global campaign to persuade world leaders to install solar on their homes. After a meeting with White House officials, they left Washington without a commitment. Bill McKibben, the founder of the 350.org group, said Tuesday the administration did the right thing. \\"If it has anything like the effect of the White House garden, it could be a trigger for a wave of solar installations across the country and around the world,\\" McKibben said in a statement. What was unclear Tuesday was how much the White House solar project will cost, and how much fossil fuel-based electricity it would displace, since the system is not yet designed and the White House will not disclose how much energy is needed to keep the president's lights turned on. Based on available roof space, administration officials expect the photovoltaic system will include between 25 to 75 panels and will convert sunlight into 19,700 kilowatt hours of electricity a year. That would save a typical household 2,300 on its electricity bill, based on commercial rates in Washington. The solar hot water heating system, based on government estimates, could save an additional 1,000 a year. But the White House is far from a typical house, noted Danny Kennedy, the founder of California-based solar energy provider Sungevity, which offered to put solar panels on the White House for free earlier this year as part of a campaign called SolarontheWhiteHouse. Kennedy estimates that outfitting Obama's home with solar would cost about 100,000 if paid out of pocket. But the money would be earned back with savings on the electric bill in the first five years, he said in an interview from the Maldives, where he is installing 48 solar panels on President Mohammed Nasheed's private residence. Kennedy said his calculations were based on a 5,000 square-foot (464 sq. meter) California home, which uses 60,000 kilowatt hours of electricity annually. ||||| What is a summary?","completion":"Energy Secretary Steven Chu has announced plans to install solar panels and a solar hot water heater at the White House.

It also said there would be unspecified back office cuts at other UK sites. AstraZeneca announced a fall in pre-tax profits for the three months to the end of December to 2.05bn (??1.32bn) compared with 2.28bn in 2010. Profit for the financial year was up to 12.37bn, from 10.97bn the year before. The UK's second-largest drugs firm has 61,000 staff globally, of which 8,000 are in the UK. The GMB union said shedding R&D jobs would damage the UK economy. \\"These cutting edge R&D [research and development] jobs are both well paid and essential for a thriving UK economy,\\" said Allan Black from the GMB. The latest cuts are part of the third restructuring programme the company has carried out since 2007, and is designed to save 1.6bn a year by 2014. By James GallagherHealth and science reporter, BBC News There are still large profits being made by pharma, but there are pressures on the whole industry. Huge costs in developing new drugs are paid for with huge profits while the company has exclusive rights to manufacture the medication. However, when patents expire, anyone can manufacture the drug and profits plummet. Many money-spinners are reaching the end of their lifespans and there are concerns that not enough new drugs are coming in to replace them. One of the problems with drug research is that the obvious drugs have already been made. Analysis: Pharmaceutical woes The aim is to release funding to invest in research and development and \\"the UK remains strongly positioned to compete for those R&D dollars,\\" Stephen Whitehead, chief executive of the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry told BBC News. He said the job losses at AstraZeneca were a result of changes to the the R&D process that had become \\"more complex and much more expensive\\". \\"Increasingly there has been externalisation of R&D, collaboration with universities, with research charities, with academia... So that means that you don't necessarily employ people [directly].\\" In its first round of restructuring AstraZeneca cut 12,600 positions between 2007 and 2009. It began a second programme in 2010, which the firm said would lead to the loss of 9,000 jobs by 2012. It has sites around the UK at Alderley Park, in Cheshire, Avonmouth near Bristol, Brixham in Devon, and London, and employs staff through affiliated companies in Liverpool, Cambridge and Luton. The Alderley Park site is the company's largest, employing about 3,000 people. AstraZeneca blamed increased competition for the fall in fourth quarter profits. \\"Disciplined execution of our strategy has delivered a good performance in 2011, in the face of intensified pricing pressure and generic competition,\\" said chief executive David Brennan. \\"While the further expected losses of market exclusivity make for a challenging 2012 outlook, we remain committed to a long-term, focused, R&D based strategy and today have announced further steps to drive productivity in all areas,\\" he added. The company is also facing the loss of patents on some of its products such as anti-psychotic treatment Seroquel, and has not yet released alternative money earners. \\"That's really why AstraZeneca are in the position there are now, they don't see anything coming through soon enough to have an impact,\\" said David Phillips from the Royal Society of Chemistry. \\"It's a fact that the easy targets, in the body, for the production of drugs have, essentially, all been used up,\\" he added. AstraZeneca's attempts to develop new drugs have run into trouble. In December, it scrapped an ovarian cancer drug and took a significant loss on an experimental antidepressant.

He is sent to the high-security Graymoor Asylum for the Criminally Insane, where the most dangerous minds are kept. Despite maintaining his innocence, no one believes him. At Graymoor, Renfield is assigned to a cell adjacent to Victor Rowan, an enigmatic inmate and former illusionist with a dark past. The two men form an uneasy bond over their shared conviction that they've been wrongly imprisoned. Victor, intrigued by Renfield's case, finds his illusions and expertise in escapology useful in getting information about the other inmates and staff. Renfield, on the other hand, starts putting together a plan for an impossible escape from the cell that he believes will clear his name. Act 2: Confrontation After weeks of planning, Renfield confides in Victor about his escape plan. He has discovered an underground network of tunnels beneath the asylum, constructed during the Cold War as a fallout shelter. He believes he can access these tunnels through a hidden entrance in his cell, and then navigate through them using his acute sense of direction. He believes that once he is free, he can gather evidence to exonerate himself. Victor, meanwhile, has become increasingly fascinated with the \\"Lurking Shadows\\", mysterious figures in dark shrouds he claims to have seen roaming the corridors of the asylum. He also shares his belief that these beings are behind the murders that landed them both in Graymoor. Together, Renfield and Victor put their plan into motion, managing to break through the hidden entrance in Renfield's cell and enter the subterranean tunnels. They navigate through the dark maze, encountering forgotten relics of the past along with mounting evidence of the true culprits behind the murders. However, as they delve deeper into the labyrinth, they also start to unveil the disturbing truth about the Lurking Shadows. Act 3: Resolution Renfield and Victor realize that the Lurking Shadows are not supernatural beings, but a secret organization operating within the asylum. They are an elite group of medical doctors, scientists, and businessmen, conducting unethical experiments on the inmates in order to advance their own careers and influence. It is then revealed that Renfield was framed because his research on human consciousness threatened to expose their activities. Dr. Gregory Lamarck, the head psychiatrist at the asylum and secret leader of the organization, is desperate to capture the two escapees before they make their way out of the tunnels. The thrilling climax of the story follows Renfield and Victor as they outwit and evade the Lurking Shadows and the corrupt staff of Graymoor. Ultimately, Renfield and Victor manage to contact the outside world and bring down the organization, uncovering the truth about their innocence in the process. Dr. Lamarck and the rest of the Lurking Shadows members are arrested for their horrendous crimes. The movie ends on a bittersweet note, as Renfield is exonerated and released from Graymoor, while Victor is left to complete his sentence for his real past misdeeds. The two exchange an emotional farewell, acknowledging the bond they formed through their shared struggle against an invisible enemy. As Renfield walks away from the asylum, he resolves to start a new chapter in his life, dedicated to advocating justice for the wrongfully accused and standing up against corruption within the system."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: I can use this background: Shown in the Figure below is a cylinder of gas on the left that is at room temperature (300 K). On the right, the cylinder has been heated until the Kelvin temperature has doubled to 600 K. The kinetic energy of the gas molecules increases, so collisions with the walls of the container are now more forceful than they were before. As a result, the pressure of the gas doubles. Decreasing the temperature would have the opposite effect, and the pressure of an enclosed gas would decrease. Now, I have a new situation: Rob is testing the properties of gas. To that end, he experimented with a cylinder of gas in three stages, stage A, stage B, and stage C. In stage A he kept the gas in room temperature. In stage B he heated the gas up. And in stage C he cooled the gas down. Answer this question please: Would stage B see increased of decreased pressure than stage C? Answer:","completion":"To answer this question, let's analyze the given information step by step and justify each step. Step 1: Understand the initial conditions and the effect of temperature on gas pressure From the background information provided, we know that: - A gas at room temperature (300 K) has a certain pressure. - When the temperature of the gas is doubled (from 300 K to 600 K), the kinetic energy of the gas molecules increases, causing more forceful collisions with the container walls, and as a result, the pressure of the gas doubles. Step 2: Apply this understanding to Rob's experiment Rob's experiment consists of three stages: - Stage A: The gas is at room temperature. - Stage B: The gas is heated up. - Stage C: The gas is cooled down. Step 3: Determine the pressure changes between stages Based on the initial conditions and the effect of temperature on gas pressure, we can infer the following: - Since the gas is heated up in stage B, its temperature increases, which results in an increase in gas pressure. - In stage C, the gas is cooled down, which implies a decrease in temperature and therefore a decrease in gas pressure. Step 4: Compare the pressure in stage B and stage C Considering the above pressure changes in both stages, we can now conclude that: Answer: The pressure in stage B would be higher than the pressure in stage C, as heating the gas results in increased pressure, whereas cooling the gas results in decreased pressure."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The answer to this question is:","completion":"The official title of the character played by James Frain on the TV series \\"The Tudors\\" was Thomas Cromwell, 1st Earl of Essex. In the critically acclaimed historical fiction television series \\"The Tudors\\" (2007-2010), English actor James Frain portrayed the character of Thomas Cromwell, a prominent statesman who served as King Henry VIII's chief minister from 1532 to 1540. Thomas Cromwell was a key figure in the English Reformation during the reign of King Henry VIII. He rose to prominence through his extraordinary ability to manipulate legal and political mechanisms, ultimately becoming one of the most influential men in the Tudor court. Cromwell's significant achievements include the dissolution of the monasteries, the annulment of King Henry VIII's marriage to his first wife, Catherine of Aragon, and the establishment of the Church of England as a separate entity from the Roman Catholic Church. Cromwell also played a vital role in arranging King Henry VIII's subsequent marriages to Anne Boleyn and Jane Seymour. His efforts to consolidate the King's power contributed to the development of a robust centralized government, thus leaving a lasting impact on England's political landscape. However, Cromwell's eventual downfall came in 1540 when he fell out of favor with King Henry VIII due to the King's unhappy marriage with Anne of Cleves, which Cromwell had arranged. He was arrested for treason and heresy, and subsequently executed on July 28, 1540. Shortly after Cromwell's execution, King Henry VIII posthumously stripped him of his titles, resulting in his official designation as the 1st and last Earl of Essex during his lifetime."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

By Louise Boyle PUBLISHED: 13:51 EST, 4 December 2013 | UPDATED: 20:07 EST, 4 December 2013 A military couple whose engagement ring was secretly bought by actor Paul Walker came forward today after finally having their suspicions confirmed that the star was behind the act of amazing generosity. Soldier Kyle Upham and his new wife Kristen were in a Santa Barbara jewellery store in 2004 looking for a diamond ring shortly before he was sent on his second deployment back to Iraq. The couple quickly realized that the other shopper in the store was Fast And The Furious star Walker and struck up a conversation. Kyle revealed to the actor that he had just come back from a tour of duty in Iraq.","completion":"The couple expressed their admiration for Walker's work in the Fast And The Furious franchise, and the conversation soon turned to their reason for visiting the jewelry store – selecting an engagement ring to treasure during Kyle's upcoming deployment. While browsing through the collection, Kristen fell in love with a beautiful diamond ring that was, unfortunately, beyond their budget. The young couple reluctantly decided to settle for a less expensive option. Little did they know that Walker had overheard their conversation and had been moved by the bravery and dedication of Kyle, who was about to risk his life again in the service of his country. However, the actor didn't want to make a scene or draw unnecessary attention to himself. Instead, he secretly approached the store's manager and insisted on buying the very ring that had caught Kristen's eye. He paid the full amount for the ring, which was reportedly around 9,000, and made the manager promise not to reveal his identity. After finalizing the purchase, the manager discreetly handed the engagement ring to Kyle and Kristen, saying that it had been paid for by an anonymous benefactor. The couple was initially overwhelmed with disbelief and gratitude, but they suspected that it might be the work of the actor they had just met. Their suspicions ran high, but without any solid proof, they kept the story to themselves, cherishing the secret and the auction of love and kindness. Almost a decade later, in December 2013, following the tragic and untimely death of Paul Walker, stories of his selfless acts and philanthropic work started surfacing in the media. It was then that the jewelry store manager finally broke his silence, revealing the story of the actor's generous act to the public. This confirmation allowed the Upham couple to finally share their story and to express their gratitude towards the man who had made their engagement truly unforgettable. In various interviews following the revelation, Kyle and Kristen spoke about how the kind gesture had impacted their lives, not only by providing them with a beautiful, everlasting symbol of their love but also inspiring them to give back to their community and help others in need. Even years after the unforgettable encounter, they felt a deep connection to the late actor and appreciated his support for military personnel through his many charitable endeavors. Paul Walker's unexpected act of generosity towards the Upham couple is a powerful testament to the actor's humble nature and genuine desire to make a difference in people's lives. The story serves as an example of compassion, empathy, and the value of extending a helping hand to those who serve our country."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize the following: If the tool is part of a larger machine, such as a table saw, disassemble your unit. Wash all of the tools or parts to be treated for rust in a mixture of grease-cutting dish detergent and warm water to remove the oils and dirt. You can use a plastic container, pot, or tub, as long as it’s large enough to submerge the tools. Choose a container that you can set aside for one to three days. White vinegar is acidic, so it will cut through the rust, making it easier to remove. While the amount of white vinegar will vary depending on how many tools you are cleaning and how big they are, track how much you add to the container so that you can properly measure your salt. You should add roughly ¼ cup (60 milliliters) of salt for each quart (1 liter) of vinegar. The salt will increase the acidity of the vinegar so that the solution dissolves the rust quicker. Spread the salt evenly over the vinegar soak. The vinegar and salt need time to break down the rust so that it can be scrubbed from the tools. The longer you allow your tools to remain in the vinegar, the easier it will be to remove the rust. Place the container in a secure location so that children and animals won’t get into it. For example, you could lock it in your garage or shed. Pull out any tools with hinges or moving parts occasionally to move them around. This helps work out the rust from the crevices. After you remove the tools from the vinegar solution, vigorously rub your tools to buff away the rust. Continue to scrub the tools until they are completely free of rust. If the rust is thick, use a metal bristle brush. Use a small, firm toothbrush in circular motions for hard to reach areas. Pour out the vinegar solution and wash out the tub. Fill the tub with enough clean water to match the amount of vinegar solution that you’d used. The baking soda will neutralize the acid from the vinegar so that it doesn’t remain on your tools. Use about ¼ cup (60 milliliters) of baking soda for each quart (1 liter) of water. Mix the baking soda into the water to create a solution. Make sure that your tools are submerged in the baking soda solution. Allow the tools to soak for ten minutes before removing them. Dry them well with a clean towel. Use 0000 steel wool to buff the tools and remove any remaining spots. Your tools should be free of rust. Apply denatured alcohol to a clean cloth and rub it onto the tools. The alcohol will help you make sure that no water remains on your tools. Water could cause more rust. Polish the tool with camellia oil to prevent more rust.

She almost never takes it off, but it was giving her a bit of a rash so she did, zipping it in her coin purse for safe keeping. Later, she absentmindedly emptied the contents of that purse into the collection cup of Billy Ray Harris, who is homeless and often stays under a bridge in Darling's hometown. It wasn't until the next day that she realized her ring was gone. \\"It was horrible.

This is sometimes referred to as “checking labs,” “doing bloodwork,” or even “checking blood.” Most older adults have been through this. For instance, it’s pretty much impossible to be hospitalized without having bloodwork done, and it’s part of most emergency room care. Such testing is also often done as part of an annual exam, or “complete physical.” Last but not least, blood testing is usually — although not always — very helpful when it comes to evaluating many common complaints that affect aging adults. Fatigued and experiencing low energy? We should perhaps check for anemia and thyroid problems, among other things. Confused and delirious? Bloodwork can help us check on an older person’s electrolytes (they can be thrown off by a medication side-effect, as well as by other causes). Blood tests can also provide us with information related to infection, kidney function, and much more. Like much of medical care, blood testing is probably overused. But often, it’s an appropriate and an important part of evaluating an older person’s health care concerns. So as a geriatrician, I routinely order or recommend blood tests for older adults. Historically, laboratory results were reviewed by the doctors and were only minimally discussed with patients and families. But today, it’s becoming more common for patients to ask questions about their results, and otherwise become more knowledgeable about this aspect of their health. In fact, one of my top recommendations to older adults and family caregivers is to always request a copy of your laboratory results. (And then, keep it in your personal health record!) This way, if you ever have questions about your health, or need to see a different doctor, you’ll be able to quickly access this useful information about yourself.

I am very happy and have decided to go, but I'm a little worried about it, too. The social customs in my country are very different from here, so I'm afraid of making mistakes. Should I bring a present, such as sweets or flowers? Should I arrive on time or a little late? At the dinner table, how can I know which fork or knife to use? How can I let the family know that I'm thankful for their kindness? Wang Lin Letter B Dear Wang Lin, It's a good idea to bring a small present when you go to a dinner party. Flowers are always nice, or you may bring a bottle of wine if you know that your friends drink it. You should arrive on time or five to ten minutes late. Don't get there early. If you're going to be more than fifteen minutes late, you should call and tell them. Try to be free at the dinner table. If you don't know about choosing the right fork or knife, just watch the other people, and follow them. If you still have no idea of what to do, ask the person next to you. If you like the food, say so. Of course, you'll thank them for the meal and for their kindness. It's also a good idea to send a thank-you card the day after.

White House officials on Wednesday laid out plans to send National Guard troops to the United States’ southern border with Mexico, as part of President Donald Trump’s efforts to confront what he says is a growing problem with illegal immigrants. The decision to deploy the U.S. military to the border represents a major new aspect of Trump’s wide-ranging immigration crackdown. But major parts of the move are unclear, including how many troops will be sent, when they will deploy, or what exactly they will do. “It will take time to have the details in place, but we are beginning today and are moving quickly,” said Kirstjen Nielsen, secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. “We are anxious to have this support.” In the U.S., the active duty military is generally restricted from domestic law enforcement functions, which would include apprehending border crossers. However, U.S. presidents have deployed the National Guard to the border to act in support roles. Nielsen said the National Guard troops will help with border surveillance and other “support functions.” She declined to say how large the force would be, but she did say it would include “as many (troops) as is needed to fill the gaps today.” A senior Trump administration official declined to say whether the National Guard troops will be armed, saying those details are still being worked out. But the official said the force would be effective. “Suffice it to say, for individuals looking to pay a smuggler to get in the United States right now, that would be a very unwise investment,” the official said. Trump signed a proclamation authorizing the move Wednesday evening. But states must also approve the decision before deploying their guard members. Trump repeatedly has threatened to deploy the military to help secure the border, especially as a caravan of Central American migrants makes it way north through Mexico, with some headed for the U.S. Who said the national guard will help with border surveillance? - Jones - Walters - not enough information - Nielsen The answer to this question is:","completion":"Kirstjen Nielsen, the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, said that the National Guard troops will help with border surveillance and other \\"support functions.\\" The decision to deploy the U.S. military to the border is part of President Donald Trump's efforts to confront the growing problem of illegal immigrants.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Donald Trump Bets Increase Just Like Brexit: Bookmakers Donald Trump’s odds to win the U.S. presidential election may not match that of bookmaker’s favorite Hillary Clinton, but a late surge of bets have been placed on the Republican candidate ahead of the final presidential debate on Wednesday. British-based bookmakers William Hill have launched their list of bets for the final debate, with Clinton placed at 1-3 to win the final televised showdown and Trump at 9-4. Overall, Clinton remains the hot favorite to win the presidency, whereas Trump now has a 20% chance of winning compared with 15% before the weekend. However, the Trump campaign doesn’t seem to have dissuaded bettors looking for a last-minute gamble, as William Hill’s latest figures show that 65% of bets on the market have been placed on Trump with the remaining 35% placed on Clinton. As to why punters might be backing Trump at this stage, Hill spokesman Graham Sharpe said, “It may be because the race has reached a level now where people thought it might be worth taking a chance, or just as with the E.U. referendum, people just don’t believe the opinion polls.” Bookmakers have responded by cutting the odds on Trump to win in a betting pattern reminiscent of the run-up to the E.U. referendum in Britain earlier this year. “It was the case that consistently throughout the E.U. referendum campaign, some two-thirds of the money gambled was for Remain, but in terms of individual bets, it was around two-thirds for Leave,” said Sharpe. “In straight bookmaking terms we have to be big Trump supporters as he currently represents a six-figure loss in our overall market.” In terms of stakes, Hall’s figures said 71% of the total money bet on the U.S. election has been placed on a Clinton win, including a record-breaking bet of over 610,000 placed on the Democratic candidate earlier this month.","completion":"People are betting on who will be the next President of the United States, and lately, more people have been betting on Donald Trump to win.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Patsy Cline (born Virginia Patterson Hensley; September 8, 1932 - March 5, 1963) was an American country music singer and part of the Nashville sound during the late 1950s and early 1960s. She successfully \\"crossed over\\" to pop music and was one of the most influential, successful, and acclaimed vocalists of the 20th century. She died at age 30 in the crash of a private airplane. Cline was known for her rich tone, emotionally expressive and bold contralto voice, and her role as a country music pioneer. Patsy Cline was born Virginia Patterson Hensley on September 8, 1932 in Winchester, Virginia, in the city's Memorial Hospital. She was the eldest child of seamstress Hilda Virginia (nee Patterson, 1916-1998) and blacksmith Samuel Lawrence Hensley (1889-1956). She had a brother Samuel Jr. (1939-2004) and a sister Sylvia. The family moved often before finally settling in Winchester, Virginia when Patsy was 16. Sam Hensley deserted his family in 1947, but the children's home was reportedly happy nonetheless. When Patsy was 13, she was hospitalized with a throat infection and rheumatic fever. She later said, \\"The fever affected my throat and when I recovered I had this booming voice like Kate Smith.\\" Cline enrolled at John Handley High School but never attended classes. To help her mother support their family, she worked as a soda jerk at Gaunt's Drug Store and a waitress at the Triangle Diner. She watched performers through the window at the local radio station, and she asked WINC (AM) disc jockey Jimmy McCoy if she could sing on his show. Her performance in 1947 was well received and she was asked back. This led to appearances at local nightclubs wearing fringed Western outfits that her mother made from Patsy's designs. Cline performed in variety and talent shows in the Winchester and Tri-State areas, and she gained a large following through the shows and local radio appearances. Jimmy Dean was already a country star in 1954, and she became a regular with him on Connie B. Gay's Town and Country Jamboree radio show on WAVA (AM) in Arlington County, Virginia. Did she have any siblings?","completion":"Yes, Patsy Cline had two siblings, a brother named Samuel Jr. (1939-2004) and a sister named Sylvia."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Rick Scott said Wednesday he supports expanding Medicaid and funneling billions of federal dollars to Florida, a significant policy reversal that could bring health care coverage to 1 million additional Floridians. \\"While the federal government is committed to pay 100 percent of the cost, I cannot, in good conscience, deny Floridians the needed access to health care,\\" Scott said at a hastily called news conference at the Governor's Mansion. Scott, a former hospital executive, spoke with unusual directness about helping the \\"poorest and weakest\\" Floridians — a stunning about-face for a small-government Republican who was one of the loudest voices in an aggressive, and ultimately unsuccessful, legal strategy to kill a law he derided as \\"Obamacare.\\" Throughout his 2010 campaign for governor, as Scott sought support from tea party members, he called the law a \\"job killer\\" that would hurt Florida. On Wednesday, he called the proposed Medicaid expansion, at least for an initial period, \\"common sense.\\" Tea party activists bitterly criticized Scott's declaration. \\"This is just another example of Republicans lying to Floridians,\\" said Everett Wilkinson of Palm Beach Gardens, calling Scott \\"the Benedict Arnold to the patriot and tea party movement in Florida.\\" Scott was careful to point out that the Republican-controlled Florida Legislature will ultimately decide whether or not his proposal is worth implementing. That is far from certain, particularly in the more partisan House. \\"Gov. Scott has made his decision, and I certainly respect his thoughts,\\" said House Speaker Will Weatherford, R-Wesley Chapel. \\"However, the Florida Legislature will make the ultimate decision. I am personally skeptical that this inflexible law will improve the quality of health care in our state and ensure our long-term financial stability.\\" \\"I respect the governor for staking out a clear position,\\" added Sen. Joe Negron, R-Stuart, who chairs a Senate committee studying the health care law. He said senators would reach their own conclusions likely in early March. Scott said he would support an initial three-year expansion of Medicaid but made clear he would not twist legislators' arms to make it happen. He reiterated that his top priorities are a 2,500 pay raise for teachers and a sales tax break for manufacturers' equipment purchases. Under the governor's proposal, after three years the Legislature would have to vote to reauthorize the program to keep it going. \\"It is not a white flag of surrender to government-run health care,\\" he said, as if anticipating a political backlash from his most conservative supporters. Part of his self-described \\"new perspective\\" came from the death of his mother, Esther, last year, he said. \\"A few months ago, my mother passed away, and I lost one of the only constants in my life,\\" Scott said. \\"Losing someone so close to you puts everything in new perspective . . . especially the big decisions.\\" For weeks, Scott has said the debate on expanding Medicaid was directly tied to the state's application for waivers it needs to allow private companies to run the program. His endorsement of the expansion came hours after the federal government agreed to grant Florida a conditional waiver to privatize Medicaid statewide for the state's more than 3 million current recipients, more than half of which are children or people under age 21. Scott and GOP lawmakers have repeatedly warned that Medicaid's roughly 21 billion annual costs were consuming Florida's budget and proposed the managed care plan to save money and improve care. The privatization expands on a five-county pilot program that has been rife with problems. Critics worry for-profit providers are scrimping on patient care and denying medical services to increase profits. Some doctors have dropped out of the pilot program, complaining of red tape and that the insurers deny the tests and medicine they prescribe. Patients have complained they struggled to get doctor's appointments. Several health plans also dropped out of the pilot program, saying they couldn't make enough money. Patients complained they were bounced from plan to plan with lapses in care. Nearly half of the 200,000 patients enrolled in the pilot have been dropped from at least one plan, federal health officials noted at one point during negotiations. Lawmakers say they have fixed the pilot program's shortcomings, with provisions including increased oversight and more stringent penalties, including fining providers up to 500,000 if they drop out. The measures also increase doctors' reimbursement rates and limit malpractice lawsuits for Medicaid patients in hopes of increasing doctor participation in the program. Medicaid, a joint state-federal, government-run health care program, is voluntary for states. But every state participates, in part because of the good financial terms. The federal government covers about 55 percent of all Medicaid costs in Florida and covered about 68 percent in recent years with additional stimulus funding. The health care law tried to entice states to expand eligibility to Medicaid by raising income eligibility limits. To do so, the federal government agreed to fund 100 percent of the cost for states to expand Medicaid for three budget years. The federal government would then cover 95 percent of the costs in 2017, 94 percent of the costs in 2018, 93 percent of the costs in 2019 and 90 percent of the costs in 2020 and beyond. Recent polls conducted by the American Cancer Society's Cancer Action Network and the Florida Hospital Association indicated that most Floridians supported the Medicaid expansion. Scott said Wednesday that he had to look past his long-standing opposition to the health care law to reach his decision. \\"It doesn't matter what I believe. It doesn't matter what anybody believes,\\" Scott said. \\"The Supreme Court's already made their decision. We had an election in the fall, and the public made their decision.\\" Information from the Associated Press was used in this report. The story .

Rick Scott — a fierce foe of Obamacare who fought it all the way to the Supreme Court — on Wednesday announced that he would accept the Medicaid expansion under the health law. He is the seventh GOP governor to do so — and arguably the biggest political symbol of grudging Republican acceptance that Obamacare is the law of the land. Text Size - + reset Scott had campaigned against the health legislation even before he began running for office, and Florida led the 26 states that fought it in court. On Wednesday, that changed as he agreed to take the federally financed expansion that would cover more than 1 million people — at least for the first three years. “While the federal government is committed to paying 100 percent of the cost of new people in Medicaid, I cannot in good conscience deny the uninsured access to care,” he explained in a speech late Wednesday. But Scott’s Medicaid endorsement comes with a caveat no other governor has proposed. He said he’ll push legislators to support just a three-year expansion of the program — which is after the end of his first term. That forces the state to re-evaluate the expansion before getting locked in for a longer-term commitment. “This is a commonsense solution to dealing with this for the next three years,” Scott said. “It’ll give us time to think about how we can improve the system.” Democrats and advocates of the health law were jubilant — but annoyed that it took so long. \\"Three years of staunch opposition and tens of thousands of taxpayer dollars later, embattled Gov. Rick Scott today flip-flopped on the central issue which has defined his political career,” said Florida Democratic Party Chairwoman Allison Tant. “This stunning about-face is merely the latest move to repackage a governor whose approval rating with Floridians remains as toxic as his tea party agenda,” she added. The road from Obamacare foe to Medicaid expander was a long and strange journey for Scott, a former hospital executive who spent millions four years ago in a failed attempt to derail the health care bill in Congress. From there, he launched a gubernatorial bid in Florida, took office in 2011 and quickly aligned himself with Govs. Rick Perry of Texas and Bobby Jindal of Louisiana — outspoken conservatives who have refused to lift a finger to implement Obamacare. A few days after Obama won reelection, Scott gave a surprising interview to The Associated Press hinting a softening in his stalwart opposition. Amid unfavorable polls at home, Scott talked about wanting to work with the feds on the health law. Scott’s Obamacare diplomacy led to a high-profile early January meeting with HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, after which both sides expressed a commitment to keep working together. It also became apparent that Scott was trying to win concessions from HHS on how to design Florida’s Medicaid program. He won approval of two waivers — and the announcement came just hours after the second one.

Already in such countries as America, almost every family has a car. Many accidents happen because cars are now made to travel very fast. Also, people waste time and money every day as long lines of cars move slowly into towns and cities. In most big towns it is very hard to find parking spaces. Wide, smooth , straight roads must be built now in place of the old and narrow roads. These roads must not pass through towns and cities. They must not be crossed by other roads. Today such roads are being built in many countries in the world. These roads have at least two lanes , one for slow-moving traffic and the other for fast-moving traffic. These roads do not pass through town and cities; horses and bikes are not allowed on them. Accidents do not usually happen. Cars can travel hundreds of miles without having to stop. But these modem roads often cannot be built in towns and cities. Before a road in a town can be made wider, many buildings have to be pulled down. Some people feel that more car-parks should be built outside a city, then the drivers should leave their cars and catch a bus or take a taxi to their offices.

Write a summary based on this article: LAS VEGAS A mortar explosion at a Army munitions depot in Nevada killed seven Marines from Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, and injured eight other service members during a live-fire training exercise, military officials said on Tuesday. A Marine Corps official said a 60mm mortar round exploded prematurely on Monday night during training at the Hawthorne Army Depot in western Nevada. The cause was under investigation. \\"The Marines were conducting live fire and maneuver training at the Hawthorne Army depot,\\" Brigadier General Jim Lukeman told a news conference in North Carolina. \\"A mortar round exploded in the mortar tube, causing the deaths of seven. ... We don't know yet what caused this malfunction.\\" The blast was among the deadliest such training accidents on U.S. soil in recent years. In February 2012, seven Marines were killed when two helicopters collided during an exercise along the California-Arizona border. The Marines killed on Monday had been undergoing training for the past month at the Marine Corps Mountain Warfare Training Center in Bridgeport, California, and at Hawthorne. \\"This type of training is really the type of training that we do to be able to be that force of readiness. It is what's required of our nation's military, to do the things this nation asks us to do,\\" Lukeman said, adding the training was not linked to preparations for a specific impending deployment. The Marines ordered a blanket suspension of the use of 60mm mortars pending a review after the blast, Marine Corps spokeswoman Captain Kendra Motz said in a statement. The blast victims were airlifted to Renown Regional Medical Center in Reno with injuries that included penetration trauma, fractures and vascular injuries, said Stacy Kendall, a spokeswoman for the medical center. Seven Marines and a Navy sailor were wounded. Of those, six were in serious or very serious condition, including the sailor, while a seventh suffered minor injuries and an eighth was treated and released, the Marines said in a statement. NIGHTTIME ACCIDENT The explosion occurred close to 10 p.m. PDT (0500 GMT Tuesday) during an exercise at the Hawthorne depot, about 92 miles southeast of Reno, said facility manager Russ Collier. The Marines described the mortar involved as lightweight, and said it was typically fired from a stationary position. The identities of the dead, all from the 2nd Marine Division, and injured had not been made public, but will be released after their families are notified. U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel was receiving updates on the accident, Pentagon spokesman George Little said, adding the incident struck a nerve with Hagel, himself an infantry veteran of the Vietnam War. \\"This brought back memories of a training accident when he was in the U.S. Army when two soldiers were killed in a training accident, so he takes these incidents very much to heart,\\" Little said. Hawthorne Army Depot is a 147,000-acre (60,000-acre) site used for the storage and destruction of demilitarized ammunition. Its location in Nevada's isolated high desert is also considered an ideal training environment for Special Operations forces preparing for deployments to Southwest Asia, according to a U.S. military website. The facility was established as a naval staging area for bombs, rockets and ammunition, and was used by the Navy during most of World War Two. It was transferred to the Army in 1977. The accident came a week after a U.S. military plane assigned to a Washington state Naval Air Station crashed during a routine training flight, killing all three crew members on board. (Reporting by Chris Francescani in New York, David Alexander in Washington, and Cynthia Johnston in Las Vegas; Writing by Chris Francescani and Steve Gorman; Editing by Leslie Gevirtz and Peter Cooney) ||||| Updated 10:11 p.m. ET HAWTHORNE, Nev. A mortar shell explosion killed seven Marines and injured several more during mountain warfare training in Nevada's high desert, prompting the Pentagon to immediately halt the use of the weapons until an investigation can determine their safety, officials said Tuesday. The explosion occurred Monday night at the Hawthorne Army Depot, a sprawling facility used by troops heading overseas, during an exercise involving the 2nd Marine Expeditionary Force from Camp Lejeune, N.C. Several Marines from the unit were injured in the blast, authorities said. The Marines were practicing firing mortars, reports CBS affiliate KTVN-TV in Reno, when one of the rounds exploded while still inside the tube. Brig. Gen. Jim Lukeman said investigators were trying to determine the cause of the malfunction. The Pentagon expanded a temporary ban to prohibit the military from firing any 60 mm mortar rounds until the results of the investigation. The Marine Corps said Tuesday a \\"blanket suspension\\" of 60 mm mortars and associated firing tubes is in effect. The Pentagon earlier had suspended use of all high-explosive and illumination mortar rounds that were in the same manufacturing lots as ones fired in Nevada. It was not immediately clear whether more than a single round exploded, a Marine Corps official said, speaking on condition of anonymity because the official wasn't authorized to speak about an ongoing investigation. The Marine Corps said early Tuesday that seven Marines were killed. Eight men under the age of 30 were taken to Renown Regional Medical Center in Reno. One of them died, four were in serious condition, two were in fair condition and another was discharged, said spokesman Mark Earnest. The identities of those killed won't be released until 24 hours after their families are notified. \\"We send our prayers and condolences to the families of Marines involved in this tragic incident,\\" said the force's commander, Maj. Gen. Raymond C. Fox. \\"We mourn their loss, and it is with heavy hearts we remember their courage and sacrifice.\\" The rescue was complicated by the remoteness of the site, which is favored because the harsh geography simulates conditions in Afghanistan. The 60 mm mortar is a weapon that traditionally requires three to four Marines to operate, but it's common during training for others to observe nearby. The firing tube is supported in a tripod-like design and fires roughly a 3-pound shell, some 14 inches in length and a bit larger than 2 inches in diameter. The mortar has changed little since World War II and remains one of the simplest weapons to operate, which is why it is found at the lowest level of infantry units, said Joseph Trevithick, a mortar expert with Global Security.org. \\"Basically, it's still a pipe and it's got a firing pin at the bottom,\\" Trevithick said. Still, a number of things could go wrong, such as a fuse malfunction, a problem with the barrel's assembly, or a round prematurely detonating inside the tube, he said. The Marine Corps official said an explosion at the point of firing in a training exercise could kill or maim anyone in or near the protective mortar pit and could concussively detonate any mortars stored nearby in a phenomenon known as \\"sympathetic detonation.\\" The official said a worldwide moratorium after such an accident is not unusual and would persist until the investigation determines that the weapon did not malfunction in ways that would hurt other Marines or that mortar shells manufactured at the same time as the one involved in the accident were safe. The official said it would be normal to warn other U.S. military branches that use 60 mm mortars, such as the Army, about the Marines warning. The moratorium could last for weeks or months. The investigation will focus on whether the Marines followed procedures to properly fire the weapon, or whether there was a malfunction in the firing device or in the explosive mortar shell itself, the official said.

They are a great way to freshen your look and meet friends without spending any money. Look online for clothing swaps in your area, or organize one with friends or social media contacts. Organize larger clothing swaps by handing out tickets or vouchers for each item a person brings, which can then be used to procure another item. Garage sales and flea markets are a great way to find unique, interesting items to add to your home for next to no money. Keep an eye on local newspaper listings and social media for events like this happening in your community. Be sure to arrive early to ensure that you get the best selection of the day's deals and offerings. If you have read books that you are ready to get rid of, look for book swapping events in your area. If no live events are happening, visit an book trading website to barter books. Certain sites will find people interested in your books, then send you credits for what you've traded to obtain other books listed on the site. Look for a book swapping website that provides easy-to-print shipping labels, like http://www.paperbackswap.com/. Extreme couponing involves combining coupons and promotions to get hefty savings on in-store items at grocery stores, department stores, and pharmacies. Look online for coupons for your favorite products to print out and use. Compare prices and weekly sales at different stores to make sure that your coupon savings will go as far as possible.

Putting up wallpaper is not just about aesthetic appeal, it also involves a good amount of skill, patience, and an eye for detail. He started by choosing a wallpaper that suits the room in terms of color, pattern, and texture. Perhaps he opted for a striking, colorful print to add a touch of personality or maybe a neutral tone for a calming ambiance. Armed with his measuring tape, adhesive, and utility knife, among other tools, he began the process of cutting the wallpaper into strips that fit the height of the wall. He made sure to add a few extra inches to account for any incidental shortages or unexpected discrepancies in wall dimensions. His focus was on getting the measurements just right, to ensure that each strip of wallpaper would align perfectly with the wall corners, window frames, and ceiling line. After completing the measurements, the next step was to apply adhesive on the back of the wallpaper. He smeared it evenly across the surface, making sure to cover every inch to prevent any empty spaces that could lead to bubbles or loosening over time. He also paid close attention to the adhesive's drying time to guarantee its correct and effective adhesion. Slowly and carefully, he started to affix the wallpaper on the wall, beginning from the top and smoothing down towards the floor. He used a smoothing brush to eliminate any bubbles and wrinkles that could ruin the final look. Having a keen eye, he ensured the patterned wallpaper matched at the seams, creating a seamless look. In the process of wallpapering, he encountered some obstacles like outlets and light switches. However, with a quick precision cut with his utility knife, he managed to neatly trim around these areas, maintaining the wallpaper’s continuity and the room's aesthetics. After installing each strip, he used a seam roller to firmly secure the edges of the wallpaper strips together. This smoothed out the seams and ensured a tight bond, keeping the wallpaper attractive and durable for years. He continued this process, repeating the measuring, cutting, pasting, and applying until every wall in the room was covered. Then, he stepped back to review his work. He scrutinized every inch of the wallpapered walls, looking for any imperfections or inconsistencies. If he noticed any areas that needed attention - a small bubble or a loose edge - he swiftly attended to it, keen to ensure the finished job was as perfect as possible. In conclusion, while wallpapering a wall may seem like a simple task, this man puts a significant amount of attention, care, and precision into every step of the process to ensure the best possible end result. His work reflects not only his skills but also his standards and dedication to perfection in his work."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Do these questions have the same meaning? What are some of the types of computer viruses? What are the different types of computer viruses?","completion":"Yes, these two questions essentially have the same meaning as both are inquiring about the various types of computer viruses. While the phrasing is slightly different, the goal of each question is to obtain information about the different categories or kinds of computer viruses that currently exist or have existed in the past. Computer viruses are malicious programs capable of self-replication and spreading to other computers or networks, causing harm to the infected systems, software, and user data. The purpose of most computer viruses is to disrupt normal computer operations or to extract sensitive information. There are many types of computer viruses, but some of the most common ones include: 1. Resident viruses: These viruses embed themselves in a computer's memory and operate silently while the computer is running. Resident viruses can interfere with system processes, corrupting files or system functions. 2. Non-resident viruses: Unlike resident viruses, non-resident viruses are stored in files on the infected computer's hard drive. They typically spread by attaching themselves to other files or programs when executed. 3. Boot sector viruses: These viruses specifically target the boot sector of a computer's hard drive, which is responsible for starting the operating system. By infecting this part of a computer, a boot sector virus can cause the system to become inoperable. 4. Macro viruses: These viruses are written in macro languages, such as Visual Basic for Applications (VBA), and are primarily found in documents or files created by software like Microsoft Office. Macro viruses have the ability to spread easily across different applications and platforms. 5. File infector viruses: These viruses attach themselves to executable files (.exe or .com) and infect the system when the user launches the infected file. They can overwrite or modify the original file, causing system malfunctions or data corruption. 6. Polymorphic viruses: Polymorphic viruses change their code each time they replicate, making it difficult for antivirus software to detect them. By using encryption and constantly altering their code, these viruses can often evade detection and removal. 7. Multipartite viruses: These viruses can infect a system in multiple ways, such as targeting both the boot sector and executable files. Multipartite viruses are versatile and can spread quickly through a computer network. 8. Worms: Worms are a type of virus that can self-replicate without needing to attach themselves to other files. They can quickly exhaust system resources, such as memory and processing power, causing the computer to slow down or crash. 9. Trojans: Trojans are malicious programs that disguise themselves as legitimate software. While they don't self-replicate, they can cause damage to the infected system, such as creating backdoors for hackers to access or take control of the computer. 10. Ransomware: This type of malware encrypts user's files or locks access to the computer, demanding a ransom payment from the victim to restore their data. Ransomware has become increasingly common in recent years, with high-profile attacks on businesses and government agencies. Although the two questions are phrased differently, both seek to understand the various types of computer viruses that can cause harm to computer systems, software, and sensitive information."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It's a universal language that transcends cultural and physical boundaries and allows us to express our individuality as well as appreciate those around us. The dance floor may be a diverse, dynamic, and ever-changing stage, but the key to making the most of this shared experience is finding the right dance partner. In this article, we'll explore why choosing the right person to dance with is essential and how you can take your dancing skills to the next level, including stepping up from twerking. Finding The Perfect Dance Partner 1. Be open to new connections: The first step in finding a dance partner is keeping an open mind. Expanding your social circle and meeting new people will increase the chances of finding someone with a shared interest in dancing. Networking at dance classes or workshops, joining local dance groups, or attending social dance events can all lead to new connections and potential dance partners. 2. Compatibility: Dancing can be a deeply personal and intimate experience, so picking someone with whom you feel comfortable is paramount. Your partner should be someone you don't mind getting close to and can trust. Communication and a mutual understanding of boundaries are essential for a successful dance connection. 3. Dancing ability and style: While dancing can be enjoyed by people of all skill levels, finding a partner whose abilities complement your own will enhance the experience. Discuss your preferences and be open to learning new styles together. By catering to each other's strengths and weaknesses, you can create a symbiotic relationship on the dance floor. Stepping Up from Twerking to New Dance Styles Having found a dance partner you're comfortable with, it's time to broaden your repertoire and elevate your skills. While twerking may be a popular dance style, learning additional styles can be beneficial. 1. Challenge yourself: Learning a new dance style or technique can be both challenging and rewarding. Expanding your skills will not only improve your overall dancing abilities but also present new opportunities to perform and connect with others. 2. Adaptability: Becoming familiar with multiple dance styles not only allows you to adapt to various types of music and settings but also enhances your appreciation for different cultures and traditions. Diverse dancing experiences can provide a broader perspective and a deeper understanding of the art form. 3. The art of partnership: To truly excel in partner dance styles, such as ballroom, salsa, or even swing, communication and collaboration are crucial.

Grunge guitarists use very loud Marshall guitar amplifiers and some used powerful Mesa-Boogie amplifiers, including Kurt Cobain and Dave Grohl (the latter in early, grunge-oriented Foo Fighters songs ). Grunge has been called the rock genre with the most \\"lugubrious sound\\"; the use of heavy distortion and loud amps has been compared to a massive \\"buildup of sonic fog\\". or even dismissed as \\"noise\\" by one critic.

The Domesday Survey of 1086 does not directly mention Ashton, perhaps because only a partial survey of the area had been taken. However, it is thought that St Michael's Church, mentioned in the Domesday entry for the ancient parish of Manchester, was in Ashton (also spelt Asheton, Asshton and Assheton). The town itself was first mentioned in the 12th century when the manor was part of the barony of Manchester. By the late 12th century, a family who adopted the name Assheton held the manor on behalf of the Gresleys, barons of Manchester. Ashton Old Hall was a manor house, the administrative centre of the manor, and the seat of the de Ashton or de Assheton family. With three wings, the hall was \\"one of the finest great houses in the North West\\" of the 14th century. It has been recognised as important for being one of the few great houses in south-east Lancashire and possibly one of the few halls influenced by French design in the country. The town was granted a Royal Charter in 1414, which allowed it to hold a fair twice a year, and a market on every Monday, making the settlement a market town.According to popular tradition, Sir Ralph de Assheton, who was lord of the manor in the mid-14th century and known as the Black Knight, was an unpopular and cruel feudal lord. After his death, his unpopularity led the locals to parade an effigy of him around the town each Easter Monday and collect money. Afterwards the effigy would be hung up, shot, and set on fire, before being torn apart and thrown into the crowd. The first recorded occurrence of the event was in 1795, although the tradition may be older; it continued into the 1830s.The manor remained in the possession of the Assheton family until 1514 when its male line terminated. The lordship of the manor passed to Sir George Booth, great-great grandson of Sir Thomas Ashton, devolving through the Booth family until the Earls of Stamford inherited it through marriage in 1758.

Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below. Which species' traits would be less common, species A or species B? David wants to revisit the theory of evolution proposed by Darwin and Wallace. He is particularly interested in two species of deer, species A and species B. Species A has some helpful traits, but species B has some harmful traits. He is planning to write a paper on why some species are greater in number while others are smaller in number. Hint: The theory of evolution by natural selection was proposed at about the same time by both Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace, shown in Figure below , and was set out in detail in Darwin's 1859 book On the Origin of Species . Natural selection is a process that causes heritable traits that are helpful for survival and reproduction to become more common, and harmful traits, or traits that are not helpful or advantageous for survival to become more rare in a population of organisms. This occurs because organisms with advantageous traits are more \\"fit\\" to survive in a particular environment and have \\"adapted\\" to the conditions of that environment. These individuals will have greater reproductive success than organisms less fit for survival in the environment. This will lead to an increase in the number of organisms with the advantageous trait(s) over time. Over many generations, adaptations occur through a combination of successive, small, random changes in traits, and natural selection of those variants best-suited for their environment. Natural selection is one of the cornerstones of modern biology.

Step 1: Understanding the term 'narrative conventions' Narrative conventions are elements and techniques employed by authors to craft a compelling story. These conventions include, but are not limited to, plot, setting, point of view, character development, and dialogue. Step 2: Explaining how narrative conventions are used in writing a story Narrative conventions are used by authors to create a well-structured and engaging story. They function together to develop the plot, explore themes, and create believable, relatable characters. These elements provide a foundation on which the writer can construct a unique and creative narrative while still adhering to the rules, traditions, or practices of storytelling. Second question: What are the most common clichés in fiction writing? Step 1: Defining 'clichés' in the context of fiction writing Clichés are overused phrases, ideas, or elements in writing that have lost their originality and power to surprise or engage the reader due to repetition and overuse. Step 2: Listing the most common clichés in fiction writing 1. The chosen one: A character destined to save the world or solve a great problem. 2. Love triangle: A romantic relationship where three people are involved, often causing conflict and drama. 3. Amnesia: A character loses their memory and must rediscover their past or identity. 4.

Let's follow these steps: Step 1: Simplify the left side of the equation: 1 - 1 = 0 Now, our equation looks like this: 0 = 10*d Step 2: Isolate the variable d: To isolate d, we need to get d alone on one side of the equation. Since 10 is multiplied by d, we will perform the opposite operation, which is division, to both sides of the equation. We will divide both sides by 10: 0 ÷ 10 = (10*d) ÷ 10 Step 3: Simplify both sides: 0 = d So, the solution to the equation 1 - 1 = 10*d for d is d = 0."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The rest nearly fell out of their chairs laughing. \\"Don't be silly, only geniuses can become writers,\\" the English teacher said, \\"And you are getting a D this semester.\\" I was so humiliated that I burst into tears. That night I wrote a short sad poem about broken dreams and mailed it to the Capri's Weekly newspaper. To my astonishment, they published it and sent me two dollars. I was a published and paid writer. I showed it to my teacher and fellow students. They laughed. \\"Just plain dumb luck,\\" the teacher said. I tasted success. I'd sold the first thing I'd ever written. That was more than any of them had done and if it was just dumb luck, that was fine with me. During the next two years I sold dozens of poems, letters, jokes and recipes. By the time I graduated from high school, with a C minus average, I had scrapbooks filled with my published work. I never mentioned my writing to my teachers, friends or my family again. They were dream killers and if people must choose between their friends and their dreams, they must always choose their dreams. I had four children at the time, and the oldest was only four. While the children slept, I typed on my ancient typewriter. I wrote what I felt. It took nine months, just like a baby. A month later Crying Wind, the title of my book, became a best seller, was translated into fifteen languages and Braille and sold worldwide. I appeared on TV talk shows. I traveled from New York to California and Canada on promotional tours. My first book also became required reading in native American schools in Canada. People ask what college I attended, what degrees I had and what qualifications I have to be a writer. The answer is: \\"None.\\" I just write. I'm not a genius. I'm not gifted and I don't write right. To all those who dream of writing, I'm shouting at you: \\"Yes, you can. Yes, you can. Don't listen to them.\\" I don't write right but I've...

Over the weekend, brokerages and fund managers vowed to buy stocks, helped by a state-owned margin finance firm, which in turn would be helped with liquidity from the central bank. Despite this, the Shanghai Composite was down 1.5% at 3,732.13 on Tuesday. That comes despite signs of heavy money flows into Shanghai's blue chip stocks. State media said 21 brokerages had put more than 128bn yuan (20.6bn; Â£13bn) into a stabilisation fund to meet their weekend pledges to support the market. About 57 mutual fund houses were also reported to have started buying equities using 2.16bn yuan of their own money. However, the significant downtrend in the market is raising concerns about whether policymakers have the ability to stabilise the market. Local reports said more than 200 Chinese-listed firms would halt trading of their shares, in an attempt protect themselves from the falling stock markets. But Bernard Aw, market strategist at trading firm IG, said he expected authorities to continue to \\"implement stronger measures until the stock market stabilises\\". In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index fell 0.8% to 25,039.93.

A few weeks after Of Human Feelings was recorded, Mwanga went to Japan to negotiate a deal with Trio Records to have the album released on Phrase Text. Trio, who had previously released a compilation of Coleman's 1966 to 1971 live performances in Paris, prepared to press the album once Mwanga provided the label with the record stamper. Coleman was also set to perform his song \\"Skies of America\\" with the NHK Symphony Orchestra, but cancelled both deals upon Mwanga's return from Japan. Mwanga immediately quit after less than four months as Coleman's manager. In 1981, Coleman hired Stan and Sid Bernstein as his managers, who sold the album's recording tapes to Island Records. He signed with the record label that year, and Of Human Feelings was released in 1982 on Island's subsidiary jazz label Antilles Records. Billboard magazine published a front-page story at the time about its distinction as both the first digital album recorded in New York City and the first digital jazz album recorded by an American label.According to jazz writer Francis Davis, \\"a modest commercial breakthrough seemed imminent\\" for Coleman, who appeared to be regaining his celebrity. German musicologist Peter Niklas Wilson said the album may have been the most tuneful and commercial-sounding of his career at that point. The album's clean mix and relatively short tracks were interpreted as an attempt for radio airplay by Mandel, who described its production as \\"the surface consistency that would put it in the pop sphere\\". Of Human Feelings had no success on the American pop charts, only charting on the Top Jazz Albums, where it spent 26 weeks and peaked at number 15. Because the record offered a middle ground between funk and jazz, McRae argued that it consequently appealed to neither demographic of listeners. Sound & Vision critic Brent Butterworth speculated that it was overlooked because it had electric instruments, rock and funk drumming, and did not conform to what he felt was the hokey image of jazz that many of the genre's fans...

They clinched their first title in 1992, followed by a back-to-back championship in 1993. In 1992, the Blue Jays faced the Atlanta Braves in the World Series. The Jays defeated the highly competitive Braves in six games, securing their first championship. Toronto clinched the title on October 24, 1992, with a final game score of 4-3. This victory marked the first time that a team outside the United States had won the World Series. The Blue Jays' exploits in the 1992 season also made them the first team in Major League Baseball (MLB) expansion history to win the title within 20 years. The Blue Jays continued their winning streak by conquering the 1993 World Series against the Philadelphia Phillies. Under manager Cito Gaston, they bested the Phillies in a six-game series. The championship-clinching match took place on October 23, 1993, with a dramatic walk-off home run by Blue Jays designated hitter Joe Carter in the bottom of the ninth inning. This memorable moment led to a final game score of 8-6, earning them back-to-back titles. These triumphant years for the Toronto Blue Jays placed them among the list of dominating teams in the early 1990s. Although the team has not captured a World Series title since then, they continue to be competitive in the MLB, with playoff appearances in 2015 and 2016."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Bobby Darin (born Walden Robert Cassotto; May 14, 1936 - December 20, 1973) was an American singer, songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, and actor in film and television. He performed jazz, pop, rock and roll, folk, swing, and country music. He started his career as a songwriter for Connie Francis. Born Walden Robert Cassotto in the East Harlem neighborhood of New York City, Bobby Darin was reared by his maternal grandmother, whom he believed was his mother. Darin's birth mother, Vanina Juliette \\"Nina\\" Cassotto (born November 30, 1917), became pregnant with him in the summer of 1935 when she was 17. Presumably because of the scandalous nature of out-of-wedlock pregnancies in that era, Nina and her mother hatched a plan to pass her baby off as Nina's younger brother. Years later, when Nina finally told Darin the truth about his upbringing, she refused to reveal the identity of his biological father, and kept the secret to her death in 1983. Darin's maternal grandfather, Saverio Antonio \\"Big Sam Curly\\" Cassotto (born January 26, 1882), was of Italian descent and a would-be mobster who died in prison from pneumonia a year before Darin's birth. His maternal grandmother, Vivian Fern Walden (also born in 1882), who called herself Polly, was of English ancestry and a vaudeville singer. From his birth, Darin always believed Nina to be his older sister and Polly his mother. But in 1968, when he was 32, Nina told Darin the truth, reportedly devastating him. By the time he was a teenager, Darin could play several instruments, including piano, drums, and guitar. He later added harmonica and xylophone. Darin moved to the Bronx early in his life (with a rented summer home in Staten Island) and graduated from the prestigious Bronx High School of Science. In later years he attributed his arrogance to his experiences there, where he was surrounded by brighter students who teased him. He then enrolled at Hunter College and soon gravitated to the drama department. After only two semesters, he dropped out to pursue an acting career.

Summarize this article: The mother of Modern Family starfiled an incident report with the Los Angeles Sheriff’s Department after she allegedly caught her 14-year-old daughter engaged in a sexual act with an 18-year-old man. The police filing — obtained exclusively by Celebuzz — details “suspicious circumstances, possible unlawful sex with minor,” according to the officer who spoke to Chris Workman, Winter’s mother, on October 6. Celebuzz has chosen not to name Winter’s boyfriend, who was identified by the young star’s mother and told to law enforcement. “On 09-24-12, at approximately 2200-hours, she walked in the guest bedroom of her home and found her daughter, Ariel Winter Workman, in bed with boyfriend, [Name Redacted],” the three-page report claims. Workman told the Sheriff explicit details about what she saw when she walked into the room at her Montrose, Calif. home. Celebuzz has chosen not to report the full recollections of Workman because of the graphic account. “The informant (Workman) said the guest bedroom door was left wide open when she walked in,” Workman told police. “According to the informant, Ariel and [Name Redacted] have been boyfriend/girlfriend for approximately 5 months. She has attempted to break them up because of their age difference.” Winter nor the boyfriend have not responded to a request for comment from Celebuzz. In an earlier statement on Thursday, Workman claimed her teenage daughter’s relationship with the man, four years her senior, was the real reason behind the young actress’ decision to ask a judge to temporarily place her in her sister’s care. According to court papers, a Los Angeles Superior Court judge put Winter, who plays teenager Alex Dunphy on the Emmy-winning TV comedy, under the temporary guardianship of her older sister, Shanelle Gray. Workman told Celebuzz she “caught them engaging in behavior that I feel my daughter is too young mentally and physically to understand.” “I put a stop to it immediately,” Workman said. “I filed charges against him because legally he is an adult and if he wants to engage in adult behavior with a minor than he should also be ready to suffer adult consequences for his actions and poor judgment. “I will not apologize for protecting my daughter, as she means the world to me and I will always be there for her and I will always protect her to the best of my ability until the day I die.” In the incident report, the officer noted that he had been unable to speak with Winter and her guardian, Gray. “I was not able to contact Ariel because she is currently living with her older sister, Shanelle Gray, somewhere in Studio City,” the Sheriff wrote. “The informant does not have much of a relationship with her daughter Shanelle and does not have her address or telephone number. In addition, Ariel recently changed her cellular number. She did not give her number to the informant.” The officer said he also tried to call the boyfriend and his mother but was unable to make contact with either of them. “The informant mentioned that on 10-03-12, Ariel contacted The Department of Child and Family Services (DCFS). Ariel alleged that her mother (Informant) abused her. The informat has not yet been contacted by DCFS. The officer added: “I asked the informant why she did not report the incident when it occurred. She said, at the time she was uncertain as to what she wanted to do. She wanted to seek advice from her friends and her attorney.

Chris Workman, Winter’s mother, told Celebuzz in an exclusive statement that she “caught them engaging in behavior that I feel my daughter is too young mentally and physically to understand.” “I put a stop to it immediately,” Workman added, revealing she pressed charges against the unknown male teenager. It is not known what charges were filed, or with what law enforcement agency. “I filed charges against him because legally he is an adult and if he wants to engage in adult behavior with a minor than he should also be ready to suffer adult consequences for his actions and poor judgment,” Workman told Celebuzz. The mother did not elaborate further about what the alleged “behavior” was between the pair. “I will not apologize for protecting my daughter, as she means the world to me and I will always be there for her and I will always protect her to the best of my ability until the day I die,” Workman said. According to court papers filed on October 3, a Los Angeles Superior Court judge put Winter, who plays teenager Alex Dunphy on the Emmy-winning TV comedy, under the temporary guardianship of her older sister, Shanelle Gray. Workman was alleged to have slapped and emotionally abused her daughter, according to the website TMZ. Winter was removed from her mother’s home and her sister will retain guardianship until a November 20 court hearing. In her emotional statement, Workman said Winter’s sister came “out of the woodwork” once it was announced the cast were to receive substantial salary increases. The Modern Family cast filed a lawsuit in a bit to better their deals to appear on ABC’s top-rated comedy. Said Workman: “She has only seen her little sister maybe ten times in the last fourteen years. “They have no relationship and her motives are not out of love, but out of spite. She had problems as a child and she and I have maybe seen each other a dozen times in the last twenty years. “I made a conscious decision years ago to distance her from the family because of the lies she told on me so many years ago. “I never wanted her unstableness to effect Ariel or anyone else in the family.” The distraught mother of the promising starlet added: “My biggest nightmare is now being played out in the public arena for people to make judgments on me and my daughter and our family. I only hope that as quickly as this blew up, that it will go away just as fast and Ariel will come home and we can move forward with love as a family.” Workman’s full statement to Celebuzz reads as follows: “I love my daughter very much. I would never abuse her in anyway and I have always tried my best to always protect her and do what is right for her. My daughter is in a business that requires you to grow up fast. It’s hard enough being a teenage girl, but it’s even harder when you are in the public eye. However, because you are in the public eye, it doesn’t mean you are no longer in need of good parenting. My fourteen year old daughter has been dating a eighteen and half year old man and when I caught them engaging in behavior that I feel my daughter is too young mentally and physically to understand and fully grasp I put a stop to it immediately. Being a teenager “in love” I thought she would cry and sulk and eventually her broken heart would heal. I would have never of dreamed, that she would take it to this level. Yes, I filed charges against him because legally he is an adult and if he wants to engage in adult behavior with a minor than he should also be ready to suffer adult consequences for his actions and poor judgment. I will not apologize for protecting my daughter, as she means the world to me and I will always be there for her and I will always protect her to the best of my ability until the day I die.” “As for my estranged daughter, who has come out of the woodwork once it was announced that the kids on the show got a big raise recently, I will only say this, she has only seen her little sister maybe ten times in the last fourteen years, they have no relationship and her motives are not out of love, but out of spite. She had problems as a child and she and I have maybe seen each other a dozen times in the last twenty years. I made a conscious decision years ago to distance her from the family because of the lies she told on me so many years ago. I never wanted her unstableness to effect Ariel or anyone else in the family.

TMZ has learned -- because they think the mother is making up stories of an illicit sexual relationship to save face after she was stripped of custody.TMZ broke the story ... a judge determined allegations thatwas physically and emotionally abusing Ariel were so serious, he awarded temporary custody to Ariel's older sister -- and ordered Chrystal to stay 100 yards away from her young daughter.Law enforcement sources tell us they're not buying Chrystal's claim Ariel was involved in a sexual relationship with an 18-year-old boy, largely because the mom never went to cops until AFTER she lost custody on October 3 -- even though she claims the affair's been going on since the beginning of summer.Court sources tell us the first time Chrystal mentioned ANYTHING about an illicit relationship was during the guardianship hearing last month ... when she began ranting in court and called the guardianship lawyer a \\"moron.\\"We're told she testified about a specific incident on Sept. 24, saying ... \\"I caught my daughter with her boyfriend in bed -- she's 14. He's 18 and I threw him out and I broke them up.\\"Due, in no small part, to the timing of Chrystal's testimony ... one law enforcement source tells us they don't believe there was ever a sexual relationship between Ariel and the boy. ||||| There's nothing funny about Modern Family funnygal Ariel Winter's family travails. The 14-year-old has been removed from her mother's care following allegations in court documents of physical and emotional abuse, and now the star's adult sister is seeking permanent guardianship over her sibling. Police have confirmed to E! News that an active investigation is under way but declined to provide additional details. E! News has also learned that the detective handling the case is with the special victims bureau. Herewith, a guide to the key players in Ariel's family drama. ||||| It’s the real-life Modern Family feud that has turned ugly. In yet another twist in the allegations of parental abuse involving young star Ariel Winter, the family’s pediatrician has signed a letter defending the woman accused of delivering years of emotional and physical abuse, Chris Workman “There has never been any evidence of an abusive relationship in regards to Ariel,” John Rodarte, M.D. wrote a letter dated Oct. 18, 2012, two weeks after the 14-year-old asked a Los Angeles Superior Court judge to place her under the guardianship of her older sister, Shanelle Gray. The doctor added, “Ariel ‘Winter’ Workman has been a patient of ours since 1998. Her mother has always been conscientious in bringing Ariel to her appointments.” As Celebuzz exclusively reported, Workman has claimed the real reason her daughter went to court was because she attempted to break-up her daughter and her older boyfriend. Indeed, Winter’s mother filed an incident report with the Los Angeles Sheriff’s Department allegedly caught her 14-year-old daughter engaged in a sexual act with an 18-year-old man, who Celebuzz has decided not to name. A missive from a second pediatrician was also provided to police and the court to defend Workman against claims she abused Shanelle Gray, too. Virginia-based pediatrician Carl Hanfling, M.D. wrote, in a a letter dated May 27, 1994, that he “never observed… negligence or child abuse.” “Shanelle Workman has been a patient of mine since birth,” Hanfling said. “I or my staff have never observed any suggestion of negligence or child abuse. On the contrary, both parents have always demonstrated extraordinary concern and have been loving, caring mother and father.” According to court papers filed Oct. 3, Winter claimed her mother subjected her to “ongoing physical abuse (slapping, hitting, pushing) and emotional abuse (vile name-calling, personal insults about minor and minor’s weight, attempts to ‘sexualize’ minor, deprivation of food, etc.) for an extended period of time”. Faced with the allegations, a judge not only granted temporary custody but also ordered Workman not to come within 100 yards of her daughter. A representative for Winter did not want to comment about the case or the police filing when approached late on Thursday. In the incident report we obtained, police noted “suspicious circumstances, possible unlawful sex with minor,” following the interview with Winter’s mother on October 6 — three days after the minor went to court. “On 09-24-12, at approximately 2200-hours, she walked in the guest bedroom of her home and found her daughter, Ariel Winter Workman, in bed with boyfriend, [Name Redacted],” the three-page report claims. Workman told the Sheriff explicit details about what she saw when she walked into the room at her Montrose, Calif. home. Celebuzz has chosen not to report the full recollections of Workman because of the graphic account. “The informant (Workman) said the guest bedroom door was left wide open when she walked in,” Workman told police. “According to the informant, Ariel and [Name Redacted] have been boyfriend/girlfriend for approximately 5 months. She has attempted to break them up because of their age difference.” The next court hearing involving Winter and her mother is scheduled to be heart on Nov. 20. – Additional Reporting by Dylan Howard Celebuzz Editor in Chief Dylan Howard joins ‘The Daily Buzz’ host Hyla to break down the latest developments in the Ariel Winter case, below.

Assuming that the atmospheric pressure is standard, the temperature will rise steadily until it reaches 100°C. At this point, the added energy from the heat will cause the liquid to begin to vaporize. As with the previous state change, the temperature will remain at 100°C while the water molecules are going from the liquid to the gas or vapor state. Once all the liquid has completely boiled away, continued heating of the steam (remember the container is closed) will increase its temperature above 100°C.

I got to know people by the flowers they planted that I had to remember not to cut down, by the things they lost in the grass or struck in the ground on purpose. I reached the point with most of them when I knew in advance what complaint was about to be spoken, which request was most important. And I learned something about the measure of my neighbors by their preferred method of payment: by the job, by the month--or not at all. Mr. Ballou fell into the last category, and he always had a reason why. On one day, he had no change for a fifty, on another he was flat out of checks, on another, he was simply out when I knocked on his door. Still, except for the money apart, he was a nice enough guy, always waving or tipping his hat when he'd seen me from a distance. I figured him for a thin retirement check, maybe a work-related injury that kept him from doing his own yard work. Sure, I kept track of the total, but I didn't worry about the amount too much. Grass was grass, and the little that Mr. Ballou's property comprised didn't take long to trim . Then, one late afternoon in mid-July, the hottest time of the year, I was walking by his house and he opened the door, mentioned me to come inside. The hall was cool, shaded, and it took my eyes a minute to adjust to the dim light. \\"I owe you,\\" Mr Ballou said, \\"but...\\" I thought I'd save him the trouble of thinking of a new excuse. \\"No problem.

So, our simplified equation is: 33*d + 198 = 0 Step 3: Solve for d Now, we want to isolate the variable d by moving non-d terms to the other side of the equation. First, we'll subtract 198 from both sides of the equation: 33*d + 198 - 198 = 0 - 198 This simplifies to: 33*d = -198 Now, to isolate d, divide both sides of the equation by 33: d = -198 / 33 Step 4: Perform the calculation -198 divided by 33 equals -6: d = -6 Answer: The value of d is -6."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Today, we're going to learn about a fun event that happened in Sheffield. Do you know who Jarvis Cocker is? He's a very famous man who sings songs and talks on the radio too! He is the frontman of a band called Pulp, which means he's the main person who sings in the band. They made lots of fun and popular songs that many people enjoy listening to. And guess what? He recently did something exciting with trams in Sheffield! Trams are like long buses with lots of wheels that run on tracks, like a train. They go around the city taking people to different places, like school or the shops. In Sheffield, where Jarvis Cocker is from, they have special announcements that play on the tram to let people know where they are going. These announcements are usually made by a recorded voice, so everyone can hear clearly and know when to get off the tram. Now, Jarvis Cocker has used his cool voice to re-record those announcements for the Sheffield trams! That means that instead of hearing the old voice telling them where they are going, people on the trams will hear Jarvis Cocker's voice instead. Doesn't that sound fun? Imagine hearing your favourite singer's voice when you're on the tram going to a fun place in the city! Why do you think Jarvis Cocker did this? It's because he loves his city Sheffield and wanted to make people smile as they travel on the trams. It's a special way of showing that he cares about the people who live there, and he wants to make sure they have a good day, just like you do when you help your friends or family! So next time you're on a tram or a bus, listen carefully to the announcements and remember how Jarvis Cocker used his talent to make people happy on their daily journeys!

The high-speed passenger trains stuck in the tunnel were fairly full, he added. \\"It's really technical problems due to the bad weather and the snow. The difference in temperature is quite significant,\\" the spokesman explained. \\"It's very cold outside and it's very warm in the tunnel so there's a big difference in temperature and that makes it difficult.\\" Eurostar said the disruption to services would continue throughout Saturday. \\"We strongly advise passengers not to travel. Because of the bad weather, we will have a reduced service. \\"People can get a refund if they want or they can exchange their tickets for travel on a later date. \\"Some of the trains will be cancelled. We will have a service but it will be reduced and so if their journey is not essential then we advise people not to travel.\\" Eurostar's British train drivers and staff began a 48-hour strike on Friday. However, the firm had enough drivers of other nationalities to cope, it said. The Channel Tunnel runs for 50 kilometres (30 miles) between the county of Kent in southeast England and the Pas-de-Calais department in northeast France. Opened in 1994, it is the world's longest uninterrupted undersea link. There are two rail tunnels -- with crossover points between them allowing trains to switch from one to the other -- and a service tunnel in the middle. Besides the Eurostar passenger trains, the tunnels also carry freight and vehicle shuttles. The passenger trains from London, which hit speeds of 300 kilometres (186 miles) per hour, can reach Paris in two hours, 15 minutes and Brussels in one hour, 51 minutes. Copyright © 2013 AFP.

The trains are thought to have failed when they exited the cold air in northern France and entered the warmer air inside the tunnel. All passengers are believed to be safe with emergency lighting in use while rescue efforts are made. The tunnel has been closed, leaving many other passengers stranded at terminals on either end. Severe weather conditions are exacerbating the situation, and drivers are being advised to avoid the area.

Help as much as you can. Given the below context: The first eruptions of Nevado del Ruiz occurred about 1.8 million years ago at the beginning of the Pleistocene epoch. Three primary eruption periods in the history of the massif have been identified: ancestral, older and present. During the ancestral period between one million to two million years ago, a complex of large stratovolcanoes was created. Between 1.0 million and 0.8 million years ago, they partially collapsed, forming large (5–10 km wide) calderas. During the older period, which lasted from 0.8 million to 0.2 million years ago, a new complex of large stratovolcanoes developed (including Older Ruiz, Tolima, Quindio, and Santa Isabel). Once again explosive summit calderas formed from 0.2 million to 0.15 million years ago.The present period began about 150,000 years ago and involved the development of the present volcanic edifice through the emplacement of lava domes made of andesite and dacite (igneous rocks) inside older calderas. During the past 11,000 years, Nevado del Ruiz passed through at least 12 eruption stages, which included multiple slope failures (rock avalanches), pyroclastic flows and lahars leading to partial destruction of the summit domes. During the past several thousand years, eruptions of the volcanoes in the Ruiz–Tolima massif have mostly been small, and the pyroclastic flow deposits have been much less voluminous than during the Pleistocene. Since the volcano's earlier eruptions are not recorded, volcanologists have used tephrochronology to date them.During recorded history, eruptions have consisted primarily of a central vent eruption (in the caldera) followed by an explosive eruption, then lahars. Ruiz's earliest identified Holocene eruption was about 6660 BC, and further eruptions occurred in 1245 BC ± 150 years (dated through radiocarbon dating), about 850 BC, 200 BC ± 100 years, 350 AD ± 300 years, 675 AD ± 50 years, in 1350, 1541 (perhaps), 1570, 1595, 1623, 1805, 1826, 1828 (perhaps),[b] 1829, 1831, 1833 (perhaps),[b] 1845, 1916, December 1984 – March 1985, September...

Little did they know that they were about to witness an extraordinary act of camaraderie and sportsmanship, as runner Matthew Rees stopped just short of the finish line to help a fellow competitor in need. As the 26.2-mile race drew to a close, Rees, a member of the Swansea Harriers running club, spotted his fellow runner struggling to continue just a few hundred meters from the finish line. Realizing that the fellow marathoner was in distress, Rees made the selfless decision to sacrifice his own race time in order to help the ailing runner. Ignoring the physical and mental exhaustion from running for hours, Rees slowed down and went over to the struggling competitor, whose legs were buckling beneath him. With arm over his shoulder, Rees valiantly supported the exhausted runner, helping him to continue forward toward the finish line. In an exceptional display of team spirit and empathy, Rees guided and encouraged his impromptu teammate every step of the way. As they inched closer to the finish line, the crowd erupted into cheers and applause, touched by the genuine compassion and selflessness that they were witnessing. Rees was not focused on his personal achievement; instead, he prioritized the well-being and success of a fellow athlete, who happened to be a complete stranger. The inspiring scene was captured on camera and quickly went viral on social media. Countless people across the globe were moved by Rees’ kindness and sportsmanship, proving that in today's fast-paced and competitive world, emphatic acts like these are valued and cherished. In a post-race interview, Rees humbly downplayed his actions, saying that he simply wanted to ensure that his fellow competitor was able to finish the race safely. His magnanimity and humility further endeared him to the hearts of people worldwide. The storyline of the 2017 London Marathon will forever be remembered for the remarkable sportsmanship and humanity displayed by Matthew Rees. His act of kindness transcended the boundaries of competition and exemplified the true spirit of marathon running – one of solidarity, perseverance, and unity. Rees’ decision to help a struggling competitor poignantly echoes the words of legendary British marathoner Richard Nerurkar: “A marathon is a shared experience, and the camaraderie that develops between runners who face the same challenge is incredibly strong.” Indeed, Rees became a shining example of the sportsmanship, selflessness, and compassion that prevail across the running community. As the world continues to grapple with division and strife in various arenas, the iconic image of Rees helping a fellow runner across the finish line serves as a powerful reminder of the unity and empathy that can exist within us all if we choose to embrace it. As we strive to create a kinder, more compassionate world, we can look to the example set by Matthew Rees, who in his moment of choice on a sunny Sunday in London, opted to uplift and support a fellow human in need."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Which way makes more sense to accomplish this goal?","completion":"Removing excess fat from baked potato wedges primarily deals with prevention. It's easier to reduce the amount of fat used in preparing potato wedges than it is to try and remove the fat after they've been cooked. Here are some steps you can follow to accomplish this. 1. Choose the Right Potato: The type of potato you choose can have a significant impact on the fat content of your wedges. Some potatoes, like russets, are naturally low in fat and high in fiber. They also have a nice, fluffy texture when baked. 2. Preparing the Potatoes: Soaking the potato wedges in cold water for an hour or so before baking can help reduce the amount of oil needed to bake them. The soaking process removes excess starch which results in a crispier wedge without the need for extra oil. 3. Reducing the Oil: One of the key reasons why potato wedges can be high in fat is because of the amount of oil used to bake them with. Instead of drowning your wedges in oil, try using an oil spray to lightly coat them, or lightly brush them with oil. Make sure every edge is marginally coated, this will provide you with crispy wedges without unnecessary oil. 4. Use Alternative Cooking Methods: Instead of baking, you can try air frying your wedges. Air fryers cook food by circulating hot air around it, so you'll need less oil to get the same crispy texture. 5. Roasting on A Rack: When baking, try putting your potato wedges on a wire rack on top of your baking tray. Any excess oil will drip down onto the tray, away from your wedges. 6. Make Use of Spices: Enhance the flavor of your potato wedges by using a variety of spices instead of added oil or fats. Herbs like rosemary and thyme, or spices like chili powder and cumin, can boost the flavor of your wedges without any added fat. 7. Avoid Adding Extra Fat: Resist the urge to add extra fats like cheese or cream-based dips. If you're craving a dip, opt for lower-fat options like salsa or a homemade yoghurt-based dip. 8. Eat in Moderation: Ultimately, potato wedges can be a part of a healthy diet if eaten in moderation. This is particularly important if you're trying to cut back on your overall fat intake. On the other hand, if you're looking to remove oil from already baked potato wedges, options are limited. You can place the hot wedges on paper towels right after baking, which should soak up some of the oil. However, this method isn't perfect and a significant amount of oil will still be left in the wedges. That's why focusing on reducing the amount of fat in the preparation and cooking process is the best way to remove excess fat from baked potato wedges."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

We have seen it with Alex Rodriguez and have seen it from Lance Armstrong, who now rides in charity events on the Tour de France course and probably wishes he had a team to take him back the way the Yankees took Rodriguez back, even before they — or he — knew he could still hit the way he has this season, all the way through that go-ahead home run he hit the other way against the Mariners on Friday night at the Stadium. FOLLOW THE DAILY NEWS SPORTS ON FACEBOOK. \\"LIKE\\" US HERE But mostly we keep seeing it from Tiger Woods, who can’t make the cut now at major golf championships as he moves up on his 40th birthday. And if you’re expecting big things from him in majors the rest of the way, go check out how even the most famous golfers who ever played have done in golf major championships after their 40th birthdays. The other day I was talking to Tom Kite, a major champion at the U.S. Open in Pebble Beach in 1992 and who finished second to Tiger at the ’97 Masters, by 12 shots that year. It was the year, by the way, when Kite famously described himself as having won the “first flight” championship at Augusta National. Kite was breaking down Tiger’s new swing, which isn’t the new swing he got from Sean Foley, and isn’t the new swing he got from Hank Haney, and certainly isn’t the old swing he had when Butch Harmon, the best coach there is, was in charge of quality control. Kite was talking about the injuries Tiger has had to his knees, and the problems he now has with his left side as he attacks a golf ball. “From what I see, he’s just getting ahead of himself,” Kite said after a lot of analysis a lot more technical than that. But it is more than just his swing, which looks like something that has had way too much cosmetic surgery. So many commentators who finally watched Woods put some good rounds together at the Greenbrier, where he was back in the 60s and finished a half-dozen shots out of a playoff, and who watched his practice rounds at St. Andrews (where he won another British Open in 2005) were amazed at how once again Woods was such a complete failure taking his practice-round swing and practice-tee swing to the first tee of a major championship. He started chunking balls on the first hole and shot 40 on the front nine, and you thought he was on his way to another 80 in a major. He finished with a 76, and then at one point on Friday when a Brit named Danny Willett was in the lead at 9-under, at a time when so many golfers had gone low at the Old Course, Woods really was 15 behind and looking at missing the cut in Scotland the way he had at Chambers Bay. So no, it isn’t just all the surgeries he has had, to his knees and back. This is Woods, who won everything for a while and had the Tiger Slam if not the traditional Grand Slam in golf that Jordan Spieth is chasing, being confronted by the same enemies that have confronted golfers who never came close to knowing the success that he did as he was sprinting to 14 majors and chasing Jack Nicklaus. Those enemies are age and injury and nerves and fear and choking, especially choking at majors right now, with a driver in his hands or a putter or even a wedge. The wonderful CBS commentator Gary McCord was telling me once about what happens in golf when you start missing putts. McCord said that before long there’s a ripple effect from all the short putts and birdie putts that don’t fall that runs through your entire game. “And then,” McCord said, “it’s in your DNA.” It’s in Tiger’s DNA right now, even just a couple of years from when he was still good enough to win five tournaments in a year, and even with him telling us, every time he does shoot a good score and perhaps reads the hero-worship coverage he still gets sometimes, how close he is to being back to what he used to be. He can’t drive it straight and though he can get hot with the putter sometimes, he looks nothing at all like the guy who made everything he looked at for 10 years. It doesn’t mean he won’t win again. There are plenty of stories about aging golfers surprising us all. There was a time just recently when three over-40 golfers in a row won British Opens, Darren Clarke and Ernie Els and Phil Mickelson. There was a time when the great Tom Watson, hitting the ball as well as he ever did, went through nearly a decade of putting yips. Somehow Watson, because of the force of his athletic character, found his way to the other side of that, and won a lot of big senior tournaments. And nearly won his sixth British Open at the age of 59 at Turnberry six years ago. But for now, and for a while now, this has been as stunning a fall for a sports champion, and a sports star like this, as we have ever seen. Once, he was the athlete after Michael Jordan retired we most wanted to watch. We still want to watch him when he’s on television. But it’s like a bad reality show these days, built around really bad golf. All we are saying is give Spieth a chance, Wright or wrong & Serena rocks.... -- It would be a tremendous thing for golf if Jordan Spieth wins the third leg of the Grand Slam. But I’m rooting for Dustin Johnson to win the British Open, if they ever finish it, that is. Having watched in person as Tom Watson won British Opens in Scotland, watching him take that walk on the 18th at St. Andrews on Friday was one of the most unforgettable scenes in the history of the tournament, and of the place. We’re not on our way to the Canyon of Heroes because the Knicks played well in the summer league, but you have to admit, the Latvian Mamba looked pretty good, didn’t he? And if you’re wondering how much Knicks fans are starving for any kind of good news, look at the play Mr. Porzingis got for throwing one back on Jahlil Okafor. Curtis Strange and Paul Azinger are still as good at golf commentary as you can find anywhere. Those “nightmares” LeBron James says he’s been having since the NBA Finals ended — did they start before or after we saw him on those banana boats in the Bahamas with his special basketball friends? We are about to find out, before the trade deadline in baseball, how much of a chance the Mets really think they have against the Washington Nationals, or how much they’re willing to give up to compete all the way for the second wild card in the National League. -- Everybody knows how much I like David Wright, and how hard I am rooting for him to come back and be the old David Wright for the Mets, instead of just an old David Wright. He is as nice as anyone, and that includes Yogi, I have ever covered in a New York baseball clubhouse. But there can be no Franchise Four list of New York Mets that doesn’t have Doc Gooden on it. I’m not sure, when you add everything up, that Mike Piazza deserves to be on that list more than Darryl Strawberry, or even Gary Carter. And when you look at the whole grand scheme of things, I happen to think you can make a case that William Hayward (Mookie) Wilson could have made the cut, too. After some pretty dark times in New York sports, it wasn’t such a terrible thing to have the Yankees in first place at the All-Star Break and the Mets in second, all of that happening in the shadow of the run the Rangers made in the spring. When I turned on the British Open Saturday morning, I was waiting for the flying cow from “Twister” to come by when one of the golfers was trying to mark his ball. -- I’m so happy that Mark Cuban and Steve Ballmer were able to work things out without couples counseling. Seriously? Is there anything more difficult to watch than billionaires with relationship issues? My favorite thing this week was listening to all this hand-wringing from pundits in Cable America about a deal with Iran none of them had read. Even our guy Trump, as he was killing the deal, sounded like he was working off Cliffs Notes. -- What we are witnessing from Serena Williams is one of the great finishing kicks in the history of her sport or any sport. She has now won as many major championships after the age of 30 as Jimmy Connors and Andre Agassi won in their entire careers. And as for the other player who won Wimbledon last weekend, just know this about Novak Djokovic: He came along at the time when both Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal were in their primes, before Federer turned 30 himself, and on their way to winning 31 majors between them. Now Djokovic has whipped them both. Somehow, even on the way to those 17 majors, Federer couldn’t beat Nadal, at least not nearly enough. In his twilight, in so many big moments, now he can’t beat Djokovic. I thought Caitlyn Jenner’s speech at the ESPY Awards was terrific. But somebody has to explain to me why some reaction shots of Brett Favre turned him into some sort of public enemy on social media. What, he’s a bad guy because he didn’t weep? Four games for Tom Brady? I still don’t think he’s going to accept four minutes. -- The mayor of New York City sounds as upset about Uber as he did about horse-drawn carriages in Central Park. The big guy better watch it, because if he gets rid of Uber, people all over town are going to start being as late for stuff as he is. “Lupica” can be heard Monday through Friday at 1 p.m. and Sunday at 9 a.m. on ESPN 98.7.

Your task is to summarize them. \\"My family had to leave Libya just to survive,\\" says a young bearded man in spectacles, perching awkwardly on a white leather sofa. We are in the front room of Saif al-Islam al-Gaddafi's mansion in Hampstead Garden Suburb, recently expropriated by activists working in alliance with Libyan exiles. An hour earlier, I had passed through an open window near some ugly imported ferns belonging to Muammar al-Gaddafi's son, having been invited to meet the members of the new Free Libyan Embassy. We drink stewed tea from Saif's best china and eat cheese sandwiches using his silver cutlery, while the young man, Abdulla, tells me about how his uncle was \\"disappeared\\" by Saif's father. \\"In Libya, people disappear all the time. There was a prison massacre where 1,200 people died. They poured cement over the bodies.\\" Abdulla nervously adjusts his glasses. \\"It's important that people know we're not creating a civil war for no reason.\\" Nearly every room in this enormous house boasts a large, flat-screen television. The occupiers have set each one to al-Jazeera, for rolling coverage of the people's revolutions that are sweeping the Arab world. Televised gunfire echoes in the marble hallway as Jay, 25, explains how activists from the London squatter movement took over the Gaddafi mansion, moving in secretly and putting up notices declaring their intention to hold the empty house under English common law. \\"We wanted to show our solidarity the best way we know how,\\" he says. “It's a symbolic and practical reclamation of private property that belongs to the Libyan people. It's about their struggle, which is why the place has been handed over to the Libyans as a place to organise and a safe space for refugees,\\" Jay says. \\"People have been arriving in support from all over the UK.\\" The tabloids have portrayed the occupiers as drunken anarchists but this is, in Jay's words, \\"total bollocks\\". \\"On the first night, people came down thinking there would be a squat party and we turned them away. They didn't seem to realise how seriously we're taking this,\\" he explains. “At first, we were elated that we'd managed to pull it off. Then the Libyans turned up and they were elated. But once they started to get reports about family and friends being killed, the atmosphere changed. We were watching Zawiyah burning on al-Jazeera and someone saw his own house. It was terrible.\\" Jay takes me on a tour over four floors of hushed opulence, each several times the size of an ordinary London flat. \\"It's worth nearly £11m,\\" he says. Under the kitchen is a cosy entertainment complex, complete with pool, Jacuzzi, sauna and a private cinema done out in suede, the pews so thick and warm you could sleep on them – which people have been doing. On the corner of one aisle a bare duvet lies, neatly folded. Everything here is white, bright and glistening: white leather sofas, marble floors, silver candlesticks adorning pristine white walls. The only note of colour is in one of the guest bedrooms, where a Libyan flag has been draped over the TV. Fuelling anger Fearing the spectacle of bailiffs dragging Libyans out of the private property of a Gaddafi, at a time when the UK government is desperately downplaying its erstwhile support for the dictator, the authorities have kept their distance. But that doesn't mean that there have been no attempts to get the occupiers to leave. “Last night, at about four in the morning, someone came to the door,\\" Jay says. According to Abdulla, \\"It was a well-dressed Arab person, [wearing] nice clothes and gold. When I asked him what he was doing here so late, he said, 'I want to make you an offer.' He told us: 'I have £40,000 in cash. You can have it if you leave immediately.' No amount of money could make us leave this house. It's not a financial issue.\\" On the sofa opposite, a quiet man called Ambarak suddenly speaks up in Arabic. \\"What's a life worth?\\" he says, as Abdulla translates softly. \\"What are 100,000 lives worth?\\" Ambarak perches on the edge of the sofa, looking out of place in his keffiyeh and scuffed trainers. \\"I'm talking about people being shot by snipers in the street. I'm talking about family members selling dry bread to live. “They ask what the west should do, but they've known about [Muammar] Gaddafi for years,\\" he continues in broken English. \\"They did nothing. The petrol . . .\\" – he rubs his fingers together in a \\"money\\" gesture, grinning without humour. \\"My brother has disappeared in the fighting. We haven't heard from him, we have no way of contacting him.\\" Ambarak goes very quiet. \\"Excuse me, please. I must go and pray.\\" \\"The resources that come out of Libya should belong to the people but that petrol money goes somewhere else,\\" says Abdulla. \\"All those close to Gaddafi have places like this to live. There are some who are heartless and will do anything for a comfortable life.\\" Ambarak's family is in Misurata, where fierce fighting continues. \\"They say on the phone that they can hear shooting and tanks are coming down the street. My cousin has died, [as have] my friend, my neighbours.\\" An influx of neighbours bearing food terminates the interview. A young man wearing a Libyan flag like a cape takes the cups politely to the sink. He is a long way from home. \\"We all want to go home,\\" says Abdulla. \\"But not to Libya as it is now.\\" The Libyans involved in this article wanted their names to be known; other names have been changed.

There are over 600 known species of Oak, with 55 found in the continental United States. Because there is such a wide variety of oak trees in the world, it can be hard to find characteristics that unite them all. However, they do exist: Acorns are the easiest way to spot an oak tree. If the tree produces acorns, it's an oak. Lobed leaves are leaves that have rounded or pointed knobs extending out from the center line. While a few oaks do not have lobes, all of the leaves are generally symmetrical around a clear median line. Small, scaly bark. Bark on oak trees is variable, but it is generally made up of small, hard, and scaly bits of bark. This is unlike the large, flaky chunks of pines or the wallpaper-like bark on birch trees, and is much more cracked and grooved. Lobes are the bits of leaf that extend out to each side from the center of the leaf, like points on a star. White oaks have rounded lobes while red oaks have pointed ones. This is an important distinction that will cut the number of potential trees you're trying to identify in half. On red oaks, the vein of the leave extends all the way out to the edge, creating this point. Each area has its own assortment of oak species, which is often drastically different from other areas. The species of oak you will encounter changes great depending on where you are in the world, as it is rare for an oak found on the east coast to be found in the west, a southern oak in the north, etc. You can generally figure out your region with a few criteria (examples here are for Continental US): General location -- Northeast, Southeast, Midwest, Northwest, Southwest Inland or coastal. Mountainous or flat terrain. The lobes are the sections that extend out from the center of the leaf's stem on both sides. If possible, compare multiple leaves to find the average number of lobes. A few species such as the willow oak have no lobes at all, but most oaks have multiple lobes. Count at least 4-5 leaves when identifying, as this will help when you turn to the field guide. Look at the area between the lobes and determine whether the indentations are deep or shallow. White oak leaves often have variable indentations that alternate randomly between shallow and deep, where red oaks can have dramatic, sharp indentations or none at all. The leaves of evergreen oaks are shiny and dark green all year, but most oaks will turn colors in autumn. Some oaks, such as scarlet oak (Quercus coccinea), sport brilliant colors in the fall. White oaks and chestnut oaks are often a dull brown when color comes around. If it's summer, look at whether the leaves are dark green or light green, and whether they're shiny or not, to help determine the species. Evergreen oaks and a couple red oaks such as scrub oak have smaller leaves while most red oaks and nearly all deciduous white oaks have much larger leaves (at least 4 in.). This is one of the more important distinguishing features between similar species of oak. Using the data you've collected, identify your oak tree using a tree manual or field guide. There are dozens and dozens of oak trees out there, and you can't he expected to know them all by heart. Use the above criteria to narrow down your choices, then use the guide to find what oak you're looking at. You can look through the collection of common oak trees below, or consult a Field Guide, found through the US Forestry Service. Turn to the appropriate section. Most guides are divided into a red oak section and a white oak section Narrow your selection down to the oaks specific to your area. A good guide should have distribution maps for each species. Once you have a list of possibilities, look at the pictures for each one to determine your tree. Summary:","completion":"Oak trees are special types of trees found in many places around the world. There are lots of different kinds of oak trees, but they all share some things in common. They make acorns, which are little nuts that fall from the tree. Oak leaves have special shapes called lobes that stick out from the middle of the leaf. Oak tree bark is usually rough and scaly. There are two main groups of oak trees: white oaks and red oaks. White oaks have rounded lobes on their leaves, while red oaks have pointy ones. To identify an oak tree, look at its leaves, bark, location, and the shape and color of its leaves.

At very low pressure, the particles of the substance are far apart from one another and the substance is in the gas state.

I gained patience when I lost my freedom. I knew that I would eventually get it back in time. I was locked up in prison for a period of six years because at 19 years old I was playing with a handgun and I accidentally shot and killed my friend. The first couple of years was the hardest.I was always stressed out about everything.Time was dragging by because I was always paying attention to it.While I was locked up,Tom who I talked to helped put this virtue in me.He told me that it was possible that he would never make it home but that being patient and believing that one day he would was what had made him feel better.After a while I realized why he said a lot of things to me.Once I stopped paying attention to the days and just kept in mind that I would get freedom,it seemed that my time passed quickly. Now I am home and can see that patience paid off for me. I now use this virtue in my daily activities. I know that sometimes life gets hard and that it will pay in the end to stay patient and not to get discouraged.

Here is an article: In Cuba, it is legal to own fighting cocks, it is legal to train them, and it is legal to put them to fight, but one detail – all forms of betting and gambling are strictly forbidden since 1959, when the Cuban Revolution started. And the sole reason to fight cocks is to bet on them. It is an activity so popular among Cubans that stopping it would pose a huge challenge for the authorities and would be counterproductive. I spoke to a man named Yurien, who said, “President Raul likes cockfighting, our commanders Ramiro and Guillermo also like it, and we like it. Cockfighting is a part of Cuba so we do it with order and discipline. It is unstoppable. There are also a few legal arenas set up by the state, and even in those betting exists, but in a quiet and discreet way.” The most impressive site used for illegal cockfighting I visited was a military anti-aircraft shelter built into the side of a hill on the outskirts of a Cuban city, reachable after a short trek through thick bush. It struck me as a place in the middle of nowhere. The site was full of people enjoying an afternoon with their favorite pastime, cockfighting. As I arrived a man quickly came over with the entry tickets, in a highly organized manner. The fights were on and the cocks were safe, very safe, in the shade of the underground bunker. When I was leaving the bunker I met a boy carrying his injured fighting cock through the bush. His bird had lost the fight that day and he was sad. He said, “We will be back to win. I will cure my bird, and he will be back, even if now he only has one eye.” To reach the fight arena you have to know exactly where you are going, and when the fights are to take place. There are not signs, no announcements. This site and others are always concealed and hidden away down a dirt road lane and in the bush on the outskirts any Cuban city. Curiously, the steep paths or the bits of the lane on which car wheels skid in mud when it rains, are paved, yes, paved with asphalt. Money has been invested to ensure that participants and spectators make it to the site even if it rains. After the adventure of finding the site, suddenly in the middle of nowhere one finds people milling around and dozens of cars, many of them the typical pre-1959 models that have been restored and look like from their best times, tractors, horse-drawn carts, motorbikes and trucks all parked in a proper parking lot with a guard. There is electricity in the air and excitement everywhere. It is the day. A checkpoint manned by three or four men marks the entrance, and after paying a fee, you realize it is a serious place for serious business. But the whole thing can be quickly dismantled, loaded on trucks and set up elsewhere, in only a few hours. The sites are always practical and well built wooden structures covered with a thatched roof or tarpaulins to cater to hundreds of people. Apart from the main fight arena, other thatched structures surround the place as kiosks offering food, drinks, tobacco and other amenities for the spectators. There are cold drinks, roast pork, rice and beans, sandwiches and other snacks being offered. If you need to go to the toilet you just walk into the bush. There are dozens of these set-ups around Cuba where thousands of dollars are won and lost. A front row position can cost up to 10, or one further back can go for 4. Money flows freely as people go around holding huge wads of notes. There are also always tables to play cards, and bets are placed on the cocks before and during the fights. Each proud owner carries his animal with pride. Some birds can easily sell for 1,000. There are cocks of breeds from India, Mexico, Spain and many other countries. It is a very specialized trade and they enter the country in the form of a fertilized egg to be incubated in Cuba, since importing live animals is prohibited. Before the fights start, cock owners mill around the weigh-in point, and the birds are officially weighed and assigned a category. Once that’s completed, the different fights are arranged. The fighting cocks are the real stars of the show. After long months of training they are given pedicures, fitted with a sharp claw, endure sessions of feather-dressing, grooming and extreme clipping. The feathers on their legs and body are clipped, giving them a strange semi-human, semi-chicken look. The birds are treated like kings as they are carried in special boxes, and they are fed special food. To breed fighting cocks is a fine and very specialized occupation done by only a few. When I watched my first cockfight I realized that the birds use their back claw to kill each other in a very fast movement. All I could see was a ball of feathers swirling around, so during the fights I began to watch other interesting elements at the event – the bird owners and the crowd. It struck me that for the first time I was observing human beings turning into fighting roosters. The owners of the cocks are allowed to stand beside their animals like a coach along a boxing ring. They continuously dance around their birds, chuckling like excited cocks, salivating and sweating profusely. They literally enter a into a semi-trance with their eyes rolling. Some of them move their arms and legs as if they are the birds themselves, and don’t stop cooing and chuckling. Between rounds, they pick up their roosters as if they were wounded children, and lovingly lick their wounds. I saw one of them furiously blowing spit on his bird’s behind after chuckling into its ear and kissing and licking its beak. A truly surreal sight. There is a boiling frenzy as the fight starts, and it continues right to the end, with many people shouting bets furiously at the same time, waving their fat wads of money, moving their arms, legs, heads and whole bodies. The wooden structure bends and moves, and the air is so dense with excitement it is difficult to describe. Everyone knows that it is all an illegal activity, and that makes it even more exciting. A lot money has been placed on the birds; the outcome will leave losers with dead or severely injured birds and winners with more money in their pocket. Photography is absolutely not allowed, but in Cuba nothing and everything is possible. It all depends on how a photographer approaches the challenge. It is a question of first of all becoming part of the woodwork, which takes some time, and choosing very carefully when and what to shoot. Obviously big professional cameras are not much help in this kind of scene. To do the pictures for this story I used cellphones, a Gopro Hero 2, a Panasonic Lumix DMC-LX3 and the Canon EOS 5D Mark II, depending on the situation.

Sourav Chandidas Ganguly ( pronunciation ; born 8 July 1972), affectionately known as Dada (meaning \\"elder brother\\" in Bengali), is a former Indian cricketer and captain of the Indian national team, Currently, he is appointed as the President of the Cricket Association of Bengal and President of the Editorial Board with Wisden India. During his playing career, Ganguly established himself as one of the world's leading batsmen and also one of the greatest captains of the national cricket team. While batting, he was especially prolific through the off side, earning himself the nickname God of the Off Side for his elegant strokeplay square of the wicket and through the covers. Sourav Ganguly is one of the four members of the Indian Premier League's Governing Council, responsible for all the functions of the tournament. Sourav Ganguly was born on 8 July 1972 in Calcutta, and is the youngest son of Chandidas and Nirupa Ganguly. Chandidas ran a flourishing print business and was one of the richest men in the city. Ganguly had a luxurious childhood and was nicknamed the 'Maharaja', meaning the 'Great King'. Ganguly's father Chandidas Ganguly died at the age of 73 on 21 February 2013 after a long illness. Since the favourite sport for the people of Calcutta was football, Ganguly was initially attracted to the game. However, academics came in-between his love for sports and Nirupa was not very supportive of Ganguly taking up cricket or any other sport as a career. By then, his elder brother Snehasish was already an established cricketer for the Bengal cricket team. He supported Ganguly's dream to be a cricketer and asked their father to get Ganguly enrolled in a cricket coaching camp during his summer holidays. Ganguly was studying in tenth grade at that time. Despite being right-handed, Ganguly learnt to bat left-handed so he could use his brother's sporting equipment. After he showed some promise as a batsman, he was enrolled in a cricket academy. An indoor multi-gym and concrete wicket was built at their home, so he and Snehasish could practice the game. They used to watch a number of old cricket match videos, especially the games played by David Gower, whom Ganguly admired. After he scored a century against the Orissa Under-15 side, he was made captain of St Xavier's School's cricket team, where several of his teammates complained against what they perceived to be his arrogance. While touring with a junior team, Ganguly refused his turn as the twelfth man, as he reportedly felt that the duties involved, which included organising equipment and drinks for the players, and delivering messages, were beneath his social status. Ganguly purportedly refused to do such tasks as he considered it beneath his social status to assist his teammates in such a way. However, his playmanship gave him a chance to make his first-class cricket debut for Bengal in 1989, the same year that his brother was dropped from the team.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: how was his early life?","completion":"Sourav Ganguly's early life was quite comfortable and luxurious, as he was born into a wealthy family in Calcutta.

Toronto School Bans Footballs, Soccer Balls And Baseballs From Playground TORONTO – A Toronto school angered students and parents when it banned soccer balls, baseballs, footballs, tennis balls and volleyballs from the school grounds, the Toronto Star reported. Students at Earl Beatty Public School were sent home carrying letters stating that nobody could bring any of the balls to the junior and senior schools after a \\"few serious incidents\\" in which staff and students were struck in the playground. The temporary ban means only Nerf balls or sponge balls can be used by students at the school for now. School trustee Sheila Cary-Meagher told the newspaper that the most serious incident involved a parent who was hit in the head by a soccer ball, suffering a concussion. \\"I think the principal is reacting in a rational way. You don't want anyone to be injured,\\" she said. But some parents and students object to the ban, arguing that it is excessive. Chris Stateski said his six-year-old son Jacob was \\"crushed\\" when he learned about the ban. \\"He [Jacob] said, 'Daddy, what am I going to do with all my friends?' He wanted to change schools,\\" Stateski said. Anna Caputo, a communications officer at the Toronto District School Board, said the ban was temporary and that the school would monitor the situation closely. \\"It's a small playground and 350 students are playing in that playground. There's also a daycare [center on the site] so there are a lot of small children and parents going in to pick up the children,\\" she said. Write a one or two sentence summary.","completion":"A school in Toronto has stopped kids from playing with soccer balls, baseballs, and other hard balls because they can cause injuries.

Graduated cylinders are specifically designed for measuring the volume of liquids in laboratories and other scientific settings. They are typically made of glass or plastic and are transparent, which allows users to easily observe the liquid level inside. The unit 'liter' is an internationally recognized unit of measurement for volume. Within a graduated cylinder, the volume will be indicated by marked lines, or graduations, on the side of the cylinder. These graduations are usually provided in milliliters (a thousandth of a liter) to allow for accurate and precise volume measurements, although certain cylinders may have different subdivisions or units depending on their specific application (e.g., mL, µL, etc.). Remember that the other options provided are not valid units for measuring volume in a graduated cylinder: - Engines, power, and cellulose are terms that do not define units of measurement. Engines are associated with machines and vehicles; power refers to energy and work; cellulose is a compound found in plant cell walls. - Meters and inches are units of length, used to measure distances rather than volume. - Two is a number and does not represent a unit of measure. - Pounds are a unit of mass, which is different from volume; mass refers to the amount of matter in an object, whereas volume refers to the space it occupies."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band is the eighth studio album by English rock band the Beatles. Released on 26 May 1967 in the United Kingdom and 2 June 1967 in the United States, it was an immediate commercial and critical success, spending 27 weeks at the top of the UK albums chart and 15 weeks at number one in the US. On release, the album was lauded by the vast majority of critics for its innovations in music production, songwriting and graphic design, for bridging a cultural divide between popular music and high art, and for providing a musical representation of its generation and the contemporary counterculture. By 1966, the Beatles had grown weary of live performance. In John Lennon's opinion, they could \\"send out four waxworks ... and that would satisfy the crowds. Beatles concerts are nothing to do with music anymore. They're just bloody tribal rites.\\" In June that year, two days after finishing the album Revolver, the group set off for a tour that started in Germany. While in Hamburg they received an anonymous telegram stating: \\"Do not go to Tokyo. Your life is in danger\\". The threat was taken seriously in light of the controversy surrounding the tour among Japan's religious and conservative groups, with particular opposition to the Beatles' planned performances at the sacred Nippon Budokan arena. As an added precaution, 35,000 police were mobilised and tasked with protecting the group, who were transported from hotels to concert venues in armoured vehicles. The polite and restrained Japanese audiences shocked the band, because the absence of screaming fans allowed them to hear how poor their live performances had become. By the time that they arrived in the Philippines, where they were threatened and manhandled by its citizens for not visiting the First Lady Imelda Marcos, the group had grown unhappy with their manager, Brian Epstein, for insisting on what they regarded as an exhausting and demoralising itinerary. After the Beatles' return to London, George Harrison replied to a question about their long-term plans: \\"We'll take a couple of weeks to recuperate before we go and get beaten up by the Americans.\\" His comments proved prophetic, as soon afterwards Lennon's remarks about the Beatles being \\"more popular than Jesus\\" embroiled the band in controversy and protest in America's Bible Belt. A public apology eased tensions, but a miserable US tour in August that was marked by half-filled stadiums and subpar performances proved to be their last. The author Nicholas Schaffner writes: To the Beatles, playing such concerts had become a charade so remote from the new directions they were pursuing that not a single tune was attempted from the just-released Revolver LP, whose arrangements were for the most part impossible to reproduce with the limitations imposed by their two-guitars-bass-and-drums stage lineup. Upon the Beatles' return to England, rumours began to circulate that they had decided to break up. Harrison informed Epstein that he was leaving the band, but was persuaded to stay on the assurance that there would be no more tours. The group took a three-month break, during which they focused on individual interests. Harrison travelled to India for six weeks to study the sitar under the instruction of Ravi Shankar and develop his interest in Hindu philosophy. Having been the last of the Beatles to concede that their live performances had become futile, Paul McCartney collaborated with Beatles producer George Martin on the soundtrack for the film The Family Way. Lennon acted in the film How I Won the War and attended art showings, such as one at the Indica Gallery where he met his future wife Yoko Ono. Ringo Starr used the break to spend time with his wife Maureen and son Zak. In November 1966, during a return flight to London from Kenya, where he had been on holiday with Beatles tour manager Mal Evans, McCartney had an idea for a song that eventually formed the impetus of the Sgt. Pepper concept. His idea involved an Edwardian-era military band, for which Evans invented a name in the style of contemporary San Francisco-based groups such as Big Brother and the Holding Company and Quicksilver Messenger Service. In February 1967, McCartney suggested that the Beatles should record an entire album that would represent a performance by the fictional band. This alter ego group would give them the freedom to experiment musically. He explained: \\"I thought, let's not be ourselves. Let's develop alter egos.\\" Martin remembered: \\"Sergeant Pepper\\" itself didn't appear until halfway through making the album. It was Paul's song, just an ordinary rock number ... but when we had finished it, Paul said, \\"Why don't we make the album as though the Pepper band really existed, as though Sergeant Pepper was making the record? We'll dub in effects and things.\\" I loved the idea, and from that moment on it was as though Pepper had a life of its own. In 1966, the American musician and bandleader Brian Wilson's growing interest in the aesthetics of recording and his admiration for both record producer Phil Spector's Wall of Sound and the Beatles' album Rubber Soul resulted in the Beach Boys' Pet Sounds LP, which demonstrated his production expertise and his mastery of composition and arrangement. The author Thomas MacFarlane credits the release with influencing many musicians of the time, with McCartney in particular singing its praises and drawing inspiration to \\"expand the focus of the Beatles' work with sounds and textures not usually associated with popular music\\". McCartney thought that his constant playing of the album made it difficult for Lennon to \\"escape the influence\\", adding: \\"It's very cleverly done ... so we were inspired by it and nicked a few ideas.\\" Martin stated: \\"Without Pet Sounds, Sgt. Pepper never would have happened ... Pepper was an attempt to equal Pet Sounds.\\" Freak Out! by the Mothers of Invention has also been cited as having influenced Sgt. Pepper. According to the author Philip Norman, during the Sgt. Pepper recording sessions McCartney repeatedly stated: \\"This is our Freak Out!\\" The music journalist Chet Flippo states that McCartney was inspired to record a concept album after hearing Freak Out!, considered the first rock concept album. Sgt. Pepper, according to American musicologist Allan F. Moore, is composed mainly of rock and pop music, while Michael Hannan and Naphtali Wagner both believed it is an album of various genres; Hannan said it features \\"a broad variety of musical and theatrical genres\\". According to Hannan and Wagner, the music incorporates the stylistic influences of rock and roll, vaudeville, big band, piano jazz, blues, chamber, circus, music hall, avant-garde, and Western and Indian classical music. Wagner felt the album's music reconciles the \\"diametrically opposed aesthetic ideals\\" of classical and psychedelia, achieving a \\"psycheclassical synthesis\\" of the two forms. Musicologist John Covach describes Sgt. Pepper as \\"proto-progressive\\". Concerns that some of the lyrics in Sgt. Pepper refer to recreational drug use led to the BBC banning several songs from British radio, such as \\"A Day in the Life\\" because of the phrase \\"I'd love to turn you on\\", with the BBC claiming that it could \\"encourage a permissive attitude towards drug-taking.\\" Although Lennon and McCartney denied any drug-related interpretation of the song at the time, McCartney later suggested that the line was deliberately written to ambiguously refer to either illicit drugs or sexual activity. The meaning of \\"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\\" became the subject of speculation, as many believed that the song's title was code for the hallucinogenic drug LSD. The BBC banned the track on those grounds. They also banned \\"Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!\\" because of the lyric, which mentions \\"Henry the Horse\\", a phrase that contains two common slang terms for heroin. Fans speculated that Henry the Horse was a drug dealer and \\"Fixing a Hole\\" was a reference to heroin use. Others noted lyrics such as \\"I get high\\" from \\"With a Little Help from My Friends\\", \\"take some tea\\" - slang for cannabis use - from \\"Lovely Rita\\" and \\"digging the weeds\\" from \\"When I'm Sixty-Four\\". The author Sheila Whiteley attributes Sgt. Pepper's underlying philosophy not only to the drug culture, but also to metaphysics and the non-violent approach of the flower power movement. The musicologist Oliver Julien views the album as an embodiment of \\"the social, the musical, and more generally, the cultural changes of the 1960s\\". The American psychologist and counterculture figure Timothy Leary contends that the LP \\"gave a voice to the feeling that the old ways were over ... it came along at the right time\\" and stressed the need for cultural change based on a peaceful agenda. The album's primary value, according to Moore, is its ability to \\"capture, more vividly than almost anything contemporaneous, its own time and place\\". Whiteley agrees, crediting the album with \\"provid[ing] a historical snapshot of England during the run-up to the Summer of Love\\". Several scholars have applied a hermeneutic strategy to their analysis of Sgt. Pepper's lyrics, identifying loss of innocence and the dangers of overindulgence in fantasies or illusions as the most prominent themes. What was important about the lyrics?","completion":"The lyrics of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band were important for several reasons. First, they represented the album's embodiment of the social, musical, and cultural changes of the 1960s. The album expressed a need for cultural change based on a peaceful agenda and captured the spirit of the times, including the flower power movement, metaphysics, and the drug culture. It provided a historical snapshot of England during the run-up to the Summer of Love. Second, the lyrics in several songs led to speculation about their connection to recreational drug use. The BBC banned some songs from British radio due to concerns that the lyrics either directly or ambiguously referred to drug use or promoted a permissive attitude towards drug-taking. Some examples include \\"A Day in the Life,\\" \\"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds,\\" \\"Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!,\\" \\"With a Little Help from My Friends,\\" \\"Lovely Rita,\\" and \\"When I'm Sixty-Four\\". Despite the denials of John Lennon and Paul McCartney at the time, McCartney later admitted that some lyrics were deliberately ambiguous. Lastly, the lyrics in Sgt. Pepper explored various themes, including the loss of innocence and the dangers of overindulgence in fantasies or illusions. These themes contributed to the album's ability to capture its own time and place, making it a landmark work in popular music history. This is further highlighted by the fact that several scholars have applied hermeneutic strategies to analyze the album's lyrics, demonstrating the importance of the album both for its time and its continued relevance."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Jake Rainer, a former child psychiatrist turned therapist, is called on to probe the child's mind in order to solve the case. The psychological drama is provided by the fact that not even Jake can entice Tim to communicate what he has or has not seen regarding the crime. Tim's sister, Sylvie, is protective of him. She eventually warms to Jake's efforts, but is concerned when she learns he was implicated in the suicide of another young child who was under his care. Jake gradually befriends Tim. At first, Jake thinks that Tim is trying to communicate by cutting up playing cards, but Sylvie reveals that Tim is good at mimicking voices. Jake is able to trigger Tim's memory so that Tim mimics the voices he heard on the night of the murder by using the trigger phrase \\"God Damn,\\" which were the first words Tim heard from the murder. He attempts to piece together the chronology of the murder, suspecting that Tim interrupted a fight between his parents and an intruder. Sheriff Mitch Rivers threatens to use drugs to get Tim to talk about the murder and Dr. Rene Harlinger successfully hypnotizes Tim into breaking down a locked door. The police chief, seeing this as proof of Tim's strength, concludes that Tim was the murderer, after finding photographs showing that Tim's father was molesting him. That night, Sylvie plans to take Tim away and attempts to convince Jake to run away with them. She fails, and instead paralyzes Jake and throws him into an icy lake to drown him.

Lion populations are untenable outside designated reserves and national parks. Although the cause of the decline is not fully understood, habitat loss and conflicts with humans are the greatest causes of concern. Within Africa, the West African lion population is particularly endangered. - Hamden Khalif Allah Awad alias Ahmed the German ( actually Egyptian ) ( August 13 , 1970 -- August 7 , 1998 ) was one of the perpetrators of the 1998 United States embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania .

Gerry and Joe leave the injured man a blanket, a canteen and a gun before driving off, supposedly to seek medical aid. As the hours go by and Carson realizes the truth of his predicament, he vows to live long enough to exact revenge against his wife and her accomplice. Carson is reported missing to police lieutenant Mike Platt and to Dave Emory, who is Carson's lawyer and business manager. Gerry doesn't mention the broken leg and claims her husband wandered off. Emory isn't yet too concerned because Carson is a temperamental alcoholic who has acted irresponsibly more than once. The lovers fly to Carson's mansion in Los Angeles knowing that Carson is a good 60 miles from where they told the police to look.

The explosion happened at Phramongkutklao Hospital, which is used by serving and retired members of the military and their families. It took place on the third anniversary of the 2014 coup which brought the military government to power. Police said it was not clear who was behind the blast, which happened in a waiting room by a pharmacy. \\"We found pieces of a circuit and a battery, as well as some wires. We'll investigate further but initially we found the explosive had a range of 2-3 metres,\\" the Bangkok Post quoted Deputy National Police Chief General Srivara Rangsibrahmanakul as saying. Officials said most people had minor wounds from flying glass. \\"Eight people were admitted to hospital to observe their condition... among them is one woman who needed surgery because of shrapnel buried in her jaw,\\" AFP quoted hospital director Saroj Keokajee as saying. Thai newspaper The Nation said Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha had ordered an immediate investigation into the attack at the hospital, which also treats civilians. Three years after the armed forces seized power in Thailand, they rule almost unchallenged; the few who have dared oppose the government openly have been detained and charged. But there have been occasional small bombs, presumed to be in protest against the military. One went off last week close to the royal palace, where preparations are still under way for the elaborate cremation of the late King Bhumibol, who died last October. The military has succeeded in maintaining order and stability through a sensitive royal succession; but it has done little to address the political divisions underlying the conflicts which preceded the coup. Three years ago to the day the military ousted an elected government following months of street protests. Since then, Thailand's military leaders have clamped down on critics, political opponents and free speech. An election is due by the end of next year. It will be held under a new military-drafted constitution that critics claim only allows for a partial, guided democracy. Thailand has faced a power struggle since Thaksin Shinawatra was ousted by the military as prime minister in 2006. He and his sister (who led the government ousted in 2014) have strong support in rural areas, but they are hated by a military-backed urban elite who accuse them of corruption.

Most of the injuries were minor, resulting from flying glass, though eight people were admitted to the hospital, including a woman who required surgery for shrapnel in her jaw. The incident occurred amidst ongoing political tension in the country, with Thailand's military leaders having restricted freedom of speech and political dissent since seizing power.

He wanted Bluebird for lunch, but he was afraid of the blue water. On the third morning, Coyote saw Bluebird come out of the lake with beautiful blue feathers. Impressed, he sat next to Bluebird's tree and waited for her. When she returned, he asked, \\"How did you get blue feathers? I want to be blue like the mountains too.\\" Bluebird didn't believe Coyote, but she taught him how to bathe three times each morning and how to sing her song. Coyote did what she said, and after three days of bathing in the lake, his white fur turned deep blue. Convinced that blue fur was even more beautiful than blue feathers, Coyote forgot all about being hungry. He ran as fast as he could to the top of the hill. Standing on his back legs, he raised his front legs off the ground and howled. But Coyote slipped and rolled down the hill. He couldn't stop himself, and the dust and dirt covered his new blue fur.

The longstanding bad blood between Sunnis and Shiites in Iraq boiled Monday amid another round of attacks: the killing of 25 people and wounding of dozens more in five car bombings. Four of the blasts occurred in the Shiite heartland in the southern region of Iraq. Two car bombs exploded near a busy outdoor market in Amara, killing 13 people and wounding 24 others. A bomb went off near an outdoor market in Diwaniya, killing six people and wounding 20 others. And two people died and 11 others were wounded in a bombing at a commercial area in Karbala. Another blast occurred in Mahmoudiya, a predominantly Sunni area just south of Baghdad. Four people were killed and 14 others were wounded in that attack. Iraq pulls plug on 'misleading' TV networks. No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attacks, nor was it clear whether they were related. But the fighting has prompted fears among Iraqi leaders and international powers that the tensions between Sunnis and Shiites could escalate and bring a return of the full-blown sectarian war that raged last decade. Since the overthrow of Saddam Hussein's government last decade, Sunni Arabs have been politically marginalized and Shiites, who represent a majority of Iraqis, have emerged with more power. There have been protests for months by Sunni Arabs against the Shiite-led government and its prime minister, Nuri al-Maliki. The anger has escalated since a confrontation last week between police and protesters in Hawija. The International Crisis Group last week said that the \\"failure to integrate Sunni Arabs into a genuinely representative political system in Baghdad risks turning Iraq's domestic crisis into a broader regional struggle.\\" \\"The most urgent task today is to tamp down the flames, and the burden for this lies above all with the government,\\" the Belgium-based think tank said in a report. \\"The country is at a crossroads,\\" said Martin Kobler, U.N. special representative in Iraq.

These attacks have raised concerns among Iraqi leaders and international powers, fearing a return to a full-blown sectarian war as seen in the previous decade. The article also mentions that since the overthrow of Saddam Hussein's government, Sunni Arabs have been politically marginalized, while Shiites have gained more power. This has led to growing resentment and protests by Sunni Arabs against the Shiite-led government and its prime minister, Nuri al-Maliki. Furthermore, the International Crisis Group warns that the failure to integrate Sunni Arabs into a representative political system might turn Iraq's domestic crisis into a broader regional struggle. The think tank states that the most urgent task is to control the situation, with the burden of responsibility falling on the government. Lastly, the UN special representative in Iraq, Martin Kobler, declares that the country is at a crossroads, signifying the critical nature of the current situation and the need to address the underlying issues."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Czech is closely related to Slovak, Polish, and Sorbian, and it uses the Latin alphabet with additional diacritics for pronunciation. The sentence you provided translates to: \\"Bushka turned pale with anger, but remained silent.\\" Czech is known for its complex grammar system, including complicated consonant clusters and a rich case system. The language is characterized by its relatively free word order, which is influenced by an extensive system of inflection. There are seven cases in Czech, reflecting different syntactic roles of nouns, pronouns, and adjectives within a sentence: nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, vocative, locative, and instrumental. Czech vocabulary is derived mainly from the common Slavic language, which existed around the 6th and 7th centuries AD. But it has also borrowed words from other languages such as Latin, German, and English. The Czech language has not only played an important role in the cultural life of the Czech Republic, but it also has considerable influence in other Slavic countries as well. The works of the Czech historical figures like religious reformer Jan Hus, the educator and philosopher Jan Amos Komenský (known as Comenius in English), as well as the contributions of Nobel Prize-winning Czech authors such as Jaroslav Seifert and Bohumil Hrabal, have all added to the language’s rich history and global presence."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Thuringia: Some reordering of the Thuringian states occurred during the German Mediatisation from 1795 to 1814, and the territory was included within the Napoleonic Confederation of the Rhine organized in 1806. The 1815 Congress of Vienna confirmed these changes and the Thuringian states' inclusion in the German Confederation; the Kingdom of Prussia also acquired some Thuringian territory and administered it within the Province of Saxony. The Thuringian duchies which became part of the German Empire in 1871 during the Prussian-led unification of Germany were Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, Saxe-Meiningen, Saxe-Altenburg, Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, Schwarzburg-Sondershausen, Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt and the two principalities of Reuss Elder Line and Reuss Younger Line. In 1920, after World War I, these small states merged into one state, called Thuringia; only Saxe-Coburg voted to join Bavaria instead. Weimar became the new capital of Thuringia.

First, we will process the first element, which is 47. Since 47 is an odd number, we apply the rule: multiply by 3 and add 1, so 47 * 3 + 1 = 142. 2. Next, we will process the second element, which is 87. Since 87 is an odd number, we apply the rule: multiply by 3 and add 1, so 87 * 3 + 1 = 262. 3. Now, we will process the third element, which is 196. Since 196 is an even number, we apply the rule: divide by 2, so 196 / 2 = 98. 4. Then, we will process the fourth element, which is 149. Since 149 is an odd number, we apply the rule: multiply by 3 and add 1, so 149 * 3 + 1 = 448. 5. Finally, we will process the fifth element, which is 23. Since 23 is an odd number, we apply the rule: multiply by 3 and add 1, so 23 * 3 + 1 = 70.

Until the mid 1980s this was only practical with the brush-type DC motor, although such DC can be supplied from an AC catenary via on-board electric power conversion. Since such conversion was not well developed in the late 19th century and early 20th century, most early electrified railways used DC and many still do, particularly rapid transit (subways) and trams. Speed was controlled by connecting the traction motors in various series-parallel combinations, by varying the traction motors' fields, and by inserting and removing starting resistances to limit motor current. Q: What is speed limit for railways?","completion":"The speed limit for railways varies depending on the type of train, track conditions, and the country or region where the railway is located. Generally, speed limits for trains are imposed to ensure safety, efficiency, and the operational performance of the railway systems. Here, we will take a look at different types of train systems and some examples of their speed limits: 1. Conventional passenger trains: Conventional trains, also known as non-high-speed trains, usually operate at speeds between 70 km/h (45 mph) and 160 km/h (100 mph). For instance, in the United States, the speed limit for conventional passenger trains is typically around 120 km/h (75 mph). However, some regions, such as Europe, have introduced higher speed limits ranging from 160 km/h (100 mph) to 200 km/h (124 mph) on specific routes. 2. Freight trains: Freight trains usually have lower speed limits than passenger trains because of their heavier loads and the need for braking distance. In general, freight trains in the United States can operate at maximum speeds of 80 km/h (50 mph) to 112 km/h (70 mph). In Europe, the average speed limit for freight trains is about 100 km/h (62 mph). 3. High-speed rail: High-speed rail systems operate at significantly higher speeds than conventional trains, ranging from 200 km/h (124 mph) to 350 km/h (217 mph) or even higher. For example, the Japanese Shinkansen operates at speeds of up to 320 km/h (199 mph); the French TGV achieves speeds of up to 320 km/h (199 mph) or 350 km/h (217 mph) on some lines; and the Chinese CRH trains can reach up to 350 km/h (217 mph) on their dedicated high-speed lines. Speed limits on high-speed rail tracks are determined by factors such as the quality and maintenance of the track, signaling systems, and train design and capabilities. 4. Urban rapid transit and trams: Urban rapid transit systems like subways, light rail, and trams usually have lower speed limits than intercity trains. For instance, speed limits on many subway systems typically range from 50 km/h (31 mph) to 80 km/h (50 mph), while for light rail or trams, the limits may vary from 30 km/h (19 mph) to 80 km/h (50 mph), depending on the type of track and the environment they operate in. Ultimately, the speed limit for railways depends on a multitude of factors, such as train design, track conditions, signaling systems, and regional regulations, all of which influence the safe and efficient operation of railway networks."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Sentence:","completion":"This data provides in-depth information about 10 Hygiea, an object in our solar system, as observed at a specific time frame known as an epoch, in this case, the date being June 27, 2015. Hygiea, or more formally known as 10 Hygiea due to its status as the tenth minor planet in the Solar System to be discovered, is the fourth-largest asteroid in the Asteroid Belt and a potentially fascinating subject of astronomical study. In regards to its movement around the sun, 10 Hygiea has an orbital period of 5.57 days. The orbital period is essentially the time that it takes for any celestial body, such as planets, asteroids, or comets, to complete one full orbit around its primary star, which in Hygiea's case is the Sun. An orbital period of 5.57 days means that 10 Hygiea completes one full orbit around the Sun in that time frame. The data also provides information about the escape velocity of 10 Hygiea, which stands at 0.21 kilometres per second. The escape velocity is basically the minimum velocity an object must have in order to escape the gravitational influence of a particular planet or other body. In simpler terms, if a rocket or any other object were to leave 10 Hygiea and to not fall back, it would need to travel at least at a speed of 0.21 kilometres per second. 10 Hygiea has a surface area of 837,080.744 square kilometres, akin to the surface area of a country on Earth, making it one of the larger bodies in the asteroid belt. The term 'apoapsis' refers to the point of greatest distance from the center of a celestial body's orbit around its orbiting body. For 10 Hygiea, the apoapsis is approximately 523,951,582.33968 kilometres. This means that at its farthest orbital point, 10 Hygiea is over half a billion kilometres away from the Sun. In summary, the provided data is a detailed astronomical profile of the asteroid 10 Hygiea, giving precise figures on its orbital period, escape velocity, surface area, and apoapsis. This information can be crucial to astronomers and scientists studying the properties and behaviour of different celestial bodies in our solar system. It helps in understanding not only the specific characteristics and conditions of 10 Hygiea itself, but also provides wider insights about the asteroid belt and our solar system's dynamics as a whole."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

One of the grants includes the creation of a Web site with legal advice for the poor. A three-year grant worth 6.6 million and a separate technology grant were announced at a press conference and dinner held Thursday at Evo. A. DeConcini Federal Courthouse, 405 W. Congress St. Deconcini was one of the organization's early board members. Thursday's celebration was the first public even held at the courthouse. About 100 members of the legal community attended, including state Attorney General Janet Napolitano and Arizona Supreme Court Justice Thomas Zlaket. Both grants come from the Legal Services., a private, nonprofit corporation established by Congress in 1974 to offer poor people equal access to the justice system. It's funded through congressional appropriation. The 6.6 million grant will pay for staffing operations. The Web site, which will be created with a 50,000 grant, is intended to offer legal advice to poor people across Arizona, said Paul Julian, chief executive officer of Southern Arizona Legal Aid. He said he wants every poor person in Arizona to have legal help. \\"This is another step in trying to realize that. We feel like we do a pretty good job of helping people who find us,\\" Julian said. Julian said that though most people do not own computers, they can still access them at libraries, schools, and courthouses. He said the Web site will help bridge the \\"digital divide\\" that keeps the poor from using the Internet as a resource. Southern Arizona Legal Aid was founded in 1951 as the Legal Aid Society of the Pima County Bar Association.

Please answer the following question: You are considering whether to buy a product. You look at the reviews. Would the following review decrease or increase the chances of you buying the product? Review title: NOT a T605!!!! Product review: If you want A2DP streaming, do NOT order this product!! I have ordered THREE of them and every time they send a T603, which dos not have have A2DP streaming. While the return was handled promptly, the fact that they are shipping the wrong product ON PURPOSE is not ok. They need to get this issue resolved. A:","completion":"The given review would significantly decrease the chances of me buying the product, and here are the reasons why: 1. Incorrect Product Delivered: The reviewer highlights that they have ordered the product three times and each time, they have received the wrong product (T603 instead of T605). This indicates that the seller might have a consistent issue with their inventory management and delivery process that could affect my order too. 2. Lack of A2DP streaming: The primary reason for the disappointment in the review is the absence of A2DP streaming in the delivered product. A2DP is an important feature for many customers who want to stream high-quality audio wirelessly. If this feature is not available in the product delivered, it would not meet my expectations and requirements, providing less value for the purchase. 3. Questionable Seller Intent: The reviewer suggests that the seller is shipping the wrong product \\"on purpose.\\" This raises concerns about the credibility and integrity of the seller. As a potential buyer, this claim would make me question the overall trustworthiness of the seller and consider looking for alternative products or sellers with more reliable reviews. 4. Return Process: Although the reviewer mentions that the return process was handled promptly, having to go through the hassle of returning a product multiple times is not ideal. It leads to wasted time, effort, and potential frustration, which are factors I would want to avoid when making a purchase. In summary, considering the issues highlighted in the review, including the wrong product being delivered and the lack of a required feature, the review would substantially decrease my chances of buying the product. Additionally, the trustworthiness of the seller is also in question, making it less likely for me to take the risk and proceed with the purchase. To make a more informed decision, I would explore alternative products or sellers that have a strong track record of delivering the correct product with the desired features."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

If \\"The children sip their drinks together as the young boy makes a phone call.\\", does this mean that \\"The children are drinking alcohol while the young boy calls his dead grandma.\\"?","completion":"No, the interpretation that \\"The children are drinking alcohol while the young boy calls his dead grandma\\" is not accurate based on the sentence \\"The children sip their drinks together as the young boy makes a phone call.\\" In the given sentence, \\"The children sip their drinks together\\" indicates that the children are consuming some type of liquid beverage. There is no specific information provided about the drinks being alcoholic or non-alcoholic. It could be any drink like water, juice, soda, or milk. Therefore, assuming that they are drinking alcohol may not be a valid interpretation unless there is any supporting context provided. The second part of the sentence, \\"as the young boy makes a phone call,\\" tells us that a young boy is using a phone to make a call at the same time as the children are sipping their drinks. There is no information in the provided sentence about whom the young boy is calling. It is not mentioned that he is calling his dead grandma. Without further context, we cannot assume this as part of the story. To conclude, the original sentence does not necessarily mean that the children are drinking alcohol or that the young boy is calling his dead grandmother. The given statement merely describes a situation where children are consuming drinks while a young boy is making a phone call.

During his career just after World War I, he won 20 of 21 races and 249,465 (equal to 3,047,451 today) in purses. He was the unofficial 1920 American horse of the year and was honored with Babe Ruth as the outstanding athlete of the year by The New York Times. He was inducted into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in 1957. Man o' War was a chestnut horse with a white star and stripe on his forehead. He was foaled at Nursery Stud near Lexington, Kentucky. He was bred by August Belmont, Jr., whose father's accomplishments were recognized through the naming of the Belmont Stakes in 1867. Belmont Jr. was an equally notable horseman who served as the chairman of The Jockey Club from 1895 until his death in 1924. Belmont Park was named in the family's honor when it opened in 1905. Man o' War was sired by Fair Play, a multiple stakes winner who finished second in the 1908 Belmont Stakes to the undefeated Colin. Man o' War was the second foal out of Mahubah, a lightly raced mare by English Triple Crown Champion Rock Sand. Not long after the colt was foaled on March 29, 1917, Belmont Jr. joined the United States Army at age 65 to serve in France during World War I. While he was overseas, his wife named the foal \\"Man o' War\\" in honor of her husband. Originally, the Belmonts intended to race Man o' War themselves. However, in the summer of 1918 with the ongoing war effort, they decided to liquidate their racing stable. At the Saratoga yearling sale, Man o' War was sold at a final bid of 5,000 (equivalent to 81,000 in 2017) to Samuel D. Riddle, who brought him to his Glen Riddle Farm near Berlin, Maryland. The underbidder at the auction was Robert L. Gerry, Sr., who is reported to have said to his wife, \\"Forty-five hundred is enough to spend for any yearling.\\" Two years later in 1920, Riddle declined an offer of 400,000 for the horse. At maturity, Man o' War stood 16.2 1/2 hands (66.5 inches, 169 cm), with prominent withers and a high croup, but was sometimes faulted for a dipped back that grew more pronounced with age. He had virtually flawless legs and solid bone, traits he passed on to his offspring. He had a slightly Roman nose and notably high head carriage. His nickname was \\"Big Red\\", though his coat had tinges of yellow and gold. An energetic, spirited horse, he is often pictured standing very still and gazing off into the distance, described as the \\"look of eagles\\". His stride was measured at 28 feet, believed to be the longest of all time. Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: Did it have famous parents?","completion":"Yes, Man o' War did have famous parents.

Charles Percy, a prominent Illinois Republican who served in the Senate for nearly 20 years and became chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, died Saturday, said a spokesman for Sen. Jay Rockefeller, a relative. He was 91. Percy, a one-time rising star in the Republican Party who was once considered a potential presidential candidate, was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1966 and served until 1985. His daughter, Sharon, the wife of Rockefeller (D-West Virginia), spoke publicly in 2009 of her father experiencing Alzheimer's disease. She made those remarks before the National Alzheimer's Association. Born in Florida and raised in Chicago's far north neighborhood of Rogers Park and the well-to-do suburb of Winnetka, Percy was regarded a business wunderkind who rose to become the president, CEO and board chairman of Bell & Howell, a manufacturer of made home-movie cameras and electronic consumer products. He became president at age 29. He was appointed as President Dwight Eisenhower's personal representative to presidential inaugurations in Peru and Bolivia with the rank of special ambassador in 1956. After an unsuccessful run for governor of Illinois in 1964, he successfully ran for the U.S. Senate two years later. While campaigning in 1966, Percy's other daughter, Valerie, Sharon's twin, was murdered at age 21 in the family's Kenilworth, Illinois, home, a crime that shocked Illinois and the nation. The murder is unsolved, but remains a vivid memory for many residents of Chicago and Illinois who knew Percy. While in the Senate, Percy emerged as an antagonist to President Richard Nixon, also a Republican, when Percy called for a special prosecutor to investigate Watergate, the political scandal that eventually culminated in Nixon's resignation. Percy considered running for the 1976 presidential nomination, but he backed off after Nixon resigned in 1974 and after Vice President Gerald Ford became the new president and decided to seek the 1976 nomination himself. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"Former U.S. Senator Charles Percy was a celebrated figure in Illinois and a key member of the Republican party who served in the Senate from 1966 to 1985. Although he was once considered a potential presidential candidate, circumstances led him to back out of the race. Percy's political journey began with him taking on the role of President Dwight Eisenhower's personal representative to presidential inaugurations in Peru and Bolivia as a special ambassador in 1956. Before his political career, Percy, considered a business prodigy, was appointed president of Bell & Howell, a company manufacturing consumer electronic products and home-movie cameras, at the young age of 29. Born in Florida and brought up in Chicago's Rogers Park neighborhood and the affluent suburb of Winnetka, Percy demonstrated his exceptional skills and talents from an early age. His political journey wasn't without dramatic moments though. In 1964, Percy's first run for governor of Illinois ended unsuccessfully, but he learned from the experience and successfully ran for the U.S. Senate in 1966. However, his campaign was overshadowed by a tragedy that struck his family prematurely. Percy's 21-year-old daughter, Valerie, was murdered in their family home, a crime that remains unsolved. The incident shocked Illinois and the entire country, leaving a vivid memory in the minds of those who knew Percy. Despite the personal tragedy, Percy continued his political journey in the Senate. He made a significant stand against President Richard Nixon, a member of his own party, calling for a special prosecutor to investigate the Watergate scandal. This controversy played a significant role in Nixon's eventual resignation from presidential office. In 1974, after Nixon's resignation, Vice President Gerald Ford assumed presidency and Percy considered running for the 1976 Presidential nomination. However, when Ford decided to seek the nomination himself, Percy decided to hold off from further competitive political pursuits. Percy’s daughter, Sharon, made the revelation in 2009 that he had been struggling with Alzheimer's disease. He passed away in 2011 at age 91, leaving a remarkable legacy in public service."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

News article: US military admits it mistakenly targeted and killed loyalist Syrian forces The US military has formally admitted fault in a major September airstrike in eastern Syria that killed at least 15 fighters loyal to the regime of dictator Bashar al-Assad. US Central Command (Centcom), which both conducted and investigated the 17 September strike, said the attack stemmed from a “good faith” mistake that led targeters to believe the Syrian fighters, whom Centcom said did not wear uniforms, were Islamic State (Isis) militants. British, Australian and Danish warplanes also participated in the attack and released their weapons on the mistaken target, according to US air force Brig Gen Richard Coe, the investigating officer. Coe stopped short of apologizing to the Syrian government, saying such a statement was beyond the purview of his six-week investigation. The strikes occurred in the eastern province of Deir ez-Zor, where the US bombs Isis fighters and positions almost every day, and where known regime loyalists are relatively few. Due to the lack of observable insignia, Centcom would not say definitively that it had killed Syrian soldiers. “We made an unintentional, regrettable error, based on several factors in the targeting process,” Coe told reporters on Tuesday, who said he found “no intent to target Syrian [government] forces”. Coe’s investigators were unable to access the scene of the strike, a few kilometers north of the Deir ez-Zor airfield, and the Russian military – which is supporting Assad’s campaign against Isis and rebel opposition forces – did not participate in the inquiry. An initial report on the incident by the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights suggested that 83 people had been killed. Coe said that on the basis of contemporaneous video evidence and interviews, he could only definitively determine 15 dead regime loyalists, but added that the death toll was likely to be higher. Soon after the incident on 17 September, Centcom said that it had halted airstrikes in progress in Deir ez-Zor after speaking to Russian officials on a channel established to deconflict the two countries’ air campaigns over Syria. In that conversation, the Russians informed their US counterparts that the targets of the strike were probably “part of the Syrian military”. The conversation turned out to be crucial. A US military officer misidentified the coordinates of the targeted area, and presumed from the lack of Russian objection that there was no problem with the intended strike. But Centcom said on Tuesday that the Russians made a “critical delay” before informing the US of the mistake, waiting 27 minutes for a “familiar US counterpart” to be reached. During that time, 15 of the total 32 airstrikes occurred. Coe gave the Russians a measure of credit: “Without that call from the Russians, the strikes would have continued for longer than they did.” Coe described the planning process for the strike unfolding over at least two days with “multiple, multiple” shift changes “in different parts of the globe” contributing to human error. The intended strikes were substantial: warplanesand drones released 34 guided weapons and 380 rounds of 30mm ammunition on what Coe described as “defensive fighting positions, vehicles, tents, bed-down locations, tunnels and personnel”. The presence of a tank tipped at least one intelligence analyst to conclude that the target was not Isis, but Coe said the analyst’s assessment was neither widely distributed nor fully accurate, as earlier airstrikes against Isis had hit tanks commandeered from the Syrian regime. The tank appears to have convinced strike planners that they had located a major Isis target, and what began as a deliberate strike expanded, blurring targeting procedures, as officers and analysts became convinced they had a major target of opportunity in their crosshairs. “Constantly challenging our own conclusions in these processes is something we need to do every time,” Coe said. The admission of fault by the US military is the latest potential sign that the US under Donald Trump will acquiesce to a Syria under Assad’s rule. Since his election, speculation has mounted that Trump will drop Barack Obama’s calls for Assad to relinquish power. Trump has expressed respect for Assad’s patron, President Vladimir Putin of Russia, and portrayed US support for the anti-Assad opposition forces as a disaster. Earlier this month, Trump told the Wall Street Journal that “Syria is fighting Isis”, indicating a lack of appetite for the US to undermine the enemy of its enemy. Trump is unlikely to arm the Syrian opposition – a policy advocated by David Petraeus, whom Trump is considering for secretary of state – because “we have no idea who these people are”. He acknowledged to the paper: “I’ve had an opposite view of many people regarding Syria.” Assad has sounded cautiously enthusiastic since Trump’s victory, describing the president-elect as “a natural ally” to Portuguese television. The US admission of error comes as Assad, backed by the Russian air force, is poised for a critical victory in the northern city of Aleppo, a former center of manufacturing that years of war have turned into a graveyard. Tens of thousands of civilians are fleeing Aleppo in advance of a final bombardment that Russian leaflets reportedly describe as a pending “annihilation”. Coe’s investigation also provided a new level of detail into the US-Russian “deconfliction” channel, established last year after the Russian air force entered the war on Assad’s behalf. During the 17 September conversation with the Russians, the US delivered highly precise but ultimately mistaken coordinates for the intended attack, as an analyst miscommunicated. Coe said it was the “first time” that the US had called the Russians in advance of a strike with such precise location information. “We would have a large number of aircraft operating in that small airspace for an extended period of time and we wanted to obviously notify the Russians so they’d be aware of our activities there,” Coe said. What are the most important parts of this news article?","completion":"The US military has admitted responsibility for an airstrike in eastern Syria in September that killed at least 15 Syrian fighters loyal to the regime of Bashar al-Assad. Although the US Central Command (Centcom) stated that the attack was based on a “good faith” mistake that led planners to think the targeted fighters were ISIS militants, the admission serves as further evidence that the Trump administration could be prepared to accept Assad's continued rule of Syria. The strikes occurred in the eastern province of Deir ez-Zor, where US forces had noted the presence of relatively few regime loyalists.⟩"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I saw this film awhile back (while working on a trailer for the film's production company) and it was TERRIBLE. Hewitt is mediocre at best, Hopkins phones his performance in (but still blows away Hewitt in their scenes together) and Alec looks bored. Trust me on this: you should avoid this film like the plague if it ever gets released. It seems to go on forever as the tired plot unfolds at a snail's pace. It is relentlessly unfunny, the cinematography is crappy and the direction is pedestrian. Alec Baldwin should go to film school if he plans to direct again. In terms of his acting, his character is totally unlikable, which makes it impossible to root for him. Dan Ackroyd is pretty funny and the surprising makeup of the jury near the film's end is cute, but this film is just plain awful. What is the sentiment of this review?","completion":"To determine the sentiment of this review, let's analyze it step-by-step: 1. In the beginning, the user states that the film was \\"TERRIBLE\\" and described Hewitt's performance as \\"mediocre at best.\\" This shows a strong negative sentiment. 2. The user mentions that Hopkins doesn't do a great job but is still better than Hewitt, and Alec looks bored. This continues the negative sentiment. 3. The user then advises others to avoid the film, mentioning its slow pace and unfunny content. This is another indication of negative sentiment. 4. Criticizing the cinematography, direction, and Alec Baldwin's skills, the user adds more reasons to dislike the movie, increasing the negative sentiment. 5. The reviewer acknowledges that Dan Ackroyd is funny and the jury's makeup near the end is a cute touch, which is a brief deviation from the negative sentiment. In conclusion, the sentiment of this review is predominantly negative, with a slight positive acknowledgment of some aspects."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What country backed the Karposh's Rebellion in 1689? ? The Ottomans were employed as mercenaries by the Byzantines in the 1340s but later became invaders in their own right. Sultan Murad I took Adrianople from the Byzantines in 1362; Sofia fell in 1382, followed by Shumen in 1388. The Ottomans completed their conquest of Bulgarian lands in 1393 when Tarnovo was sacked after a three-month siege and the Battle of Nicopolis which brought about the fall of the Vidin Tsardom in 1396. Sozopol was the last Bulgarian settlement to fall, in 1453. The Bulgarian nobility was subsequently eliminated and the peasantry was enserfed to Ottoman masters, while much of the educated clergy fled to other countries.Christians were considered an inferior class of people under the Ottoman system. Bulgarians were subjected to heavy taxes (including devshirme, or blood tax), their culture was suppressed, and they experienced partial Islamisation. Ottoman authorities established a religious administrative community called the Rum Millet, which governed all Orthodox Christians regardless of their ethnicity. Most of the local population then gradually lost its distinct national consciousness, identifying only by its faith. The clergy remaining in some isolated monasteries kept their ethnic identity alive, enabling its survival in remote rural areas, and in the militant Catholic community in the northwest of the country.As Ottoman power began to wane, Habsburg Austria and Russia saw Bulgarian Christians as potential allies. The Austrians first backed an uprising in Tarnovo in 1598, then a second one in 1686, the Chiprovtsi Uprising in 1688 and finally Karposh's Rebellion in 1689. The Russian Empire also asserted itself as a protector of Christians in Ottoman lands with the Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca in 1774. The Western European Enlightenment in the 18th century influenced the initiation of a national awakening of Bulgaria. It restored national consciousness and provided an ideological basis for the liberation struggle, resulting in the 1876 April Uprising. Up to 30,000 Bulgarians were killed...

Please help improve it by removing unnecessary details and making it more concise. (May 2010) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) On holiday in Egypt with George and Emily Hacker (Christopher Connelly and Martha Taylor), her archaeologist father and journalist mother, ten-year-old Susie Hacker (Brigitta Boccoli) is approached by a mysterious blind woman who gives her an amulet. Soon after, George is struck blind when he enters a previously unexplored tomb. Upon their return in New York City, George is informed that the loss of his eyesight will only be temporary. Susie begins to act strangely, and her younger brother Tommy (Giovanni Frezza), who stayed behind in New York with the family's au pair Jamie Lee (Cinzia de Ponti), is also affected by the mysterious amulet. Both Susie and Tommy have gained supernatural access to dimensional doorways. A few days later, George's eyesight returns, and he describes the design on the wall of the tomb he'd entered to a colleague called Wiler. A little while later, Luke Anderson (Carlo De Mejo), an eccentric colleague of Emily's, arrives to work with her on her latest story detailing her travels in Egypt. When Luke hears a noise coming from Susie's bedroom, he goes in, only to be sucked into the dimensional portal and finds himself transported to the deserts of Egypt where he later dies from dehydration in the vast, arid desert. The Hackers think Luke's disappearance is merely a practical joke, but they never learn of his fate, nor find any trace of him. Jamie Lee takes the kids out to nearby Central Park to play where she takes photos of them. A woman picks up a discarded Polaroid photo taken of Susie. It shows nothing but the amulet against the grassy background. The woman contacts a man called Adrian Marcato (Laurence Welles) with her find.

Answer:","completion":"Title: Useful, but Needs Improvement Review: I recently downloaded the org.mysociety.FixMyStreet app, and I must say, the concept behind it is genuinely great. The idea of being able to report local issues like potholes, broken streetlights, and other problems directly to the council seems like a game-changer. However, there are a few issues with the app that prevent me from giving it a higher rating. Firstly, the user interface could use a good redesign. The navigation can be a bit confusing at times, and the overall look seems a bit outdated. Step-by-step guidance on how to report an issue to the council is needed to help users avoid any unnecessary confusion. A more modern and simplified interface would make the app more user-friendly and visually appealing. Secondly, the app can be a bit slow to load information, especially while using location services to find nearby issues. In the age of fast internet and instant gratification, users are more likely to give up on an app that doesn't provide quick results. Optimizing the app's performance would make the user experience much smoother. Lastly, there is a noticeable lack of communication from the council regarding the status of reported issues. An update system, where users receive notifications about the progress of their reports, would be a great addition to the app, giving users a sense of accomplishment and confidence in the app's impact. In conclusion, the org.mysociety.FixMyStreet app is a useful tool that empowers citizens to report and fix issues in their local communities. However, some improvements are needed to make it more user-friendly, fast, and efficient. Right now, I would rate the app three stars out of five, but I believe it has the potential to reach five stars with these suggested enhancements."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Seattle celebrated its restored prosperity and made a bid for world recognition with the Century 21 Exposition, the 1962 World's Fair. Another major local economic downturn was in the late 1960s and early 1970s, at a time when Boeing was heavily affected by the oil crises, loss of Government contracts, and costs and delays associated with the Boeing 747. Many people left the area to look for work elsewhere, and two local real estate agents put up a billboard reading \\"Will the last person leaving Seattle – Turn out the lights.\\"Seattle remained the corporate headquarters of Boeing until 2001, when the company separated its headquarters from its major production facilities; the headquarters were moved to Chicago.

Article: President Obama has ordered a top-to-bottom review of how the U.S. government tries to win the release of Americans held hostage by terrorist groups overseas, The Daily Beast has learned. The review, which will include a specific emphasis on how the U.S. treats hostages’ family members, follows criticism that current hostage-negotiation operations are plagued by bureaucratic infighting and a lack of leadership, particularly by the White House. The review was prompted “as a result of the increased frequency of hostage-taking of Americans overseas,” Christine Wormuth, the undersecretary of Defense for policy and one of the Pentagon’s most senior officials, informed Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-CA) in a letter last week (PDF). Hunter sits on the House Armed Services Committee and has been pressing the administration to do more to free Americans held by ISIS and other terrorist groups. Wormuth said the president had ordered the review “recently,” but she didn’t specify when. On Sunday, ISIS released its latest video showing the beheading of one of its American captives, Peter Kassig. The group is holding one more American, a 26-year-old woman who was kidnapped in Syria last year while delivering aid to Syrians affected by the country’s civil war. The brutal series of beheading videos has been a persistent reminder that the U.S. faces an implacable enemy, even as it steps up airstrikes on ISIS positions in Syria and Iraq. President Obama took heat for playing a round of golf on Martha’s Vineyard after the first video showing the beheading of journalist James Foley aired in August. Wormuth said the review will include a “specific emphasis on examining family engagement, intelligence collection, and diplomatic engagement policies.” The emphasis on the families of hostages is particularly noteworthy; the parents of Americans murdered by ISIS have criticized the White House for threatening them with potential criminal prosecution if they were to pay a ransom. Family members have also complained that the administration didn’t follow up on leads that they provided about where ISIS might be holding the Americans. Several groups of parents have banded together in efforts to locate their children but say they’ve run up against a wall at the White House. Foley’s parents reportedly told Obama in a phone call after their son was shown murdered that the government had “failed” him by not trying harder to win his freedom. It was during that phone call that Obama told the Foleys an earlier mission by the military had failed to extract the hostages from Syria. While not overtly acknowledging the complaints of family members and critics of the U.S. bureaucracy, Wormuth said the review would seek to “improve interagency coordination and strengthen the whole of government approach,” code for putting a stop to turf wars and getting the various corners of the government on the same page. Recent efforts to free ISIS prisoners have put the White House and the State Department at odds with the FBI, which has long sought more creative ways for getting Americans out of terrorists’ clutches, including facilitating ransom payments. Wormuth replied to Hunter after an earlier letter in which he urged the president to put someone in charge of all the government’s efforts to free Americans. In the letter, sent after the video of Foley’s beheading appeared, Hunter said he was “very concerned” that the government is not “adequately pursuing and exhausting opportunities” to bring Americans home. “The administration’s goal has always been to use every appropriate resource within the bounds of the law to assist families to bring their loved ones home. In light of the increasing number of U.S. citizens taken hostage by terrorist groups overseas and the extraordinary nature of recent hostage cases, this summer President Obama directed relevant departments and agencies, including the Departments of Defense and State, the FBI, and the intelligence community, to conduct a comprehensive review of how the U.S. government addresses these matters,” said Alistair Baskey, a spokesman for the National Security Council. “While we are not in a position to detail every effort or every tool we are using to try to bring American hostages home, we will continue to bring all appropriate military, intelligence, law enforcement, and diplomatic capabilities to bear to recover American hostages. Those efforts continue every day.” ||||| WASHINGTON—The Obama administration is undertaking a review of how it handles cases of U.S. citizens held captive by extremists abroad, according to a letter from a top Pentagon official made public Monday, a move that follows criticism from some relatives of slain Americans. The review, according to the Pentagon letter, is designed to improve interagency coordination in hostage cases and will examine intelligence-collection efforts... |||||Summary:","completion":"President Obama has asked for a complete check of how the U.S. government tries to free Americans who are captured by bad people in other countries. This is because some people have said that the current ways of talking to get the hostages free have problems and lack direction. This became important because more Americans are being captured in other countries. President Obama wants to focus on how the U.S. helps the families of these hostages too. For instance, the families who have lost their loved ones to a really bad group called ISIS have said that the U.S. government didn't help them enough when they tried to find and free their children. President Obama wants all parts of the government to work together better to free Americans who are captured."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Given the question: I have a new situation: Two nearby villages are experiencing earthquakes. Bow village gets a lot of earthquakes annually, while Arrow village gets only a few. But I can use this background: Almost all earthquakes occur at plate boundaries. All types of plate boundaries have earthquakes. Convection within the Earth causes the plates to move. As the plates move, stresses build. When the stresses build too much, the rocks break. The break releases the energy that was stored in the rocks. The sudden release of energy is an earthquake. During an earthquake the rocks usually move several centimeters. Rarely, they may move as much as a few meters. Elastic rebound theory describes how earthquakes occur ( Figure below ). What is an answer for this question: Which village experiences fewer rocks breaking? The answer is:","completion":"Arrow village experiences fewer rocks breaking. This is implied by the information that Arrow village gets only a few earthquakes annually, compared to Bow village which gets a lot. This means that the rocks in the area of Arrow village break less often, resulting in fewer earthquakes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Question: \\"Excerpts of this work by Strauss are often used commercially.\\" Context: \\"Certain staples of classical music are often used commercially (either in advertising or in movie soundtracks). In television commercials, several passages have become clichéd, particularly the opening of Richard Strauss' Also sprach Zarathustra (made famous in the film 2001: A Space Odyssey) and the opening section \\"O Fortuna\\" of Carl Orff's Carmina Burana, often used in the horror genre; other examples include the Dies Irae from the Verdi Requiem, Edvard Grieg's In the Hall of the Mountain King from Peer Gynt, the opening bars of Beethoven's Symphony No. 5, Wagner's Ride of the Valkyries from Die Walküre, Rimsky-Korsakov's Flight of the Bumblebee, and excerpts of Aaron Copland's Rodeo.\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"Richard Strauss' Also sprach Zarathustra, a tone poem composed in 1896, has indeed been prominently featured in various commercial settings. As mentioned in the context provided, the piece owes much of its fame to its appearance in Stanley Kubrick's science fiction masterpiece 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968). The iconic opening fanfare, famously titled \\"Sunrise,\\" has become a symbol of grandeur and a harbinger of mighty revelations since its association with the portrayal of the dawn of man and the cosmic mysteries explored in the film. This association has led to the widespread commercial use of this particular excerpt from Strauss' work. The effectiveness of Also sprach Zarathustra in capturing the attention of audiences stems from its powerful and enigmatic musical themes. The opening fanfare features a bold C-G-C motif played by the brass section, punctuated by timpani and accompanied by a sustained low C on the organ. This pattern is contrasted with the serene, ascending melody played by the woodwind section, creating a sense of awe and wonder. As the piece progresses, the orchestration becomes even more lavish and colorful, and the musical themes are developed and transformed. The commercial appeal of Also sprach Zarathustra is further bolstered by the work's fascinating programmatic content. Strauss drew inspiration from Friedrich Nietzsche's philosophical novel of the same name, in which the prophet Zarathustra proclaims the death of God and advocates for the creation of new values to upend conventional morality. The music evokes the spirit of this bold endeavor with its tumultuous dynamics and harmonies, reflecting both the triumph and tragedy of humankind's quest for meaning and enlightenment. In the world of advertising, the use of the opening fanfare from Also sprach Zarathustra has become almost a cliché, heard in numerous commercials to convey a sense of grand achievement or momentous discovery. For instance, it has been used by companies introducing revolutionary products or technologies, as well as by automotive manufacturers to underscore the power and luxury of their vehicles. The piece has also been featured in numerous film trailers, particularly for movies that aspire to epic or profound themes. Beyond commercials, the \\"Sunrise\\" fanfare and other excerpts from Also sprach Zarathustra can be found in various forms of popular culture, such as television, film, and sporting events. In these contexts, the music serves a similar function, drawing upon its inherent sense of majesty and awe, as well as its associations with revolutionary breakthroughs and transcendental experiences. In conclusion, the enduring appeal and success of Richard Strauss' Also sprach Zarathustra in commercial settings can be attributed to a combination of its powerful musical language, its provocative programmatic content, and its established cultural associations with the exploration of unknown frontiers and the unfolding of cosmic mysteries."},{"prompt":"Q: I heard that Jesse produced Austin's result successfully.

Plot title: Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths Movie plot: In an alternate universe where the roles of the heroes and villains are reversed from their counterparts in the mainstream DC Universe, heroic analogues of Lex Luthor and the Joker (called the Jester) are stealing a device called the \\"Quantum Trigger\\" from the headquarters of the Crime Syndicate. When an alarm is tripped, the Jester sacrifices himself to allow Luthor to escape and kills J'edd J'arkus and Angelique (alternate versions of Martian Manhunter and Hawkgirl respectively) with a bomb. Luthor is nearly captured by the remaining Syndicate members (Ultraman, Superwoman, Power Ring, Johnny Quick and Owlman) but escapes to the Earth of the heroic Justice League by activating a dimensional travel device. Luthor locates a police station but is mistaken for the evil Luthor. The Justice League is summoned and Superman's x-ray vision confirms Luthor's reversed organs indicate that he is from a parallel Earth and that the evil Luthor is still incarcerated at Stryker's Island. The Justice League take the alternate Luthor to the Watchtower, where they learn of the Syndicate threat. As the Justice League debates the matter, Luthor hides the Quantum Trigger on the satellite. With the exception of Batman, the rest of the Justice League (Superman, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern, Flash and Martian Manhunter) travel to Luthor's Earth.

News article: Goth at 40: The enduring appeal of bleakness and black lipstick NEW YORK — The Cure has been drawing massive crowds during its North American tour, so it seems a good opportunity to talk to goths, whose love of all things bleak, and of unattractive lipstick shades, never cease to fascinate sunny American normals. Outside Madison Square Garden, it’s easy to find a friendly family of goths — one current, two formers and their mom. (She just likes to wear black.) Ask them what goth means today, and you get an answer much like black-clad kids have been giving for the past — wow, nearly 40 years. Goth is realism, says Martin Willis, 23, who is wearing a black leather jacket and black lipstick, and whose green eyes are rimmed for an undead look. “I see how the world is, and I just want to cry to no end,” he says. Goth is remarkably hardy, a subculture that’s established itself as a kind of permanent Other, the dark yin to our country’s relentlessly optimistic yang. After its emergence in the late 1970s, its ethos of despair and decay traveled around the world, colonizing places as diverse as Germany, Mexico and Japan, and setting up permanent camp in the United States, where the question of “what is goth?” has lately become fraught. Or maybe it always was. For example: Is Kylie Jenner goth? Journalists have casually tagged the Kardashian sibling as such, now that she is hawking black lipsticks in shades called “Dead of Knight” and “Kymajesty Metal Matte.” This is the sort of thing that sends actual goths into fits of apocalyptic frenzy, since they consider their subculture so much more than a fleeting summer beauty look. Indeed, the idea of mainstream absorption is regarded as a kind of existential threat by many goths, who as a result tend to be Talmudically precise about what they are, and what they aren’t. “I blame Hot Topic,” says Janice Mallardi, Willis’s sister, who at 25, married and with a kid, has aged out of calling herself goth but still seems to carry it in her heart. “There’s a serious dilution of what had been traditional goth culture,” says her husband, Malcolm, 36. “Like the classic vampire film! The ‘Twilight’ films have kind of killed the classics for me.” If you ask a goth academic — because of course there are goth academics — it’s this constant process of questioning and defining that keeps the subculture vibrant. On this, the third and final night of the Cure’s sold-out Madison Square Garden run, there are many people wearing their inner darkness for all to see. There’s a mother-and-daughter punk-goth pair (the daughter has epic black eye makeup and feels a strong emotional connection to bats), and there’s a guy in a Kylo Ren costume — the dark side of the Force, you know. There are also plenty of normals, because plenty of kinds of people enjoy the Cure’s music, which ranges from gloomy to eerily atmospheric to playful pop. God willing, there will always be kids like Martin Willis, who considers himself an anarchist, and a bit of a nihilist, who finds wandering old graveyards comforting, and describes Marilyn Manson songs as “cheery” because they prove he’s not alone in his melancholy. There’s something about goth that feels like a necessary critique of Americanness, no less urgent for being in middle age. “I think ‘normal’ is a fad that should go away, honestly,” Willis says. After nearly four decades, goth lumbers on, zombielike in its relentless opposition to whatever counts as mainstream at the moment. The gothic rock sound, as the press and music insiders termed it, emerged in late-1970s Britain, giving rise to the post-punk subculture that became known as goth. It drew on a “discordant bricolage of hyperromantic elements,” as the scholarly text “Goth: Undead Subculture” puts it: vampires, Mary Shelley, Nosferatu, druids, pagans, Bettie Page, absinthe-fueled readings of Edward Gorey and so on. It served as a door into cultural subversion and also as a refuge for intellectuals and depressives, outcasts and downcasts, the quiet and misunderstood. Kids alienated from football-and-cheerleader culture found solace in goth; kids who liked old poetry and old tombstones; kids who loved Siouxsie and the Banshees, Joy Division, and Bauhaus. As goths, they could band together and eschew their mundane given names for something like Drusilla or Hades. The ’80s and ’90s were a good time for goth, until, with the Columbine school shootings, they weren’t. Some media reports claimed the two shooters were obsessed with the subculture, and goths were put on the defensive, forced to explain that their love of moody music and Doc Martens had nothing whatsoever to do with homicidal atrocities. There’s still the occasional scare, such as when a group of “men dressed in black” walking along a Muscatine County, Iowa, roadside triggered a police report. But the public image has softened; a 2004 Edmonton Journal headline proclaimed the finding that “Goth subculture of outcasts surprisingly gentle, polite.” (“Bizarre dress,” the headline went on to explain, is merely a “welcoming signal to like-minded.”) Other music-based subcultures have flashed and faded — grunge, mods, Teddy boys, hair metal — but goth persists, despite the fact that the bands most associated with it made their names decades ago. The scene has spawned a ton of subtypes, including trad goths, vamp goths, rivetheads, romantigoths, cyber goths, nu goths, gothic Lolitas (they started in Japan, naturally) and corp goths (for those who grew up and became paralegals). As “Goth: Undead Subculture” points out, the goth look can mean chunky boots or high-heeled ones, cravats or riding crops or top hats, piercings, whiteface, fangs . . . all for a look that “may evoke high chic, antique, retro-kitsch, punk, fetish, second-hand trash,” or something else altogether. Goth expert Liisa Ladouceur wrote an entire “Encyclopedia Gothica” in an attempt to answer the question of what goth is. (Short answer: It’s complicated.) Lee Meadows, who is known as DJ Cruel Brittania, says the Internet saved goth, just when it should have logically gone extinct. Dispersed online, it became a refuge for all the sad kids of the world who felt that no one in their small towns understood them. In 2009, Meadows co-founded World Goth Day, and now Mexico and Brazil — those sunny, happy places — are among the most avid participants; festivals in England and Germany draw thousands as well. In the United States, the scene appears to be steady, neither growing nor shrinking. Some goths age out; young’uns come along. Between 6,000 and 7,000 people this year attended Bats Day in the Fun Park, an annual goth convention that takes place in and around Disneyland. In Denver, there was recently a “goth prom” that drew 500 people, with a special appearance by enthusiasts of the Denver Hearse Association. In D.C., a monthly dance party known as the Coven and designed for queer “witchy” women, attracts 300 people every month. Goth girls still seek goth guys on Craigslist. Goth seems to stay in people’s souls, even when they grow up and get jobs and have kids and stop dressing quite as outrageously as they once did. It is an outlook, a refuge, a dark corner made friendly by the presence of others. Hence: elder goths. “They told me it was too hot today to wear all black and I said, ‘Screw ’em,’ ” says Judy Miller Silverman, a music publicist who turned goth as an ’80s teenager and once scandalized her Jewish mother by wearing a cross (goths love crosses), and recently tweeted out her joy at the introduction of the new black heart emoji. The identity has such enduring appeal to those who see themselves as lifers that it has spawned not one, but two goth-themed cruises. One of them, called GothCruise, is celebrating its 13th year with a trip to Maine, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. The theme: “Disasters and Apocalypses.” And now, goth is enduring another crossover moment. The fashion magazine Nylon reports that “goth style is more mainstream than ever” — Katy Perry, the Olsen twins and all your favorite celebs are wearing it! “Gothic glamour” was on display at runway shows by Marc Jacobs and Rodarte, and in the collaboration between Rihanna and Puma. Kylie Jenner is pushing those black lipsticks while older sister Kendall recently starred in a dystopian fashion shoot with Marilyn Manson, who is himself having a mini-moment. (He’s due to appear in the third season of “Salem,” as a bloodletting barber/surgeon, naturally.) According to celebrity chroniclers, Taylor Swift was for a time channeling her “inner goth” — a notion that is like matter meeting antimatter and the universe exploding. “We’re certainly in a phase where people do wear black lipstick,” says Ladouceur, who recently released a delightful short video called “Forty Years of Goth Style.” “I’m not sure why. We wear it to be unpretty. . . . It’s fascinating to me when pretty people start to wear our weird stuff.” Other things Ladouceur and her friends like to wear: Corsets. Fishnets. Platform heels. Fascinators. Parasols. Various items made of rubber. “If you’re going to go out in August wearing a velvet cape you can’t be upset when people stare,” Ladouceur says. “The average person would never go out wearing the stuff that me and my friends wear. They would feel ridiculous. And I love that. It takes a commitment.” Perhaps all this fashionable darkness is linked to a gloomy strain that’s been bubbling up in our culture. The science of death is big right now, as are mortality-themed gatherings such as Death Cafes. Last year, New York’s Metropolitan Museum of Art had an exhibit on the last century of mourning attire. The Cure’s North American tour has absolutely blown up. The poet Melissa Broder, who tweets her dark humor to 367,000 followers under @SoSadToday, has a new book of personal essays. (Sample: “I’m not emotionally dead I just want to be.” And: “bringing another person into this world isn’t very nice of you.”) Lynne Zacek Bassett, who curated the recent show “Gothic to Goth: Romantic Era Fashion & Its Legacy” at the Wadsworth Atheneum Museum of Art in Hartford, Conn., says that both goth and retrofuturistic steampunk — which offers a mock Victorian vision of sci-fi, complete with bustles, brass goggles and world-touring dirigibles — trace their roots to the romantic era of the first half of the 19th century, which was itself an idealization of a rural past that emerged during the Sturm und Drang of the Industrial Revolution. Bassett argues that this kind of looking back crops up during times of social and economic anxiety. But what will hopefully save goth is that there’s a limit to how mainstream it can become. Its unprettiness is transgressive, as is the confusing way it mixes sexiness and decay. Goth’s androgyny, its embrace of eyelinered men in long skirts, isn’t easily appropriated by a masculinized culture, argues Michael Bibby, an English professor at Shippensburg University of Pennsylvania who co-edited “Goth: Undead Subculture,” and its music isn’t easily used in commercials — how do you sell something as downbeat as death? It functions as both a way of life and as an artful pose, a critique of ­“happy-happy culture,” as Bibby calls it. If it makes normals uncomfortable, that’s the point. Perhaps we always needed goth. Perhaps we always had it. “Before people started calling themselves goth, there were goths,” says Bob Westphal, who runs the aforementioned GothCruise. “Where did the Addams Family come from? Where did the Munsters come from? Where did dark humor come from? Could that retroactively be called goth? Has goth always existed?” What are the most important parts of this news article?","completion":"This news article talks about the enduring appeal of the goth subculture, which is about 40 years old now. The goth style has more mainstream appeal than ever before, with celebrities like Katy Perry and the Olsen twins embracing the dark look. The goth subculture started in the late 1970s and has an ethos of despair and decay. Its unprettiness and transgressive nature make it less likely to be fully absorbed by the mainstream, keeping its unique identity. The article mentions various aspects of goth culture, its continued popularity, and how it feels like a necessary critique of sunny, optimistic mainstream culture."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Some species of wood-decay fungi attack dead wood, such as brown rot, and some, such as Armillaria (honey fungus), are parasitic and colonize living trees. Excessive moisture above the fibre saturation point in wood is required for fungal colonization and proliferation.[1] Fungi that not only grow on wood but permeate its fibrous structure and actually cause decay, are called lignicolous fungi. In nature, this process causes the breakdown of complex molecules and leads to the return of nutrients to the soil.[2] Various lignicolous fungi consume wood in various ways; for example, some attack the carbohydrates in wood and some others decay lignin. The rate of decay of wooden materials in various climates can be estimated by empirical models.[3] The mycologist wanted to move to a rural area, to further his research, and found these two villages situated 10 miles from each other. The interesting fact about these villages was that while both villages had a forest nearby, one presented more signs of water saturation than the other, so that the rate of decay in wood was greater in Peak Forest. More fungi were present in Peak Forest. The Valley Forest was dryer, although the rain amounts were similar, partially because of a drainage system composed of ditches, that were dug by the locals. The rate of wood decay continued to increase in the Peak Forest, while being significantly reduced in the Valley Forest. Which forest will have more wood-decay fungi? Answer:","completion":"The Peak Forest will have more wood-decay fungi, as it has more signs of water saturation, leading to a greater rate of decay in wood and the presence of more fungi in comparison to the Valley Forest."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Question: Who stole the footage? Movie title: The China Syndrome Movie plot: While visiting the (fictional) Ventana nuclear power plant outside Los Angeles, television news reporter Kimberly Wells (Fonda), her cameraman Richard Adams (Douglas) and their soundman Hector Salas witness the plant going through an emergency shutdown (SCRAM). Shift Supervisor Jack Godell (Lemmon) notices an unusual vibration while grabbing his cup of coffee which he had set down. He then finds that a gauge is misreading and that the coolant is dangerously low (he thought it was overflowing). The crew manages to bring the reactor under control and can be seen celebrating and expressing relief. Richard surreptitiously films the incident, despite being requested to not film the control room for security purposes. Kimberly's superior at work (Donat) refuses to permit her to report what happened or show the film, disgusting Richard, who steals the footage. He shows it to experts, who conclude that the plant came perilously close to the China Syndrome in which the core would have melted down into the earth, hitting groundwater and contaminating the surrounding area with radioactive steam. During an inspection of the plant before it is brought back online, Godell discovers a puddle of radioactive water that has apparently leaked from a pump. Godell pushes to delay restarting the plant, but the plant superintendent denies his request and appears willing to let nothing stand in the way of the scheduled restart of the plant. Godell investigates further and finds that a series of radiographs supposedly taken to verify the integrity of welds on the leaking pump are identical - the contractor simply kept submitting the same picture. He believes that the plant is unsafe and could be severely damaged if another full-power SCRAM occurs. He tries to bring the evidence to plant manager Herman DeYoung (Brady), who brushes off Godell as paranoid and states that new radiographs would cost at least 20 million. Godell confronts D.B.

Neighborhood Legal Services, which provides free legal services to the poor, has expanded into the San Gabriel and Pomona valleys, areas with large Asian populations, many of whom speak limited or no English. Language is their biggest obstacle, but the Asian communities' cultural isolation and service providers' lack of cultural expertise also play a part, said NLS executive director Neal Dubovitz. And with 13 percent to 15 percent of the Asian population in the U.S. living below the poverty line, NLS services are badly needed, Dubovitz said. \\"Although it is a significant part of the poverty population, Asians historically have not been able to participate in the services and programs available to the poor,\\" he said. From simple telephone advice to complete legal representation in court, the agency provides free consumer, health, family, immigration, housing, public benefits and labor legal services to people who earn under 1,380 per month. Legal service providers have long served large Latino populations, who have cultural diversity but share a common language. \\"I remember the days when there were only a handful of people in the legal offices who spoke Spanish,\\" Dudovitz said. \\"Now Spanish and English are interchangeable. Our goal is to have that for the major Asian languages as well.\\" Before the expansion, only a few NLS lawyers spoke Asian languages, said attorney Rebecca Yee, who was hired by NLS in April 2002 to design and head the project. \\"Now we have people speaking Cantonese, Mandarin, Thai, Khmer (from Cambodia), Korean, Vietnamese, Japanese and Tagalog,\\" Yee said. One of the 13 attorneys hired to work with the program is Irene Mak, a family law attorney who speaks Cantonese, Mandarin and Thai. Mak was a partner at a private law firm before she went to work for NLS two years ago, earning up to 20,000 less a year working on domestic violence cases. \\"The job is more satisfying than the money,\\" said Mak, who grew up in Hong Kong and Thailand before coming to the United States. \\"I could use my language skills and wanted to give back to the Asian community.\\" NLS expanded when Legal Services Corp., the federal agency that funds providers of free legal services nationwide, reduced the number of grantees in the Los Angeles area from five to three, Dudovitz said. NLS won the competitive grant over the Legal Services Program for Pasadena, San Gabriel-Pomona valleys. That boosted its client base from 16,000 to around 25,000, and NLS opened an office in El Monte.

Given the following context: From 1916, Nielsen taught at the Royal Academy where he became director in 1931, shortly before his death. He also had private students in his earlier days in order to supplement his income. As a result of his teaching, Nielsen has exerted considerable influence on classical music in Denmark. Among his most successful pupils were the composers Thorvald Aagaard, remembered in particular for his songs, Harald Agersnap, both a conductor and orchestral composer, and Jørgen Bentzon who composed choral and chamber music mainly for his folk music school (Københavns Folkemusikskole). Among his other students were the musicologist Knud Jeppesen, the pianist Herman Koppel, the academy professor and symphony composer Poul Schierbeck, the organist Emilius Bangert who played at Roskilde Cathedral, and Nancy Dalberg, one of Nielsen's private students who helped with the orchestration of Aladdin. Nielsen also instructed the conductor and choirmaster Mogens Wöldike, remembered for his interpretations of Baroque music, and Rudolph Simonsen, the pianist and composer who became director of the Academy after Nielsen's death.The Carl Nielsen Society maintains a listing of performances of Nielsen's works, classified by region (Denmark, Scandinavia, Europe apart from Scandinavia and outside Europe) which demonstrates that his music is regularly performed throughout the world. The concerti and symphonies feature frequently in these listings. The Carl Nielsen International Competition commenced in the 1970s under the auspices of the Odense Symphony Orchestra. A four-yearly violin competition has been held there since 1980. Flute and clarinet competitions were later added, but these have now been discontinued. An international Organ Competition, founded by the city of Odense, became associated with the Nielsen competition in 2009, but from 2015 will be organized separately, based in Odense Cathedral. answer the following question: What is the last name of the person that taught Knud Jeppesen?","completion":"The last name of the person that taught Knud Jeppesen is Nielsen.

Background: Titas (Portuguese pronunciation: [tSi'tas]) are a rock band from Sao Paulo, Brazil. Though they basically play pop/alternative rock, their music has touched a number of other styles throughout their 30-year career, such as new wave, punk rock, grunge, MPB and electronic music. They are one of the most successful rock bands in Brazil, having sold more than 6,3 million albums as of 2005 and having been covered by several well-known Brazilian artists and a couple of international singers. They were awarded a Latin Grammy in 2009 and have won the Imprensa Trophy for Best Band a record four times. Context: On February 12, 2010, Titas announced in their official website that drummer Charles Gavin would leave the band for personal reasons. Gavin later stated that he was physically and mentally exhausted because of the tours and album releases. The quartet continued their performances of the Sacos Plasticos tour with drummer Mario Fabre, who is still with the band as of 2018, though not as an official member. Fabre was suggested by Gavin himself. When asked about the status of Fabre in the band, Bellotto explained that \\"he is the official drummer! He's the drummer of Titas! But he isn't one of Titas, because our history began long ago, at Greek mythology... \\" During an interview, keyboardist Sergio Britto said the band was planning to start recording a new album in 2011. Nothing else was said since then, until March 2013, when they revealed they were starting to work on a new album, to be released in the second half of 2013. The album would be self-produced, and, according to Britto, it would be \\"a mixture between Cabeca Dinossauro and O Blesq Blom. In January 2012, the band announced a live performance in company of ex-members Arnaldo Antunes, Nando Reis and Charles Gavin. The show would celebrate the 30-year career of the band, and would include guest performances of other friends of the band, and there were plans for a DVD release. According to Miklos: The reunion took place on October 6, 2012, in Sao Paulo. For the first time since 1997's Acustico MTV, the seven original members of the band reunited for a one-night performance. According to Bellotto: The band gathered in Reis' house to discuss the reunion - it was the first time since Fromer's death that all seven members met.

Understand the sentence: The given sentence states that Adam needs to avoid someone named Kenneth for the sake of his psychological health. It implies that there is something about Kenneth that threatens Adam's mental well-being. 2. Evaluate each option: (A). Adam was very vulnerable. (B). Kenneth was very vulnerable. Option (A) suggests that Adam's psychological health could be under threat due to his own vulnerability. This makes sense in the context of the first part of the sentence and provides a reason for why Adam might need to distance himself from Kenneth. Option (B) suggests that Kenneth was the vulnerable one. However, this does not logically explain why Adam needs to avoid Kenneth for the sake of his own psychological health. Between the two options, option (A) fits the sentence more logically because the sentence is setting up an explanation for why Adam needs to avoid Kenneth.

Answer based on context: Upper Austria had been rebellious for centuries, with 62 known uprisings between 1356 and 1849, 14 of which occurred in the 16th century. However, the Peasants' War of 1626 was the costliest in terms of human life and damage to livestock and property. The war caused Martin Aichinger to lose his farm and begin roaming the country. He eventually became a religious leader who led a popular revolt against aristocratic rule. His revolutionary ideas frightened the rulers so much that they tried to arrest him, leading to another series of uprisings that ended in the Battle on the Frankenberg in 1636. All of Aichinger's followers were slaughtered during the battle, including the remaining women and children who had been in hiding. How many uprisings occurred outside of the 16th century?","completion":"In order to determine how many uprisings occurred outside of the 16th century, we must first look at the total number of known uprisings, which is 62.

Vilvoorden tehdassulkeminen ei ole vain paikallinen ongelma, vaan se heijastaa laajempaa teollisuuden muutosta, jossa yritykset pyrkivät minimoimaan kustannuksia ja tehostamaan toimintaansa usein työpaikkojen menetyksen kustannuksella.

What is the answer for the question: What is the full name of the person who admires the Prime Minister? from the following article ? In 1874, Disraeli's ambitious foreign policy, aimed at creating a British empire, is voted down by the House of Commons after a speech by his great rival, William Gladstone. Later, Disraeli receives the welcome news that the spendthrift Khedive of Egypt is in dire need of money and is willing to sell the controlling shares in the Suez Canal. The purchase of the canal would secure control of India, but Michael Probert, head of the Bank of England, makes it clear to Disraeli that he is vehemently opposed to any such plan. Disraeli then summons Hugh Myers, a leading Jewish banker. Meanwhile, Lord Charles Deeford proposes to Lady Clarissa Pevensey. Although she is in love with him, she turns him down. He is content to enjoy his wealth and high social standing, and lacks the ambition she wants in a husband; further, she is a great admirer of the Prime Minister and Charles has no strong opinion about him. Disraeli, seeing promise in the young man and wanting Clarissa to be happy, convinces Charles to come work for him, and tells him about the canal purchase. But he does not tell him about the spies. Russia, eager to seize India for itself, has assigned two spies to watch Disraeli: Mrs. Travers, who has entree to the highest social circles, and Mr. Foljambe. Disraeli was not fooled; he has hired Foljambe as his personal government secretary, the better to deceive him. When Foljambe asks Charles if Myers is there to provide financial backing for the purchase of the canal, Charles says nothing, but his manner makes it clear that Foljambe has guessed correctly. Mrs. Travers orders Foljambe to leave the country and warn their masters. Disraeli soon discovers what has happened. When he decides to send an agent to the khedive immediately, Clarissa suggests he send Charles.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Can Obama Escape the Alberta Tar Pit? President Obama is in a situation right now somewhat akin to that facing the creatures that once prowled the edges of the La Brea tar pits — a sticky trap that caught and consumed the least wary or agile members of many species. For Obama, the physical tar pit lies far away in northeastern Alberta province, Canada, but a rhetorical one surrounds him in Washington as the fight to shape his position on an oil pipeline draws toward a climax. He has a way out, but it’s a tricky path. Here’s the situation: Later this year Obama needs to decide if it is in the nation’s interest to approve the Keystone XL pipeline, which would be able to carry more than half a million barrels a day of a tarry oil precursor from Saudi-scale deposits in Alberta to American fuel refineries. (The administration’s approval is required because the pipeline crosses an international border.) There are signs that, despite impassioned opposition by environmentalists who were once important Obama allies, he will give the project the green light. Passion isn’t matched by response, in part, because environmental concerns cannot compete as an issue with persistent economic stagnation and joblessness. The most recent evidence was the White House decision Friday to hold off on tightening standards for air pollutants that form smog. The most visible protest on the pipeline plan has been a weeks-long demonstration outside the White House that culminated on Saturday. In the action, more than 1,200 campaigners, scientists (including NASA’s Jim Hansen), students and other concerned citizens — mainly brought there by the project’s climate impacts — sat down and waited for handcuffs: You can read reams of valuable context on the issues surrounding the Alberta resource and the pipeline in Foreign Policy (a particularly illuminating new tour of North American energy prospects by Charles Homans) The Times, The New Yorker, The Economist and more reams of blog and editorial commentary. (The Times editorial board has repeatedly criticized the pipeline plan.) I also encourage you to read analysis by the Canadian economist Andrew Leach for help in distinguishing hype from fact. My views are close to those of Michael Levi of the Council on Foreign Relations, who’s been providing analysis of the climate, security and economic issues since 2009 and who leans toward Obama approving the pipeline while pursuing energy and climate policies that would, in the end, render it insignificant and uneconomical. For me the pipeline, in isolation, is not in the national interest if we have any interest in not contributing, through our driving habits, to the despoliation of far-flung parts of the planet. This method of extracting petroleum leaves an unholy mess, even as conveyed by a libertarian writer like Ronald Bailey visiting the Alberta oil-sands mines on a junket paid for by oil companies. Consider his recent description of the vast amounts of residual material that persist for decades: Mature fine tailings are the big problem for oil sands extraction. They consist of a gel-like suspension of very fine clay, which for chemical reasons refuses to solidify in less than 30 years. Consequently, oil sands mines are surrounded by vast tailings ponds…. The ponds shimmer with a oily sheen since not all bitumen can be extracted from the sand. But that’s my stance on the project outside of broader contexts. Overall, I think Obama should not stand in the way of the pipeline. While it’s a potent symbol and convenient rallying point for campaigners, it’s a distraction from core issues and opportunities on energy and largely insignificant if your concern is averting a disruptive buildup of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. The pipeline plan doesn’t exist in isolation. With the economy in its own tar pit and a presidential election approaching, it’s very much in the national interest for Obama to avoid saddling himself with an unnecessary issue that would be easy for his foes to distort into an Obama anti-jobs position. This particular pipeline has a good chance of dying on the vine in any case if and when easier, less expensive sources of transportation fuel come online, including domestic oil and natural gas (and there are competing pipeline options and routes). The greenhouse impact of the oil sands is also far less significant than some claims, particularly given the reality that oil consumption rates are what matters — not the amount of gigatons of carbon sitting in deposits of this sort in the ground. Environmentalists’ statements about the massive greenhouse impact from oil-sand carbon don’t mention that it would take a millennium or more, even at a breath-taking rate of extraction of, say, 5 million barrels a day, for that CO2 impact to be fully realized (as if no new energy options, or methods for sopping up CO2, will arise in the future), as pointed out by Andrew Leach last June: In the fight against climate change, every bit counts, but to make an argument that is based on a leverage ratio of somewhere between 90 and 500 times the actual damage caused by a particular project is not the right way to go about it…. [I]f you want deep cuts to [greenhouse gas] emissions, you need a broad-based policy, not a hopelessly leveraged argument against a single project. In my opinion, those are the arguments most likely to be ignored as alarmist. I think that Americans are eager for a serious American energy policy that could both erode the economics of this pipeline and marginalize the “drill baby drill” crowd as childish and irresponsible. If Obama cast all of this the right way, such a policy would incorporate the need for more domestic energy exploration and development (done responsibly) with a long-term plan that also stresses conservation, efficiency and innovation. These same issues arose when Obama faced the BP gusher in the Gulf. Read my 2010 post on “Obama’s Oil and Energy Opportunity” to get my view of a sustainable policy path. In an interview taped earlier this summer, I discussed some of the core issues related to oil sands on The Agenda, the Canadian public affairs program. The interview ran last week as part of a five-day package focused on global energy issues and opportunities: In a post on Friday, Michael Levi wrote of the limited significance of the Keystone XL pipeline and the primacy of policies that curb demand for oil: Slash oil demand and oil sands development goes away; keep oil demand on its current trajectory and we’ve got huge climate problems regardless of whether Keystone XL is approved. I agree completely. Levi, who has exposed overstatements on both sides of the polarized debate, sees the pipeline as meriting approval mainly because its impact on climate — whether approved or denied — would be minimal when placed in global context. Levi and I discussed the pipeline on Friday via Skype. Here are some highlights: One of his points in our chat was that a reduction in demand kills the economics that make such marginal and expensive sources of fuel remotely feasible: The goal of climate policy should be to reduce demand for fossil fuels and if we do that the oil sands will become superfluous. In an e-mail before our exchange, I asked him the core question facing Obama: Is the pipeline in the national interest. Here’s Levi’s reply: I’ve been studiously avoiding coming down one way or the other on the national interest issue, in part because I’m pretty ambivalent, but I guess it’s time to get off the fence. I think that approval is ultimately in the U.S. national interest, so long as U.S. regulators ensure that the pipeline is operated safely. I do not buy the argument that the pipeline would be a massive windfall for U.S. security. I also think that climate change needs to be taken seriously. That said, reducing emissions by blocking the pipeline would likely be far more costly (primarily in terms of higher world oil prices but also, potentially, in terms of reduced Bakken production) than almost any other emissions-cutting approach that serious people contemplate. Let’s focus on those other approaches. (Targeting oil sands production also has very limited potential, since total oil sands production emissions are a tiny fraction of total U.S. emissions.) There is no realistic scenario where the oil sands are the difference between success and failure in addressing climate change. [ACR: I added the Bakken link for context.] I recognize that Bill McKibben, Jim Hansen and others see this particular project as crossing their moral line in the (tar) sand. I respect their decision to pursue civil disobedience. But I haven’t joined them because — while I would love to see America and the world cut oil appetites – I see more promising routes to meaningful progress on that front. And once the appetite is cut, there is less pressure to push the limits of oil extraction, both toward dirty, hard-to-extract deposits like Alberta’s, the deep-sea bed, the Arctic and elsewhere. I also think Bryan Walsh and Michael Grunwald at Time Magazine are right in pointing out the perils that could come if environmental groups keep beating up on Obama. As Walsh wrote a week ago: If greens want to sit out the election and help a President Rick Perry or a President Michele Bachmann become a reality, go ahead. It might even feel good. But the consequences would be far, far, far worse than any single pipeline. In the meantime, the Tar Sands Action organizers are poised to announce phase two of their movement.","completion":"President Obama faces a critical decision on whether to approve the Keystone XL pipeline, which would transport over half a million barrels of oil per day from deposits in Alberta, Canada, to American fuel refineries. While environmentalists passionately oppose the project, there are signs that Obama will give it the green light, as environmental concerns seem less pressing when compared to persistent economic stagnation and joblessness. Some analysts argue that the pipeline is not in the nation's interest if the goal is to reduce dependence on fossil fuels. However, others believe that focusing on reducing oil demand through a comprehensive energy policy that emphasizes conservation, efficiency, and innovation would make projects like the Keystone XL pipeline economically unfeasible, thus addressing climate concerns more effectively."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Can you tell me the answer to when did women's hockey became an olympic sport??","completion":"Women's hockey became an Olympic sport during the 1998 Winter Olympic Games, which were held in Nagano, Japan. This monumental event marked a significant milestone for women's hockey and the promotion of gender equality in sports. The journey toward including women's hockey in the Olympics began much earlier, though. Women's ice hockey has been played since the early 20th century, with the first recorded women's game taking place in 1921 in Ottawa, Canada. Over the years, the popularity of women's hockey grew as various leagues and championships were established across different countries, particularly in North America and Europe. In the late 1980s, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) made a conscious effort to promote gender equality in Olympic sports and began considering the inclusion of women's ice hockey in the Winter Olympic program. In 1991, the proposal to include women's ice hockey as a medal event finally gained enough support to go through, making its debut in the 1998 Winter Olympics. The 1998 Winter Olympics marked the beginning of a new era for women's hockey as six teams competed for the inaugural gold medal. The participating countries were the United States, Canada, Finland, Sweden, China, and Japan. The tournament was played in a round-robin format, followed by a knockout stage to determine the medal winners. The United States claimed the first gold medal in women's Olympic hockey by defeating Canada in the final, and Finland won the bronze medal by beating China. Since then, women's hockey has remained a fixture at the Winter Olympics, attracting increased attention and competitiveness. The number of participating teams expanded to eight in the 2002 Winter Olympics held in Salt Lake City, ensuring more opportunities for female hockey players from various countries to compete on the world stage. The inclusion of women's hockey in the Olympics has not only raised the global profile of the sport but has also led to increased participation and development within the women's hockey community. With dedicated athletes, burgeoning leagues, and growing fan bases, women's hockey continues to flourish and break barriers, inspiring future generations of female athletes to pursue their dreams and excel in the sport they love."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Write a title for this article: J.J. Abrams, meanwhile, tends toward a cinematographic trope that looks, at first glance, like a screw-up -- lens flare -- i.e. intentionally flooding the camera frame with light to deliberately wash out or obscure the imagery on-screen. His 2011 sci-fi thriller “Super 8” is packed with hazy flashes of light, as is the filmmaker’s 2009 “Star Trek” movie reboot. But what was once the cinematic equivalent of a nervous tic has become a full-blown body tremor. And critics say the director needs a lens flare intervention. Abrams’ presumed summer blockbuster “Star Trek Into Darkness,” which arrives in theaters May 17, features so much hazy blue light bombarding the starship Enterprise's flight deck that audience members would be forgiven for mistaking the lens flares (rendered even more vivid in 3-D) for incoming photon torpedoes. With the movie opening earlier this month across Europe, Asia and Australia, early reviewers, most of whom like the movie, nevertheless have taken the director to task for showcasing so many diffuse bursts of light rather than leaving them on the editing bay floor where they say they belong. “In ‘Star Trek Into Darkness,’ [Abrams] does his best to ensure gratuitous use of lens flare will live long and prosper,” Luke Buckmaster wrote on Crikey, an Australian media blog. “Only the most ambitious film critics profess to interpret why he does this, other than to observe that the effect looks kind of cool.” In the Guardian UK, critic Andrew Pulver puts the convention within context of a notorious music video vixen, noting that “ ‘Into Darkness’ is slathered in so much lens flare it looks like a Kylie Minogue video.” In his “Into Darkness” review, Shadowlocked.com’s Lewis Bazley seems to resign himself to Abrams’ continuing abuse of the light flare treatment. “… if you tease [Abrams] for his love of lens flare, he’ll just double his efforts to obscure some of every shot with refracted light,” Bazley writes. Abrams’ over-reliance on lens flare prompted the wags at Boy Genius Comedy to lampoon the director with a short called “Lens Flare: The Movie” featuring a group of young people who fear alien invasion but are rendered too blind by lens flash trickery to do anything about it. For his part, at a 2009 news conference for “Star Trek,\\" Abrams admitted having his cinematographer employ flashlights and mirrors to achieve lens flare -- and getting a little carried away with the visual technique. “I wanted a visual system that felt unique,” the filmmaker said. “I know there are certain shots where even I watch and think, ‘Oh that’s ridiculous, that was too many.’ But I love the idea that the future was so bright it couldn’t be contained in the frame.” L.A.

In 1954, the Corsica pit was shut down. Workers were told that the shutdown was temporary because the demand for that particular type of ore had declined. The pit was allowed to flood, and Pickands Mather officially conceded that \\"temporary\\" might stretch into quite a long time, although the mine would perhaps \\"eventually\\" be reopened. A year later, Pickands Mather and Company, manager of the mines at Elcor and the land on which the houses rested, ordered residents to vacate the property. By edict of the mining company, the remaining families were forced out so that the company could reclaim the land.Sources differ on why the order was issued, speculating that the company wanted the land for a dump site, no longer wanted to tend to the town's maintenance, or decided it was not economical to own houses anymore. No one in authority revealed what was to become of the land.Residents of the company-owned houses were given the option to buy the structures at bargain prices, provided they moved them out of town. For many, it took much of their life savings to relocate elsewhere, taking their homes in caravans along the highways and leaving behind empty foundations. Most Elcor residents purchased lots in the surrounding communities, trying to beat land speculators. In the few months after Elcor's fate became official, land prices skyrocketed. Lots that had originally been priced at 75 were sold for as much as 500. Most of the remaining families moved about two miles west to Gilbert, although other homes were replanted in nearby McKinley. The last vestiges of the old mining community were gone by 1956. Every building was torn down or removed. All that remained for some years after were old foundations, sidewalks, rusting stoves, pipes, bottles, and yard shrubbery, formerly visible from the old section of Minnesota State Highway 135 between Gilbert and Biwabik.

Tintin and I recently aired as an episode of PBS's P.O.V. series. It's based on a taped interview of Georges Remi a.k.a. Herge, Tintin's creator, from 1971 in which in discusses his various experiences publishing his popular character, first in a Catholic newspaper, then in his own series of comic books. Awesome sweeping views of various comic pages and surreal images of Herge's dreams. I first encountered Tintin in the pages of Children's Digest at my local elementary school library reading The Secrets of the Unicorn. My mom later got a subscription to CD and I read the entire Red Rackham's Treasure every month in 1978. I remember seeing some Tintin comic books in a local book store after that but for some reason I didn't get any probably because I was 12 and I thought I was outgrowing them. I do have Breaking Free, a book written and drawn by J. Daniels, published in 1989, six years after Herge's death. Haven't read it yet. This film also covers the artist's personal life as when he left his first wife after his affair with a colorist in his employ (whom he later married). Her name is Fanny and she is interviewed here. If you love Tintin and his creator, this film is definitely worth a look. Update: 9/4/07-I've now read Breaking Free. Tintin and The Captain are the only regular characters that appear here and they are tailored to the anti-capitalist views of Mr. Daniels with Tintin portrayed as a rabble rouser with a chip on his shoulder who nevertheless cares for The Captain who he's staying with. The Captain here is just trying to make ends meet with a wife and daughter that he loves dearly. They and other construction workers vow to strike after a fellow employee dies from a faulty equipment accident. The whole thing takes place in England with working-class cockney accents intact. Not the kind of thing Herge would approve of but an interesting read nonetheless.

Earl\\", 281 U.S. 111 (1930) . \\"Horst\\" is the leading case that applies the assignment of income doctrine to income from property. Hypothesis: The \\"Horst\\" case is leading in application of the assignment of income doctrine to income from property.","completion":"Yes, we can draw the hypothesis that the \\"Horst\\" case is leading in the application of the assignment of income doctrine to income from property, based on the given context. To provide further insight into the matter, let us discuss the context, the cases mentioned, the assignment of income doctrine, and how they form the basis for this hypothesis. Context: The context introduces two influential United States Supreme Court cases: \\"Helvering v. Horst\\" (1940) and \\"Lucas v. Earl\\" (1930). Both cases have significantly impacted tax law in the United States and shed light on the way income is attributed to taxpayers. \\"Lucas v. Earl\\" (1930): In \\"Lucas v. Earl,\\" the U.S. Supreme Court established the famous \\"fruit-and-tree\\" metaphor. The Court held that income is attributed to the individual who earns it and cannot be assigned to another taxpayer in an attempt to decrease the tax burden. The person who earns the income in this metaphor is represented by the tree, while the income derived is represented by the fruit. This landmark decision laid the groundwork for subsequent income tax jurisprudence in the United States. \\"Helvering v. Horst\\" (1940): Approximately a decade later, \\"Helvering v. Horst\\" further developed and applied the \\"fruit-and-tree\\" metaphor from \\"Lucas v. Earl.\\" In \\"Horst,\\" a father gifted his son an interest coupon, which provided the son with income from the bond. The Court established that the father (the tree) continued to own the bond (the tree) and was responsible for the income taxes on the interest earned (the fruit). The Court applied the assignment of income doctrine to affirm that the income should be taxed to the individual who controls the property generating the income. Assignment of Income Doctrine: The assignment of income doctrine is a fundamental principle in United States tax law, which aims to prevent taxpayers from artificially reducing the burden of tax liability by assigning their income to other individuals or entities. This doctrine holds that income must be attributed and subsequently taxed to the individual who earned it, regardless of any assignment or agreement made to transfer that income to another person. The Hypothesis: Based on the context provided and the examination of these cases, we can conclude that the \\"Horst\\" case is indeed leading in the application of the assignment of income doctrine to income from property. \\"Horst\\" took the foundation established in \\"Lucas v. Earl\\" and expanded it to cover income generated from property. It has since become a precedent for cases involving the assignment of income concerning property-related income and thus lends credence to the hypothesis."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the context: How would you describe Addison? Possible answers: quite friendly, very inviting, friendly Answer:","completion":"Addison can be described as quite friendly, very inviting, and simply friendly based on the given context. All of these descriptions highlight different yet crucial aspects of Addison's personality regarding social interactions and her approach to including others in events, such as a birthday party. Firstly, Addison can be considered quite friendly. This description emphasizes the fact that she is actively reaching out to Lee and Jordan, as opposed to a more passive approach, such as waiting for someone to reach out to her or hoping that they found out about the party through someone else. Addison's proactivity in reaching out to invite her friends conveys a strong sense of her sociability and ability to initiate and maintain social connections. Secondly, Addison's actions also depict her as very inviting. By inviting Lee and Jordan to the party, she ensures that they feel included and welcomed. This demonstrates her thoughtfulness, as well as her desire to share experiences with others. The inclusion of the word \\"very\\" emphasizes the extent of her openness and warmth towards others in her social circle. Lastly, the term \\"friendly\\" serves as a general summary of the previous descriptions. It underscores the fact that Addison has a positive disposition, which makes it easier for her to maintain strong relationships and enjoy social gatherings. While it may be a more concise adjective compared to the other two descriptions, it still perfectly encapsulates Addison's nature when it comes to her interactions with her friends. In conclusion, Addison can be described as quite friendly, very inviting, and friendly based on her efforts to reach out to and include Lee and Jordan in the birthday party. These descriptions offer various perspectives on her sociability and demonstrate her warm, pleasant, and proactive nature in engaging with others. Regardless of which description is used, all of them highlight the core aspect of Addison's personality: her amiable and inclusive attitude towards her friends."},{"prompt":"Instructions: In this task, you will be presented with a question, and you have to write the part-of-speech tag for each word in the question.

He was born on April 29, but his birth was recorded by doctor F. D. Sims on April 30. He was named Willie by his cousin Mildred, who also chose Hugh as his middle name, in honor of her recently deceased younger brother. His parents moved from Arkansas in 1929, to look for work. Nelson has been arrested several times for marijuana possession. The first occasion was in 1974 in Dallas, Texas. In 1977 after a tour with Hank Cochran, Nelson traveled to The Bahamas. Nelson and Cochran arrived late to the airport and boarded the flight without luggage. The bags were later sent to them. As Nelson and Cochran claimed their luggage in the Bahamas, a customs officer questioned Nelson after marijuana was found in a pair of his jeans. Nelson was arrested and jailed. As Cochran made arrangements to pay the bail, he took Nelson a six-pack of beer to his cell. Nelson was released a few hours later. Inebriated, he fell after he jumped celebrating and was taken to the emergency room. He then appeared before the judge, who dropped the charges but ordered Nelson to never return to the country. In 1994, highway patrolmen found marijuana in his car near Waco, Texas. His requirement to appear in court prevented him attending the Grammy awards that year. While traveling to Ann W. Richards' funeral in 2006, Nelson, along with his manager and his sister, Bobbie, were arrested in St. Martin Parish, Louisiana and charged with possession of marijuana and hallucinogenic mushrooms. Nelson received six months probation. On November 26, 2010, Nelson was arrested in Sierra Blanca, Texas, for possession of six ounces of marijuana found in his tour bus while traveling from Los Angeles back to Texas. He was released after paying bail of US2,500. Prosecutor Kit Bramblett supported not sentencing Nelson to jail due to the small amount of marijuana involved, but suggested instead a US100 fine and told Nelson that he would have him sing \\"Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain\\" for the court. Judge Becky Dean-Walker said that Nelson would have to pay the fine but not to perform the song, explaining that the prosecutor was joking. Nelson's lawyer Joe Turner reached an agreement with the prosecutor. Nelson was set to pay a US500 fine to avoid a two-year jail sentence with a 30-day review period, which in case of another incident would end the agreement. The judge later rejected the agreement, claiming that Nelson was receiving preferential treatment for his celebrity status; the offense normally carried a one-year jail sentence. Bramblett declared that the case would remain open until it was either dismissed or the judge changed her opinion.

To provide a more detailed and long answer, here is the translation of the sentence along with some context and explanation: The sentence refers to an action or change that the neighbors must undertake in a specific direction, possibly to adapt to a new situation, achieve a goal, or improve in some way. Here is the sentence broken down into its components: 1. \\"Its neighbours\\" - \\"Ses voisins\\": This part of the sentence uses the possessive pronoun \\"its\\" to indicate that the neighbors belong or are related to something, likely a country or region previously mentioned. \\"Voisins\\" means neighbors and \\"Ses\\" means its in French. 2. \\"also\\" - \\"également\\": This adverb indicates that the action or change is not only required for whatever the sentence was initially discussing but is also essential for the neighbors. It adds a sense of inclusivity to the statement, making it clear that the entire group or region should take the same course of action. 3. \\"need to make their move\\" - \\"doivent faire leur mouvement\\": This part of the sentence emphasizes the necessity for these neighbors to engage in a particular action or path. \\"Doivent\\" indicates a strong obligation, similar to the English \\"must\\" or \\"need to.\\" The phrase \\"faire leur mouvement\\" can be understood as taking a step or making a decisive action in a specific direction, often to illustrate progress or transformation. 4. \\"in this direction\\" - \\"dans cette direction\\": This phrase reveals that the action or change to be undertaken by the neighbors should be following a particular path or direction. This direction could involve socio-economic growth, infrastructural improvements, diplomatic actions, or any other topic where progress is expected.

Does \\"Hume became a major figure in the skeptical philosophical and empiricist traditions of philosophy.\\" correctly answer the question of In what areas of philosophy did Hume become a major figure?","completion":"Yes, the statement \\"Hume became a major figure in the skeptical philosophical and empiricist traditions of philosophy\\" correctly and succinctly addresses the question of in what areas of philosophy Hume became a major figure but it can be expanded upon to give a more comprehensive understanding of Hume's contributions and influence in philosophy. David Hume was a Scottish philosopher and historian who became a central figure in the 18th-century philosophical movement known as the Scottish Enlightenment. He is best known for developing a philosophical position known as Humean empiricism, which argues that all knowledge comes from sensory experience. He was also a significant figure in the Western tradition of skepticism, where he cast doubt on concepts often taken for granted such as causation, self-identity, and the existence of an external world. Hume's philosophical approach can be described as empirical and skeptical. Empiricism is a school of philosophy that insists that knowledge comes only or primarily from sensory experience. It rejects the idea of innate ideas or knowledge derived from reason alone. For Hume, our knowledge is limited to the scope of our sense experience and memory. He insisted on the idea that causal relationships between events, for instance, could not be known absolutely but only as a habit or custom of thought. Hume's skepticism, on the other hand, questioned the reliability of these perceptions, going as far as to question the very notion of self or identity over time. He cast doubt on a wide array of philosophical concepts and challenged the very foundations upon which philosophy often is built. His concept of skepticism has been influential in various branches of philosophy, particularly in epistemology. Additionally, Hume was a highly influential figure in the field of ethics, where he promoted the theory of ethical sentimentalism. He posited that moral judgments are rooted in our sentiments or feelings, in contrast to the rationalist approaches prevalent during his time. He conceived of morality as more rooted in our human nature and emotions rather than as a result of rational deliberation. In the realm of political philosophy, Hume was instrumental in promoting a form of classical liberalism and famously critiqued the social contract theory of political legitimacy. Hume's philosophical writings profoundly influenced subsequent generations of philosophers, and his ideas continue to be studied, debated, and developed. Whether in epistemology, metaphysics, ethics, or political philosophy, Hume's empiricism and skepticism represent crucial developments in the history of philosophy. Thus, he is rightfully considered a major figure in these areas of philosophy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

They have released five studio albums and six extended plays. The band is composed of vocalist Liam Cormier, guitarist Scott Middleton, drummer Mike Peters and bassist Jaye R. Schwarzer. Cancer Bats take a wide variety of influences from heavy metal subgenres and fuse them into hardcore and punk rock, and also include elements of Southern rock. Cancer Bats was founded in May 2004 by singer Liam Cormier and guitarist Scott Middleton, a former member of Toronto heavy metal band At the Mercy of Inspiration. The two wanted to form a project that combined their favorite parts of bands like Entombed, Refused, Black Flag, Led Zeppelin and Down, among others. The lineup was completed with the addition of Andrew McCracken on bass and Joel Bath on drums, with Cormier moving to vocals. The four-piece wrote and recorded songs for a self-released demo that saw light in January 2005, and led to Canadian independent record label Distort Entertainment signing the band. The story is that the band considered the names Cancer Bats and Pneumonia Hawk after deciding that a combination of illness and animal name would give the best band name. Soon after, Mike Peters replaced Bath on the drums and the band began playing throughout Southern Ontario, playing live shows with bands like Billy Talent, Every Time I Die, Nora, Alexisonfire, Haste the Day, It Dies Today, Bane, Comeback Kid, Buried Inside, Attack in Black, Misery Signals, This Is Hell, Rise Against, The Bronx and Gallows. On June 2, 2006, the band took part in a short interview and then played a free CD release show at The Edge 102.1 (CFNY-FM) and then on June 6 Birthing the Giant was released into major record stores. The album includes guest vocals by George Pettit of Alexisonfire. On June 7, 2006 they hosted All Things Rock, a show on MTV Canada, and had their own video played at the end of the show.

They've arrived at the section of Avengers comics, and this sparks a friendly debate on who their favorite Avenger is. ----- Mike: (grinning) Hey Harrison, I bet you can't guess my favorite Avenger. Harrison: (smirking) Oh, that's easy - Black Panther, right? Mike: (impressed) You got it! T'Challa's intelligence, prowess, and leadership skills make him the best Avenger. Plus, he's the king of Wakanda - a highly advanced and technologically superior nation in Africa. How badass is that? Harrison: (nodding) Yeah, I agree that Black Panther has a lot going for him, and Wakanda is an incredible nation. But my favorite Avenger is still Captain America. Mike: (leaning against the shelf) Captain America? The super soldier with a vibranium shield? How come he's your favorite? Harrison: (smiling) It's because of Steve Rogers' character - his unfaltering moral compass, exceptional courage, and remarkable leadership skills. Plus, he's got a long history that dates back to World War II, giving him a rich narrative in the comics. Mike: (scratching his head) But, isn't Captain America a bit outdated? I mean, he was a product of the Super Soldier Serum experiment back in the '40s. And considering current science and technology, he seems a bit old school, don't you think? Harrison: (raising an eyebrow) Well, Mike, I think it's important to consider the values that people from that time embraced. They believed in the idea of duty, honor, and selflessness. Steve Rogers embodies those ideals, in a way serving as an inspiration for others. Besides, his experiences from WWII give him a unique perspective, enabling him to make wise decisions in the fight against evil. Mike: (crossing his arms) Alright, I get your point, but Black Panther brings more to the table. Think about it: he's a scientist with access to the most advanced technology on the planet. It's even said that the technology of Wakanda makes Tony Stark's look like child's play. Harrison: (grinning) Tony Stark would probably be offended, but it's true, Wakanda's technology is an asset to the Avengers. However, let's not forget Captain America's incredible tactical mind. That, along with his vast experience, makes him a vital strategist for the team. Mike: (putting his hands on his hips) Well, Black Panther is not just a strategist; he's a king. He knows how to make difficult decisions and stand up for what he believes in. I think that definitely gives T'Challa an edge. Harrison: (nodding) It's true, being a king comes with unique responsibilities and experiences. But we cannot ignore the fact that Steve Rogers has been leading the Avengers since their inception. His ability to unite a diverse group of superheroes cements his status as an excellent leader. Mike: (smirking) I guess we'll have to agree to disagree on this one, Harrison. Harrison: (smiling) Yeah, it seems so. No matter what though, both Black Panther and Captain America bring great strengths to the Avengers team. Mike: (laughing) Agreed.

Description:FlowerheadofCommonToadflax Please segment the words.","completion":"The phrase you provided can be segmented into the following words: Flower head of Common Toadflax. Now, let me provide you with a detailed and long answer about the flower head of Common Toadflax. The Common Toadflax (Linaria vulgaris) is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Plantaginaceae family, which is native to Europe and parts of Asia. It has been introduced to North America and other regions as an ornamental plant and is now considered invasive in some areas. Commonly known as Yellow Toadflax, Butter-and-Eggs, or Wild Snapdragon, this plant is easily recognized by its beautiful and unique flower head. The flower head of the Common Toadflax consists of a cluster of bright yellow, snapdragon-like flowers with an orange-brown lower lip. The flowers are bilaterally symmetrical and tubular in shape, measuring approximately 1 to 1.5 inches (2.5 to 3.8 cm) in length. They are typically arranged in dense, terminal spikes atop unbranched, erect stems that are up to 3 feet (0.9 meters) tall. The flower head can contain as many as 25 individual flowers. The Common Toadflax flowers from June to October, attracting various pollinators, including bees and butterflies. The plant's nectar-rich flowers are particularly favored by long-tongued bumblebees, which can access the nectar at the base of the tubular flowers. The flowers are self-fertile, meaning that they can produce seeds without the need for fertilization from another plant, ensuring the plant's survival and spread. As for the foliage, Common Toadflax has thin, linear leaves that are arranged in opposite pairs along the stems. These leaves are grayish-green in color and can grow up to 2.5 inches (6.4 cm) long. The plant has a shallow and spreading root system, and it can propagate both sexually through seeds and asexually through its creeping rhizomes. The seeds of the Common Toadflax are tiny and black, with each flower head capable of producing up to 300 seeds. This prolific seed production contributes to the plant's invasive nature, as the seeds are quickly dispersed by wind, water, and animals. While often considered a weed, the Common Toadflax has been used in traditional medicine and herbal remedies, primarily as a diuretic and laxative. However, caution is advised when using this plant for medicinal purposes, as it contains toxic compounds called quinolizidine alkaloids that can be harmful if ingested in large quantities. In summary, the flower head of the Common Toadflax is a striking feature of this perennial herb, characterized by its bright yellow, tubular flowers with a distinctive orange-brown lower lip. While admired for its ornamental value, the plant's ability to spread quickly and its potential toxicity should be taken into consideration when deciding whether to introduce it into your garden or natural landscape."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

A few days later, the man saw a small hole in the cocoon. He sat and watched for several hours as a butterfly struggled to force its body through that little hole. Then it stopped. So the man decided to help the butterfly. He took a knife and cut a bigger hole in the cocoon. The butterfly came out of the cocoon but it had a weak body and small, thin wings. The butterfly didn't start to fly. In fact, the butterfly spent the rest of its life crawling around with a weak body and thin wings. It was never able to fly. The man acted with kindness but he didn't understand that he had done something wrong. When a butterfly crawls out of the cocoon, it must struggle. The hard work of getting out of the cocoon forces the fluid from the butterfly's body into wings. It helps the butterfly be ready to fly. If the butterfly never has to force itself out of the cocoon, its wings never get the fluid and it can never fly. Sometimes struggles are exactly what we need in our lives. If we lived our lives without any problems, we would never learn or grow. We would not be as strong as we could have been and we would never fly.

Troops are massacred at a Furnace Creek fort in 1880 after an army captain, Walsh, cites orders forcing him to abandon a wagon train. Apache Indians hid inside the wagons to gain access to the fort. General Blackwell is blamed for the incident and court-martialed. Denying that he sent any such order, the general has a stroke and dies on the witness stand. No written evidence of the order is presented. One of his sons, Rufe, a captain from West Point, travels west to find out what happened. His brother, Cash, reads of their father's death in a Kansas City newspaper and also heads toward Furnace Creek in search of answers. Using an alias, Cash learns that Capt. Walsh has become a drunkard. A mining boss, Leverett, is impressed by the stranger in town and hires him, not knowing Cash's real name or intent. Rufe arrives in town and also assumes a false identity. Cafe waitress Molly Baxter, whose father was killed at the fort, still considers General Blackwell the man to blame.

A Bill of Divorcement describes a day in the lives of a middle-aged Englishwoman named Margaret \\"Meg\\" Fairfield; her daughter Sydney; Sydney's fiancé Kit Humphreys; Meg's fiancé Gray Meredith; and Meg's husband Hilary, who escapes after spending almost twenty years in a mental hospital. After the family discusses Hilary's genetic predisposition toward psychiatric problems, which Sydney seems to have inherited, Hilary and Sydney give up Meg and Kit in order to avoid passing this trait to future generations. The film begins on Christmas Eve as Meg gives a party in her comfortable English manor. In addition to dancing and listening to Christmas carols, Sydney and Kit happily discuss their future together, as do Meg and Gray. The only unpleasant moment of the evening occurs when the singers dedicate their performance of God Bless the Master of This House to Gray. Hilary's sister Hester objects to this because she considers Hilary to be the master of the house even though he is psychotic and institutionalized. On Christmas morning, while Meg and Gray are at church, the asylum telephones to say that Hilary has gone missing, and Hester unintentionally reveals to Sydney that insanity runs in their family. The family's official explanation of Hilary's troubles has been that he experienced shell shock while fighting in World War I, but another family member had similar problems in the past. Hester and Sydney discuss Hilary's talent as a composer, and Sydney sits down at the piano to play an unfinished sonata that Hilary wrote before going to war. A few minutes later, Hilary returns home, having escaped from the asylum. He meets Sydney and they chat comfortably, except for a heated argument that serves to further display their similarities as sensitive, free-spirited individuals.

Answer the above question based on the context below: \\"Halo\\" was composed by Ryan Tedder, lead vocalist of OneRepublic, together with Evan \\"Kidd\\" Bogart and Beyoncé. In an interview for HitQuarters, Kidd narrated the events that led to writing the song. OneRepublic canceled their tour after Tedder had broken his Achilles tendon and had undergone surgery. The following day, the band sent Tedder to Los Angeles. There, he and Kidd were socializing when Tedder expressed his desire to write a song. Kidd was initially opposed to the idea because Tedder was supposed to be recuperating, but the pair went to Tedder's studio. During the writing sessions, singer Ray LaMontagne was the primary inspiration for \\"Halo\\". Kidd suggested they create a song in the style of LaMontagne's \\"Shelter\\" for Beyoncé and her husband Jay-Z, and proposed the title \\"Halo\\" after hearing Tedder play \\"angelic\\" chords.

Context: Stephen Báthory ; 27 September 1533 - 12 December 1586) was Voivode of Transylvania , Prince of Transylvania , from 1576 Queen Anna Jagiellon's husband and jure uxoris King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania . The son of Stephen VIII Báthory and a member of the Hungarian Báthory noble family, Báthory was a ruler of Transylvania in the 1570s, defeating another challenger for that title, Gáspár Bekes. In 1576 Báthory became the third elected king of Poland. He worked closely with chancellor Jan Zamoyski. The first years of his reign were focused on establishing power, defeating a fellow claimant to the throne, Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor, and quelling rebellions, most notably, the Danzig rebellion. He reigned only a decade, but is considered one of the most successful kings in Polish history, particularly in the realm of military history. His signal achievement was his victorious campaign in Livonia against Russia in the middle part of his reign, in which he repulsed a Russian invasion of Commonwealth borderlands and secured a highly favorable treaty of peace . Question: How many years old was Báthory when he became the third elected king of Poland? Answer:","completion":"To find out how old Báthory was when he became the third elected king of Poland, we need to calculate the difference between the year he became king and the year he was born. Stephen Báthory was born on September 27, 1533, and became King of Poland in 1576. To calculate his age at the time he became king, we can follow these steps: 1. Subtract his birth year from the year he became king: 1576 - 1533 = 43 years 2. Since his birthday is on September 27, and we don't have the exact date he became king in 1576, let's assume he became king before September 27. Hence, he would have already turned 43 years old in that year. Therefore, Báthory was 43 years old when he became the third elected king of Poland."},{"prompt":"Generate a question about the following movie plot: At a chic 'haute couture' fashion house in Rome, model Isabella (Francesca Ungaro) is brutally murdered one night during a raging thunderstorm by a mysterious figure dressed in black, wearing a mask.

I only have good memories of summer - Christmas time, six weeks holidays when in school then three months off whilst at uni. In my eyes, there is not one bad thing about summer. That is why I hate the First of March. Yes, it is still hot. Yes, my summer fruits are still in season and I can still wear my skimpy clothes, but, in my mind, it means that winter is near. The weather is only going to get colder and my favourite time of the year is official over. In an attempt to lift my end of Summer blues I decided to give myself a bright, cheerful manicure. The colour I choose was a luscious purple cream from butter LONDON called Molly-Coddled. It was just about opaque after one coat, just ever so slightly streaky. Two coats, completely opaque and streak free. If you haven't previously heard of butter LONDON, it is a nail polish brand with a massive range of high fashion colours and it's products are formulated without the use of the harmful ingredients like Formaldehyde, Toluene, DBP or Parabens. butter LONDON was the first company to sell 3 Free nail lacquer in the United States. Formaldehyde is one of the biggest nasties that I make a real effort to avoid. I did my PhD in Forensics and spent a lot of time watching autopsies.

Q: What forms when tectonic plates move above a hot spot? Choices: - earthquake chain - volcanic system - volcanic setting - volcanic chain A: Answer:","completion":"Volcanic Chain A volcanic chain forms when tectonic plates move above a hot spot. Hot spots are areas of intense heat within the Earth's mantle that arise from plumes of partially molten material. These areas remain relatively stationary while tectonic plates move over them. When a tectonic plate moves over a hot spot, the intense heat causes the mantle material to melt, creating magma. The magma then rises through the Earth's crust, eventually reaching the surface and resulting in the formation of a volcano. Volcanic chains are a series of volcanoes that form in a linear pattern, corresponding to the movement of the tectonic plate over the stationary hot spot. As the plate moves, new volcanoes form over the hot spot, while older volcanoes move away from the heat source and eventually become extinct. Over time, the extinct volcanoes erode, leaving behind a chain of volcanic seamounts (underwater mountains). One famous example of a volcanic chain is the Hawaiian Islands, located in the middle of the Pacific tectonic plate. The Hawaiian Islands are made up of a series of volcanic islands, all formed by the movement of the Pacific Plate over a hot spot. The Big Island of Hawaii, which is still volcanically active, is currently located over the hot spot, while the older and extinct volcanic islands lie to the northwest, having moved away from the heat source. Another example is the Emperor Seamounts, a chain of seamounts in the Pacific Ocean that stretches from Hawaii to the Aleutian Trench. The Emperor Seamounts are also the result of the Pacific Plate moving over a hot spot and represent an older portion of the volcanic chain. In summary, a volcanic chain forms when tectonic plates move above a hot spot. The movement of the plate over the stationary hot spot causes the formation of a series of volcanoes, which create a volcanic chain as the plate continues to move. Examples of volcanic chains include the Hawaiian Islands and the Emperor Seamounts."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

A federal judge in Georgia on Monday, Aug. 12, 2013 threw out race discrimination claims by a former... (Associated Press) Lisa Jackson sued Deen and her brother, Bubba Hiers, last year saying she suffered from sexual harassment and racially offensive talk and employment practices that were unfair to black workers during her five years as a manager of Uncle Bubba's Seafood and Oyster House. Deen is co-owner of the restaurant, which is primarily run by her brother. But claims of race discrimination by Jackson, who is white, were gutted in the 20-page opinion by U.S. District Court Judge William T. Moore Jr. The judge agreed with lawyers for Deen and Hiers that Jackson has no standing to sue her former employers for what she claims was poor treatment of black workers, regardless of her claims that she was offended and placed under additional stress. Jackson, at best, \\"is an accidental victim of the alleged racial discrimination,\\" Moore said in his ruling. \\"There are no allegations that defendant Hiers's racially offensive comments were either directed toward plaintiff or made with the intent to harass her.\\" The ruling lets stand Jackson's claims that Hiers sexually harassed her when she worked at the restaurant from 2005 to 2010. However, the judge said he was reserving the chance to rule on requests from Deen's lawyers to dismiss other claims in the lawsuit. The judge added that to allow Jackson to seek legal recourse for discrimination directed toward other workers \\"would serve to conscript federal courts as human resource departments that are responsible for imposing and monitoring a federally created standard for harmony in the workplace.\\" Of course, Jackson's race-based claims have already resulted in serious damage to Deen's public image. It was Jackson's lawyer who questioned Deen under oath in May when she acknowledged having used racial slurs in the past. A transcript of the legal deposition became public in June, and the backlash against Deen caused the Food Network and other corporate sponsors and business partners to drop her. Still, Deen's publicist issued an upbeat statement Monday. \\"We are pleased with the court's ruling today that Lisa Jackson's claims of race discrimination have been dismissed,\\" Elana Weiss said in a statement emailed to The Associated Press. \\"As Ms. Deen has stated before, she is confident that those who truly know how she lives her life know that she believes in equal opportunity, kindness and fairness for everyone.\\" Jackson's attorney, Matthew Billips, did not immediately return a phone call seeking comment. Attorneys for Deen and Hiers also did not immediately return phone calls. The judge's decision comes a month after Deen and Hiers dumped their attorneys and hired a new legal team. But the court motions seeking dismissal for all race-based claims in the case were filed in December, months before those changes were made. In her lawsuit, Jackson had claimed Hiers frequently made jokes containing racial slurs at work and prohibited black workers from using the restaurant's front entrance and customer restrooms. She said she was personally offended because she had biracial nieces. Attorneys for Deen have said in court filings that Jackson's lawsuit was based on \\"scurrilous and false claims.\\" They said before Jackson filed suit, she threatened to embarrass Deen publicly unless she paid the ex-employee \\"huge sums of money.\\" ||||| Paula Deen Wins Racial Lawsuit That Destroyed Her Paula Deen Wins Racial Discrimination Lawsuit That Destroyed Her Breaking News In one of the most supremely ironic court decisions in a long time, a judge just threw out the racial discrimination claim filed against-- the very lawsuit that destroyed the famous chef.A judge just ruled ...had no right to claim racial discrimination, BECAUSE SHE'S WHITE!

Input: Article: Now that America has declared a state of swine flu public health emergency, you may be asking yourself -- what am Isupposed to do? Here is a list of practical steps you can take to prepare and protect yourself and your family. 1) Know the symptoms-- Here are some of the symptoms that sound like swine flu -- fevers over 100 degrees (37.8degC), body aches, cough, runny nose, and sometimes, nausea and diarrhea . It's also useful to know if you might have had an exposure either by recent travel to Mexico, or to the areas of known cases so far in America -- specific areas of California, Texas, New York, Ohio and Kansas. Or you may have been exposed to a sick person who came from those areas. 2) Don't panic-- If you have symptoms that sound like swine flu, do not rush to hospitals. Not only is this difficult for the healthcare system, it can also be potentially dangerous for everyone. Call your doctor or local public health clinic before going in. 3) Contain the illness-- Hand-washing works. Wash, wash and wash. Invest in some hand sanitizer for the whole family. Avoid hugs and kisses of well-wishers, and do not share telephone handsets or computers. Be especially careful to always cough into the elbow of your arm (yes! the elbow, not your hand!). Cover your cough and sneeze to protect others. 4) What about a mask?-- The data shows that masks do work --as long asthere is a tight seal about the mouth and nose. 5) Eat the pork(if you want) -- Swine flu gets its name because pigs can get the infection and spread it to each other -- as well as to humans. This latest virus contains pieces that indicate it evolved from swine flu virus, and can now spread from person to person. Swine flu is not spread by properly prepared and cooked pork products. So if you want to eat pork, you can. 6) Getting sick? Stay home!-- In our go-go-go culture and these severe economic times, it can be very hard to call a boss and cancel a day's work. Now, however, if you or your loved ones are feeling like there's a flu coming on, stay home. 7) Stockpile?-- Right now, it's too early for any of us to become a Swine Flu Shut-In, but the public health department recommends that each home have two weeks of supplies, in case we must stay home -- either for illness or to help contain transmission. That means two weeks of food for everyone in your home, two weeks of all medications, and, if you're like most people, two weeks of books and DVDs.

Summarize this article: The party is in first place in some other towns it is targeting, according to projections. President Francois Hollande's Socialists have lost ground overall and may lose control of some major towns. The vote is seen as a key test for the Socialists, deeply unpopular after nearly two years in power. The Socialists were also hit by the low turnout in the first round of the elections - exit polls suggest up to 35% of voters stayed at home. The vote is to choose councillors and mayors in more than 36,000 villages, towns and cities. The anti-immigration National Front (FN) took 50.26% of the vote in the northern town of Henin-Beaumont, which has historically voted for the left. Elsewhere, in Avignon and Perpignan in the south, the party's candidates for mayor had the biggest number of votes. In some 200 places FN candidates have won through to the second round next weekend. Marine Le Pen, National Front leader since 2011, hailed the results, saying her party had \\"arrived as a major independent force - a political force at both national and local level\\". The BBC's Hugh Schofield in Paris says that in most cases, these candidates have little chance of gaining control of the town halls as they will be beaten in round two. However, it is a big advance for the far right and an expression of the growing popular exasperation with the establishment parties of the right and the left, he says. Many people who voted for President Hollande two years ago chose to abstain, which has meant losses for the Socialists, our correspondent notes, and in many important towns they will struggle in the second round to hold off challenges from the main centre-right UMP opposition party. Earlier, pollsters identified half a dozen towns that could see National Front rule as a result of the elections, giving it the chance to show it can be trusted with power after attempts to run four towns in the late 1990s revealed its lack of competence, Reuters news agency said.","completion":"The National Front (FN), an anti-immigration party, has won 50.26% of the vote in the French town of Henin-Beaumont in the first round of local elections, and has led in other towns including Avignon and Perpignan in the south.

This is the story of a government in power and the tensions between those who govern. But above all it is a story of a politician who truly wanted to bring democracy closer to the people, but who saw a government increasingly separated from the values of himself and his party, and who developed a growing belief that on Iraq, its position was morally, diplomatically and politically wrong.

This article: William Etty (1787–1849), the seventh child of a York baker and miller, began his career as an apprentice printer in Hull at the age of 11. On completing his seven-year apprenticeship he moved to London \\"with a few pieces of chalk crayons\\", with the intention of becoming a history painter in the tradition of the Old Masters, and studied under renowned artist Thomas Lawrence. Strongly influenced by the works of Titian and Rubens, Etty submitted numerous paintings to the Royal Academy of Arts and the British Institution, all of which were either rejected or received little attention when exhibited.In 1821 the Royal Academy accepted and exhibited one of Etty's works, The Arrival of Cleopatra in Cilicia (also known as The Triumph of Cleopatra), which depicted a large number of nude figures. Cleopatra was extremely well received, and many of Etty's fellow artists greatly admired him. He was elected a full Royal Academician in 1828, ahead of John Constable. He became well respected for his ability to capture flesh tones accurately in painting, and for his fascination with contrasts in skin tones. Following the exhibition of Cleopatra, over the next decade Etty tried to replicate its success by painting nudes in biblical, literary and mythological settings. Between 1820 and 1829 Etty exhibited 15 paintings, of which 14 included nude figures.While some nudes by foreign artists were held in private English collections, the country had no tradition of nude painting and the display and distribution of such material to the public had been suppressed since the 1787 Proclamation for the Discouragement of Vice. Etty was the first British artist to specialise in painting nudes, and many critics condemned his repeated depictions of female nudity as indecent, although his portraits of male nudes were generally well received. From 1832 onwards, needled by repeated attacks from the press, Etty remained a prominent painter of nudes, but made conscious efforts to try to reflect moral lessons in his work. contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who was known for their fascination with contrasts in skin tones?, what is it ?

Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: There’s a story in my Tuscan family of nobility and forbidden love. It’s set in Taranto, Puglia, on Italy’s southern heel and involves my daughter’s great-great-grandmother. The best known version is told by my husband Marco’s uncle, Riccardo, who remembers it being told to him by his elderly Nonna Anna herself. Anna Michela Comasia Maria Calianno. Her long name was a sign of her family’s noble status. She was born in Taranto, Puglia, in 1889, into a wealthy, well-educated Tarantine family of physicians, surgeons and landowners. One day, by chance, young Anna answered the door instead of the butler. There was Nicola Cardellicchio, the postman. He came from a poor family of bricklayers and wool spinners, raised by a single mother. “He was no adonis,” noted Nonna Anna. Nicola was rather short and stocky, but she liked him immediately. She continued answering the door whenever the postman passed. When Anna’s mother, Girolama, noticed her daughter’s growing interest in the postman, she forbid her to see him again, threatening to disown her. So Anna did what any lovesick girl would do: she ran away, eloping with Nicola. The couple had nine children in Taranto — Mario, Marco’s grandfather was born in the middle of the First World War — but times were very hard, and they moved north to Torino to look for work. Nonna Anna was perhaps not an instinctive cook. I wondered whether she ever had the possibility to learn how to cook. Her grandchildren, Angela (my mother in law) and Riccardo, remember her only ever making lesso (boiled meat) and these polpette, which became variously known in the family as “sugo di nonna Anna” and, oddly, “amatriciana” (which is actually a different recipe, a chilli-spiked sauce of fried guanciale and tomato to coat pasta). But these polpette – plump meat balls, cooked slowly in tomato sauce, a very traditional dish from Puglia – were passed down to Anna’s daughter in law, Angela’s Tuscan mother, Lina, who made them so often for her own family that she in turn taught her daughter in law,...

Article: Death is natural, but do you have any idea of the process of dying? Modern scientists divide the process of dying into two phases --- clinical or temporary death and biological death. Clinical death occurs when the vital organs, such as the heart or lungs, have ceased to function, but have not suffered permanent damage. The organism can still be revived . Biological death occurs when changes in the organism lead to the \\"breaking up\\" of vital cells and tissues. Death is then unchangeable and final. Scientists have been seeking a way to prolong the period of clinical death so that the organism can remain alive before biological death occurs. The best method developed so far involves cooling of the organism, combined with narcotic sleep. By slowing down the body's metabolism , cooling delays the processes leading to biological death. To illustrate how this works, scientists performed an experiment on a six-year-old female monkey called Keta. The scientist put Keta to sleep with a narcotic. Then they surrounded her body with ice-bags and began checking her body temperature. When it had dropped to 28 degrees the scientists began draining blood from an artery. The monkey's blood pressure decreased and an hour later both the heart and breathing stopped: clinical death set in. For twenty minutes Keta remained in this state. Her temperature dropped to 22 degrees. At this point the scientists pumped blood into an artery in the direction of the heart and started artificial breathing. After two minutes Keta's heart became active once more. After fifteen minutes, spontaneous breathing began, and after four hours Keta opened her eyes and lifted her head. After six hours, when the scientists tried to give her a penicillin injection, Keta seized the syringe and ran with it around the room. Her behavior differed little from that of a healthy animal.

Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. A:","completion":"No, the answer you found on Google does not provide a correct and clear explanation of the Universal Law of Gravitation. The Universal Law of Gravitation, formulated by Sir Isaac Newton, states that any two objects with mass attract each other with a force that is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers. Mathematically, it can be expressed as: F = G * (m1 * m2) / r^2 Where: F is the gravitational force between the two objects, G is the gravitational constant (approximately 6.674 × 10^-11 N(m/kg)^2), m1 and m2 are the masses of the two objects, and r is the distance between the centers of the objects. The answer you found may be referring to the fact that the gravitational constant G was not measured experimentally until 71 years after Newton's death, which indeed made it impossible for Newton to determine the exact value of the gravitational forces involved. However, Newton's calculations still provided valuable insights into the nature of gravitational force and established the foundation for our understanding of gravity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: President Donald Trump is counting on congressional Republicans to enact a package of tax cuts in the coming weeks, in the process delivering his first major legislative achievement since taking office in January. But even as Trump and his Republican allies close in on the goal of passing tax reform, the Russia investigation continues to be a major distraction. The recent plea deal between Trump’s former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, and the office of special counsel Robert Mueller sent shockwaves around Washington and at the very least seemed to indicate the Russia probe is a long way from being completed. Trump is banking on a tax cut victory to shore up his political base and show supporters and detractors alike that he is a man of his word when it comes to delivering on his campaign promises. House and Senate negotiators are now working to resolve differences in the two versions with hopes of final votes in the coming weeks. But even if the tax plan is enacted into law, its impact is not likely to be felt for at least a year. And polls show the plan has less than majority support. Trump insists the tax cuts will lead to economic growth and more jobs. “I will tell you this is in a nonbraggadocio way,” Trump told supporters in Missouri recently. “There has never been a 10-month president that has accomplished what we have accomplished. That I can tell you.” Democrats oppose the tax plan but lack the votes to stop it. “It rewards the rich in terms of individuals and corporations at the expense of tens of millions of working middle class families in our country,” warned House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi. Despite his poor standing in national polls, just less than 40 percent approval in most surveys, Trump’s base is largely sticking with him. The latest American Values Survey by the Public Religion Research Institute found that 84 percent of Republicans continue to back the president.

The equation is: 8f - 13f - 10 = 0 Now, combining the like terms: (8f - 13f) - 10 = 0 This simplifies to: -5f - 10 = 0 Now, we need to isolate f. To do this, let's get rid of the constant term, which is -10. We will add 10 to both sides of the equation: -5f - 10 + 10 = 0 + 10 This simplifies to: -5f = 10 Next, we need to divide both sides of the equation by -5 to solve for f: f = 10 / -5 And the solution is: f = -2 So, the answer to the equation 8f - 13f - 10 = 0 is f = -2."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The used to play together outside in the yard till one day Barb's parents found out that she had sickle cell anemia. They haven't played together since. Hint: Some individuals have a specific mutation in the primary sequence of their hemoglobin molecules that causes them to aggregate, resulting in a deformation of their red blood cells. This abnormality is genetic in nature. A person may inherit the gene from one parent and have sickle cell trait (only some of the hemoglobin is hemoglobin S), which is usually not life-threatening. Inheriting the gene from both parents will result in sickle cell disease, which is a very serious condition. The answer is:","completion":"Ann is the girl who didn't have a deformation of her red blood cells. In the paragraph, it is mentioned that Barb's parents found out she had sickle cell anemia, which is a genetic disease that causes red blood cells to deform, affecting the hemoglobin molecules.

Both happened in Newport RI when I was in the US Navy. First, I lived in a cottage that was in an old motel. It had a cottage in front where the landlady lived and there were ten little cottages in a half-moon configuration around it. Ours was a party place and we didn't have a phone. This was in the early 1970's. The landlady was in her 50's I'd guess. The only phone was a pay-phone outside her cottage and it was o party line with her phone. When we used it, she would try to listen, especially if we were talking to a girl. We could tell and sometimes we'd ask he to hang up, but other times we'd talk about sexy stuff and let her listen. We could hear her breathing heavy when we did. When we'd be parting, she'd come to the door wearing sexy clothes that were completely inappropriate and want to be invited in. Though we were a bunch of horny sailors, no one wanted any part of that. We never let her come in. I got married and moved into an apartment that was three rooms in a huge old house. They closed that Navy base and all of the sailors were transferred elsewhere. There were bumper-stickers that said, \\"Will the last sailor to leave, please turn out the lights.\\" In those days, Newport was a small town that leached off of sailors. My landlord said that when my wife and I were completely out and it was completely clean, he'd refund my deposit. We left the apartment immaculately clean and he wouldn't refund my deposit. That was nearly 50 years ago and it still pisses me off. Why is the sailor still pissed off today? - because the Landlord wouldn't refund the deposit - because the landlady listened to phone calls - because the landlady showed up at parties in sexy clothing - not enough information Answer:","completion":"The sailor is still pissed off today because the landlord wouldn't refund the deposit."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Similarly, label \\"date\\" if you think the answer to the given question is a date. Input: Passage: Coming off their dominating win over the Saints, the Broncos traveled to Paul Brown Stadium for an AFC duel with the Cincinnati Bengals. A 43-yard field goal by placekicker Matt Prater gave the Broncos an early lead, but the Bengals countered in the second quarter, with a 28-yard field goal by placekicker Mike Nugent. The Broncos responded, with a 13-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Peyton Manning to wide receiver Eric Decker. The Broncos added to their lead, when return specialist Trindon Holliday took the opening kickoff of the second half 105 yards for a touchdown. However, the Bengals would reel off 17 unanswered points, consisting of a 10-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Andy Dalton to wide receiver A. J. Green, a 49-field goal by Nugent followed in the fourth quarter by running back BenJarvus Green-Ellis rushing for a 2-yard touchdown, with the latter two scores coming off Manning interceptions. This gave Cincinnati a 20-17 lead early in the fourth quarter. The Broncos re-claimed the lead on their next possession, with Manning connecting on a 1-yard touchdown pass to tight end Joel Dreessen. Ten plays into the Bengals' next possession, Dalton was intercepted by cornerback Champ Bailey at the Bengals' 46-yard line, and the Broncos subsequently added to their lead eight plays later, with a 4-yard touchdown pass from Manning to Decker. Trailing 31-20 with 3:36 remaining in the fourth quarter, the Bengals tried to rally, with Nugent nailing a 41-yard field goal with 52 seconds remaining, but the Broncos recovered the onside kick in the game's final minute and subsequently ran out the clock. Peyton Manning improved his personal record to 8-0 all-time in games against the Bengals. Question: How many yards was the longest field goal of the game?

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the name of the person since whose death only Samson et Dalila has been regularly staged? Discounting his collaboration with Dukas in the completion of Guiraud's unfinished Frédégonde, Saint-Saëns wrote twelve operas, two of which are opéras comiques. During the composer's lifetime his Henry VIII became a repertory piece; since his death only Samson et Dalila has been regularly staged, although according to Schonberg, Ascanio (1890) is considered by experts to be a much finer work. The critic Ronald Crichton writes that for all his experience and musical skill, Saint-Saëns \\"lacked the 'nose' of the theatre animal granted, for example, to Massenet who in other forms of music was his inferior\\". In a 2005 study, the musical scholar Steven Huebner contrasts the two composers: \\"Saint-Saëns obviously had no time for Massenet's histrionics\\". Saint-Saëns's biographer James Harding comments that it is regrettable that the composer did not attempt more works of a light-hearted nature, on the lines of La princesse jaune, which Harding describes as like Sullivan \\"with a light French touch\\".Although most of Saint-Saëns's operas have remained neglected, Crichton rates them as important in the history of French opera, as \\"a bridge between Meyerbeer and the serious French operas of the early 1890s\\". In his view, the operatic scores of Saint-Saëns have, in general, the strengths and weaknesses of the rest of his music – \\"lucid Mozartian transparency, greater care for form than for content ... There is a certain emotional dryness; invention is sometimes thin, but the workmanship is impeccable.\\" Stylistically, Saint-Saëns drew on a range of models. From Meyerbeer he drew the effective use of the chorus in the action of a piece; for Henry VIII he included Tudor music he had researched in London; in La princesse jaune he used an oriental pentatonic scale; from Wagner he derived the use of leitmotifs, which, like Massenet, he used sparingly. Huebner observes that Saint-Saëns was more conventional than Massenet so far as through composition is concerned, more often favouring discrete arias and ensembles, with less...","completion":"The name of the person since whose death only Samson et Dalila has been regularly staged is Saint-Saëns."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Florence Nightingale was born on 12 May 1820 into a rich, upper-class, well-connected British family at the Villa Colombaia, in Florence, Tuscany, Italy, and was named after the city of her birth. Florence's older sister Frances Parthenope had similarly been named after her place of birth, Parthenope, a Greek settlement now part of the city of Naples. The family moved back to England in 1821, with Nightingale being brought up in the family's homes at Embley, Hampshire and Lea Hurst, Derbyshire. Florence inherited a liberal-humanitarian outlook from both sides of her family. Florence Nightingale exhibited a gift for mathematics from an early age and excelled in the subject under the tutelage of her father. Later, Nightingale became a pioneer in the visual presentation of information and statistical graphics. She used methods such as the pie chart, which had first been developed by William Playfair in 1801. While taken for granted now, it was at the time a relatively novel method of presenting data. Indeed, Nightingale is described as \\"a true pioneer in the graphical representation of statistics\\", and is credited with developing a form of the pie chart now known as the polar area diagram, or occasionally the Nightingale rose diagram, equivalent to a modern circular histogram, to illustrate seasonal sources of patient mortality in the military field hospital she managed. Nightingale called a compilation of such diagrams a \\"coxcomb\\", but later that term would frequently be used for the individual diagrams. She made extensive use of coxcombs to present reports on the nature and magnitude of the conditions of medical care in the Crimean War to Members of Parliament and civil servants who would have been unlikely to read or understand traditional statistical reports. In 1859, Nightingale was elected the first female member of the Royal Statistical Society. In 1874 she became an honorary member of the American Statistical Association. Her attention turned to the health of the British army in India and she demonstrated that bad drainage, contaminated water, overcrowding and poor ventilation were causing the high death rate. She concluded that the health of the army and the people of India had to go hand in hand and so campaigned to improve the sanitary conditions of the country as a whole. Nightingale made a comprehensive statistical study of sanitation in Indian rural life and was the leading figure in the introduction of improved medical care and public health service in India. In 1858 and 1859, she successfully lobbied for the establishment of a Royal Commission into the Indian situation. Two years later, she provided a report to the commission, which completed its own study in 1863. \\"After 10 years of sanitary reform, in 1873, Nightingale reported that mortality among the soldiers in India had declined from 69 to 18 per 1,000\\". The Royal Sanitary Commission of 1868-9 presented Nightingale with an opportunity to press for compulsory sanitation in private houses. She lobbied the minister responsible, James Stansfeld, to strengthen the proposed Public Health Bill to require owners of existing properties to pay for connection to mains drainage. The strengthened legislation was enacted in the Public Health Acts of 1874 and 1875. At the same time she combined with the retired sanitary reformer Edwin Chadwick to persuade Stansfeld to devolve powers to enforce the law to Local Authorities, eliminating central control by medical technocrats. Her Crimean War statistics had convinced her that non-medical approaches were more effective given the state of knowledge at the time. Historians now believe that both drainage and devolved enforcement played a crucial role in increasing average national life expectancy by 20 years between 1871 and the mid-1930s during which time medical science made no impact on the most fatal epidemic diseases.

This lake is quite interesting because it is classified as an \\"exploding lake\\". This term refers to a rare type of natural lake that contains significant amounts of dissolved gases (methane and carbon dioxide), which can potentially escape into the atmosphere, leading to a huge explosion. Being one of only three such lakes in the world (the other two are Lake Monoun and Lake Nyos, both in Cameroon), it poses a certain threat to nearby populations, primarily due to the risk of a limnic eruption. This is an unusual natural disaster that can occur when water becomes saturated with gas, causing a large explosion potentially killing wildlife and people in the vicinity and causing significant damage to buildings and infrastructure. On the other side, the methane in Lake Kivu’s waters also presents an opportunity for local communities. Depending on the technology used, this gas could be extracted and used as an energy source. If properly managed, methane extraction from Lake Kivu could provide a steady supply of energy to the region's communities, as it continuously generates from organic matter at the lake’s bottom. Thus, the context of the sentence, \\"Lake Kivu is one of the world’s three known “exploding lakes,” presenting a threat as well as an opportunity for local communities,\\" outlines this dual characteristic of Lake Kivu - its potential dangers and its possible benefits. It highlights the unique and delicate balance inhabitants of the region must maintain to safely harness the resources it provides while living with the ever-present risk of a natural disaster."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question 2: What is the difference between a pocket veto and the actual veto power of the President of India? Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","completion":"Hello little friend! I'll gladly explain the answers to your questions. Question 1: In India, there are two types of bodies called constitutional and statutory bodies. Constitutional bodies are mentioned in the Indian Constitution, like a treasure map with special locations. The Constitution is a big book of rules for the country. The bodies mentioned in it have been created following these rules. Examples are the Election Commission and the Public Service Commission. Statutory bodies, on the other hand, are not mentioned in the Constitution. They are created by laws passed by the Parliament, which is like a big team that makes decisions for the country. Examples of statutory bodies are the Reserve Bank of India and the National Human Rights Commission. Question 2: In India, the President has different types of veto powers, like special buttons they can push when they don't agree with a law. There are two important buttons called \\"pocket veto\\" and \\"actual veto.\\" A pocket veto is like a secret power. The President keeps the bill, or the paper with the law written on it, in their pocket and does not take any action. There is no time limit, so it can take as long as the President wants. The bill might not become a law or might just wait longer. The actual veto power is more open. The President says \\"no\\" to the bill, and it goes back to the Parliament. The big team can discuss it again and, if they still want that law, they can pass the bill with more votes. The President then has to accept it, and the bill becomes a law. Question 1 and 2 are not asking the same thing. They talk about different topics: one is about different types of bodies in India, and the other is about the President's powers. But both questions help us understand more about India's government."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

You do not have to limit yourself to a certain type of fabric to make a great tie, but heavier fabrics do tend to wear better. For one tie, you'll need at least 1 1⁄2 yards (1.4 m) of fabric for the front of the tie and about 5 x 6 inches of fabric for the back liner. Silk is a popular choice for tie liners. For a casual tie, go for patterned cotton, linen or denim. Ties are made with a material called interfacing, which is sewn or ironed into the inside of the tie as a liner. It allows fabrics to keep a firm shape. You will need 1 1⁄2 yards (1.4 m) of interfacing in a color that matches the tie fabric. For fusible interfacing, you will put the glazed side face down on the tie fabric to permanently adhere it to the tie. Be sure to buy sewable, fusible interfacing because you will be sewing the tie later on. Interfacing that is sewn-in does not have a glaze on it. It is sewn to the inside of the seam line so there won't be visible stitching on the outside of the tie. In addition to the fabric and interfacing, you will need to buy the following supplies: Fine thread that matches the tie fabric A good pair of fabric scissors Either a needle (if you're sewing the tie by hand) or a sewing machine Straight pins Measuring tape Iron There are many tie patterns available for you to choose from. Once you find a style you like, you can print the outline for it online for free. The alternative to printing a tie outline would be to use a ruler to trace another tie out yourself. When tie outlines print, they will continue onto more than one page because the length of the tie will be longer than a standard sheet of printing paper. Simply tape the paper together when you trace them onto the fabric. You will need about 3/8in of additional space outside of your trace line that you will later use for the inseam. Summary:","completion":"To make a great tie, choose from various fabrics, use at least 1.4 meters of fabric and a compatible interfacing, gather essential sewing supplies, select a preferred pattern, and ensure sufficient seam allowance while tracing the outline."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: What superhuman sense did Grenouille have? Movie title: Perfume: The Story of a Murderer Movie plot: The film begins with the sentencing of Jean-Baptiste Grenouille (Ben Whishaw), a notorious murderer. Between the reading of the sentence and the execution, the story of his life is told in flashback, beginning with his abandonment at birth in a French fish market. Raised in an orphanage, Grenouille grows into a strangely detached boy with a superhuman sense of smell. After growing to maturity as a tanner's apprentice, he makes his first delivery to Paris, where he revels in the new odors. He focuses on the scent of a kindly girl selling plums (Karoline Herfurth) and startles her with his behavior. To prevent her from crying out, he covers the girl's mouth and unintentionally suffocates her. After realizing that she is dead, he strips her body naked and smells her until the scent fades.Afterwards, Grenouille becomes haunted by the desire to preserve the woman's scent forever. After making a delivery to a perfume shop, Grenouille amazes the Italian owner, Giuseppe Baldini (Dustin Hoffman), with his ability to create fragrances. He revitalizes the perfumer's career with new formulas, demanding only that Baldini teach him how to convert scents into perfume. Baldini explains that all perfumes are harmonies of twelve individual scents, and may contain a theoretical thirteenth scent. He also tells a story about a perfume discovered in an Egyptian tomb that was so perfect that it caused everyone in the entire world to briefly believe they were in paradise the moment the bottle was opened.When Grenouille discovers that Baldini's method of distillation will not capture the scents of all objects, such as iron chains and dead animals, he becomes depressed. After receiving a letter of presentation written by Baldini, Grenouille leaves to learn a different method in Grasse. En route to Grasse, Grenouille realises that he has no scent of his own, and is therefore a cipher. He decides that creating the perfect smell will prove his worth.Upon arrival in Grasse, Grenouille catches the scent of the naive Laura Richis (Rachel...

Former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said deficit spending by the federal government hasn’t been as effective at stimulating the economy as expected. “I’m not saying the stimulus is not working, I’m saying it’s working far less than anyone anticipated,” Greenspan said today at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York. Greenspan said the “most effective” stimulus would be an increase in stock prices rather than more government spending. He also said he favors raising taxes to curb the federal budget deficit, joining the debate in Congress over whether to extend reductions enacted under President George W. Bush. “We have to find a way to settle down the extent of activism that is currently going on and allow this economy to heal,” Greenspan said. “We would be far better off to allow the normal market forces to operate.” Taxes and spending are dominating the congressional agenda less than two months before elections that will determine control of the House and Senate. President Barack Obama is defending his economic policies against criticism from Republicans, who argue they haven’t been effective and have widened a budget deficit that reached a record 1.42 trillion in 2009. Obama last week proposed a package of 180 billion in business tax breaks and infrastructure spending to boost the economy. That would come on top of the 814 billion stimulus measure enacted last year. Extending Tax Cuts Obama also wants to extend Bush-era tax cuts for individuals who make less than 200,000 a year and couples earning less than 250,000 while repealing them for those who earn more. Republicans want to extend cuts for all taxpayers. Greenspan said raising taxes in a weak economy isn’t an ideal option. “There are risks, but our choice is not between good and bad, it’s between terrible and worse,” he said. “Unless we come to grips with the deficit quickly we’re fooling ourselves as to how much time we have.” A relapse into a recession is unlikely, said Greenspan, 84, who was chairman of the central bank from 1987 to 2006 and didn’t comment on monetary policy in today’s remarks. “What we have going for us is that the tinder for a double dip is not readily available,” he said. Still, he repeated his warning that if housing prices drop, “all bets are off.” Unemployment Rate The economy grew at a 1.6 percent annual rate in the second quarter, hampered by an unemployment rate that has stayed above 9 percent all year. The unemployment rate rose to 9.6 percent in August from 9.5 percent in July. Greenspan cited the level of excess reserves in the banking system as evidence of the uncertainty that’s restraining recovery. As of Sept. 9, U.S. banks have 1.01 trillion in excess reserves. “There is a heavy weight of uncertainty on the system such that we are not getting the impact of a trillion dollars already on the books into the marketplace,” he said, describing the situation as a “liquidity trap.” “Our financial institutions are still partially disabled and will continue to be disabled until we restore a level of capital in the system that enables the average lender to a depository institution to feel secure,” he said. Capital requirements proposed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision earlier this week are a move in the right direction, he said. “The nature of the regulations that were promulgated by the Basel committee made sense to me,” he said. As Fed chairman in 2001, Greenspan supported the first round of tax cuts under Bush. At the time, the federal government operated with a surplus, and Greenspan told Congress he didn’t think the cuts would lead to a deficit. To contact the reporters for this story: Joshua Zumbrun in Washington at jzumbrun@bloomberg.net; ||||| The former head of the Federal Reserve said fiscal stimulus efforts have fallen far short of expectations, and the government now needs to get out of the way and allow businesses and markets to power the recovery. “We have to find a way to simmer down the extent of activism that is going on” with government stimulus spending “and allow the economy to heal” itself, former Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan told a gathering held at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York on Wednesday. Bloomberg News Former Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan At this point, “we’d probably be better off doing less than more” because “you’d be far better off to allow the normal market forces to operate here,” Greenspan said. That’s largely because stimulus spending is not proving as effective as many had hoped. “To the extent the evidence suggests very large deficits concurrently crowd out capital investment, there is a debit to the stimulus program that is somewhere between a third and a half of what the gross stimulus is,” he said. Greenspan was Fed chairman from 1987 to 2006, and was succeeded by current central bank chief Ben Bernanke. Greenspan’s tenure at the Fed was defined by his opposition to government regulation and his confidence that markets would discipline themselves. To many, the financial crisis was largely born of that ideology, and to some degree, Greenspan has himself said he overestimated the market’s willingness to understand and price for risk. Greenspan has also been widely accused of running an overly easy monetary policy during the early years of the last decade, in turn providing the fuel that powered the housing bubble, the rupturing of which drove the worst recession in generations. Greenspan’s comments came in response to moderator and audience questions, and were accordingly wide-ranging. The former central banker noted that gold, the price of which has been surging, still represents the “ultimate means of payment.” What is happening in that market “is a signal there is a problem with respect to currency markets.” He reckons the problem is not a large one, but the jump in gold prices could be “the canary in the coal mine to keep an eye on.” Greenspan, while worried about the outlook and what is happening with the housing market, said when it comes to a double-dip recession, “the probability of that is going down.” Given all the ground the economy has lost, “the tinder for a double-dip is not readily available,” although he added if housing goes down “all bets are off.” Greenspan said that the U.S. needs to do something now to deal with budget deficits and it must do something very soon. He explained his anxiety is so high that “I’m coming out in the first time in my memory” in support of higher taxes in addition to reduced spending, including allowing the so-called Bush tax cuts to expire. “Our choice is not between good and bad; it’s between terrible and worse,” Greenspan said. The nation has “a level of commitment … which I don’t think we can psychically meet,” absent huge changes in how the government finances itself. ||||| Write a summary.","completion":"Former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan stated that deficit spending by the federal government has not been as effective at stimulating the economy as expected.

From 2001 to 2005, Libby held the offices of Assistant to the Vice President for National Security Affairs and Chief of Staff to the Vice President of the United States and Assistant to the President during the administration of President George W. Bush. In October 2005, Libby resigned from all three government positions after he was indicted on five counts by a federal grand jury concerning the investigation of the leak of the covert identity of Central Intelligence Agency officer Valerie Plame Wilson. He was subsequently convicted of four counts (one count of obstruction of justice, two counts of perjury, and one count of making false statements), making him the highest-ranking White House official convicted in a government scandal since John Poindexter, the national security adviser to President Ronald Reagan in the Iran-Contra affair. Libby was born to an affluent Jewish family in New Haven, Connecticut; his late father, Irving Lewis Liebowitz, was an investment banker. Libby graduated from the Eaglebrook School, in Deerfield, Massachusetts, a middle school, in 1965. The family lived in the Washington region, Miami and Connecticut prior to Libby's graduation from Phillips Academy, in Andover, Massachusetts, in 1968. He and his elder brother, Hank, a retired tax lawyer, were the first in the family to graduate from college. Libby matriculated at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, in Fall 1968, graduating magna cum laude in 1972. As Yale Daily News reporter Jack Mirkinson observes, \\"Even though he would eventually become a prominent Republican, Libby's political beginnings would not have pointed in that direction. He served as vice president of the Yale College Democrats and later campaigned for Michael Dukakis when he was running for governor of Massachusetts.\\" According to Mirkinson: \\"Two particular Yale courses helped guide Libby's future endeavors. One of these was a creative writing course, which started Libby on a 20-year mission to complete a novel ... [later published as] The Apprentice ... [and] a political science class with professor and future Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz. In an interview with author James Mann, Libby said Wolfowitz was one of his favorite professors, and their professional relationship did not end with the class.\\" Wolfowitz became a significant mentor in his later professional life.

Use this fact to answer the question: bacteria can cause people to become ill Bacteria can cause people to become what?","completion":"Bacteria can cause people to become ill. The term 'ill' refers to a state of poor health, or a condition in which an individual's physical, mental, or emotional well-being is adversely affected. Bacteria are microscopic, single-celled organisms that can be found almost everywhere on Earth, including in soil, water, plants, animals, and humans. While many bacteria are harmless or even beneficial to humans, there are certain types of bacteria that are pathogens, meaning they can invade the human body and cause infections and illnesses. The mechanism through which bacteria cause people to become ill typically involves the bacteria entering the human body, multiplying, and releasing harmful substances called toxins. These toxins can damage tissue, cause inflammation, and interfere with the normal functioning of the body. When the immune system detects the presence of bacteria, it mounts a defense to try to eliminate the infection, which can also contribute to the symptoms of illness. Some examples of bacterial infections include strep throat (caused by Streptococcus bacteria), urinary tract infections (caused by Escherichia coli, or E. coli), and pneumonia (caused by several bacteria, including Streptococcus pneumoniae). Bacterial infections can be mild, moderate, or severe, and they can affect various parts of the body, such as the skin, lungs, gastrointestinal tract, or urinary tract. The symptoms of bacterial infections can vary widely depending on the type of bacteria and the part of the body that is affected. Some common symptoms include fever, chills, fatigue, pain, swelling, redness, and the presence of pus or other discharge. Bacterial infections can also lead to more serious complications, such as sepsis (a life-threatening systemic response to infection), organ damage, or long-term health problems. To treat bacterial infections, doctors typically prescribe antibiotics, which are medications that work by killing bacteria or inhibiting their growth. It is important to take the full course of antibiotics as prescribed by a healthcare professional to ensure that the infection is completely eradicated and to prevent the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. In addition to antibiotics, other supportive treatments such as rest, hydration, and over-the-counter pain relievers or fever reducers may be recommended to help alleviate symptoms. Preventing bacterial infections includes practicing good hygiene, such as washing hands regularly with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand sanitizers, properly cooking and storing food to avoid foodborne illnesses, and keeping wounds clean and covered. Additional preventive measures may include getting vaccinated against certain bacterial infections, such as pneumococcal pneumonia, and avoiding close contact with individuals who have contagious bacterial infections. In summary, bacteria can cause people to become ill by invading the body, multiplying, and releasing harmful toxins that damage tissue and interfere with normal bodily functions. The resulting illnesses can range in severity and affect various parts of the body. Treatment typically involves antibiotics in combination with other supportive measures, and prevention strategies include good hygiene practices and receiving appropriate vaccinations."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: An Australian inventor has designed and built an environmentally friendly ferry that uses solar and wind power to transport people around Sydney Harbor. Robert Dane and his Solar Sailor were given the top prize at the Australian Design Awards recently. The Solar Sailor has been in use for six months. It uses four sources of energy for its power -- solar, wind, battery power with stored solar energy and a fuel generator in store all controlled by computers. The ferry can travel up to 7.5 knots on just wind and solar power. It's solar wings and fiberglass solar panels which not only take in sunlight and store it in batteries, but also act as sails. \\"We angle our solar panels to the sun in two planes , which increases the amount of energy we get from the sun by 40 percent,\\" Dane says. \\"And also we can use that same structure to do another job, which is also the sail, and so these wing sails actually push the ferry forward just like a soft sail does.\\" Computers check the sun and wind and angle the solar wings to take in the most sunlight. If there isn't much wind or it is a cloudy day, energy stored in the batteries runs the electric motor for up to five hours. \\"If the batteries are too low, then the computer turns the generator on so the boat is always able to meet a commercial schedule, or get from point A to point B no matter what,\\" Dan explains. Dane got his idea for the Solar Sailor from a book on insects. He was amazed how insects use their wings to collect solar energy to warm themselves. \\"When I read that, I realized there was a good example in nature for what we were going to do, which was to use a solar wing to collect solar energy and also to sail,\\" he says.

Bob Taft (R) yesterday pleaded no contest to charges that he violated state ethics laws, becoming the first governor in the state's history convicted of a crime and providing powerful ammunition to Democrats seeking to break the Republican Party's dominance in a critical swing state. For the past decade, Democrats have been in retreat in the Buckeye State. Republicans have won the governor's office for four consecutive terms, control both houses of the legislature and hold the other major statewide offices. Last year, Ohio was ground zero in the presidential campaign and provided the crucial electoral votes that secured President Bush's reelection victory. Political analysts said yesterday that the spreading scandal that put Taft in a Columbus courthouse, as well as public dissatisfaction over an economy whose unemployment rate is above the national average, leaves Republicans vulnerable for a potential housecleaning in next year's elections. \\"Potentially, it could be a very tough year,\\" said Eric W. Rademacher, co-director of the University of Cincinnati's Ohio Poll. Taft, who cooperated with investigators, issued a public apology after being convicted on four misdemeanor counts for failing to report 52 golf outings, dinners and other entertainment gifts. He was fined 4,000, the maximum. Taft, who by law cannot run again, said he will not resign. \\"There are no words to express the deep remorse that I feel over the embarrassment that I have caused for my administration and for the people of the state of Ohio,\\" Taft said after the sentencing. \\"I offer my sincere and heartfelt apology, and I hope the people will understand that these mistakes, though major and important mistakes, were done unintentionally, and I hope and pray they will accept my apology.\\" Among the golf outings were two from Tom Noe, a prominent Republican fundraiser and rare coin dealer who is at the heart of a larger scandal involving the Ohio Bureau of Workers' Compensation, which invested approximately 50 million in rare coins through Noe. Investigators later found 10 million to 13 million was missing, sending GOP officials scampering to escape the taint of association with Noe. The Taft name is one of the most storied in the history of Republican politics. His father and grandfather were both U.S. senators, and his great-grandfather, William Howard Taft, served both as president and as chief justice of the United States. But in office, Taft has struggled constantly. With the news of his reporting failures, his approval rating has plunged below 20 percent, the lowest of any governor in the nation. Republicans blamed Taft's unpopularity and the coin scandal for the surprisingly close outcome in a special House election in southwest Ohio this month. In that race, Democrat Paul Hackett, an Iraq war veteran and harsh critic of Bush, came within 5,000 votes of defeating Republican Jean Schmidt in a district Bush won with 64 percent of the vote. Rademacher said the challenge for Republicans next year will be to convince voters that the problems that have left them so unhappy are the fault of the Taft administration, not the GOP itself. \\"One of the real questions for all of us for next year is . . . whether or not their focus is on the governor's office or all the statewide offices up for election next year,\\" he said. The Democrats' top priorities appear to be the governor's office and the office of secretary of state, which oversees elections and which became a focal point of Democrats' anger last year because the incumbent, Republican J. Kenneth Blackwell, also chaired the Bush-Cheney campaign in the state. Congressional Democrats also are targeting Republican Rep. Robert W. Ney, whose association with indicted Washington lobbyist Jack Abramoff has tied him to charges of GOP corruption. On Wednesday, Chillicothe Mayor Joseph P. Sulzer, a Democrat, announced his candidacy for the House seat. Senate Democratic campaign officials have been seeking to recruit someone to run against Republican Sen. Mike DeWine, but on Wednesday, heavily recruited Rep. Sherrod Brown announced he would not run. Some grass-roots Democrats want Hackett to run for the Senate. However vulnerable Republicans may be, Democrats can't count on scandal alone to change their fortunes. \\"Their party structure is not well funded or well organized,\\" said John C. Green, director of the Ray C. Bliss Institute of Applied Politics at the University of Akron. \\"Even if the situation turned out to be very bad for the Republicans next year, from the vantage point of today, it would seem unlikely that the Democrats would sweep a large proportion of the offices.\\"","completion":"Ohio Governor Bob Taft pleaded no contest to charges of violating state ethics laws, making him the first governor in Ohio's history to be convicted of a crime. This case provides ammunition to Democrats seeking to challenge the Republican Party's dominance in the critical swing state. Taft's conviction comes amidst growing public dissatisfaction over the state's economy, with an unemployment rate above the national average. Democrats are hoping this vulnerability could lead to significant changes in next year's elections. Taft was convicted on four misdemeanor counts for failing to report 52 golf outings, dinners, and other entertainment gifts. He was fined 4,000 and publicly apologized, but will not resign as he is prohibited from running for office again by law."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

It was a made-for-TV moment that all presidents would relish, but it seemed especially significant for the man who turned a reality TV career into a successful bid for the presidency. Donald Trump triumphantly greeted the three Americans released by North Korea in the early morning darkness at Joint Base Andrews outside Washington early Thursday, an image one can expect to see over and over again come the 2020 U.S. presidential election campaign. “It was a very important thing to all of us to be able to get these three great people out,” Trump told reporters on the tarmac. He then went on to speculate that live television coverage of the arrival “probably broke the all-time in history television rating for 3 o’clock in the morning.” It was a moment the president gladly seized given that his White House has been buffeted by a chaotic mix of policy and personal drama in recent days. The prospect of a potentially historic breakthrough on North Korea could move a number of other unwelcome distractions to the side, including the ongoing Russia investigation, the growing legal difficulties for Trump’s personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, and the soap opera that the Stormy Daniels story has become. Daniels is the adult film actress who claims she once had an affair with Trump. He denies the claim. Trump also announced Thursday on Twitter that he will meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on June 12 in Singapore. A new CNN poll found that 77 percent of those surveyed support Trump meeting the North Korean leader, and 53 percent approve of his handling of the North Korea issue generally. Those numbers are in keeping with a general trend of late that has seen the president’s poll ratings improving, perhaps in part because of the strong economy. According to the above context, answer the following question. What is likely true about President Trump? OPT: (I) He is not bothered or nervous about the controversies he is currently experiencing during his presidency.. (II) not enough information.

Question: Process: - A person takes in oxygen through their nose or mouth - The oxygen travels into the body - Breaks down into glucose - Carbon dioxide is produced by the glucose breakdown - The carbon dioxide is exhaled out of the body through the nose or mouth. Question: suppose more oxygen is inhaled happens, how will it affect more carbon dioxide is produced. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect Answer:","completion":"In order to answer this question correctly, it is essential to have a clear understanding of the process of respiration in the human body. To begin, let us first explain each step of the process you have mentioned and then discuss the relationship between oxygen intake, glucose breakdown, and carbon dioxide production. 1. A person takes in oxygen through their nose or mouth: Oxygen enters the body through the mouth or nostrils during inhalation. This oxygen-rich air then travels through the respiratory system, including the trachea, bronchi, and bronchioles, until it reaches the alveoli, which are small sacs in the lungs specialized for gas exchange. 2. The oxygen travels into the body: Once in the alveoli, oxygen diffuses across the alveolar and capillary membranes, entering the bloodstream where it binds to hemoglobin in red blood cells. 3. Breaks down into glucose: This step may be a bit confusing, as the breakdown of glucose, not oxygen, is the main process in cellular respiration. Oxygen is essential for the breakdown of glucose in cells, which produces energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). This process occurs in the mitochondria and is known as aerobic respiration. It involves a series of metabolic reactions, including glycolysis, the Krebs cycle, and the electron transport chain, which all contribute to the production of ATP. 4. Carbon dioxide is produced by the glucose breakdown: During the breakdown of glucose, carbon dioxide (CO2) is generated as a waste byproduct. CO₂ also needs to be transported out of the cell and into the bloodstream, where it eventually diffuses into the alveoli. 5. The carbon dioxide is exhaled out of the body through the nose or mouth: Once carbon dioxide reaches the alveoli, it diffuses back across the alveolar and capillary membranes for exhalation, removing it from the body. Now, let's consider the hypothetical situation where more oxygen is inhaled and its effect on the production of carbon dioxide. In general, breathing in more oxygen would not necessarily result in a direct increase in the amount of carbon dioxide produced or ATP generation. The amount of glucose breakdown and subsequent energy production depends on various factors, including bodily needs (e.g., during physical activity, resting, etc.), and the availability of substrates like glucose, fatty acids, and amino acids to fuel these processes. Unless there is an increase in metabolic demand for energy production, inhaling more oxygen would not necessarily accelerate the rate of glucose breakdown and consequently the production of carbon dioxide. However, if the body does require more energy, either due to higher physical or metabolic activity, and increased oxygen intake is available accordingly, then the rate of glucose breakdown may increase in response. This, in turn, would lead to higher carbon dioxide production as a waste byproduct during this process. In such cases, the relationship between oxygen intake and carbon dioxide production would follow option A: more. It is also essential to consider that breathing in more oxygen than required (i.e., hyperventilation) may disturb the balance of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the body and create other complications. The body's respiratory system is designed to match oxygen consumption with carbon dioxide production to maintain an optimal balance for the proper functioning of cells and tissues. In conclusion, the relationship between oxygen intake and carbon dioxide production depends on the activity level and other factors related to the energy demands of the body. In situations where energy demands are increased, and more oxygen is available, carbon dioxide production may also increase. However, in a resting state or without an increase in metabolic demand, additional oxygen intake does not necessarily lead to more carbon dioxide production."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Summarize the following: For your weave, you’ll at need at least two packages of wefts of human hair in a color coordinating your natural hue. You’ll also need curved sewing needles, weave thread that matches the hair color, a wig cap, and a pick or fine tooth comb for separating sections of hair. When you finish weaving in a weft of hair, you’ll cut the excess with a pair of shears, so have those on hand as well. Measure about 1-inch down the perimeter braid from the first knot you made, and repeat the process. Hook the needle under the braid, pull it through the other side, and tug to pull the loose thread tight. Before the thread between the two knots has been tightened all the way though, wrap the needle around it twice near where you inserted it, and pull tight. This will give you your second knot. Repeat this same process all the way around the perimeter braid. Each knot should be about 1 inch (2.5 cm) apart from each other. Make sure that your knots and thread are pulled tight, so that your cap is firmly attached to your braids. When you’ve sewn the wig cap around the perimeter braid, you’ll complete the ‘loop’ by sewing around the outside of your part. Starting from your last knot on the perimeter braid, skip up to the next row of braids on your head. Repeat the knot-tying process, and then go up to the next row. By the time you’ve sewn around the part, you should have a large ‘U’ shape of knots. Make sure that each knot is at least 1-inch away from the center part. Finish off by tying two knots at the base of your sewing, where you started on the perimeter braid. The finishing knots should be the same as the other knots you’ve been sewing the whole time. Cut the extra string off as close to the knot as you are able, without cutting the knot.","completion":"To summarize, in order to create a weave, gather the necessary supplies, which include at least two packages of human hair wefts, curved sewing needles, matching weave thread, a wig cap, a pick or fine-tooth comb, and shears. Begin by attaching the wig cap to your perimeter braid, approximately 1-inch from the first knot. Use the curved sewing needle and weave thread to create knots evenly spaced around the perimeter braid, ensuring each knot is about 1 inch apart and tight enough to hold the cap firmly. Once the wig cap is securely attached to the perimeter braid, start sewing around the outline of your hair part using the same knot-tying method as before. Move up to the next row of braids, creating a 'U' shape of knots. Ensure that each knot is at least 1-inch away from the center part. Complete the process by tying two finishing knots at the base of your sewing, where you began on the perimeter braid, and trim the extra string close to the knot without cutting it. This will result in a secure weave that is properly attached to your braids."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.
