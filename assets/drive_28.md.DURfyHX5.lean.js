Write a summary based on this article: Republican Karen Handel has won Georgia’s special election, holding off the most well-funded House candidate in history and deflating Democrats who yearned for a special election rebuke to President Donald Trump. Handel, who previously served as Georgia’s secretary of state, had 52 percent of the vote to Democrat Jon Ossoff’s 48 percent when the Associated Press called the race late Tuesday night after a six-month campaign in which Republicans hammered Ossoff as an ill fit for a traditionally conservative district. Story Continued Below With her win, Handel protected Republicans’ 24-seat House majority and their hold on the 6th District in Atlanta’s northern suburbs, a longtime GOP seat that looked to be slipping from the party when Trump only carried it by 2 points in November. Democrats, spying an opening, poured millions of dollars into the special election when former Rep. Tom Price resigned to join Trump’s cabinet as the secretary of Health and Human Services. Ossoff, a former congressional aide and documentary filmmaker, captured the anti-Trump fervor coursing through the Democratic Party and raised over 23 million for his campaign. But Trump is not the only unpopular politician in the country, and Republicans once again used House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi as a bogeyman in a major House race, linking Ossoff to her in TV ads, in door-to-door conversations with voters and even in the televised debates between Ossoff and Handel. \\"On April 18 I said this was going to be a very very tight race, it was going to be contentious, it was going to require all hands on deck, and that's exactly what we had,\\" Handel told cheering supporters after her win. While Handel’s victory only brings the Republican House majority back to its baseline level after the 2016 election, it denied Democrats a momentum boost toward the 2018 midterms and a victory that party activists dearly seek after five months of GOP control in Washington. The GOP has now won each House special election of 2017, after Trump selected a handful of congressmen from conservative seats for his Cabinet — though Republicans had a close call in South Carolina Tuesday night, where Republican Ralph Norman won the state’s 5th District by a surprisingly close 3-point margin. Handel’s win also comes at a critical time for congressional Republicans, who have gotten bogged down trying to pass major legislation, including on health care. \\"Democrats from coast to coast threw everything they had at this race, and Karen would not be defeated,\\" House Speaker Paul Ryan said in a statement. Turnout soared in the special election, with Republican outside groups spending millions of dollars to drive more GOP voters to the polls this time than in the April primary. Ossoff and Handel finished first and second in the all-party primary two months ago, setting up Tuesday’s runoff — though Ossoff came just a few thousand votes short of winning the district outright in April. Ossoff held an edge in most public polling during the runoff, but Handel closed the gap just before Election Day. Handel struggled to compete with Ossoff’s money, but she presented herself as an experienced conservative in line with the district’s traditional Republican leanings. Top Republicans flocked to Georgia to aid her, including Trump and Vice President Mike Pence, who helped raise 1 million for Handel at separate events, according to her campaign. Ryan, Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue (a former Georgia governor) and Price himself came to the district to rally GOP voters, too.

Trump also weighed in several times on the race on Twitter, hours before Election Day: “Karen Handel’s opponent in #GA06 can’t even vote in the district he wants to represent…” adding, “…because he doesn’t even live there! He wants to raise taxes and kill healthcare. On Tuesday, #VoteKarenHandel.” Trump is not widely liked in the 6th District, where the presidential vote swung further toward Democrats in 2016 than in all but one non-Utah House seat. But while Trump’s standing in the district loosened the GOP’s hold on the seat, it did not dislodge the party. Instead, GOP outside groups focused on Pelosi’s own abysmal approval ratings to gin up opposition to Ossoff, whom they said was aligned with the San Francisco Democrat. Ossoff, for his part, tried to cast himself as a centrist, promising to be a “fresh, independent voice” for the district. But Republicans also accused him of being soft on national security and of relying on liberal, small-dollar donors from outside the district to fuel his campaign. Republicans also hammered Ossoff on his home address, as he doesn’t currently live in the district, while he said he wants to support his fiancée’s medical studies at Emory University. In one debate, Handel asked Ossoff: “Who are you going to vote for in this election?” Ossoff urges his Democratic supporters to keep working for their cause in a concession speech. \\"We showed the world that in places where no one thought it was possible you could fight, we could fight,\\" Ossoff said, adding: \\"This is not the outcome any of us were hoping for. But this is the beginning of something much bigger than us.\\" Handel also spoke about House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, who was shot last week during a practice for the Republican congressional baseball team, during her speech. \\"What happened on that ballfield was a terrible tragedy and we all need to continue to lift up Steve and the others who were injured that day,\\" Handel said. \\"And we need to also lift up this nation so that we can find a more civil way to deal with our disagreements.\\" Gabriel Debenedetti contributed to this report.

Handel thanked President Donald Trump and other prominent Republicans who supported her in the nationally watched runoff, leading to cheers of “Trump, Trump, Trump” from the crowd at the Hyatt Regency in Brookhaven. Handel, Georgia’s former Secretary of State, maintained Republican control of Georgia’s 6th Congressional District, which was previously represented by Tom Price, who is now Trump’s Secretary for Health and Human Services. “Tomorrow the real work will begin — the hard work of governing and doing that in a civil, responsible way,” she said. Handel’s supporters rejoiced with cheers and sighs of relief after the most expensive congressional race in U.S. history, costing more than 50 million. Handel said Ossoff was gracious and thanked her for a “spirited campaign” when he called her to concede. “We may have some different beliefs, but we are part of one community, the community of the 6th District,” Handel said. “My pledge is to be part of the solution: to focus on governing, to put my experience to work in helping to solve the very serious issues we’re facing in this country.” ||||| Peter Ludwinski of Sandy Springs, Ga., laughs as he waits for an election-night watch party to begin for Republican candidate for Georgia's Sixth District Congressional seat Karen Handel Tuesday, June... (Associated Press) DUNWOODY, Ga. (AP) — Republican Karen Handel won a nationally watched congressional election Tuesday in Georgia, and she thanked President Donald Trump after she avoided an upset that would have rocked Washington ahead of the 2018 midterm elections. Returns showed Handel, a former Georgia secretary of state, winning about 52 percent of the vote over Democrat Jon Ossoff, who won nearly 48 percent in Georgia's 6th Congressional District. \\"A special thanks to the president of the United States of America,\\" she said late Tuesday night as her supporters chanted, \\"Trump! Trump! Trump!\\" It was Handel's most public embrace of the man whose tenuous standing in this well-educated, suburban enclave made a previously safe Republican district close to begin with. Handel's margin allows Republicans a sigh of relief after what's being recognized as the most expensive House race in U.S history, with a price tag that may exceed 50 million. Yet the result in a historically conservative district still offers Republicans a warning that Trump, for better or worse, will dominate the looming campaign cycle. Georgia's outcome follows similar results in Montana, Kansas and South Carolina, where Republicans won special House races by much narrower margins than they managed as recently as November. Republicans immediately crowed over winning a seat that Democrats spent 30 million trying to flip. \\"Democrats from coast to coast threw everything they had at this race, and Karen would not be defeated,\\" House Speaker Paul Ryan said in a statement. Democrats still must defend their current districts and win 24 GOP-held seats to regain a House majority next November. Party leaders profess encouragement from the trends, but the latest losses mean they will have to rally donors and volunteers after a tough stretch of special elections. Handel, 55, will become the first Republican woman to represent Georgia in the U.S. House, according to state party officials. Her win comes after losing bids for governor in 2010 and the Senate in 2014, and it builds on a business and political career she built after leaving an abusive home as a teen. \\"It's that fighting spirit, that perseverance and tenacity that I will take to Washington,\\" she said Tuesday night. Handel is the latest in a line of Republicans who have represented the district since 1979, beginning with Newt Gingrich, who would become House speaker. Most recently, Tom Price resigned in February to join Trump's administration. The president himself struggled here, though, edging Democrat Hillary Clinton but falling short of a majority among an affluent, well-educated electorate that typically has given Republican nominees better than 60 percent of the vote. Handel emphasized that Republican pedigree often in her campaign and again in her victory speech. She also noted throughout the campaign that she has lived in the district for 25 years, unlike Ossoff, who grew up in the district but lives in Atlanta, a few miles south of the 6th District's southern border. In victory, she commended Ossoff and pledged to work for his supporters. She noted last week's shooting of Republican Majority Whip Steve Scalise of Louisiana and said politics has become too embittered. \\"My pledge is to be part of the solution, to focus on governing,\\" she said. Ossoff, taking the stage at his own party after conceding the race, told his supporters his campaign \\"is the beginning of something much bigger than us,\\" adding, \\"The fight goes on.\\" Party organizations, independent political action committees and donors from Los Angeles to Boston sent a cascade of money into a race, filling metro Atlanta's airwaves with ads and its 6th District neighborhoods with hordes of paid canvassers. Contrary to the chants at Handel's victory party, she insisted for months that voters' choice had little to do with Trump. She rarely mentioned him, despite holding a closed-door fundraiser with him earlier this spring. She pointed voters instead to her \\"proven conservative record\\" as a state and local elected official. Her protestations aside, Handel often embraced the national tenor of the race, joining a GOP chorus that lambasted Ossoff as a \\"dangerous liberal\\" who was \\"hand-picked\\" by House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi of California. She also welcomed a parade of national GOP figures to Atlanta to help her raise money, with Ryan and Vice President Mike Pence holding fundraisers following Trump's April visit. It was enough to help Handel raise more than 5 million, not a paltry sum in a congressional race, but barely a fifth of Ossoff's fundraising haul. The Republican campaign establishment, however, helped make up the difference. A super PAC backed by Ryan spent 7 million alone. On policy, she mostly echoes party leaders. She said she'd have voted for the House Republican health care bill, though she sometimes misrepresented its provisions in debates with Ossoff. She touts traditional supply side economics, going so far as to say during one debate that she does \\"not support a living wage\\" — her way of explaining her opposition to a minimum-wage increase. ___ Follow Barrow on Twitter at https://www.twitter.com/BillBarrowAP. |||||","completion":"Republican Karen Handel has won Georgia's special election in the US House of Representatives against Democratic candidate Jon Ossoff with 52% of the vote.

Please answer the following question: You are given a new situation: Dan is a geneticist and studied two villages from 2,000 years ago. Village A displayed traces of a large population that grew larger over the years, while village B had a small and declining population and was more isolated geographically. and a hint : Declines in population size can result in a loss of genetic diversity, and owing to genetic variation's role in the evolutionary potential of a species, this could in turn result in an observable Allee effect. As a species' population becomes smaller, its gene pool will be reduced in size as well. One possible outcome from this genetic bottleneck is a reduction in fitness of the species through the process of genetic drift, as well as inbreeding depression. This overall fitness decrease of a species is caused by an accumulation of deleterious mutations throughout the population. Genetic variation within a species could range from beneficial to detrimental. Nevertheless, in a smaller sized gene pool, there is a higher chance of a stochastic event in which deleterious alleles become fixed (genetic drift). While evolutionary theory states that expressed deleterious alleles should be purged through natural selection, purging would be most efficient only at eliminating alleles that are highly detrimental or harmful. Mildly deleterious alleles such as those that act later in life would be less likely to be removed by natural selection, and conversely, newly acquired beneficial mutations are more likely to be lost by random chance in smaller genetic pools than larger ones.Although the long-term population persistence of several species with low genetic variation has recently prompted debate on the generality of inbreeding depression, there are various empirical evidences for genetic Allee effects. One such case was observed in the endangered Florida panther (Puma concolor coryi). The Florida panther experienced a genetic bottleneck in the early 1990s where the population was reduced to ≈25 adult individuals. This reduction in genetic diversity was correlated with defects that include lower sperm quality, abnormal testosterone levels, cowlicks, and kinked tails. In response, a genetic rescue plan was put in motion and several female pumas from Texas were introduced into the Florida population. This action quickly led... Please answer this question : Which village displayed an observable Allee effect? Answer:","completion":"Village B displayed an observable Allee effect. This is because Village B had a small and declining population, which was more isolated geographically. This decline in population size can result in a loss of genetic diversity, reducing the gene pool and potentially leading to a reduction in fitness of the species through genetic drift and inbreeding depression. The Allee effect can be observed in such situations where a decrease in population density has negative impacts on individual fitness and overall population survival."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Daniel Boone was of English and Welsh ancestry. Because the Gregorian calendar was adopted during his lifetime, Boone's birth date is sometimes given as November 2, 1734 (the \\"New Style\\" date), although Boone used the October date. The Boone family belonged to the Religious Society of Friends, called \\"Quakers\\", and were persecuted in England for their dissenting beliefs. Daniel's father, Squire (his first name, not a title) Boone (1696-1765) emigrated from the small town of Bradninch, Devon (near Exeter) to Pennsylvania in 1713, to join William Penn's colony of dissenters. Squire Boone's parents, George Boone III and Mary Maugridge, followed their son to Pennsylvania in 1717, and in 1720 built a log cabin at Boonecroft. In 1720, Squire Boone, who worked primarily as a weaver and a blacksmith, married Sarah Morgan (1700-77). Sarah's family were Quakers from Wales, and had settled in 1708 in the area which became Towamencin Township of Montgomery County. In 1731, the Boones moved to Exeter Township in the Oley Valley of Berks County, near the modern city of Reading. There they built a log cabin, partially preserved today as the Daniel Boone Homestead. Daniel Boone was born there, November 2, 1734, the sixth of eleven children. The Daniel Boone Homestead is just four miles from the Mordecai Lincoln House, making the Squire Boone family neighbors of Mordecai Lincoln, the great, great grandfather of future President Abraham Lincoln. Mordecai's son, also named Abraham, married Ann Boone, a first cousin of Daniel. Daniel Boone spent his early years on what was then the edge of the frontier. Several Lenape Indian villages were nearby. The pacifist Pennsylvania Quakers had good relations with the Native Americans, but the steady growth of the white population compelled many Indians to move further west. Boone was given his first rifle at the age of 12. He learned to hunt from both local settlers and the Lenape. Folk tales have often emphasized Boone's skills as a hunter. In one story, the young Boone was hunting in the woods with some other boys, when the howl of a panther scattered all but Boone. He calmly cocked his rifle and shot the predator through the heart just as it leaped at him. The validity of this claim is contested, but the story was told so often that it became part of his popular image. In Boone's youth, his family became a source of controversy in the local Quaker community when two of the oldest children married outside the endogamous community, in present-day Lower Gwynedd Township, Pennsylvania. In 1742, Boone's parents were compelled to publicly apologize after their eldest child, Sarah, married John Willcockson, a \\"worldling\\" (non-Quaker). Because the young couple had \\"kept company\\", they were considered \\"married without benefit of clergy\\". When the Boones' oldest son Israel married a \\"worldling\\" in 1747, Squire Boone stood by him.

But like I said, this movie had it all, almost, in my opinion. Great script, good one-liners, fine acting.

Mental problems","completion":"Title: Echoes of Tommy Genre: Drama/Mystery/Thriller Plot Summary: Tommy, a mentally unstable young man, is released from a psychiatric institution after spending most of his childhood there. As he begins to rebuild his life, he's plagued by fragmented memories from his troubled past. With the help of Sarah, his compassionate therapist, Tommy sets out on a journey to piece together the broken memories and uncover the truth behind his institutionalization. Act I: Tommy, now in his mid-twenties, is released from Green Meadows Psychiatric Institution, where he has spent most of his childhood. He struggles to adjust to the outside world and faces discrimination due to his mental problems. As he attends therapy sessions with Sarah, his therapist, Tommy begins to have flashbacks of traumatic events that occurred during his childhood. Act II: The flashbacks intensify, causing Tommy to fixate on discovering the truth behind his institutionalization. Sarah, moved by Tommy's determination, starts to help him investigate his family's history. Together, they find out that Tommy's mother was also institutionalized, causing Tommy to believe that mental illness runs in the family, and he questions whether he has inherited his mother's mental instability. As they delve deeper, they uncover that Tommy's father had been involved in illegal drug trafficking and was physically abusive toward Tommy's mother, which might have contributed to her mental breakdown. Sarah becomes increasingly invested in Tommy's case as she probes into the possibility of Tommy being institutionalized as a child to cover up his father's criminal activities. Act III: Tommy and Sarah's investigations lead them to a key witness, Tommy's childhood best friend, who reveals that he witnessed Tommy's father commit a murder when they were just kids. As Tommy grapples with this revelation, he starts to remember the moments leading up to his institutionalization: Tommy saw his father kill someone and confronted him, but his father managed to convince the authorities that Tommy was hallucinating due to his mental health issues. With Sarah's help, they gather sufficient evidence to expose Tommy's father. As the truth unravels, Tommy's father is arrested, and a court trial exposes his criminal activities. Finally, with the complete picture of his past, Tommy starts to heal and embrace a brighter future, but not before ensuring that his mother receives proper psychiatric care. In the end, Tommy becomes a mental health advocate and uses his story to raise awareness and help others who struggle with mental illness and stigma. He and Sarah maintain a close friendship, and Tommy makes peace with his tumultuous past. The film concludes with a hopeful note as Tommy stands at a mental health awareness event, sharing his journey, signifying that he has come a long way since his institutionalization."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: This article: In September 2010, Mikael Åkerfeldt stated that he was writing for a new Opeth album. The band announced on their website that they would start recording their tenth album on January 31, 2011, at the Atlantis/Metronome studios in Stockholm, once again with Jens Bogren (engineering) and Steven Wilson from Porcupine Tree as co-producer.Shortly after mixing was complete on the new album in April 2011, Opeth announced that Per Wiberg was relieved of his duties in the band. In the press statement, Mikael Åkerfeldt explained the decision, saying, \\"Mendez, Axe and Fredrik and I came to the decision that we should find a replacement for Per right after the recordings of the new album, and this came as no surprise to Per. He had, in turn, been thinking about leaving, so you could say it was a mutual decision. There's no bad blood, just a relationship that came to an end, and that's that.\\"Opeth's tenth album, Heritage, was released on September 14, 2011, to generally favorable reviews. The album sold 19,000 copies in the United States in its first week of release and debuted at number 19 on the Billboard 200 chart. Heritage debuted at number four in the band's native country of Sweden.Heritage became the second Opeth album to not feature any death growls and had a much more progressive style than previous albums from the band, something that Åkerfeldt had been wanting to do for some time.The first two songs Åkerfeldt wrote for Heritage were in the style of Watershed. After hearing the songs for the first time, Martín Méndez told Åkerfeldt that he would be disappointed if the album continued in that direction. Relieved that Méndez was not interested in doing another conventional Opeth album, Åkerfeldt scrapped the two songs and started the writing process over in a different style. In the press release for Heritage, Mikael Åkerfeldt revealed that he felt as though he had been building to write the album since he was 19 years old.

Over the next five years his style increasingly integrated Italian influences into underlying Northern forms. Durer's father died in 1502, and his mother died in 1513. His best works in the first years of the workshop were his woodcut prints, mostly religious, but including secular scenes such as The Men's Bath House (ca. 1496). These were larger and more finely cut than the great majority of German woodcuts hitherto, and far more complex and balanced in composition. It is now thought unlikely that Durer cut any of the woodblocks himself; this task would have been performed by a specialist craftsman. However, his training in Wolgemut's studio, which made many carved and painted altarpieces and both designed and cut woodblocks for woodcut, evidently gave him great understanding of what the technique could be made to produce, and how to work with block cutters. Durer either drew his design directly onto the woodblock itself, or glued a paper drawing to the block. Either way, his drawings were destroyed during the cutting of the block.

Question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who suggested that record labels were trying to get the bill passed quickly through committees? ? Zappa expressed opinions on censorship when he appeared on CNN's Crossfire TV series and debated issues with Washington Times commentator John Lofton in 1986. On September 19, 1985, Zappa testified before the United States Senate Commerce, Technology, and Transportation committee, attacking the Parents Music Resource Center or PMRC, a music organization co-founded by Tipper Gore, wife of then-senator Al Gore. The PMRC consisted of many wives of politicians, including the wives of five members of the committee, and was founded to address the issue of song lyrics with sexual or satanic content. During Zappa's testimony, he stated that there was a clear conflict of interest between the PMRC due to the relations of its founders to the politicians who were then trying to pass what he referred to as the \\"Blank Tape Tax.\\" Kandy Stroud, a spokeswoman for the PMRC, announced that Senator Gore (who co-founded the committee) was a co-sponsor of that legislation. Zappa suggested that record labels were trying to get the bill passed quickly through committees, one of which was chaired by Senator Strom Thurmond, who was also affiliated with the PMRC. Zappa further pointed out that this committee was being used as a distraction from that bill being passed, which would lead only to the benefit of a select few in the music industry.Zappa saw their activities as on a path towards censorship, and called their proposal for voluntary labelling of records with explicit content \\"extortion\\" of the music industry.In his prepared statement, he said: The PMRC proposal is an ill-conceived piece of nonsense which fails to deliver any real benefits to children, infringes the civil liberties of people who are not children, and promises to keep the courts busy for years dealing with the interpretational and enforcemental problems inherent in the proposal's design.

(AFP) - El fútbol uruguayo cerró un 2011 a toda máquina, con una victoria como visitante ante la selección de Italia y se despidió hasta febrero cuando se enfrentará a Rumania en Bucarest en un nuevo año que luce prometedor. El cierre de la actividad oficial de la selección uruguaya, conducida con éxito por Oscar W. Tabárez, no pudo ser mejor con el triunfo 1-0 ante la \\"Azzurra\\" el martes en el estadio Olímpico de Roma. Fue el broche de oro de un año que incluyó su 15to título de la Copa América y el ascenso hasta el cuarto puesto del ranking de la FIFA, el mismo lugar que alcanzó en 2010 en el Mundial de Sudáfrica. Además, ocupa el primer puesto de las eliminatorias para Brasil 2014 con siete puntos. En su última presentación por las eliminatorias, la \\"orquesta\\" tocó sin notas falsas y abatió 4-0 a Chile, un partido en el que se lució el delantero Luis Suárez con cuatro dianas. Diego Forlán fue el gran ausente ante Chile e Italia, tras sufrir un desgarro en el partido ante Paraguay por las eliminatorias en el que hizo el gol del empate 1-1 en Asunción. Forlán es el máximo goleador histórico de la selección, con 33 dianas, y ha sido su figura indiscutida en años recientes, aunque el desempeño de Suárez, artillero de 24 años del Liverpool inglés, parece asegurar un recambio generacional en la \\"Celeste\\". Las bajas de Abel Hernández (lesión) y Maximiliano Pereira (suspensión) no mellaron el desempeño de Uruguay contra Chile. Por el contrario, el equipo tuvo salidas rápidas, fue eficaz y contó con un Suárez letal en el área rival. Tabárez cuenta además con otras piezas como Edinson Cavani, Diego Pérez y Egidio Arévalo Ríos en el mediocampo, y el capitán Diego Lugano en la zaga. El martes en Roma, Tabárez tuvo que apelar a suplentes como Sebastián Fernández, quien marcó el gol del triunfo, y si bien la \\"Azzurra\\" tuvo dominio de campo y de balón, los \\"celestes\\" pudieron contenerlos y llevar aprovechar las oportunidades. \\"La Celeste no contaba con Forlán y Suárez, y los hombres de Tabárez venían de Sudamérica, probablemente aturdidos por el viaje.

His father is a Georgia State Trooper and serves as Athletic Director of Southwest Atlanta Christian Academy, a private academy with one of the best high school basketball programs in the country, while his mother played on the inaugural women's basketball team at Morris Brown College. Howard's mother had seven miscarriages before he was born. A devout Christian since his youth, Howard became serious about basketball around the age of nine; when in the eighth grade, he resolved to be selected as the number one pick in the NBA Draft one day. Standing at 6 feet 11 inches tall (2.11 m) and weighing 265 pounds (120 kg), Howard plays the center position. Howard led the NBA in rebounding from 2007 to 2010, and again from 2012 to 2013. Howard's rebounding is in part facilitated by his extraordinary athleticism; his running vertical leap was tested at 39.5 inches in 2011, rare for a player of his size. He demonstrated this skill in the 2007 Slam Dunk Contest, where he completed an alley oop dunk from teammate Jameer Nelson while slapping a sticker onto the backboard at 12 ft 6 in (3.81 m) high. The sticker showed an image of his own smiling face with a handwritten \\"All things through Christ Phil: 4:13\\", a paraphrase of Philippians 4:13. Howard's leaping reach of 12 ft 6 in (3.81 m) is the highest documented in NBA history, 1 inch (2.5 cm) higher than Shaquille O'Neal's previous record of 12 ft 5 in (3.78 m). As of April 2013, Howard's career average of 12.9 rebounds per game (in the regular season) ranked 12th in NBA history. Howard's abilities and powerful physique have drawn attention from fellow NBA All-Stars. Tim Duncan once remarked in 2007: \\"[Howard] is so developed... He has so much promise and I am glad that I will be out of the league when he is peaking.\\" Kevin Garnett echoed those sentiments: \\"[Howard] is a freak of nature, man... I was nowhere near that physically talented. I wasn't that gifted, as far as body and physical presence.\\" Subsequent to a game in the 2009 NBA Playoffs, Philadelphia 76ers swingman Andre Iguodala said: \\"It's like he can guard two guys at once. He can guard his guy and the guy coming off the pick-and-roll, which is almost impossible to do... If he gets any more athletic or jumps any higher, they're going to have to change the rules.\\" As early as December 2007, ESPN writer David Thorpe declared Howard to be the most dominant center in the NBA. While many sports pundits have been rating Howard as one of the top young prospects in the NBA since 2006, Howard has some weaknesses in his game. Offensively, his shooting range remains limited; he is also mistake-prone, having led the NBA in total number of turnovers in the 2006-07 season. Like many centers, he has a low free throw conversion percentage. As a result, he is often a target of the Hack-a-Shaq defense and is annually among the league leaders in free throw attempts. During the 2007-08 regular season, Howard led the NBA with 897 free throw attempts while shooting only 59% from the free throw line. Also in that season, outside of layups and dunks, his shooting percentage was only 31.6%. In the 2008-09 season, he led the NBA again with 849 free throw attempts and in 2009-10, he was second in the NBA with 816. Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: What was his most unimpressive stat?","completion":"Howard's most unimpressive stat can be considered his free throw conversion percentage.

Movie plot title: Memento Mori Movie plot: The film revolves around the relationship between two high school students, Yoo Shi-eun (Lee Young-jin) and Min Hyo-shin (Park Ye-jin). As the two girls become romantically involved, their taboo friendship causes them to be marginalized by the other students. Unable to cope with the social pressures of having a lover of the same gender, Shi-Eun tries to distance herself from the increasingly dependent Hyo-shin. Hyo-shin reacts poorly to Shi-eun's changed attitude, viewing it as both a betrayal and rejection. Hyo-shin consequently commits suicide by jumping off of the school roof. It is also heavily implied that she was pregnant at the time of death, the father being literature teacher Mr. Goh. The plot unfurls in a nonlinear fashion, often from the perspective of fellow student Soh Min-ah (Kim Min-sun). Min-ah grows increasingly invested in Shi-eun and Hyo-shin when she finds a diary kept between the two alienated girls. This diary allows her disturbing insights to the nature of the relationship and pulls her deeper into a strange chain of events around the school. After Hyo-shin's death, supernatural occurrences start to terrorize all of the students that condemned the relationship. It is later revealed that Hyo-shin's spirit is malevolently haunting the school through the remnants she left behind in the diary.

Speaking in Singapore, the prime minister vowed to expose the use of \\"anonymous shell companies\\" to buy luxury UK properties - often in London. The PM said his message was \\"London is not a place to stash your dodgy cash\\". Corruption, he added, was \\"a cancer which is at the heart of so many of the world's problems\\" and must be tackled. Mr Cameron is on a four-day tour of South East Asia. On Monday, he announced the UK and Indonesia had agreed measures to counter the \\"shared enemy\\" of Islamic State (IS) extremism. Later in the trip he will travel to Malaysia and Vietnam. He has been accompanied by 31 British business leaders in an attempt to drum up trade with the UK and has also discussed the fight against terrorism with his counterparts. Describing corruption as \\"the enemy of progress\\", he called for a \\"global effort\\" to tackle it, saying the world has \\"looked the other way for too long\\". Citing the steps taken by the UK and Singapore to tackle corruption as part of enforcing a rules-based financial and legal system, Mr Cameron said a zero tolerance approach boosted trust and could improve business profitability and economic growth. A 2014 report by anti-poverty organisation One said an estimated 1tn (Â£600bn) a year was being taken out of poor countries because of corruption, warning of the use of phantom firms and money laundering. And last week the National Crime Agency said foreign criminals were pushing up house prices in the UK by laundering billions of pounds through the purchase of expensive properties. In his speech, Mr Cameron said properties in the UK, particularly in London, \\"are being bought by people overseas through anonymous shell companies, some with plundered or laundered cash\\". Shell companies are non-trading companies that serve a particular purpose for their owners. More than 100,000 UK property titles are registered to overseas companies, with more than 36,000 properties in London owned by offshore firms. About Â£122bn of property in England and Wales is owned by offshore companies. The government is to publish Land Registry data later this year, setting out which foreign companies own land and property in England and Wales. It will also consider forcing a foreign company bidding for a government contract to \\"publicly state who really owns it\\". While the majority of foreign-owned business investing in Britain had \\"nothing to hide\\" and were welcome, the rules needed to be more transparent to counter those who were seeking to launder \\"their ill-gotten gains without being tracked down\\". \\"There is no place for dirty money in Britain,\\" he said. \\"Indeed, there should no place for dirty money anywhere. London is not a place to stash your dodgy cash.\\" Welcoming the pledge, Laura Taylor, head of advocacy at Christian Aid, said it was \\"another step forward in the battle for greater transparency worldwide\\". \\"Countering corruption is of fundamental importance in the fight against global poverty because of its impact on developing countries,\\" she added. Diane Sheard, UK director of One, said: \\"Lifting this veil of secrecy will help developing countries to identify and recover these funds, which should be spent on essentials like health and education. \\"We hope that making information public about foreign companies that own property in the UK will deter money-launderers from doing business here.\\" And Robert Palmer, head of the money-laundering campaign at the charity Global Witness, said: \\"London is a very attractive destination for very wealthy people, including corrupt officials who have looted their state coffers.\\" He added: \\"What the Prime Minister has announced today is a really good step forward.\\" In his speech, Mr Cameron also pledged to boost the UK's trade links with Asean nations, pointing out that Britain had larger two-way trade with Belgium than with Singapore, Malaysia, Vietnam and Indonesia combined.

In this case, the reviewer uses negative language and a critical tone. Words like \\"hogwash\\", \\"selfish\\", \\"drivel\\", and \\"petty\\" are all negative descriptors and are clearly meant to discourage potential buyers. Step 2: Evaluate the specifics about the product. Although the reviewer briefly mentions the book being on the bestseller list, they don't provide any specific details about the content or the reasons why they didn't like it. This lack of information makes it difficult to determine whether the reviewer's opinion is valid or biased. Step 3: Consider the credibility of the reviewer. We don't know anything about the reviewer's background or credibility, so it's hard to determine whether their opinion should be trusted. Step 4: Gather more information. To make an informed decision, it's important to gather more information on the product by reading other reviews and researching the author's background and reputation.

If I tell you that Reducing heat changes gas into a liquid, and ask you the question \\"what does reducing heat change gas into?\\", is the correct answer \\"water\\"? Choose from: -Yes -No","completion":"No, the correct answer is not \\"water.\\" Reducing heat can change a gas into a liquid, but to state that it always turns into water is incorrect. Different gases will condense into different types of liquids when they lose heat. When heat is reduced, gases lose energy and their particles slow down, moving close to each other, which results in the formation of a liquid state. This process is called condensation. The type of liquid formed depends on the specific gas that is being cooled. For example, if you cool water vapor (gaseous state of water), it will condense into liquid water. But if you cool another gas, like nitrogen or carbon dioxide, they will condense into their respective liquid forms, which are not water. In summary, reducing heat in a gas does change it into a liquid, but it does not always change it into water.

By the year 2050 there may be 12.5 billion . There are a lot of people to feed. We need more and more food. One way to produce more food is growing stronger plants. For thousands of years, farmers have made plants better. Every season, they pick the best plants for the next season. It works very slowly. Since 1983, scientists have been able to change plants more quickly by changing their genetic material. Foods from plants grown in this way are called genetically modified foods, or GM foods By changing the genetic material of a plant, it is possible to make new plants. They make plants which are strong against plant diseases. They can also help in our diseases; a kind of rice is being prepared , for example , which stops people becoming blind. Rich countries produce GM foods because they are easy to grow and bring in more money. Poor countries are interested in them because they help produce more food. GM plants are not natural. No one knows how good or bad they are,. Making GM foods is only one way of feeding people in 2050. There are strong feelings against them, because they are unnatural.

Article: I only wanted to be loved: Rachel Uchitel breaks her silence on her affair with Tiger Woods Rachel Uchitel never set out to be the catalyst for the most spectacular personal and professional downfall of recent times. She never attempted to entrap her man or set him up in a tawdry kiss-and-tell. Yet it was her steamy text messages to Tiger Woods that set in train the public disgrace of a man who had been promoted as the most squeaky-clean, family-friendly sportsman of his generation. It was almost a year ago that the previously discreet Tiger fled his Florida home in the middle of the night after his furious wife Elin discovered Rachel’s texts. He crashed his car into a fire hydrant and a neighbour’s tree and was transported, dazed and bloody, to hospital. The superstar golfer’s highly paid image-makers went into overdrive to try to contain the PR fallout amid swirling rumours of an extramarital affair. New life: Rachel Uchitel, relaxing on a beach at Malibu, has now applied for a licence to work as a private detective But the scandal ballooned out of all control as a colourful procession of 15 women, including porn stars, strippers, waitresses and prostitutes, came forward to say that they had slept with Tiger. The sordid revelations led to the implosion of the sports star’s marriage, destroyed his career and forever wrecked his image as a calm, caring family man. The global icon at the centre of a multi-billion-dollar commercial empire was exposed as a deeply flawed man with feet of clay. But for the past 12 months, as Tiger has tried to piece together the wreckage of his life, Rachel, too, has had to face her demons. Thanks to her career as a nightclub hostess – essentially a highly-paid female nightclub maitre d’, looking after VIP clients such as Sir Philip Green and Premier League footballers, among many others – she has been reviled as little better than a prostitute, or at best a gold-digging marriage-wrecker. Yet Rachel’s friends insist that she is an intelligent, middle-class girl who sincerely believed her eight-month affair with Woods was a serious relationship with a ‘soul mate’, and who has never breathed a word in public about him. And tragically, they add, her previously respectable life was derailed on the darkest day in modern American history. On September 9, 2001, privately-educated Rachel was working as a television producer for the Bloomberg News channel and engaged to be married to 32-year-old investment banker Andrew O’Grady. He was killed in the Twin Towers atrocity. She briefly became the face of America’s grief after a picture of her holding a photo of her fiance was printed on the front page of the New York Post. Ever since, she has been trying to fill the void left in her life with a series of affairs with unsuitable men – of which her doomed love affair with Tiger Woods is just one. But last night Rachel, 35, finally broke her silence. Speaking to The Mail on Sunday from the ocean-front balcony of her rented home in Malibu, she said: ‘People have called me all sorts of names, but they don’t know me. I am not the same as the other girls and I never ever imagined in my wildest dreams that I would be caught up in a scandal like this. ‘If things had been different and 9/11 had never happened, my life would have taken a different course. I’d be fat and happy, living in a big house in Long Island with a load of kids. ‘I’m only telling my story now so that people can discover what sort of girl I am and learn the truth about me. If they still choose to hate me, then so be it. But I never set out to hurt anyone.’ In person, Rachel is tiny. Like so many women in Los Angeles, she has generously proportioned artificial breasts, plumped-up lips and a body kept whippet-thin with daily two-hour sessions in the gym (she’s clearly obsessed by her weight and constantly asks me if she looks fat). She has bought a pretty floral dress especially for our photoshoot but admits: ‘It is not something I would normally be caught dead in. But I want to show a different side of me. I’ve been branded as a scarlet woman but I am much, much more than that.’ Broken marriage: Elin and Tiger divorced in August following the scandal sparked by Rachel's texts to the golfer Rachel chain-smokes nervously as she recounts her life story for the first time. She has recently filmed a show in the new season of the series Celebrity Rehab (due to be shown in Britain early next year) in which she deals with her addiction to prescription pills – and love. ‘People don’t really understand love addiction, but I think a lot of women will relate to it,’ she explains. ‘Instead of filling themselves with booze or drugs, love addicts become emotionally invested in a series of bad relationships. Since I lost Andy, I have always been looking for the perfect man. I wanted a man who would marry me, give me the house and children I long for. I plunged headfirst into relationships which I should never have been in.’ I ask her if she regrets sleeping with a married man: ‘Yes, of course,’ she snaps. ‘I will never, ever do that again.’ Yet it’s clear the tragedy that befell her on 9/11 is only part of Rachel’s story. In fact her family history mirrors the good and the dark side of the great American dream. Her grandparents were penniless Ukrainian Jews who arrived in America with just the clothes on their backs. Since then, the Uchitels have made millions and mingled with Presidents and film stars. But Rachel’s father, Bob Uchitel, died of cocaine addiction at the early age of 44. She says proudly: ‘My Grandpa Maurice came to this country with nothing and built a fortune. He was in the rag trade and manufactured shoulder pads and linings for uniforms. He landed the contract for the US Army and made a fortune.’ Maurice married a Broadway singer called Patricia Pollack and the couple rubbed shoulders with President Kennedy, Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor. In 1966, he bought El Morocco, a legendary Manhattan nightclub, and the Eden Roc Hotel in Miami. ‘He was cool before it was cool to be cool,’ his granddaughter says proudly. ‘He was a big personality.’ Rachel’s father Bob was an entrepreneur who moved to Alaska because ‘he wanted to prove himself in the last frontier’. Together with wife Susan Bishop, Bob launched Alaska’s first cable television station: ‘My dad was ahead of his time. He went to Alaska with a thousand dollars in his pocket and earned his own millions. My mother was an on-air producer and host.’ When she was five, the couple split up and Susan returned to her native New York with Rachel: ‘It was hard. I didn’t see as much of my dad as I wanted. And then his addictions began.’ Bob Uchitel was found dead at his sprawling country estate in September 1990, with blood pouring from his nose. Grief-stricken: Rachel hunting for news of her fiance Andy O'Grady after the 9/11 attack The Anchorage Daily News reported: ‘The police found only one body, but ask Bob Uchitel’s friends, they’ll tell you two Bobs died that day. The old Bob was a strong man, a man of vision and intellect, a self-made Alaskan millionaire. The new Bob died alone, his body bruised and bloody, his brain cooked on cocaine.’ Rachel’s eyes cloud over: ‘The loss of my father was devastating to me. I was 15 when he died. It left a gaping hole in my life.’ Nevertheless, she followed a conventional path – private progressive boarding school in California, psychology degree from the University of New Hampshire, tele¬vision career with Bloomberg News. Ten years ago, she met handsome New York investment banker Andy O’Grady on a blind date. He proposed a few months later, in the summer of 2001. ‘We were madly in love and I was the happiest girl in the world,’ she says. ‘I was working as an assignment editor for Bloomberg News, Andy and I were talking about our future and kids. In Andy I had found my rock, a stable male figure that I’d never had . . . then 9/11 happened.’ Rachel’s face crumples. ‘Andy and I had just come back from a holiday in Greece. I left for work early that morning. I didn’t kiss him goodbye because I didn’t want to mess my lipstick. It’s something that haunts me.’ Rachel was at Bloomberg News as the first plane slammed into the World Trade Center: ‘Andy called and said, “Rachel, this is serious, I’ve just seen someone jump from the window of the other building.” He was working for Sandler O’Neill on the 104th floor of the South Tower. He hung up and I watched the second plane hit his building, 30 floors below where I knew he was. I tried calling him back but there was silence. Nothing.’ Grief-stricken, Rachel joined hundreds of other family members outside Bellevue Hospital: ‘I’d heard his name was on a list of survivors so I raced down there. They told me he wasn’t there and the news cameras got me as I left.’ She says the next year was a blur: ‘I sat in the closet in his clothes just to smell him. The doctors gave me pills to sleep. That’s when my addiction to Ambien started (Rachel allegedly introduced Tiger to the sleeping drug he took before he crashed his car). Andy’s credit cards were returned, burned, in the mail. Every day they would find bits of his life, a burned driver’s licence or whatever, and I would have to open the envelope. ‘I went through hell. I fell to pieces. When the one-year anniversary of 9/11 happened, most of his friends had moved on. People we knew had married and were starting families. I felt robbed.’ Given the sudden, premature losses of her father and fiance, it is little wonder Rachel began to career out of control, and that finding a replacement man became her leitmotif. She embarked on a brief, disastrous marriage to one of Andy’s best friends, Wall Street trader Steven Ehrenkranz: ‘We were both grieving. It was a mistake.’ After that, Rachel says: ‘I had to leave New York and move on with my life for my own sanity. I had to reinvent myself.’ She loaded her belongings into her car and headed west to Las Vegas, where her grandfather had a house. Within months she had landed a job as head of VIP operations at Tao Nightclub in The Venetian casino. She later acted in a similar role at other clubs in Vegas, including The Bank at Bellagio. ‘I am not a whore, nor am I a girl impressed by money or fame,’ she says. ‘I have a brain and I came from money. I never needed any man’s money.’ It was a job that would bring her into contact with the world’s richest men: ‘I still have my little black book and it has 5,000 men in there who are pretty much the men who run the world,’ she says grandly. ‘My life became one of private jets. My job was to get the high-rollers, or whales – as we called them – into the club and give them anything and everything they wanted to have the best night of their lives – guys who would order 100 bottles of Cristal champagne in a night or even blow 500,000 [£300,000] on one night of partying. ‘If they wanted steak, they got steak. If they wanted a certain song, I’d get it played on a loop all night. A Saudi prince loved Uptown Girl so I sent someone out to get it and that prince had Uptown Girl all night. ‘And if they wanted girls, I’d get them girls, though you have to understand I never got involved in that side of things. Of course, some of the girls were hookers. And others would sleep with men for gifts. But I didn’t force anyone to do anything. These were consenting adults. I was there to work and make money. It was strictly business.’ She claims she earned £300,000 a year: ‘I was paid well and got huge tips. I deserved it. I was good at my job.’ She also insists she ‘mostly’ went home alone, but it was as nightclub hostess that she met Tiger Woods and embarked on their affair. According to friends, the golfer bombarded her with texts and emails promising to leave his wife and calling her his ‘soul mate’. One source told me: ‘They were both emotionally immature. Tiger was trapped in an unhappy marriage and Rachel worshipped him. They both thought they had found the love of their lives and got caught up in the drama.’ Rachel refuses point blank to discuss her affair with Tiger. It is widely rumoured that a £6 million commercial settlement was reached a year ago. When I ask Rachel directly about the pay-off, she smiles sweetly and says: ‘Naughty you. You know I can’t say anything.’ Yet the signs all point to the fact that Tiger ‘invested’ in her silence. She recently bought an apartment on Park Avenue in New York for more than £2 million. She owns an apartment in Las Vegas and splits her time in LA between Beverly Hills and Malibu, where a £10,000 tan Hermes bag sits casually on a side table. The last year has seen her embark on rehab, study for a masters degree in psychology and, bizarrely, apply for a professional private eye’s licence. ‘I should get it next month ,’ she says with a wry smile. ‘And, yes, that means I will be hunting down cheating husbands. It is all part of me moving on with my life and I figured I may as well do something career-wise that I have a flair for.’ She reveals she has gained a sense of humour about Tiger – when I tell her she is much prettier than most of Wood’s other women, she giggles: ‘It’s hard not to be,’ before calling Tiger’s lover Mindy Lawton ‘poor Mindy’ (referring to her looks) and adding about cocktail waitress Jaimee Grubbs: ‘The poor girl had a tooth missing. Honestly! She was toothless!’ ||||| This might be the most fitting couple in the world.Sources close to Jason Wahler tell us that he's falling for Rachel Uchitel, most infamously known for being the rumored head notch on Tiger Woods' naughty belt (can you believe it's almost been a year since that crap came out?).The two Read More |||||Summary:","completion":"Rachel Uchitel, the woman whose affair with Tiger Woods led to the downfall of the golfing superstar's career and marriage, has broken her silence on the scandal.

Tragic: Liam Hardy, 14, had been hospitalised after a suicide attempt less than a week before he died, an inquest heard. A 14-year-old schoolboy who was about to become a father was found hanged days after being discharged from hospital following a suicide attempt. Liam Hardy was allowed to leave St Helier Hospital in Carshalton, Surrey, after his first suicide bid - despite pleas from his mother for him to be sectioned, an inquest heard. Days later, he was readmitted when he tried to hang himself at home. Again, the teenager was released within hours. But that same week, Liam was found dead in his bedroom as his grandfather took him a cup of hot chocolate. He had just texted his girlfriend to say: 'It's no use, I'm giving up'. Despite. desperate attempts by Terry Hardy and paramedics to resuscitate the teenager, Liam never regained consciousness and died at St Georges’ Hospital, South London, nine days later. Giving evidence at an inquest into her son’s death, Janine Hardy wept as she claimed pleas to have her son taken into care as a precaution were ignored. She had caught Liam during his first attempt after school on November 15, 2012. Despite trying to calm him down, he persisted until police and ambulance crews arrived, treated him for a superficial injury and took him to St Helier. Even though he was seen by a doctor, a specialist nurse from the district Children and Adolescent Mental Health (CAMHS) and his therapist, Liam was allowed to leave and go back to his pregnant girlfriend’s house, against his mother’s wishes. He was readmitted and discharged once more, before his grandfather found him on November 19, 2012. He died on November 27. Accompanied by her partner, Ms Hardy said: 'I gave her all Liam’s history about his self-harming, what was going on in the present situation, how he didn’t get on with [his therapist] Catelin, that he wasn’t taking help seriously, about the pregnancy. 'She said she would go and speak to Liam, she would go and speak to him alone. She was in there for about 10 minutes. We went back in to the room. There was the C.A.M.S nurse, myself and Dean. Devastated: Liam's mother, Janine Hardy, (pictured, left, outside Croydon Coroner's Court and, right, with her son) said she asked for him to be sectioned but her calls went ignored. 'She said that Liam was fine now, he didn’t intend to die, no he doesn’t want to die. I told her he intended to do this. 'She said that in her opinion it was fine for him to go back to his girlfriend’s house. 'I wasn’t happy with it, I asked why she was discharging him back to his girlfriend’s, why she isn’t keeping him in or sectioning him.' Liam, a pupil at Carshalton Boys Sports College who suffered from epilepsy, was expecting a child when he died. Liam, a pupil at Carshalton Boys. Sports College, had a history of psychological health issues including. epilepsy and had been assigned a therapist in May 2012. At. an earlier meeting with CAMHS in March, Ms Hardy had told how her son. was self-harming, had been found with red marks around his neck and that. 'he didn’t want to live'. She said she did not want her son to go into care at the time and was told 'there wasn’t any mental health issue there', although he was referred to Multi Systemic Therapy and eventually assigned to a therapist. However, Croydon Coroner’s Court heard how he struggled to interact with the therapist, who he was supposed to meet 'a couple of times a week'. Ms Hardy claimed her son felt he was not being taken seriously. After another altercation at their home in Worcester Park, Surrey, Liam was taken into custody after the police were called. Again, his mother asked for social services to section him after he self-harmed. However, he was allowed to leave the station before they had the chance to see him after being collected by his girlfriend’s father. Liam had been expecting a baby daughter with his girlfriend, who can not be named for legal reasons, who was seven months pregnant at the time of his death. In the stand today, his girlfriend told how she caught him choking himself in the weeks before he died, but he had promised her he wouldn’t do it again. However a letter found at his grandparents’ home said: 'I’m very sorry for everything and I’m nothing without [my girlfriend]'.

Large urban centers, such as Nanjing and Beijing, also contributed to the growth of private industry. In particular, small-scale industries grew up, often specializing in paper, silk, cotton, and porcelain goods. For the most part, however, relatively small urban centers with markets proliferated around the country. Town markets mainly traded food, with some necessary manufactures such as pins or oil. Despite the xenophobia and intellectual introspection characteristic of the increasingly popular new school of neo-Confucianism, China under the early Ming dynasty was not isolated. Foreign trade and other contacts with the outside world, particularly Japan, increased considerably. Chinese merchants explored all of the Indian Ocean, reaching East Africa with the treasure voyages of Zheng He. What caused urbanization to increase in China?","completion":"Urbanization increased in China due to several interrelated factors. These factors include population growth, the development of a more complex division of labor, growth of private industries in large urban centers, and increased foreign trade and contacts with the outside world. 1. Population Growth: As China's population grew, there was a need for more housing, infrastructure, and services. This growth in population led to the expansion of existing urban areas and the creation of new ones. More people living in urban areas meant a greater need for resources, jobs, and amenities that cities could provide. 2. Complex Division of Labor: As the Chinese society developed, so did the division of labor. Jobs became more specialized, creating opportunities for people with specific skills and expertise to find work in urban areas. This complexity in the division of labor attracted more people to seek out jobs that matched their skillset, contributing to the growth of cities. 3. Growth of Private Industries in Large Urban Centers: Large urban centers, such as Nanjing and Beijing, saw the growth of private industries, particularly in the sectors of paper, silk, cotton, and porcelain goods. These small-scale industries provided jobs and stimulated the local economy, attracting more people to urban areas and fueling urbanization. 4. Proliferation of Small Urban Centers with Markets: Smaller urban centers throughout China began to grow as they developed markets for trading goods, primarily food but also necessary manufactures such as pins or oil. As these markets provided a hub for economic activity, they fostered the growth of surrounding urban areas. 5. Increase in Foreign Trade and Contact: During the early Ming dynasty, China's foreign trade and contacts with the outside world, particularly Japan, increased significantly. Chinese merchants explored the entirety of the Indian Ocean, even reaching East Africa through the voyages of Zheng He. This expanding trade brought new opportunities and wealth, spurring the growth of coastal cities and further promoting urbanization in China. In conclusion, urbanization increased in China due to a combination of factors such as population growth, complex division of labor, growth of private industries in large urban centers, the development of small urban centers with markets, and increased foreign trade and contact with the outside world. These factors worked in tandem to create a more economically and socially dynamic environment, driving the growth of cities and urban populations."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

I firmly advise against watching this 82 minute failure; the only reason it merited a star was the presence of Chris Pine. Nothing happens. You wait patiently in the hope that there may be a flicker of a twist, a hint of surprise, a plot to emerge - but no.

The only thing that could have made it worse would be adding the perishable token ethnic 'companion'. Their encounters with obstacles (be they human or physical) are brief, confusing and entirely pointless. Chris Pine fights to keep himself above the surface whilst being drowned by a misery of a lightweight cast.

After arriving in New York City, Einstein was taken to various places and events, including Chinatown, a lunch with the editors of the New York Times, and a performance of Carmen at the Metropolitan Opera, where he was cheered by the audience on his arrival. During the days following, he was given the keys to the city by Mayor Jimmy Walker and met the president of Columbia University, who described Einstein as \\"The ruling monarch of the mind.\\" Harry Emerson Fosdick, pastor at New York's Riverside Church, gave Einstein a tour of the church and showed him a full-size statue that the church made of Einstein, standing at the entrance. Also during his stay in New York, he joined a crowd of 15,000 people at Madison Square Garden during a Hanukkah celebration. Einstein next traveled to California where he met Caltech president and Nobel laureate, Robert A. Millikan. His friendship with Millikan was \\"awkward\\", as Millikan \\"had a penchant for patriotic militarism,\\" where Einstein was a pronounced pacifist. During an address to Caltech's students, Einstein noted that science was often inclined to do more harm than good. This aversion to war also led Einstein to befriend author Upton Sinclair and film star Charlie Chaplin, both noted for their pacifism. Carl Laemmle, head of Universal Studios, gave Einstein a tour of his studio and introduced him to Chaplin. They had an instant rapport, with Chaplin inviting Einstein and his wife, Elsa, to his home for dinner. Chaplin said Einstein's outward persona, calm and gentle, seemed to conceal a \\"highly emotional temperament,\\" from which came his \\"extraordinary intellectual energy.\\" Chaplin also remembers Elsa telling him about the time Einstein conceived his theory of relativity. During breakfast one morning, he seemed lost in thought and ignored his food. She asked him if something was bothering him. He sat down at his piano and started playing.

Answer the above question based on the context below: After almost three years of touring to promote Metallica, including a headlining performance at Woodstock '94, Metallica returned to the studio to write and record its sixth studio album. The band went on a brief hiatus in the summer of 1995 and played a short tour, Escape from the Studio '95, comprising three outdoor shows, including a headline show at Donington Park supported by Slayer, Skid Row, Slash's Snakepit, Therapy?, and Corrosion of Conformity. The band spent about a year writing and recording new songs, resulting in the release of Load in 1996. Load debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 and ARIA Charts; it was the band's second number-one album. The cover art, Blood and Semen III, was created by Andres Serrano, who pressed a mixture of his own semen and blood between sheets of plexiglass. The release marked a change in the band's musical direction and a new image; the bandmembers' hair was cut. Metallica headlined the alternative rock festival Lollapalooza festival in mid-1996. During early production of the album, the band had recorded enough material to fill a double album. It was decided that half of the songs were to be released; the band would continue to work on the remaining songs and release them the following year. This resulted in follow-up album titled Reload. The cover art was again created by Serrano, this time using a mixture of blood and urine. Reload debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 and reached number two on the Top Canadian Album chart. Hetfield said in the 2004 documentary film Some Kind of Monster that the band initially thought some of the songs on these albums were of average quality; these were \\"polished and reworked\\" until judged releasable. To promote Reload, Metallica performed \\"Fuel\\" and \\"The Memory Remains\\" with Marianne Faithfull on NBC's Saturday Night Live in December 1997.In 1998, Metallica compiled a double album of cover songs, Garage Inc. The first disc contained newly recorded covers of songs by Diamond Head, Killing Joke, the Misfits, Thin Lizzy,... Answer:","completion":"Andres Serrano, an American artist known for his provocative artwork, used three distinct bodily fluids in the creation of the album cover art for Metallica's Load and Reload albums. For the Load album, released in 1996, Serrano created a visually striking piece of art titled \\"Blood and Semen III.\\" As the name suggests, the artwork was created using a mixture of Serrano's own semen and blood. The artist pressed this mixture between sheets of plexiglass to create an abstract pattern that was visually captivating and served as the album's cover art. This piece marked a change in Metallica's musical direction and image, corresponding to the band's experimentation with alternative rock elements in their music. When Metallica released the follow-up album, Reload, in 1997, they once again collaborated with Andres Serrano for the cover art. This time, the artwork utilized a mixture of blood and another bodily fluid: urine. Serrano combined blood and urine, creating a similarly abstract piece that complemented the visual of the Load album cover. The choice of these controversial materials aligned with the band's daring approach to their music and the themes explored in the albums. In summary, Andres Serrano used three different bodily fluids in the creation of the cover art for Metallica's Load and Reload albums. For Load, the artist used a mixture of his own blood and semen, while the Reload cover art consisted of a combination of blood and urine. These provocative choices in artistic materials contributed to the overall impression of the band's evolution in musical direction and image during this time in their career."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Process: - Carbon dioxide from the air passes through small pores (holes) in the leaves - These pores are called stomata - Water is absorbed by the roots and passes through vessels in the stem on its way to the leaves - Chlorophyll absorbs the sun&#x27;s energy - It is this energy that is used to split water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen - Oxygen is released from the leaves into the atmosphere - Hydrogen and carbon dioxide are used to form glucose or food for plants. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose less adult birds around happens, how will it affect MORE sugar and oxygen being produced. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","completion":"When considering the perturbation hypothesis with less adult birds around, we must examine both direct and indirect potential effects on the process of photosynthesis, which ultimately leads to the production of sugar (glucose) and oxygen in plants. Direct Effects: Adult birds are consumers in the ecosystem, primarily feeding on insects, seeds, fruits, or nectar, and do not directly participate in or influence the process of photosynthesis in plants. As such, a reduction in the number of adult birds is unlikely to have a direct impact on the basic mechanism of photosynthesis or the production of sugar and oxygen in plants. Indirect Effects: 1. Bird-Plant Interactions: Birds play an essential role in pollination and seed dispersal. A decrease in the number of adult birds could potentially lead to fewer plants being pollinated and consequently, fewer offspring being produced. This could lead to a decline in plant populations over time, which would indirectly affect the overall sugar and oxygen being produced in the ecosystem. However, this effect would manifest over a longer period and would not immediately alter the photosynthesis rates within individual plants. 2. Insect Population Dynamics: With fewer birds to prey on insects that feed on plant leaves, there could be an increase in the insect population, which might lead to an increase in herbivory. This could cause damage to leaves, reducing the surface area available for photosynthesis. This indirect effect, while plausible, is highly dependent on the specific insect and plant species dynamics within the ecosystem. 3. Nutrient Recycling: Birds contribute to nutrient cycling in ecosystems by breaking down organic matter and returning nutrients to the soil. Fewer adult birds could lead to a slower nutrient recycling rate, which may affect the availability of nutrients for plants, potentially limiting their growth and photosynthesis abilities. However, this effect would be limited by the relative contribution of birds to overall nutrient cycling in the ecosystem. Overall, while there are potential indirect effects of having fewer adult birds in an ecosystem, these effects will likely manifest over an extended period and may not immediately influence the rates of photosynthesis or the production of sugar and oxygen in plants. Hence, it is unlikely that the perturbation will have any immediate or large-scale direct impact on plant photosynthesis."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Wet soil: Rain could cause the soil to become wet. When soil is wet, it is easier for worms to move through because it provides a lubricant-like effect. They also come to the surface to avoid drowning in the waterlogged soil. B. Start to fall: This option does not make sense in the context of worms or rain. C. Dry soil: Rain causes soil to become wet, not dry, so this option is not logically connected to worms coming out during the rain. D. Wet things: This option relates to wetness but does not directly link to the behavior of worms during the rain. E. Wet ground: Similar to option A, this option considers the ground is wet when it rains. But, it does not directly explain the reason behind worms crawling out from the earth in the rain.

Question: Given the background: The body's second line of defense against pathogens includes the inflammatory response. If bacteria enter the skin through a scrape, the area may become red, warm, and painful. These are signs of inflammation. Inflammation is one way the body reacts to infections or injuries. Inflammation is caused by chemicals that are released when skin or other tissues are damaged. The chemicals cause nearby blood vessels to dilate, or expand. This increases blood flow to the damaged area, which makes the area red and slightly warm. The chemicals also attract white blood cells called neutrophils to the wound and cause them to leak out of blood vessels into the damaged tissue. and the situation: After working out in the yard for the day doing various chores, Karen comes back inside to prepare for a shower. While waiting for the shower to heat up, she notices she got one cut on each of her arms. The cut on her left arm is hardly even noticeable, but the one on her right arm is red and easy to see. Karen gets some cream from her cabinet to use on her cuts after she gets done showering. Answer the following question: Which arm's blood vessels are more dilated? Answer:","completion":"Karen's right arm's blood vessels are more dilated. Step 1: Identify the signs of inflammation From the given background information, we know that the signs of inflammation include redness, warmth, and pain. Karen notices that the cut on her right arm is red and easy to see, indicating a possible inflammation, while the cut on her left arm is hardly noticeable. Step 2: Relate inflammation to blood vessel dilation The background information tells us that when the body reacts to infections or injuries, it causes inflammation. Inflammation is caused by chemicals that are released in response to damaged skin or tissues. These chemicals cause the blood vessels in the affected area to dilate, or expand, increasing blood flow to the damaged area. Step 3: Compare the cuts on Karen's arms Since the cut on Karen's right arm is showing signs of inflammation (redness), it can be inferred that the blood vessels in her right arm are more dilated as a part of the body's inflammatory response to that injury. The cut on her left arm is not showing any visible signs of inflammation, and so we can assume that the blood vessels in her left arm are less dilated. In conclusion, Karen's right arm's blood vessels are more dilated due to the visible signs of inflammation."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The industry has filed a federal lawsuit demanding that the US Fish and Wildlife Service reinstate a no-otter zone off part of the coast, reports Courthouse News Service. It seems the sea otters love to hoover up shellfish, and the fishermen are afraid their livelihoods will be wiped out. \\"We're not attacking sea otters,\\" one of their attorneys tells the Los Angeles Times. \\"It's just that without a sea otter management zone, the fisheries our clients rely on will be decimated in 10 to 20 years.\\" Some background on the zone he's talking about, from a blog at Earthjustice: Congress authorized it in the 1980s. The idea was to relocate the otters from those fishing grounds to the more isolated San Nicolas Island, a move that was supposed to help both the otters and the fishermen. The problem is that the otters never took to the island and kept trying to return to their original waters. They would often get injured while being trapped and relocated. The Fish and Wildlife Service finally scrapped the no-otter zone in January, and the fishermen say the agency had no authority to do so. Environmental groups worried about the otters' stagnant population (about 2,800 for several years now) are stepping up to defend them in court. \\"If the fishermen's lawsuit were to prevail, our concern is that harm, injury and even death to sea otters would follow,\\" says a rep from the nonprofit Friends of the Sea Otter.

In 1024, they were replaced by the Salian dynasty, who famously clashed with the papacy under Emperor Henry IV (r. 1084–1105) over church appointments as part of the Investiture Controversy. His successors continued to struggle against the papacy as well as the German nobility. A period of instability followed the death of Emperor Henry V (r. 1111–25), who died without heirs, until Frederick I Barbarossa (r. 1155–90) took the imperial throne. Although he ruled effectively, the basic problems remained, and his successors continued to struggle into the 13th century. Barbarossa's grandson Frederick II (r. 1220–1250), who was also heir to the throne of Sicily through his mother, clashed repeatedly with the papacy. His court was famous for its scholars and he was often accused of heresy. He and his successors faced many difficulties, including the invasion of the Mongols into Europe in the mid-13th century.

As there was no back yard to their home in which to bury the cat. Father was forced to wrap the cat up in a newspaper and take it with him, being carefully reminded by Mother to throw the package from the train window when on the way to his work. Father placed his bag upon the package shelf over his seat, but started to have a conversation with a traveler and forgot to throw the bag out of the window. He took the package on to his office, thinking that he would deal with it on his way home that evening. But again he got to talking to someone on the train, forgot about the cat, and still had the package under his arm when he arrived home.

David Brill, chairman of the church's friends group, said: \\"The grant from Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF) has literally been the answer to our prayers.\\" The building is the second-oldest English Baptist church in Wales and was built on the site of an old brewery in 1840-41. It has not had any major work done since 1900 and as a result the slate roof is leaking, parts of the plaster ceiling have collapsed into the upstairs gallery and internal walls are suffering from damp. The HLF grant will also provide money to develop a programme of education and activities to increase visitor numbers to the church. Mr Brill said. \\"The Friends have been working hard to create events to raise money to carry out the repairs and the response from church members and non-members alike has been fabulous. \\"It has been a joy to see people united and working towards a common goal, namely to secure the future of High Street Church - it really has brought the church together. \\"But without HLF, we would be buying bowls, buckets and tarpaulins to catch rain coming through the roof, and buckets and spades for children from sunday school and the kids club to dig out the built-up areas around the church.\\" The church hosts various community groups and clubs, including the People's Kitchen, a cooking project which feeds homeless people in the area. One of its leaders, Val Williams, said: \\"I am absolutely delighted that the funding received by the Friends of High Street will help to ensure that the premises will be able to continue to host vital social activities in an economically deprived area. \\"But not only that - it also helps to ensure that a site of immense local historical importance is preserved.\\"","completion":"The High Street Baptist Church, a Grade II-listed building and the second-oldest English Baptist church in Wales, is currently facing structural issues due to a leaking roof and a partially collapsed ceiling. Situated on the site of a former brewery, the building was constructed in the period 1840-41 and hasn't seen any major restoration work since 1900. This has resulted in a plethora of problems, for instance, a leaking slate roof, collapsing portions of the plaster ceiling into the upstairs gallery and damp internal walls. However, relief has arrived in the form of a lottery grant which is intended to fund a £225,000 restoration project. This fund is issued by the Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF), whose contribution has been appreciated and labelled as an \\"answer to our prayers\\" by David Brill, the chairman of the church's friends group. In addition to helping repair the deteriorating parts of the church, the grant will also be utilized to foster a programme of education and activities in a bid to attract more visitors to the church. These funds have brought about great joy and relief for the members of the High Street Church, as without it, they would have been forced to buy bowls, buckets, and tarpaulins to catch the rain leaking from the roof, and buckets and spades for children from the Sunday school and kids club to dig out built-up areas around the church. The friends group has been working tirelessly to put together events aimed at raising money for these much-needed repairs. The support from the church members and non-members alike has been commendable—bringing a sense of unity and fostering collective action towards securing the future of the church. The High Street Baptist Church is not only a historical landmark in the area, but also a vital community hub, hosting various community groups and clubs. This includes the People's Kitchen, a cooking project focused on feeding local homeless individuals. As such, this restoration will ensure the church can continue these important social activities in an economically deprived area. As Val Williams, one of its leaders, expressed delight about the funding received by the church, they highlighted the importance of preserving such a site of immense local historical importance."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Some of this growth has occurred in the developed world, but the most dramatic increase has been in the Third World. Almost all the world's population growth over the next 30 years will take place in the cities of developing countries By the year 2030, for the first time in history, 60 percent of the world's people will be living in cities. This is actually good news in some ways. \\"Cities are the fundamental building blocks of prosperity,\\" says Marc Weiss, chairman of the Prague Institute for Global Urban Development, \\" both for the nation and for families.\\" Industrial and commercial activities in urban areas account for between 50 and 80 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP) in most countries of the world\\" there's the crazy notion that the way to deal with a city's problems is to keep people out of them,\\"Weiss continued. \\"But the problems of the rural life are even more serious than those of the city.\\" For better or worse, urban-watchers are clear on one point: The quality of life for most people in the future will be determined by the quality of cities. Those cities will be bigger than ever. And yet, population numbers by themselves don't determine a city's prospects; after all, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, and Hamburg, Germany, have the same population. Nor is explosive growth necessarily the determining factor. \\"City problems,\\" one authority points out, \\"mostly have to do with weak, ineffective, and usually unrepresentative city governments.\\" Answer: Big cities.

Question: Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: Which intricate emotions did Turner come up with? Context: A common way in which emotions are conceptualized in sociology is in terms of the multidimensional characteristics including cultural or emotional labels (e.g., anger, pride, fear, happiness), physiological changes (e.g., increased perspiration, changes in pulse rate), expressive facial and body movements (e.g., smiling, frowning, baring teeth), and appraisals of situational cues. One comprehensive theory of emotional arousal in humans has been developed by Jonathan Turner (2007: 2009). Two of the key eliciting factors for the arousal of emotions within this theory are expectations states and sanctions. When people enter a situation or encounter with certain expectations for how the encounter should unfold, they will experience different emotions depending on the extent to which expectations for Self, other and situation are met or not met. People can also provide positive or negative sanctions directed at Self or other which also trigger different emotional experiences in individuals. Turner analyzed a wide range of emotion theories across different fields of research including sociology, psychology, evolutionary science, and neuroscience. Based on this analysis, he identified four emotions that all researchers consider being founded on human neurology including assertive-anger, aversion-fear, satisfaction-happiness, and disappointment-sadness. These four categories are called primary emotions and there is some agreement amongst researchers that these primary emotions become combined to produce more elaborate and complex emotional experiences. These more elaborate emotions are called first-order elaborations in Turner's theory and they include sentiments such as pride, triumph, and awe. Emotions can also be experienced at different levels of intensity so that feelings of concern are a low-intensity variation of the primary emotion aversion-fear whereas depression is a higher intensity variant. Answer:","completion":"In Turner's theory, the intricate emotions, also known as first-order elaborations, that he came up with include pride, triumph, and awe.

Question: Who was released before a second search Movie title: The Lives of Others Movie plot: The Lives of Others is at once a political thriller and a human drama. The film opens in East Berlin in 1984 with a sequence that alternates scenes from an interrogation with scenes from a training class for aspiring officers of the Stasi, or secret police. Stasi Captain Gerd Wiesler (Ulrich Mühe), code name HGW XX/7, is demonstrating his interrogation technique using audio of his own interrogation of a suspect. Wiesler instructs the students on how to tell whether a subject is lying. A student asks a question that Wiesler judges to be a bit too compassionate (read \\"bourgeois\\"), and the professor marks the student's name on the attendance record: surely this student has just flunked the course, or worse. During the feature's first thirty minutes, writer/director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck draws a portrait of Wiesler that borders on caricature: Wiesler is a highly skilled officer of the Stasi, a proud, zealous, disciplined and entirely cold-blooded professional. He is one of the many cogs in the wheel of \\"the System,\\" working anonymously and tirelessly, convinced that his efforts are building a better Socialist society.At the end of the class, Lieutenant-Colonel Anton Grubitz (Ulrich Tukur), Wiesler's old school friend (and probably his only friend), who has risen to the position of head of the Culture Department at Stasi, comes to invite Wiesler to a theatrical premiere. The play is by the celebrated East German playwright Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch), and its leading character is played by Dreyman's lover, Christa-Maria Sieland (Martina Gedeck), an actress of great reputation. Dreyman, who writes plays about the heroic proletariat, lives a rather comfortable life in a plush East Berlin apartment, enjoying a certain notoriety among DDR officials who value him because he's one of the few East German writers whose work is read in the west. He preserves the respect of the artistic community by using his (relatively) secure position for occasional interventions in favor of dissident fellow artists.... Answer:","completion":"In order to decide whether investing in the film proposal for \\"The Lives of Others\\" is a good decision, it is essential to address a few critical questions regarding its potential success. These questions will help offer insight into the film's marketability, the strengths of its plot, the talent involved, and its appeal to target audiences. 1. Marketability: Considering the movie's plot and themes, does it have the potential for a broad appeal or attract a niche audience? \\"The Lives of Others\\" deals with political intrigue, human drama, and a powerful historical context. This could attract both audiences interested in the history of East Germany and those who enjoy character-driven dramas. Apart from its themes, the critical acclaim and recognition the original film received can also generate interest amongst potential viewers. 2. Cast and Director: Are there well-known or talented actors and a reputable director attached to the project? The quality of a film often relies on the talent of its cast and crew. It is essential to investigate the knowledge and experience of the filmmakers, as well as the attached actors. Engaging with the right talent can help elevate the film's artistic value and appeal to a broader audience base. 3. Awards and critical recognition potential: Does the film have the potential to gain critical acclaim, receive awards, or be recognized internationally? As a remake of Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck's Oscar-winning film, investing in it could lead to prestigious recognition and awards. These accolades may potentially elevate the film's visibility and boost its financial success. 4. Target audience: What is the target demographic for the film, and how does its intended audience align with current market trends? \\"The Lives of Others\\" may especially appeal to adult viewers who appreciate historical and political dramas. However, given the film's plot and subject matter, it may not cater to younger audiences or those seeking light entertainment. Understanding the film's appeal and target demographic is an essential factor in gauging its potential success in the market. 5. Financial prospects: With all the factors considered, will the film have a high chance of returning profits on the investment? It is crucial to analyze the film's budget and expected revenue potential. This ultimately determines the viability and profitability of the project. In conclusion, it is important to weigh the answers to these questions and analyze the pros and cons before deciding to invest in \\"The Lives of Others.\\" By taking all aspects into account - the marketability of the film, the cast and director, the potential for critical acclaim and recognition, the target audience, and financial prospects - you can make a well-informed decision on whether to invest in this film proposal."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

A:","completion":"No, the genuses Anthemis and Veronica do not belong to the same family. They belong to two different families within the plant kingdom. Anthemis, commonly known as chamomile, is a genus that belongs to the family Asteraceae, also known as the sunflower family or the daisy family. The Asteraceae is one of the largest and most diverse families of flowering plants, with over 23,000 species distributed across about 1,620 genera. This family is characterized by its unique inflorescence, called a capitulum, which gives the appearance of a single flower but is actually composed of numerous smaller flowers called florets. Family members often have alternate, simple, and arranged leaves, and they can be found in a variety of habitats worldwide, including grasslands, forests, and wetlands. Anthemis itself comprises around 200 species of herbaceous perennials and annuals, mainly distributed in the Mediterranean region and Southwest Asia. These plants have finely divided leaves and capitulum inflorescence with white or yellow ray florets surrounding disk florets. Some species within this genus are used for their medicinal properties, such as Anthemis nobilis (Roman chamomile) and Anthemis tinctoria (golden marguerite). These species are known for their calming effects and are used to treat minor ailments like stomachaches, skin irritations, and insomnia. Veronica, on the other hand, is a genus that belongs to the family Plantaginaceae, which is commonly known as the plantain family. This family includes around 1,900 species of flowering plants spread across about 90 genera. The Plantaginaceae family is characterized by its bilaterally symmetrical flowers with usually five petals that are fused at the base, opposite leaves, and capsules or utricles as fruit types. The family members are distributed worldwide in a variety of habitats, from mountains to coastal regions and from wetlands to arid deserts. The genus Veronica itself consists of approximately 500 species of annuals, perennials, and subshrubs, widely distributed throughout the Northern Hemisphere, Australia, and New Zealand. These plants are known for their brightly colored, usually blue, flowers and their various medicinal uses. Some commonly known species within the Veronica genus are Veronica officinalis (heath speedwell), Veronica chamaedrys (germander speedwell), and Veronica beccabunga (brooklime). These plants have been used for their astringent, diuretic, and expectorant properties, and in the treatment of coughs, respiratory infections, and skin conditions, among other ailments. In conclusion, while both Anthemis and Veronica are genera of flowering plants, they differ significantly in their taxonomy, morphological characteristics, and distribution. Anthemis belongs to the Asteraceae family and is primarily associated with the Mediterranean region and Southwest Asia, whereas Veronica is a part of the Plantaginaceae family and has a more widespread distribution across the Northern Hemisphere, Australia, and New Zealand. Their flowers, leaves, and fruit structures are different, and they are adapted to distinct habitats and environmental conditions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Went there Saturday night and there were about 4 tables filled out of the whole dining room (Memorial Day Weekend) which has about 13 or 14 tables. Upon entering, the waitress told us to have a seat. I spotted a table on my left which was already set up with place settings and approached the table. The waitress then said,\\" not there--we are seating by sections.\\" Sections? I never knew there were sections and I've eaten here many, many times There were people seated in that so called \\"section\\" but we humbly moved along. She directed us to an unset table in front of their toilet door. If the table were any closer to the toilet door, people using the toilet would have had to say excuse me before entering. Comically, or maybe not so much, a few of the patrons asked us if there was anyone using the bathroom before entering. My husband asked me if we were bathroom monitors and commented that in his days as a junior high school teacher in a raucous neighborhood part of his teaching program included bathroom duty where he was required to sit outside the boys' bathroom (with another teacher in case of big trouble) for one period a day. \\"Am I a bathroom monitor again?\\" he asked. \\"No darling\\", I said. \\"You are a senior citizen doing volunteer work as a bathroom monitor.\\" \\"At the next restaurant we go to, I will demand that you are given a higher position.\\" Our food came and as is typical of BelFiore --delicious and plentiful. He: Eggplant & chicken cutlet with pasta. Me: Shrimp Parmagiana & pasta--shrimp delightfully not overcooked. Salads were simple with iceberg lettuce but they were included with the dinner; some places give you nothing. The waitress (the one with tattoos-can't remember her name, sorry) gave us good service other than the fact that she sent us to \\"the toilet table.\\" May I recommend to BelFiore's management that they move that table away from the toilet area? They have plenty of room in that vast dining area! My greatest fear was that a diner with an upset stomach would use the toilet and share his/her upset stomach with us while we were trying to enjoy our dinners.

Evidence of the health effects of wildfire smoke should be relayed to the public so that exposure may be limited. Evidence of health effects can also be used to influence policy to promote positive health outcomes.Inhalation of smoke from a wildfire can be a health hazard. Wildfire smoke is composed of combustion products i.e. carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, water vapor, particulate matter, organic chemicals, nitrogen oxides and other compounds. The principal health concern is the inhalation of particulate matter and carbon monoxide.Particulate matter (PM) is a type of air pollution made up of particles of dust and liquid droplets. They are characterized into three categories based on the diameter of the particle: coarse PM, fine PM, and ultrafine PM. Coarse particles are between 2.5 micrometers and 10 micrometers, fine particles measure 0.1 to 2.5 micrometers, and ultrafine particle are less than 0.1 micrometer. Each size can enter the body through inhalation, but the PM impact on the body varies by size. Coarse particles are filtered by the upper airways and these particles can accumulate and cause pulmonary inflammation. This can result in eye and sinus irritation as well as sore throat and coughing. Coarse PM is often composed of materials that are heavier and more toxic that lead to short-term effects with stronger impact.Smaller particulate moves further into the respiratory system creating issues deep into the lungs and the bloodstream. In asthma patients, PM2.5 causes inflammation but also increases oxidative stress in the epithelial cells. These particulates also cause apoptosis and autophagy in lung epithelial cells. Both processes cause the cells to be damaged and impacts the cell function. This damage impacts those with respiratory conditions such as asthma where the lung tissues and function are already compromised. The third PM type is ultra-fine PM (UFP). UFP can enter the bloodstream... I am facing a new situation today: Ben visited two states. Washington state, which had many wildfires year-round, and Oregon, state which had almost no wildfires.

Article: Alsten Chase has written a book about Yellowstone National Park. He is worried about the damage the fires can do to the park. He is also concerned about the park rules. These rules say that nature should decide what happens to the park. Alsten also writes that the elk herd has grown too big. The elks walk on the riverbanks. They eat the new grass and roots of baby trees. The beavers need the trees to build dams. The dams raise the water levels. Higher water levels put more water into the soil. Moist soil helps plants grow faster. The plants offer homes and food to other animals. Chase thinks that the park rules would work only in a park with natural settings. He believes that Yellowstone has had an artificial setting for a long time. The native people left. The wolves were taken away and other animals were removed.The areas of land were fenced off and other animals added.He thinks the park rules that let herds grow too big and the fires burn are hurting the nature of the park. The park manager thinks the rules are good and that the park will be fine. Chase thinks the way the people run the park should be changed. Question: Chase thinks that the park is _ .

Answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What was the full name of the person Lennon become involved with in a protest? In 1970, Lennon and Ono went through primal therapy with Arthur Janov in Los Angeles, California. Designed to release emotional pain from early childhood, the therapy entailed two half-days a week with Janov for four months; he had wanted to treat the couple for longer, but they felt no need to continue and returned to London. Lennon's debut solo album, John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band (1970), was received with praise by many music critics, but its highly personal lyrics and stark sound limited its commercial performance. Critic Greil Marcus remarked, \\"John's singing in the last verse of 'God' may be the finest in all of rock.\\" The album featured the song \\"Mother\\", in which Lennon confronted his feelings of childhood rejection, and the Dylanesque \\"Working Class Hero\\", a bitter attack against the bourgeois social system which, due to the lyric \\"you're still fucking peasants\\", fell foul of broadcasters. In January 1971, Tariq Ali expressed his revolutionary political views when he interviewed Lennon, who immediately responded by writing \\"Power to the People\\". In his lyrics to the song, Lennon reversed the non-confrontational approach he had espoused in \\"Revolution\\", although he later disowned the message, saying that it was borne out of guilt and a desire for approval from radicals such as Ali. Lennon became involved with Ali in a protest against the prosecution of Oz magazine for alleged obscenity. Lennon denounced the proceedings as \\"disgusting fascism\\", and he and Ono (as Elastic Oz Band) released the single \\"God Save Us/Do the Oz\\" and joined marches in support of the magazine. Eager for a major commercial success, Lennon adopted a more accessible sound for his next album, Imagine (1971). Rolling Stone reported that \\"it contains a substantial portion of good music\\" but warned of the possibility that \\"his posturings will soon seem not merely dull but irrelevant\\". The album's title track later became an anthem for anti-war movements, while the song \\"How Do You Sleep?\\" was a musical attack on McCartney in response... Answer:","completion":"The full name of the person that John Lennon became involved with in a protest against the prosecution of Oz magazine for alleged obscenity was Tariq Ali. Ali was a political figure who expressed revolutionary political views, which aroused Lennon's interest. They both took part in a protest against what Lennon called the \\"disgusting fascism\\" of the prosecution of Oz magazine. Their involvement went as far as promoting their shared viewpoint through music, where Lennon and his partner, Yoko Ono, released a single under the band name Elastic Oz Band with the songs \\"God Save Us/Do the Oz.\\" Additionally, they participated in marches to support the magazine. It's worth noting that Ali's political stance deeply influenced Lennon, prompting him to write the song \\"Power to the People\\". The song marked a shift in Lennon's political approach; he transited from non- confrontational, as seen in \\"Revolution\\" to radical, an influence that seemingly came from Ali. However, Lennon later disowned the radical message in \\"Power to the People,\\" attributing it to guilt and a desire for approval from radicals such as Ali."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: - A muscle fiber gets a signal from its nerve - Proteins and chemicals release energy to either contract the muscle or relax it - When the muscles contracts the bones connected to he muscle are pulled closer together - When the muscle relaxes the bones move farther apart. What might be the first step of the process? Answer:","completion":"The first step of the process for a muscle to contract or relax occurs when a signal, or action potential, is sent from the nervous system to the muscle fibers. This signal is generated by the brain or spinal cord and travels through neurons, which make up the nerves. Once the signal reaches the neuromuscular junction—the connection point between a motor neuron and a muscle fiber—it stimulates the release of a neurotransmitter called acetylcholine. Acetylcholine binds to receptors on the muscle fiber membrane (known as the sarcolemma), triggering a change in the membrane's electrical charges. This process initiates an action potential on the sarcolemma, which then travels along the muscle fiber and reaches the sarcoplasmic reticulum, where calcium ions are stored. The release of calcium ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum initiates the interaction between actin and myosin protein filaments necessary for muscle contraction or relaxation. In summary, the crucial first step in the process of muscle contraction or relaxation is the generation and transmission of a signal, or action potential, from the nervous system to the muscle fibers."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

How to display succulents Construct a succulent wall planter. Creating a wall planter can spruce up any room without taking up much space. It can also provide an interesting conversation piece when you have guests.","completion":"Step 1: Gather materials To create a succulent wall planter, you first need to gather the necessary materials. These may include: - A wooden frame or shadow box (preferably with a back panel) - Succulent potting mix - Sphagnum moss - Succulent plants (select a variety of shapes and sizes) - Hardware cloth or wire mesh - Staple gun and staples - Wood screws and screwdriver - Work gloves - Hanging hardware Step 2: Prepare the frame Clean and sand the wooden frame or shadow box, if necessary. Make sure it is free of any debris or rough edges. Consider painting or staining the frame to match the aesthetic of your room. Step 3: Attach the wire mesh Cut a piece of hardware cloth or wire mesh that is slightly larger than the opening of your frame or shadow box. Staple the mesh securely to the inside edges of the frame using a staple gun. Be sure to wear work gloves to protect your hands from any sharp edges. Step 4: Fill the frame with succulent potting mix Place the frame on a flat surface with the mesh facing upwards. Fill the frame with succulent potting mix, making sure to press the mix firmly into place. The potting mix should be level with the top edge of the frame. Step 5: Plant the succulents Choose your succulent plants and arrange them on top of the potting mix. Carefully poke holes in the mesh using a pencil or similar tool. Insert the succulent roots through the holes and into the potting mix, making sure the plants are secure. Step 6: Add sphagnum moss Gently poke pieces of sphagnum moss between the succulents and into any gaps in the potting mix. This will help to hold the potting mix in place and provide extra moisture for your succulent plants. Step 7: Attach the back panel If your frame or shadow box has a back panel, attach it using wood screws. This will help to hold everything in place and make it easier to hang your succulent wall planter. Step 8: Install hanging hardware Install the appropriate hanging hardware on the back of your succulent wall planter. This may vary depending on the size and weight of your planter, as well as the wall surface you plan to hang it on. Step 9: Hang the planter Hang your succulent wall planter in a location that receives plenty of bright, indirect sunlight. Be sure to periodically check your planter to ensure it stays moist enough to support the succulent plants. Step 10: Maintenance Take care of your succulent wall planter by watering your plants as needed, allowing for proper drainage, and pruning any dead leaves or overgrowth.

Article: Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. / Updated / Source: NBC News By Alexandra Jaffe Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump said Sunday that there is a “very severe problem” with some Muslims, and declined to say whether he’d support a Muslim president of the United States. In an interview on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” Trump said that he feels “strongly that Muslims are excellent. I know so many Muslims that are such fabulous people. But he continued,“We can be politically correct and say there is no problem whatsoever, but the fact is, there is a problem with some and it’s a very severe problem and it’s a problem that’s taking place all over the world.” Asked by host Chuck Todd whether he’d support a Muslim president, Trump dodged. “Would I be comfortable? I don’t know if we have to address it right now. Some people have said it already happened,” he said. The comments are sure to further inflame controversy sparked by Trump last week when he declined to correct a questioner at a New Hampshire town hall who denounced Muslims as a \\"problem\\" in the U.S. and asserted both the President follows the religion and wasn't born in the U.S. The questioner asked, \\"When can we get rid of [Muslims]?\\" and Trump replied, \\"We are going to be looking at that and plenty of other things.\\" After the event his staff issued three different statements clarifying his response. On Sunday, Trump acknowledged that President Obama has said he’s a Christian, and added “I’m willing to take him at his word on that. I have no problem with that.”But Trump was less willing to budge on his skepticism of President Obama’s citizenship. Trump has questioned whether the president was born in the U.S. for years, holding an infamous 2011 press conference calling for the president to release his long-form birth certificate to prove his citizenship. The real-estate mogul has repeatedly declined to disavow the “birtherism” conspiracy, and again refused to do so on Sunday. “I just don’t want to discuss it,” he said, rattling a list of other issues he’d rather talk about: Jobs, the military, veterans. “The other’s a long, complex subject and I just don’t like talking about it,” Trump added, referring to President Obama’s citizenship. ||||| AP Photo Ben Carson: America's president can't be Muslim \\"I would not advocate that we put a Muslim in charge of this nation,\\" he says. The president of the United States should not be a Muslim, Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson declared during an interview airing Sunday morning. And Islam, a faith professed by some 3 million Americans, is not constitutional, the retired neurosurgeon said. At the end of his \\"Meet the Press\\" segment with NBC News' Chuck Todd, Carson responded to a series of questions related to Donald Trump's failure to correct an audience member at a New Hampshire town hall last Thursday who suggested in his question that President Barack Obama is a Muslim and not an American. Story Continued Below Asked whether his faith or the faith of a president should matter, Carson said, \\"It depends on what that faith is.\\" \\"If it's inconsistent with the values and principles of America, then of course it should matter. But if it fits within the realm of America and consistent with the constitution, no problem,\\" he explained, according to a transcript. Todd then asked Carson, whose rise in the polls has been powered in large part by Christian conservatives, if he believed that \\"Islam is consistent with the Constitution.\\" \\"No, I don't, I do not,\\" he responded, adding, \\"I would not advocate that we put a Muslim in charge of this nation. I absolutely would not agree with that.\\" But for Carson, the matter of voting for a Muslim for Congress \\"is a different story, but it depends on who that Muslim is and what their policies are, just as it depends on what anybody else says, you know.\\" \\"And, you know, if there's somebody who's of any faith, but they say things, and their life has been consistent with things that will elevate this nation and make it possible for everybody to succeed, and bring peace and harmony, then I'm with them,\\" he went on to say. Obama is both a Christian and born in the United States, Carson said, adding that he had \\"no reason to doubt\\" the president. Todd's question referred to long-running \\"birther\\" conspiracy theories in which some claim the president was born in Kenya and is thus not a natural-born citizen. Other versions claim that Obama lost his U.S. citizenship when he lived in Indonesia as a child and may be an Indonesian citizen instead. At Thursday's town hall in New Hampshire, an audience member stood up and asked Trump: \\"We have a problem in this country, it’s called Muslims. Our current president is one. We know he’s not even an American. We have training camps growing where they want to kill us. That’s my question, when can we get rid of them?” “A lot of people are saying that and a lot of people are saying that bad things are happening out there. We’re going to be looking at that and a lot of different things,” Trump responded. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton quickly condemned Trump's actions, while most other 2016 contenders remained silent. On Saturday morning, in a series of tweets, Trump defended himself, writing: “Am I morally obligated to defend the president every time somebody says something bad or controversial about him? I don't think so!” He added, \\"If someone made a nasty or controversial statement about me to the president, do you really think he would come to my rescue? No chance!\\" But it was Trump himself who, in in 2011, led a push for Obama to release his long-form birth certificate. \\"People have birth certificates. He doesn't have a birth certificate. He may have one but there's something on that, maybe religion, maybe it says he is a Muslim. Maybe he doesn't want that. Or he may not have one. But I will tell you this. If he wasn't born in this country it's one of the great scams of all time,\\" Trump told Fox News' Bill O'Reilly in March 2011. At the time, Trump told NBC that he had sent investigators in Hawaii, where Obama was born, and that they \\"cannot believe what they're finding.\\" Weeks later, Obama released his long-form birth certificate, showing that he was born Aug. 4, 1961, at Kapiolani Maternity and Gynecological Hospital in Honolulu. More recently, 29 percent of Americans described Obama's religion as Muslim, Islam or Islamist in a CNN/ORC poll conducted in early September. Among Republicans, that share rises to 43 percent, and among self-identified conservatives, it rises to 45 percent. Among those identifying as tea party supporters, 47 percent said they thought Obama is a Muslim. The same poll also asked respondents to identify Obama's birthplace, with 59 percent overall saying that he was born in Honolulu or Hawaii, and an additional 16 percent who said that the president was born in the U.S., but not in Hawaii. Thirteen percent said that as far as they knew, Obama was born somewhere other than the U.S., whether somewhere in Africa or in Asia. Majorities of all subgroups surveyed said that Obama was born in Hawaii. ||||| What is a summary?","completion":"Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump said on NBC's \\"Meet the Press\\" that there is a \\"very severe problem\\" with some Muslims and declined to say whether he would support a Muslim president of the United States.

The most common metrics include the radius of maximum wind, the radius of 34-knot wind (i.e. gale force), the radius of outermost closed isobar (ROCI), and the radius of vanishing wind. An additional metric is the radius at which the cyclone's relative vorticity field decreases to 1×10−5 s−1.On Earth, tropical cyclones span a large range of sizes, from 100–2,000 kilometres (62–1,243 mi) as measured by the radius of vanishing wind. They are largest on average in the northwest Pacific Ocean basin and smallest in the northeastern Pacific Ocean basin. If the radius of outermost closed isobar is less than two degrees of latitude (222 km (138 mi)), then the cyclone is \\"very small\\" or a \\"midget\\". A radius of 3–6 latitude degrees (333–670 km (207–416 mi)) is considered \\"average sized\\". \\"Very large\\" tropical cyclones have a radius of greater than 8 degrees (888 km (552 mi)). Observations indicate that size is only weakly correlated to variables such as storm intensity (i.e. maximum wind speed), radius of maximum wind, latitude, and maximum potential intensity.Size plays an important role in modulating damage caused by a storm. All else equal, a larger storm will impact a larger area for a longer period of time. Additionally, a larger near-surface wind field can generate higher storm surge due to the combination of longer wind fetch, longer duration, and enhanced wave setup.The upper circulation of strong hurricanes extends into the tropopause of the atmosphere, which at low latitudes is 15,000–18,000 metres (50,000–60,000 ft). Paragraph: A storm is brewing in the northeastern Pacific basin. This storm has resulted in a cyclone. The radius of outermost closed isobar is measured to be 1.5 degrees of latitude.

We need to find the value of 'j' in this problem. 1. We have the equation: 78*j + 5783 = -84*j - 2402 + 85 2. First, let's make the numbers simpler by adding 85 to -2402. We get -2402 + 85 = -2317. So now, our equation looks like this: 78*j + 5783 = -84*j - 2317 3. To find the value of 'j', we'll first move all the 'j' terms to one side of the equation. We'll add 84*j to both sides. So on the left side, we have 78*j + 84*j = 162*j and on the right side, we only have -2317. Our equation now looks like this: 162*j + 5783 = -2317 4. Next, we will move the number 5783 to the other side of the equation. To do this, we will subtract 5783 from both sides. So now our equation is: 162*j = -2317 - 5783 5. Let's subtract the numbers on the right side. -2317 - 5783 = -8100 Our equation is now: 162*j = -8100 6. Finally, to find the value of 'j', we will divide both sides by 162. So we get: j = -8100 / 162 7. Now let's divide -8100 by 162. We get j = -50 So the value of 'j' in this equation is -50."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Based on the context provided, it is clear that the person is seeking higher education, as colleges and universities are institutions dedicated to providing advanced learning opportunities. Here's a brief explanation of why the other options are not suitable answers: - \\"thank god\\": This phrase is an expression of relief or gratitude and does not relate to the primary objective of attending college. - \\"stand upright\\": This option refers to a physical posture and has no direct relevance to the pursuit of higher education. - \\"speak spanish\\": While learning a foreign language may be a part of the college experience for some students, it's not the main reason a person would want to go to college. Attending college encompasses a much broader educational experience than just learning a single language. - \\"unemployment\\": This option refers to the state of being without a job and is not connected to a person's motivation for attending college. In fact, higher education is often pursued to increase one's chances of finding a job or advancing in a chosen career.

Today I want to take it a step further and focus on how to start clean eating on a budget. It is very similar with just a couple of extra steps. Clean eating focuses on fresh ingredients, no processed foods, and eating good foods as close to nature as possible such as: fruits, vegetables, whole grains, cage-free eggs, grass-fed beef and grain-fed poultry, and raw milk (if possible) to your diet. Some of these may seem like a burden when you are on a small food budget, but with the tips below, you can eat clean and stay within your budget. I am sure you will recognize some from the previous post; but read through there is extra information that applies specifically to clean eating. A major component of clean eating is buying fresh produce rather than canned fruits and vegetables. Frozen produce is OK; but, if in-season fruit is available, it is always better to choose that. Buy in bulk, and freeze it yourself. Use Google to help you search for seasonal produce in your area. When you can buy it from a Farmer’s Market, or even directly from the farmers, it will be less expensive. My next choice is SPOUTS Farmer’s Marker, if there is one near you. Those sources will probably be the least expensive. For example: you may be able to buy strawberries, peaches, and nectarines very inexpensively in the summer and find that squash is a better buy in the fall. Always buy extra when the price is right and freeze the leftovers. When you first start reading about clean eating, you may find “experts” expounding the importance of certain superfoods that you should start eating. The reality is – they are nutritious and excellent additions to your diet; but, you don’t have to eat them just start a clean eating. If you cannot afford to add chia seeds of flax seeds to every smoothie or eat a pomegranate each morning, don’t worry about it. Buy the clean foods you can afford and eat those – you will be doing just fine. Question: What field does the author most probably work in? === The answer to the above question is a). sales b). medicine c). Health and nutrition d). not enough information","completion":"Step 1: Identify the main topic discussed in the text. The main topic is clean eating on a budget. Step 2: Identify the elements of clean eating mentioned in the text. The text mentions fresh ingredients, no processed foods, and good foods close to nature. Step 3: Identify any job fields or industries mentioned in the text. The author does not directly mention their job, but it is implied that they are knowledgeable about clean eating, budgeting, and sourcing food. Step 4: Evaluate the possible answer choices. a) Sales: The author does not talk about selling products or services related to clean eating, so this choice is unlikely. b) Medicine: The author talks about clean eating and its benefits, but they do not mention any medical aspects or procedures, so this choice is unlikely. c) Health and nutrition: The author's focus on clean eating, fresh ingredients, and staying within a budget is consistent with someone who works in health and nutrition. This choice is likely. d) Not enough information: While it's possible that the author's field is not explicitly mentioned, their knowledge and focus on clean eating and budgeting suggest that they work in health and nutrition. This choice is less likely. Conclusion: The author most probably works in Health and nutrition (choice c)."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Would \\"This current, caused during each stroke, takes the path of least resistance, which may be ion rich human or animal legs, over poorly conducting earth.\\" be a reasonable answer? Select from: [i] No. [ii] Yes.","completion":"[i] No. The mortality rate for lightning strikes and the statement provided as an answer address two distinct yet related aspects of lightning strike incidents. To provide a comprehensive response, it is necessary to first address the mortality rate, followed by an analysis of the provided statement. The mortality rate for lightning strikes refers to the ratio of lightning strike fatalities to total cases of lightning strike incidents. According to the United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the average global mortality rate for lightning strikes is between 10% and 20%. These rates slightly vary across different regions and are influenced by factors such as access to medical care and the degree of vulnerability associated with the affected population's activities. Now, let's analyze the statement: \\"This current, caused during each stroke, takes the path of least resistance, which may be ion-rich human or animal legs, over poorly conducting earth.\\" This statement focuses on the nature of the current caused by a lightning strike and does not address the mortality rate directly. However, it offers some insight into one of the mechanisms that could contribute to the injuries and fatalities resulting from lightning strikes. Lightning strikes occur when the electrical discharge of a thunderstorm seeks a way to connect the electrical charge between the ground and the clouds. This discharge tends to follow the path of least resistance, which is generally the shortest and most conductive route to the ground available. In the presence of humans or animals, this path may sometimes involve passing through their body, particularly if they provide better electrical conductivity than the ground around them (such as ion-rich legs). When an individual is struck by lightning, the electrical current can cause severe injuries and damage to internal organs, which can lead to fatalities. The specific path of the current through the body, the type and intensity of the lightning strike, and the individual's physical condition are factors that determine the degree of harm caused and the likelihood of survival. In conclusion, while the provided statement does not directly answer the question of lightning strike mortality rates, it does offer insight into the mechanism of lightning strikes and how humans and animals can become part of the current's path. The mortality rate for lightning strikes is estimated to be between 10% and 20% globally, with variations across regions influenced by factors such as access to medical care and the affected population's vulnerability."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The biological function of a flower is to effect reproduction, usually by providing a mechanism for the union of sperm with eggs. Flowers may facilitate outcrossing (fusion of sperm and eggs from different individuals in a population) or allow selfing (fusion of sperm and egg from the same flower). Some flowers produce diaspores without fertilization (parthenocarpy). Flowers contain sporangia and are the site where gametophytes develop. Many flowers have evolved to be attractive to animals, so as to cause them to be vectors for the transfer of pollen. After fertilization, the ovary of the flower develops into fruit containing seeds. - Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just \\"binomial\\"), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus \\"Homo\\" and within this genus to the species \\"Homo sapiens\\". The \\"formal\\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \\"Species Plantarum\\" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book \\"Pinax theatri botanici\\" (English, \\"Illustrated exposition of plants\\") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus. - Amaranthus, collectively known as amaranth, is a cosmopolitan genus of annual or short-lived perennial plants. Some amaranth species are cultivated as leaf vegetables, pseudocereals, and ornamental plants. Most of the species from \\"Amaranthus\\" are summer annual weeds and are commonly referred to as pigweed. Catkin-like cymes of densely packed flowers grow in summer or autumn. Approximately 60 species are recognized, with inflorescences and foliage ranging from purple and red to green or gold. Members of this genus share many characteristics and uses with members of the closely related genus \\"Celosia\\". - Paris (French: ) is the capital and most populous city of France.

All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs. - Australia, officially the Commonwealth of Australia, is a country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent, the island of Tasmania and numerous smaller islands.

In this car, we have a \\"single plate clutch.\\" This is similar to your bike's brakes, it helps control speed. A \\"separate 4-speed gearbox all-silent and all-syncromesh\\" means it has 4 levels or gears to control how fast the car can go. It's called \\"all-silent\\" because it doesn't make much noise when shifting gears, and \\"all-syncromesh\\" makes changing gears really smooth. The \\"centre change lever\\" is like a stick that you can move to change the gears. An \\"open tubular propellor shaft with metal joints\\" is a part that helps the car move forward, and a \\"spiral bevel fully floating back axle\\" is a part at the back of the car that also helps it move. 2. Engine: Now, every toy car needs a power source, right? In our Alvis Speed 25, the power coming from the engine is rated at \\"31.48 tax horsepower\\".

Europe spent these years rebuilding and coming to terms with the vast human cost of the conflict. The economy of the United States became increasingly intertwined with that of Europe. In Germany, the Weimar Republic gave way to episodes of political and economic turmoil, which culminated with the German hyperinflation of 1923 and the failed Beer Hall Putsch of that same year. When Germany could no longer afford war payments, Wall Street invested heavily in European debts to keep the European economy afloat as a large consumer market for American mass-produced goods. By the middle of the decade, economic development soared in Europe, and the Roaring Twenties broke out in Germany, Britain and France, the second half of the decade becoming known as the \\"Golden Twenties\\".

Trump launched a new attack on the Russia probe in the wake of a critical report on the Hillary Clinton email investigation by the inspector general of the Department of Justice. “I did nothing wrong. There was no collusion. There was no obstruction,\\" he said. \\"The IG (inspector general) report yesterday went a long way to show that, and I think that the Mueller investigation has been totally discredited.” But the report in question only dealt with how the FBI handled the Clinton email controversy. It was critical of the man Trump fired as FBI director, James Comey, but rejected the notion of a politically-directed effort aimed at Trump. “This report did not find any evidence of political bias or improper considerations actually impacting the investigation under review,\\" announced current FBI Director Christopher Wray. Democrats also took note of the report. “Anyone who is hoping to use this report to undermine the Mueller probe or prove the existence of a ‘deep state’ conspiracy against President Trump will be sorely disappointed,\\" Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said. During his lengthy encounter with reporters Friday, Trump also defended his recent summit meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. “They are doing so much for us, and now we are well on our way to get denuclearization,\\" he said. \\"And the agreement says there will be total denuclearization. Nobody wants to report that. I got along with him great. We have a great chemistry together.

A:","completion":"Step 1: Analyze the review content for relevance to product quality. The review mentions that the movie is one of the first movies that the reviewer saw when they were young. Additionally, they mention that Thomasina in the movie looks like the reviewer's old cat, Ginger. These statements are mostly personal and subjective experiences and do not provide much information on the actual quality of the product (the DVD). Step 2: Determine the impact of the review on the decision to buy the product. Since the review does not provide much relevant information about the quality, content, or features of the DVD, it neither significantly increases nor decreases the chances of buying the product. However, the nostalgic sentiment in the review might leave a slightly positive impression, indicating that the movie has a lasting effect on the reviewer's memories. Conclusion: While the review does not provide much information on the product quality, the overall impact of the review remains neutral to slightly positive, making it a weak factor in the decision-making process.

Iron the fabric: Once it's clean, we need to iron it. It's like using a hot, flat thing to make all the wrinkles go away so that it's smooth and easy to cut. 5. Lay out the pattern: Now we put the pattern on top of the fabric, making sure everything is in the right place and fits well. We can use weights or pins to keep the pattern in place. 6. Cut the fabric: Following the pattern, we carefully cut the fabric using special scissors. It's like cutting paper, but we have to be extra careful not to make mistakes. 7.

In 1978, 50% of 16-year-olds had got their first driving licence. In 2008, according to the US Transportation Department, it was just 30%. The number of those aged 19 and under with driving licences has also been _ since 1978, when 11, 989, 000 had licence. In 2010, it was 9, 932, 441, or 4.1% of American drivers. In the UK, 683, 273 teenagers have driving licences- just 1.85% of total licence holders, according to Department of Transport figures from September 2010. But the decline in the US may have more to do with tougher tests and the introduction of the new rule in many states, which force drivers aged under 16 to be with licensed drivers of 21 years and older when driving. In recent years, the annual number of journeys being made by American drivers of all ages has declined clearly for the first time ever. Car use began falling in 2007, when average petrol prices almost doubled to 4.12 a gallon, and the economy became worse. But there are signs that it is getting back to normal and American remains a country on wheels. It has a higher number of cars per head of population than any other country in the world. \\"Cars will always be a popular means of transportation in America.

Sentence 1: \\"Conservatives argued that instead, trusted politicians should be elected.\\" Sentence 2: \\"The conservatives argued that elected politicians should instead be trusted.\\" Step 2: Break down the basic components of both sentences. Sentence 1: Subject: Conservatives Verb: argued Object: trusted politicians should be elected Sentence 2: Subject: The conservatives Verb: argued Object: elected politicians should be trusted Step 3: Compare the components for similarities and differences. Both sentences share the same subject (conservatives) and verb (argued). The difference lies in the object of the sentence. Sentence 1 tells us that conservatives argued that trusted politicians should be elected (meaning the politicians should first be trustworthy, and then elected). Sentence 2, however, tells us that the conservatives argued that politicians elected first should then be trusted (meaning politicians should be trusted after they have been elected). Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on the comparison. Although the two sentences might seem similar at a first glance, their meanings are different.

Passage:The main feud heading into Cyber Sunday was between WWE Champion John Cena, World Heavyweight Champion King Booker, and ECW World Champion The Big Show, the top champion of each of the three brands. This feud began on the October 9 edition of Raw, where they came face to face, arguing about who was the most dominant champion in WWE. WWE Chairman Vince McMahon interrupted, and booked a triple threat \\"Champion of Champions\\" match at Cyber Sunday between the three of them. This also gave each show's General Manager an opportunity to choose opponents for each other's champion that night. This resulted in Big Show defeating Jeff Hardy and Booker defeating Rob Van Dam; however, the match between Cena and The Undertaker was interrupted by Booker, Big Show, and The Undertaker's storyline rival, Mr. Kennedy. At the same time, Cena began a minor feud with Kevin Federline. Federline, as the on-screen close friend of Johnny Nitro and Melina's, appeared on Raw to promote his album, \\"Playing With Fire\\". Cena rapped about Federline, but Nitro came out to Federline's defense and was thrown out of the ring by Cena. Cena was then interrupted by his two Cyber Sunday opponents, and McMahon who announced that a championship would be on the line at Cyber Sunday. Cena performed the FU on Federline, after being insulted. The feud between the champions continued on the October 20 edition of SmackDown!, when Big Show and Cena were at ringside during Booker's title defense against Batista. Batista speared Booker onto Big Show, who, in response, assaulted Batista, ending the match via disqualification. Cena then joined the brawl, and SmackDown! General Manager Theodore Long announced a tag team match for the next week. On the next Raw, Cena defeated Nitro after an FU, but was assaulted afterwards by his Cyber Sunday opponents, who turned on each other shortly after to start a brawl between the four to end the show. Batista and Cena were successful in the tag team match, after Big Show abandoned Booker. The next week, on Raw, a preview of Cyber Sunday's interactivity was displayed when fans voted for Cena's opponent for the night, between Big Show, Booker, and Jonathan Coachman. Coachman won in the voting, but was easily defeated by Cena. Solution:","completion":"b"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

You've probably seen mom or dad stop at the gas station to fill up the car, right? It's just like getting a big glass of milk for your car, but instead of milk, cars drink oil to keep going. That oil has a special price that changes from time to time. Sometimes, it's more expensive, and sometimes it's cheaper. Now, imagine if you saw your favorite candy at the store for a very high price one day, and a very low price the next day. That would be pretty strange, wouldn't it? That's what's happening with oil prices. But here’s the funny part - for most people, especially in the U.S, these changes aren’t surprising anymore, just like how you wouldn’t be surprised if you have to go to bed at bedtime! Even if the price goes up a lot, people just say, \\"Oh well, that's how it is.\\" This is what we mean when we say that oil prices have lost their 'shock value'. Shock value is when something surprises or shocks you. The 'Chart of the Day' part in the title talks about a special picture that shows info about these changing oil prices. It's like a storybook, but instead of words, it tells the story using lines, colors and numbers. Sometimes, grown-ups like to look at these charts to understand how prices have changed over time. It's like if we drew a picture everyday of how much ice cream we ate. Over time, we can look back and see some days we had lots of ice cream and some days we had a little. That’s how these charts work! In simple terms, the oil price dance doesn’t wow people anymore. They have gotten used to it, just like how you get used to your big brother's silly faces!

This option is the most logical completion of the news story because it indicates that the Australian point of view is to ensure comprehensive access for all manufacturers and create a diverse relationship with China that goes beyond just resources and energy. It also includes the services sector, which fits with James Packer's interests in tourism and casinos. The other options are either incorrect grammatically (e.g. \\"Australians side\\"), don't fit with the subject of the news story contextually (e.g. \\"Asia side\\"), or are irrelevant to the main message (e.g. \\"CNN side\\" or \\"Cold War side\\")."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie plot title: The Killing Movie plot: Johnny Clay (Sterling Hayden) is a veteran criminal planning one last heist before settling down and marrying Fay (Coleen Gray). He plans to steal 2 million from the money-counting room of a racetrack during a featured race. He assembles a team consisting of a corrupt cop (Ted de Corsia), a betting window teller (Elisha Cook Jr.) to gain access to the backroom, a sharpshooter (Timothy Carey) to shoot the favorite horse during the race to distract the crowd, a wrestler (Kola Kwariani) to provide another distraction by provoking a fight at the track bar, and a track bartender (Joe Sawyer). George Peatty, the teller, tells his wife Sherry (Marie Windsor) about the impending robbery. Sherry is bitter at George for not delivering on the promises of wealth he once made her, so George hopes telling her about the robbery will placate and impress her. Sherry does not believe him at first but, after learning that the robbery is real, enlists her lover Val Cannon (Vince Edwards) to steal the money from George and his associates. The heist is successful, although the sharpshooter is shot and killed by the police. The conspirators gather at the apartment where they are to meet Johnny and divide the money. Before Johnny arrives, Val appears and holds them up. A shootout ensues and a badly wounded George is the sole survivor. He goes home and shoots Sherry before dying. Johnny, on his way to the apartment, sees George staggering in the street and knows that something is wrong. He buys the biggest suitcase he can find to put the money in (and struggles to lock it properly). At the airport Johnny and Fay aren't allowed to take the suitcase along as hand luggage because of its size, and instead must check it in as regular luggage. Johnny reluctantly complies. While waiting to board their plane they watch as the suitcase falls off a cart onto the runway, breaks open, and the loose banknotes are swept away by the backdraft from the plane's propellers. Fay and Johnny leave the airport but are unable to hail a cab before officers...

By Michael Zennie and Associated Press Reporter A 24-year-old pitcher in California as just been signed by the Minnesota Twins and already his story seems ready-made for a Hollywood movie. Brandon Poulson throws 100mph fastballs, he ran a 60-yard dash in 6.6 seconds in his stocking feet and has a 40-inch vertical jump. And before he was discovered by major league scouts, he was splitting his time between pitching for the Healdsburg Prune Packers in Northern California's wine country and driving a front-loader for his dad's company - John's Excavating. 'I played for the Prune Packers summer of 2013, but missed nearly three-fourths of the games because I was busy working,' said Poulson, who didn’t make his high school baseball team as a freshman. Poulson is going into the","completion":"Twins organization with high expectations and a bright future ahead of him. With his remarkable athletic abilities and humble roots, he becomes an inspiration to people not just in the baseball world, but to anyone pursuing a dream. As the season proceeds, Poulson quickly proves his worth to his teammates and coaches. Although he faces challenges and setbacks along the way, his resilience and determination only make him stronger. His family and the Prune Packers community provide unwavering support, and the bond they share keeps him grounded. In a pivotal game during the playoffs, Poulson takes the mound. In the final inning, with two outs and the Twins holding a slim lead, he faces one of the league's best hitters. The anticipation builds as Poulson winds up and delivers his signature 100mph fastball. The hitter, unable to catch up to the blazing pitch, watches it sail by for a strikeout. The crowd erupts, and the Twins are headed to the championship series. The day of the championship game arrives, and Poulson is chosen to start. The game is a nail-biter from beginning to end, with both teams displaying skill and determination. Poulson gets into a groove, mowing down hitters with his explosive fastball and showcasing his full arsenal of pitches. As the game enters the final inning with the Twins in the lead, Poulson feels the pressure mount. He's aware that what started as a long-shot dream is now just three outs away from reality. With everyone on the edge of their seats, Poulson makes quick work of the first two batters. The final hitter is the one who he struck out during the playoffs, seeking redemption. The duel between pitcher and hitter captures the essence of baseball at its best. Poulson reaches deep down within himself and throws a mixture of fastballs and off-speed pitches, resulting in a full count. With the entire stadium on its feet, Poulson takes a deep breath and delivers a pitch that barely grazes the corner of the strike zone - strike three. The crowd goes wild, and the Twins are crowned champions! In the aftermath of their victory, Poulson's story becomes an inspiration for countless people who have faced adversity and believed in themselves.

Q:WASHINGTON — Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton called Republican rival Donald Trump dangerous and unqualified for the presidency in a blistering foreign policy speech Thursday in San Diego, California. \\"He is temperamentally unfit to hold an office that requires knowledge, stability and immense responsibility,\\" Clinton said. \\"This is not someone who should ever have the nuclear codes.\\" Trump “doesn’t understand America, or the world,” she said. \\"It’s not hard to imagine Donald Trump leading us into a war just because somebody got under his very thin skin.\\" In anticipation of the address, Trump attacked his Democratic opponent on Twitter. “Crooked Hillary Clinton, who I would love to call Lyin’ Hillary, is getting ready to totally misrepresent my foreign policy positions,” he tweeted. Clinton emphasized her own experience as first lady, senator and secretary of state, saying she would provide the steady diplomacy the country needs. “National security is the foundation of how we make sure our interests are pursued in the world,” said Louis Goodman, Emeritus Dean of International Relations at American University in an interview with VOA. With polls show terrorism is a major concern among Americans, Clinton targeted Trump's positions on the issue. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, has promised to temporarily block Muslims from crossing U.S. borders. \\"The struggle against radical Islam also takes place in our homeland. There are scores of recent migrants inside our borders charged with terrorism. For every case known to the public, there are dozens more. We must stop importing extremism through senseless immigration policies,\\" Trump said in a foreign policy speech in April. Trump's other anti-terrorism proposals include a pledge to torture and murder the families of suspected terrorists and target Islamic State. \\"I have a simple message for them,\\" Trump said. \\"Their days are numbered.

The sentence clearly identifies the year in question as 2012 and provides a revenue figure for the Carnival industry that year, which is the primary concern of the question. The term \\"amassed\\" gives us an understanding that the reported revenue is the total amount the industry brought in during that time, highlighting that the response is directly answering the question. Furthermore, the phrase \\"Carnival industry chain\\" encapsulates the various aspects and businesses that are involved in organizing, operating, and promoting carnivals, such as rides, games, food concessions, and other related establishments.

In February 1986, the soundtrack album to Pretty in Pink featuring \\"Shellshock\\" was released on A&M Records. An instrumental version of \\"Thieves Like Us\\" and the instrumental \\"Elegia\\" appeared in the film but were not on the soundtrack album. Later that summer, New Order headlined a line-up that included the Smiths, the Fall, and A Certain Ratio during the Festival of the Tenth Summer at Manchester's G-Mex. Brotherhood (1986) divided the two approaches onto separate album sides. The album notably featured \\"Bizarre Love Triangle\\" and \\"Angel Dust\\" (of which a remixed instrumental version is available on the UK \\"True Faith\\" CD video single, under the title \\"Evil Dust\\"), a track which marries a synth break beat with Low-Life-era guitar effects. While New Order toured North America with friends Echo & the Bunnymen, the summer of 1987 saw the release of the compilation Substance, which featured the new single \\"True Faith\\". Substance was an important album in collecting the group's 12-inch singles onto CD for the first time and featured new versions of \\"Temptation\\" and \\"Confusion\\"--referred to as \\"Temptation '87\\" and \\"Confusion '87\\". A second disc featured several of the B-sides from the singles on the first disc, as well as additional A-sides \\"Procession\\" and \\"Murder\\". The single, \\"True Faith\\", with its surreal video, became a hit on MTV and the band's first American top 40 hit. The single's B-side, \\"1963\\"--originally planned on being the A-side until the group's label convinced them to release \\"True Faith\\" instead--would later be released as a single in its own right several years later, with two new versions. In December 1987, the band released a further single, \\"Touched by the Hand of God\\", with a Kathryn Bigelow-directed video parodying glam-metal. The single reached number 20 on the UK Singles Chart and number 1 in the UK Independent Singles chart, but would not appear on an album until the 1994 compilation The Best of New Order.

He is ushered through the initial check-in where a small device is forcibly inserted down his throat: an \\"intestinator\\", which causes extreme abdominal pain when a punishment order is issued.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Write a summary based on this article: Global average temperatures are higher now than they have ever been since modern records began. However, after a period of rapid temperature increases during the 1980s and 1990s there has been a significant slow-down since the turn of the century, leading some sceptics to claim that global warming has stopped. A scientific assessment of the planet’s heat balance has found that the most likely explanation for the recent hiatus in global warming is the continual absorption of thermal energy by the huge “heat sink” of the deep ocean many hundreds of metres below the sea surface, according to scientists from the Met Office. Senior climate scientists said that they had always expected periods when the rate of increase in temperatures would level off for a few years and emphasised that the last decade was still warmer than any previous decade, with 12 of the 14 hottest years on record occurring since 2000. Professor Rowan Sutton, a climate scientist at Reading University, said the temperatures have levelled off in the past, the latest example being in the 1940s and 1950s when sulphate pollutants from the post-war boom in industrial production may have acted as a shield against incoming solar radiation. “Some people call it a slow-down, some call it a hiatus, some people call it a pause. The global average surface temperature has not increased substantially over the last 10 to 15 years,” Professor Sutton said. “Climate scientists absolutely expect variations in the rate at which surface temperature will rise….but that is not to say we understand all the details of the last 10 to 15 years,” Professor Sutton said. The problem for the Met Office is to explain why the rate of increase in global temperatures has declined in recent years while concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere have continued to accelerate. Sceptics claim that this shows there is not a strong link between the two, whereas climate scientists insist that rising carbon dioxide concentrations are largely responsible for the rise in global temperatures. Professor Stephen Belcher, head of the Met Office Hadley Centre, said that a pause in the rate of increase in global temperatures lasting this long is unusual but not exceptional, with similar pauses of about 10 years expected on average twice every century. The most likely explanation for the current pause is that excess heat trapped by carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is being transferred from the atmosphere to the oceans where it is being transported down to deeper layers that cannot be monitored by satellites, Professor Belcher said. “It looks like the Earth is continuing to accumulate energy but it looks like it is being re-arranged and hidden from view,” he said. However, measurements from hundreds of ocean floats released over the last decade, which descend and drift to depths of up to 2,000 metres, show that huge amounts of heat from the sea surface is now being transferred to the deep ocean, with unknown consequences for the environment, the scientists said. “In summary, observations of ocean heat content and of sea-level rise suggest that the Earth system has continued to absorb heat energy over the past 15 years, and that this additional heat has been absorbed in the ocean,” says the Met Office report. The pause, however, is unlikely to change the predictions over the future course of global warming. Temperature increases expected by 2015 will only be delayed by a further five or ten years, the scientists said. Average surface temperatures are still on course to increase by 2C this century, with further rises expected by the end of the century if nothing is done to curb carbon dioxide emissions, they said. It is not possible to account for the recent lack of surface warming solely by looking at the difference between amount of heat being received from the Sun and the amount of thermal energy being lost from the planet – calculations show that extra heat continues to be absorbed by the Earth at a rate of 0.6 Watts per square metre, equivalent to about 300bn 1KW electric heaters or 150bn 2KW kettles distributed across the planet. “Observations of ocean heat content and of sea-level rise suggest that the additional heat from the continued rise in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations has been absorbed in the ocean and has not been manifest as a rise in surface temperature,” the Met Office says in one of its three reports into the global warming pause. “Radiated forcing by greenhouse gases has continued unabated; that heat is being held in the system but is not manifest as a rise in global mean surface temperature. Observations of ocean heat content and of sea-level rise suggest that this additional heat has been absorbed by the ocean,” it says. ||||| The high-pressure dome causing the East Coast heat wave can be seen from space. The heat wave gripping much of the East Coast and Midwest has people wondering: Could this scorching weather have any link to global warming? Experts say it's hard to connect any single event with long-term trends. Still, heat waves \\"are expected to happen more often in the future,\\" said Jake Crouch, a scientist at the National Climatic Data Center. \\"As the average temperature increases, these types of events become more frequent.\\" The current heat wave is somewhat unusual in that it is driven by a high-pressure system, also known as a Bermuda high, that has drifted farther west than usual, Crouch said. This mass of hot air is parked over the Great Lakes and eastern United States, rather than staying in its typical spot over the Southeast and Atlantic Ocean, he said. But it's too early to say if this location change is related to a warmer climate, he added. This week's East Coast heat wave differs from those of last summer, which were driven by a persistent mass of hot air called a heat dome that stayed in place for weeks over much of the central United States, Crouch said. Last year's heat waves were also worsened by drought. Soil moisture can dissipate some heat as it takes up energy and evaporates; without water, it's easier for temperatures to climb, he added. However, a combination of rain and heat leads to high humidity, which is being seen in many places currently. And humidity can lead to higher nighttime temperatures, which are a major factor in deaths from heat, said Jeff Weber, a scientist with the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo. Hot nights don't allow people to cool down and get some relief, Weber said. As the Earth continues to warm, heat waves are tending to last longer, Weber told LiveScience. The jet stream, which generally ferries weather patterns from west to east across North America, is driven by a difference in temperature between the cold Arctic and warm equator. Polar regions are heating faster than the equator is, which is leading to a weaker jet stream, Weber said. That means weather systems, like high-pressure systems with high temperatures, tend to stay in place longer, he added. Email Douglas Main or follow him on Twitter or Google+.

Some people thought that global warming stopped because the temperatures did not increase as fast as before. But, scientists have found that the deep parts of the ocean are absorbing a lot of the heat, which is why the temperatures at the surface are not increasing as fast. Scientists still expect the Earth's temperature to keep rising in the future, and it is important to find ways to reduce the heat to protect the Earth and the living things on it."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Cambridge, Massachusetts (CNN) -- Opponents of an Islamic community center and mosque planned to be built near ground zero say it would desecrate hallowed ground. But suspicion has greeted proposed mosque projects in places less hallowed than ground zero -- in Murfreesboro, Tennessee; Sheboygan, Wisconsin; Temecula, California; and elsewhere. This suggests that opposition to mosques is not driven only by sensitivity to the memory of terrorism victims, but also by a growing unease toward Islam, fueled by security fears. Opposition to Islamic centers and mosques in the United States shows remarkable similarities to anti-Islamic movements in Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands, where people also have sought to prohibit new mosques.

First, since there are 'o' terms on both sides, you'll need to get all terms involving 'o' on one side of the equation. You can do this by subtracting '6o' from both sides of the equation. The choice to subtract '6o' is made in order to keep a positive coefficient of 'o', but you can also opt to subtract '14o', which would give you a negative coefficient. So, it becomes: 14o - 6o = 6o - 6o - 8, which simplifies to: 8o = -8. Next, to solve for 'o', we need to get 'o' on its own on one side of the equation. We can do this by dividing every term in the equation by the coefficient of 'o' which in this case is '8'. This gives us: 8o / 8 = -8 / 8, which simplifies to : o = -1.

What is the best way to: How can I flatten ties so they are easier to work with?","completion":"The best way to flatten ties so they are easier to work with involves a few essential steps. Here's a step-by-step process and justification for each step: 1. Clean the tie (if necessary): Ensure the tie is clean before attempting to flatten it. If it's dirty or stained, consider hand-washing it gently with cool water and a mild detergent, then rinse thoroughly. This will prevent any dirt or stains from being embedded into the fabric during the flattening process. 2. Air dry the tie: After cleaning the tie, let it air dry by hanging it from the narrow end or laying it flat on a clean, dry towel. Avoid wringing or twisting it, as this can cause damage to the fabric and result in wrinkles that are hard to remove. Air drying ensures that the tie retains its shape and prevents any damage caused by the use of harsh heat. 3. Prepare the ironing board and iron: Set up your ironing board in a well-lit area and plug in your iron. Adjust the temperature setting on the iron according to the fabric composition of the tie (check the care label for recommendations). The main goal is to have a smooth surface to iron on, and a well-suited heat level for the tie's material. 4. Use a pressing cloth: To protect the tie's fabric from direct heat, place a thin, clean, dry, white (color-free) cloth between the tie and the iron. This will diffuse the heat and protect the tie's delicate fibers from being scorched or damaged. 5. Start ironing the tie's backside: Begin by carefully ironing the backside (the side that doesn't show when worn) of the tie, starting at the narrow end and working your way towards the wider end. Use gentle, sweeping motions, and avoid pressing down too hard as that can damage the fabric and its structure. 6. Iron the front side: After ironing the backside, gently flip the tie over and iron the front side using the same gentle, sweeping motions. Pay particular attention to the edges, ensuring you iron out every crease or wrinkle. 7. Store the tie correctly: Proper storage is crucial to maintain the flattened and wrinkle-free appearance of your tie. Roll the tie up by starting from the narrow end and working your way towards the wider end, making sure the front side remains outwards. Alternatively, you can hang the tie on a tie rack or place it carefully in a drawer, away from humidity and direct sunlight. By following these steps, your tie will be flattened, wrinkle-free, and easier to work with."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Q:I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the full name of the Kinks member that released solo work in the 1980's? ? Following the termination of their contract with RCA, the Kinks signed with Arista Records in 1976. With the encouragement of Arista's management they stripped back down to a five-man core group and were reborn as an arena rock band. John Dalton left the band before finishing the sessions for the debut Arista album. Andy Pyle was brought in to complete the sessions and to play on the subsequent tour. Sleepwalker, released in 1977, marked a return to success for the group as it peaked at number 21 on the Billboard chart. After its release and the recording of the follow-up, Misfits, Andy Pyle and keyboardist John Gosling left the group to work together on a separate project. Dalton returned to complete the tour and ex–Pretty Things keyboardist Gordon John Edwards joined the band. In May 1978, Misfits, the Kinks' second Arista album, was released. It included the US Top 40 hit \\"A Rock 'n' Roll Fantasy\\", which helped make the record another success for the band. The non-album single \\"Father Christmas\\" has remained a popular track. Driven by session drummer Henry Spinetti's drumming and Dave Davies' heavy guitar the song \\"Father Christmas\\" has become a classic seasonal favorite on mainstream radio. Dalton left the band permanently at the end of their UK tour, and Gordon John Edwards followed. Ex-Argent bassist Jim Rodford joined the band before the recording of Low Budget, on which Ray Davies played the keyboard sections. Keyboardist Ian Gibbons was recruited for the subsequent tour, and became a permanent member of the group. Despite the personnel changes, the popularity of the band's records and live shows continued to grow. Beginning in the late 1970s, bands such as the Jam (\\"David Watts\\"), the Pretenders (\\"Stop Your Sobbing\\", \\"I Go to Sleep\\") and the Knack (\\"The Hard Way\\") recorded covers of Kinks songs, which helped bring attention to the group's new releases.

Horas antes, Salas había sido declarado muerto cerebral por los médicos de la clínica Los Fundadores, sitio donde fue ingresado al mediodía del miércoles (8) tras recibir el impacto de un elemento contundente que se alojó en su cerebro y que falta por determinar. Los médicos, que nunca se nunca se atrevieron a hacer pronósticos alentadores, declararon la mañana del jueves (9) que el joven había sufrido grave deterioro neurológico e inestabilidad hemodinámica, condiciones que aumentaban el temor de que Óscar Leonardo presentara daño cerebral severo e irreversible. El hecho, que se presentó durante una protesta estudiantil en rechazo del recién firmado Tratado de Libre Comercio y con ocasión de la celebración del Día Internacional de la Mujer, ocurrió alrededor de las 11.00 (16.00 UTC) en la Carrera 30 con Calle 45, cuando el joven de 20 años, estudiante de 4o. semestre de lingüística de la Universidad Distrital Francisco José de Caldas, otra universidad pública, acompañaba a su hermano a observar las protestas en la Universidad Nacional. El general Luis Alberto Gómez Heredia, en declaraciones sobre lo sucedido a Caracol Radio el jueves, señaló que la solicitud de presencia de los antimotines fue realizada a las 10:30 (15:30 UTC) del miércoles por las directivas de la Universidad Nacional y agregó que pedirá una investigación ante la Procuraduría y la Justicia Penal Militar para determinar la responsabilidad de la fuerza pública ante las graves denuncias que la acusan como responsable del hecho. Salas formaba parte del Polo Joven, organización adscrita al partido izquierdista Polo Democrático Alternativo (PDA). Samuel Moreno Rojas, presidente del PDA, dijo en un comunicado: \\"esperamos que la situación se aclare a la mayor brevedad posible y que los responsables paguen por la muerte de un muchacho de 20 años que apenas estaba empezando a vivir y quien era una promesa para el futuro de nuestro país\\". Protestas mucho más pacíficas, ocurridas en noviembre pasado debido a la aprobación de una reforma interna, desencadenaron en bloqueos y en el cierre temporal de la sede Bogotá de la Universidad, que debió ponerse al día entre enero y febrero, cuando finalizó el segundo semestre de 2005 -que debía acabar en diciembre-. Este lunes (6), la Universidad inició las actividades del primer semestre de 2006. Como consecuencia de lo sucedido y por las elecciones legislativas de este domingo, las directivas decidieron no realizar actividades académicas el viernes y el sábado (11). Al mediodía del viernes, algunos jóvenes organizaron una marcha en homenaje a Salas, en la que se presentaron algunos disturbios.

The remainder of the movie portrays the annunciation (conception) and birth of Jesus Christ to explain why King Herod the Great (CiarÃ¡n Hinds) ordered the murder. The film then goes back one year before the massacre, to Jerusalem where Zachariah is a rabbi and making an offering, when he gets told by the Archangel Gabriel that his wife will bear a son by a vision. He states that he is too old, and is told by Gabriel that he will be unable to speak until the boy is born. It then goes to the town of Nazareth, where a teenaged girl named Mary (Keisha Castle-Hughes) is farming, and soldiers come to collect taxes, one man, who is unable to pay, has a third of his land seized and his daughter pressed into debt slavery to pay his debt. Mary is then, betrothed to marry Joseph of Judaea (Oscar Isaac), is visited by the Angel Gabriel and told that she will become pregnant with God's son, whom she is to name \\"Jesus\\". He then tells that her God has blessed her cousin Elizabeth (Shohreh Aghdashloo) with a child despite her old age. Mary asks her parents and Joseph could she visit with Elizabeth before the harvest, where she witnesses the birth of John the Baptist to Elizabeth and her husband the priest Zachariah (Stanley Townsend), who regains his speech after he refused to believe the Angel Gabriel's news that he would have a son. Mary returns from the visit pregnant, to the shock of Joseph and her parents, who fear that Joseph will accuse her of fornication, a sin punishable with death by stoning according to the Mosaic Law. At first Joseph does not believe Mary's explanation that she was visited by the angel Gabriel, but decides not to accuse her. Although he is still shocked and angry, Joseph is later visited in a dream by the Angel Gabriel, who tells him of God's plan for Mary's son. Joseph then believes Mary, and is ashamed for his earlier doubts. Meanwhile, Caesar Augustus, the Roman emperor, has demanded that every man and his...

Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","completion":"Step 1: Analyze the premise Premise: Even the soul may be brought over when enough masters of magic work together and you were our greatest conjuration. In the premise, it is stated that if there is a sufficient number of masters of magic working together, they can bring over a soul. Furthermore, the addressee is considered the greatest conjuration. Step 2: Analyze the hypothesis Hypothesis: It can be done with enough masters of magic. The hypothesis is similar to the first part of the premise, stating that the task (presumably referring to bringing over a soul) can be done if there are enough masters of magic involved. Step 3: Compare the Premise and Hypothesis The hypothesis aligns with the first part of the premise, which states that when enough masters of magic work together, a soul can be brought over. Step 4: Determine if the premise supports the hypothesis Since the hypothesis directly correlates with the first part of the premise, it can be concluded that if the premise is true, then the hypothesis is also true. Both premise and hypothesis have the same underlying idea: enough masters of magic working together can achieve the task (bringing over a soul).

He pulled a gun from his backpack after being asked to show his identity papers and was killed in the ensuing shootout, ANSA reported. A police officer was injured. ANSA said various sources in Milan and Rome confirmed that the dead man was Amri, who German authorities believe drove the truck that plowed into the Christmas market Monday. Citing Milan anti-terrorism police, ANSA said authorities positively identified Amri from his physical appearance and fingerprints. ||||| MILAN (Reuters) - Italian police shot dead the man believed responsible for this week’s Berlin Christmas market truck attack, killing him after he pulled a gun on them during a routine check in the early hours of Friday. The suspect - 24-year-old Tunisian Anis Amri - traveled to Italy from Germany via France, taking advantage of Europe’s open-border Schengen pact to cross the continent undetected. As anger grew over the fact that Amri had escaped expulsion twice in 18 months thanks to bureaucratic loopholes, euroskeptic parties called for the reintroduction of border controls, while Germany said deportations had to be made easier. Amri is suspected of ploughing a truck through a festive Berlin market on Monday, killing 12 people. In a video released on Friday after his death, he is seen pledging his allegiance to militant group Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. “I call on my Muslim brothers everywhere... Those in Europe, kill the crusader pigs, each person to their own ability,” he says in the video posted on Islamic State’s Amaq news agency. Amri had arrived in Milan’s main railway station from France at 1.00 a.m. (2000 EDT) and then traveled to the working class suburb of Sesto San Giovanni, where two young policemen approached him because he looked suspicious idling on a street. Milan police chief Antonio De Iesu told a news conference his men had no idea that they might be dealing with Amri. “They had no perception that it could be him, otherwise they would have been much more cautious,” De Iesu said. “We had no intelligence that he could be in Milan.” He failed to produce any identification so the police requested he empty his pockets and his small backpack. He pulled a loaded gun from his bag and shot at one of the men, lightly wounding him in the shoulder. Amri then hid behind a nearby car but the other police officer managed to shoot him once or twice, killing him on the spot, De Iesu said. Amri was identified by his fingerprints. ITALIAN JAIL De Iesu said that besides the gun, the suspect had been carrying a small pocket knife. He also had a few hundred euros on him but no cell phone and very few other belongings. Amri once spent four years in jail in Italy and police were trying to work out if he knew someone in Sesto, which is home to a sizeable Muslim community. “He could have carried out other attacks. He was a loose cannon,” De Iesu said. Islamic State had previously claimed responsibility for the Berlin killings and on Friday it acknowledged the death of the man it referred to as “the executor of the Berlin attacks.” Leading euroskeptics were quick to blame the Schengen open borders pact for allowing the suspect to travel so easily. “This escapade in at least two or three countries is symptomatic of the total security catastrophe that is the Schengen agreement,” said Marine Le Pen, who leads France’s far-right National Front party and is running for president. Beppe Grillo, the founder of the 5-Star Movement, Italy’s main opposition party, said Schengen was allowing militants to cross Europe with impunity and had to be re-thought. He also said all illegal migrants had to be expelled from the country. The body of Anis Amri, the suspect in the Berlin Christmas market truck attack, is seen covered with a thermal blanket next to Italian officers in a suburb of the northern Italian city of Milan, Italy December 23, 2016. REUTERS/Stringer Chancellor Angela Merkel, under increasing pressure inside Germany to take a much tougher line on immigration after opening the country’s borders to waves of refugees in 2015, said the Berlin attack raised many questions and promised measures would be taken to improve security. Amri originally come to Europe in 2011, reaching the Italian island of Lampedusa by boat. He told authorities he was a minor, though documents now indicate he was not, and he was transferred to Catania, Sicily, where he was enrolled in school. Just months later he was arrested by police after he attempted to set fire to the school, a senior police source said. He was later convicted of vandalism, threats, and theft. He spent almost four years in Italian prisons before being ordered out of the country after Tunisia refused to accept him back in 2015 because he had no identification papers linking him to the north African country. He moved to Germany and applied for asylum there, but this was rejected after he was identified by security agencies as a potential threat. Once again he could not be deported because of a lack of I.D. Merkel said on Friday she had told Tunisian President Beji Caid Essebsi during a phone conversation that her government wanted to speed up deportation of failed asylum seekers. The attack, which echoed one in Nice in July that killed more than 80 people, has put Europe on high alert over the Christmas period. Early on Friday, German special forces arrested two men suspected of planning an attack on a shopping mall in the western city of Oberhausen. The men - two brothers from Kosovo, aged 28 and 31 - were arrested in the city of Duisburg on information from security sources, police said. A police spokesman said there was no link with the Amri case.

Italy's interior minister, Marco Minniti, assured that after all necessary checks were conducted, it is beyond doubt that the dead man is Amri, who German authorities believe drove the truck into the market, resulting in the death of 12 people. The incident took place during a routine police check in Milan's Sesto San Giovanni neighborhood when Amri pulled a gun from his backpack after being asked to show his identity papers. This led to a shootout wherein a police officer was injured and Amri was killed. The officer's condition is not life-threatening. Amri, a 24-year-old Tunisian, allegedly took advantage of Europe’s open-border Schengen pact to travel from Germany via France to Italy. After his death, he was seen in a video pledging his allegiance to Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and encouraging Muslims to kill \\"crusader pigs\\". His death was also acknowledged by the Islamic State, referring to him as “the executor of the Berlin attacks.” Amri had spent four years in jail in Italy before moving to Germany and applying for asylum, which was rejected due to him being identified as a potential threat. However, he couldn't be deported due to lack of identification. Germany is now in talks with Tunisia about speeding up the deportation of failed asylum seekers. This incident put Europe in high alert over the Christmas season. On the same day, German special forces arrested two men suspected of planning an attack on a shopping mall.

Write some highlights for the following article: There is a real danger of Sergio Aguero becoming the Premier League’s greatest striker of all-time if he manages to maintain a freak minutes-per-goal record which even tops Thierry Henry. The Manchester City man scored the only goal in Sunday’s derby win against rivals United – meaning he now notches once every 109 minutes. It was Aguero’s 62nd in the league for City – and 10th this season – and puts him ahead of Henry, Ruud van Nistelrooy and Alan Shearer. Manchester City striker Sergio Aguero has netted 62 Premier League goals in 6783 minutes in England. Sergio Aguero converts Gael Clichy's low cross from the left to put Manchester City 1-0 ahead in the derby. Aguero (second from left) is mobbed by his team-mates after giving the hosts the lead against Man United. Thierry Henry is widely-regarded as one of the best strikers to have ever graced the Premier League. Not only that, the 26-year-old is comfortably in front of every other frontman to have lit up the top flight since 1992. Henry – Arsenal’s main man for eight years – netted 175 times in 237 Premier League games. Widely-regarded as a revolutionary in the modern era, Henry’s capability of scoring 20-a-season in double-quick time put him on a pedestal as the best there had been. Even superior to Shearer, who ended his career with more, 260, but took longer in between strikes to find the net. Van Nistelrooy’s trailblazing four campaigns at Manchester United – ignoring the injury-ravaged first – garnered 95 goals at a rate of one every 128 minutes. Robin van Persie’s strike rate is healthy at 137 minutes per goal, while the year spent in England by Samuel Eto’o had proved profitable – his 12 goals coming in 1609 minutes. Manchester United skipper Wayne Rooney, on the other hand, has taken 168 minutes for each of his 176 in the Premier League. That isn’t a record to be sniffed at. It comes in at better than a goal every other game if purely using minutes. Aguero’s 109 minutes for every strike – which is half-an-hour more impressive than Luis Suarez and Edin Dzeko – makes him the most lethal marksman to have graced English football. Henry comfortably finishes past Bolton Wanderers goalkeeper Jussi Jaaskelainen in an FA Cup tie. Aguero has a better minutes-per-goal ratio than ex-Liverpool talisman Luis Suarez (celebrating at Norwich) Alan Shearer's goals were crucial in Blackburn winning the 1995 Premier League title (Chris Sutton right) Detractors may point to the City striker’s injury record – he always struggles to get through a full campaign without tweaking something – as reason enough to suggest he can never be named No 1. But even last year, when Aguero spent two months on the sidelines, he was up there with Suarez and Daniel Sturridge. His manager Manuel Pellegrini said last December that this season’s top scorer was a better player than the Uruguayan. ‘Suarez is a very important striker, but I think Sergio participates more in the game,’ Pellegrini claimed. ‘He has always been a top player and he has always scored goals, but I think at this moment, he has added working for the team without the ball, which is also important for him.’ Shearer scored 260 Premier League goals, most marked with his trademark celebration. The bustling centre forward often notched from the penalty spot but got plenty from open play. Wayne Rooney is in the top 25 but his record is worse than the likes of Robin van Persie and Javier Hernandez. The Chilean certainly isn’t wrong – Aguero contributes so much more – but it is for his goalscoring that he will be remembered most fondly for. There was never any danger of Gael Clichy’s centre not ending up nestled beyond David de Gea at the Etihad Stadium this weekend. It is that sort of clinical finishing that sets him apart. He rarely needs more than one chance. While Aguero offers much more across the width of a pitch and in behind defenders, there are a number of players who have merely relied on their prowess in front of goal to retain a spot in the upper echelons of this all-time Premier League list. Javier Hernandez, now at Real Madrid, was renowned for doing very little in United games before a ball broke inside the opposition penalty area, while Adam Le Fondre – whose record is only topped by Henry and Aguero – has forever been an impact substitute. Ivan Klasnic's goalscoring record while at Bolton puts him among the Premier League's elite. Tony Yeboah (pictured scoring for Leeds against Liverpool in 1995) scored picture-book goals. Reading used Adam Le Fondre as a super sub - but his minutes-per-goal ratio was exemplary. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer often saved Manchester United late on in games after being called from the bench. Shearer was chief penalty taker wherever he played, while Ivan Klasnic’s 20 Bolton goals tended to come in gluts (and often from the bench) before Owen Coyle sent him packing. Unsurprisingly, both Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Michael Owen feature, although their records of a goal every 150 minutes might have been better if the pair didn’t spend so much time coming back from injuries. Derby’s Branko Strupar makes the list, but his four years at Pride Park from 1999 actually only brought about 15 goals, with Tony Yeboah’s record slightly more impressive. Of the current crop to surprise, Andre Schurrle and Wilfried Bony both make the top 25. Whether Aguero’s record can be beaten remains to be seen, but it looks doubtful. Highlights:","completion":"Sergio Aguero, a Manchester City soccer player, might become the best striker in the Premier League because he scores goals very quickly! He scores a goal every 109 minutes, which is faster than some other famous players like Thierry Henry and Alan Shearer. People remember Aguero for being really good at scoring goals and helping his team win games. Some people think he might not be the best, because he sometimes gets hurt and can't play the whole season, but he always comes back and keeps scoring goals quickly."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Having read the above passage, choose the right answer to the following question (choices are more or less ): Henry noticed that his piece of cake was lighter than his piece of butter. The cake was more or less dense? The answer to this question is:","completion":"The answer to this question is that the cake was less dense. To better understand why the cake was less dense, let's first analyze the information provided in the question and explore the concepts of density and heaviness (mass) of substances. Density is defined as the mass per unit volume of a substance. The formula for density is: Density = Mass / Volume When comparing two substances of the same volume, the one with a higher mass (the heavier substance) will have a greater density. The passage states, \\"A given volume of a denser substance is heavier than the same volume of a less dense substance.\\" Now, let's examine the scenario involving Henry's pieces of cake and butter. Both items have the same volume, but the piece of cake is lighter (has a lower mass) than the piece of butter. Using the concept of density, we can deduce that since the mass of the cake is lower than the mass of the butter for the same volume, the density of the cake must also be lower compared to butter's density. Therefore, the cake is less dense than the butter."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Given the question: Ironically, J. Paul Getty never saw the Getty Villa. He died two years after his museum opened to the public in January 1974 in a new building modeled on an ancient Roman luxury home. It was not until after Getty’s death in June 1976 that he returned from his estate in England to his “ranch” on the Pacific Coast: he is buried there at the edge of the property on a private plot overlooking the ocean, alongside his eldest and youngest sons, George and Timothy, both of whom predeceased him. Following a renovation and reinstallation of the galleries, the Getty Villa opens a new chapter in its history. Although Getty never set eyes on his creation, the story of how he built the Villa and assembled his collection pervades the galleries even today. A suite of revamped rooms—Galleries 105 to 108—share this history. Featuring ancient works of art Getty bought himself along with archival documents, the new displays place the objects in their cultural contexts and shed light on Getty’s personal relationship to his museum and final resting place. From a Ranch House to an Ancient Villa Getty bought the 64-acre ranch—once part of the Rancho Boca de Santa Monica, an early-nineteenth-century 6,656-acre Mexican land grant—just after the end of World War II, intending it as a weekend retreat where his fifth wife Theodora (“Teddy”) could ride horses and he could display his growing art collection. He knew the area well, for he already owned a small house on the beach in nearby Santa Monica, just steps from the sprawling complex his friend and rival collector William Randolph Hearst had built for the actress Marion Davies. (The Davies estate is now the Annenberg Community Beach House, while Getty’s beach house has been replaced by a large modern condo complex, 270 Palisades Beach Road.)

The 57-year-old Diaz-Canel, the only candidate for the job, won a five-year term, according to state media. The move was not expected to usher in drastic change. Upon being sworn in Thursday, Diaz-Canel promised to continue the Castros' socialist revolution. \\"The mandate given by the people to this house is to give continuity to the Cuban revolution in a crucial historic moment,\\" Diaz-Canel said. Diaz-Canel, a former first vice president, appears to be socially liberal and is considered an acceptable successor to the retiring elderly leaders who fought in the revolution. He succeeds 86-year-old Raul Castro, who is resigning after 10 years in office. Raul Castro's late brother, Fidel, served as prime minister and president after the armed Cuban Revolution in 1959 until he became ill in 2006. While the leadership transition is elevating younger leaders, Raul Castro and other older revolutionaries are expected to retain their power, due to their hold on the Communist Party.

The committee pushed for rapid development of nuclear weapons using gaseous-diffusion as their isotope separation device. Once he returned to the United States, he was able to brief Vannevar Bush, the director of the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD), concerning the details discussed during the meeting.In August 1941, Mark Oliphant, the director of the physics department at the University of Birmingham and an original member of the MAUD Committee, was sent to the US to assist the NDRC on radar. During his visit he met with William D. Coolidge. Coolidge was shocked when Oliphant informed him that the British had predicted that only ten kilograms of uranium-235 would be sufficient to supply a chain reaction effected by fast moving neutrons. While in America, Oliphant discovered that the chairman of the OSRD S-1 Section, Lyman Briggs, had locked away the MAUD reports transferred from Britain entailing the initial discoveries and had not informed the S-1 Committee members of all its findings.Oliphant took the initiative himself to enlighten the scientific community in the U.S. of the recent ground breaking discoveries the MAUD Committee had just exposed.

Washington (CNN) -- When President Obama threw out the first pitch at the Washington Nationals' season opener on Monday, he kicked off not only a new baseball season but also a new round of fundraisers at Nationals Park. Though Obama wasn't raising any cash himself on game day, his appearance was the backdrop for at least one ballpark fundraiser Monday, the first of what Nationals President Stan Kasten hopes will be many political events held at the stadium this season. Since Nationals Park first opened in March 2008, Kasten has actively encouraged political operatives of all ideological stripes to hold their fundraisers and receptions at the ballpark, as opposed to more conventional venues such as restaurants or hotel ballrooms. Although holding fundraisers at baseball games is not new, the","completion":"reemergence of it has sparked some controversy. Critics argue that the blending of sports and politics might potentially taint the perceived neutrality of the game. But supporters counterargue that these events systematize opportunities for bipartisan conversations to occur at a local societal level, thus promoting a more engaged democracy. Furthermore, they provide an alternative casual and relaxed environment that could foster more candid and productive discussions compared to traditional venues. The future of political fundraisers at baseball festivals, therefore, remains uncertain as these debates continue. Here, I'm giving a logical continuation to the passage. I introduced two perspectives, one considering the blending of sports and politics as problematic and the other viewing it as an alternative method to stimulate constructive political conversations.

Possible answers: * no. * yes.","completion":"No, these two statements do not mean the same thing, and they indicate different origins and influences on dumplings within these two different cultures. The first sentence, \\"Indonesian dumplings were influenced and brought to Indonesia by Chinese immigrants,\\" implies that dumplings originally existed in China. Chinese immigrants then brought this dumpling concept to Indonesia, which suggests that the Indonesian dumplings have Chinese roots. The dumplings' characteristics in Indonesia might have been adapted and changed based on the local cuisine and preferences, but their essential idea, that is, stuffing wrapped in dough, came from China. On the other hand, the second sentence, \\"Chinese dumplings were influenced and brought by Indonesian immigrants to Indonesia,\\" indicates a completely different scenario. This sentence suggests that dumplings originally came from Indonesia and were brought to China by Indonesian immigrants. This implies that the Chinese dumplings were influenced or evolved from these original Indonesian dumplings, not the other way around. Therefore, while both sentences talk about the influence and transference of dumpling culture, they attribute the origin of this cuisine to different countries. This influences the nature of the dumplings in each country, including their shape, fillings, cooking methods, and serving methods, all of which reflect different historical and cultural ties. This makes the respective dumplings in each country unique and inherent to their own culinary tradition, despite having ties to each other due to migration and cultural exchange."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the above question based on the context below: From 1916, Nielsen taught at the Royal Academy where he became director in 1931, shortly before his death. He also had private students in his earlier days in order to supplement his income. As a result of his teaching, Nielsen has exerted considerable influence on classical music in Denmark. Among his most successful pupils were the composers Thorvald Aagaard, remembered in particular for his songs, Harald Agersnap, both a conductor and orchestral composer, and Jørgen Bentzon who composed choral and chamber music mainly for his folk music school (Københavns Folkemusikskole). Among his other students were the musicologist Knud Jeppesen, the pianist Herman Koppel, the academy professor and symphony composer Poul Schierbeck, the organist Emilius Bangert who played at Roskilde Cathedral, and Nancy Dalberg, one of Nielsen's private students who helped with the orchestration of Aladdin. Nielsen also instructed the conductor and choirmaster Mogens Wöldike, remembered for his interpretations of Baroque music, and Rudolph Simonsen, the pianist and composer who became director of the Academy after Nielsen's death.The Carl Nielsen Society maintains a listing of performances of Nielsen's works, classified by region (Denmark, Scandinavia, Europe apart from Scandinavia and outside Europe) which demonstrates that his music is regularly performed throughout the world. The concerti and symphonies feature frequently in these listings. The Carl Nielsen International Competition commenced in the 1970s under the auspices of the Odense Symphony Orchestra. A four-yearly violin competition has been held there since 1980. Flute and clarinet competitions were later added, but these have now been discontinued.

Born in Cherryvale, Kansas, Louise Brooks was the daughter of Leonard Porter Brooks, a lawyer, who was usually too busy with his practice to discipline his children, and Myra Rude, an artistic mother who determined that any \\"squalling brats she produced could take care of themselves\\". Rude was a talented pianist who played the latest Debussy and Ravel for her children, inspiring them with a love of books and music. When she was nine years old, a neighborhood predator sexually abused Louise. This event had a major influence on Brooks' life and career, causing her to say in later years that she was incapable of real love, and that this man \\"must have had a great deal to do with forming my attitude toward sexual pleasure.... Brooks made her screen debut in the silent The Street of Forgotten Men, in an uncredited role in 1925. Soon, however, she was playing the female lead in a number of silent light comedies and flapper films over the next few years, starring with Adolphe Menjou and W. C. Fields, among others. She was noticed in Europe for her pivotal vamp role in the Howard Hawks directed silent \\"buddy film\\", A Girl in Every Port in 1928. In an early sound film drama, Beggars of Life (1928), Brooks played an abused country girl who kills her foster father in a moment of desperation. A hobo, Richard Arlen, happens on the murder scene and convinces Brooks to disguise herself as a young boy and escape the law by \\"riding the rails\\" with him. In a hobo encampment, or \\"jungle,\\" they meet another hobo, Wallace Beery. Brooks's disguise is soon uncovered and she finds herself the only female in a world of brutal, sex-hungry men. Much of this film was shot on location, and the boom microphone was invented for this film by the director William Wellman, who needed it for one of the first experimental talking scenes in the movies. By this time in her life, she was mixing with the rich and famous, and was a regular guest of William Randolph Hearst and his mistress, Marion Davies, at San Simeon, being close friends with Davies' niece, Pepi Lederer. Her distinctive bob haircut helped start a trend; many women styled their hair in imitation of her and fellow film star Colleen Moore. Soon after the film Beggars Of Life was made, Brooks, who loathed the Hollywood \\"scene\\", refused to stay on at Paramount after being denied a promised raise, and left for Europe to make films for G. W. Pabst, the prominent Austrian Expressionist director. Paramount attempted to use the coming of sound films to pressure the actress, but she called the studio's bluff. It was not until 30 years later that this rebellious move would come to be seen as arguably the most savvy of her career, securing her immortality as a silent film legend and independent spirit. Unfortunately, while her initial snubbing of Paramount alone would not have finished her in Hollywood altogether, her refusal after returning from Germany to come back to Paramount for sound retakes of The Canary Murder Case (1929) irrevocably placed her on an unofficial blacklist. Actress Margaret Livingston was hired to dub Brooks's voice for the film, as the studio claimed that Brooks' voice was unsuitable for sound pictures.

Choose the most suitable option to answer the above question. Options: - use of water - drowning - rash - wet skin - dry skin A:","completion":"The most common but not long-lasting side effect of having a bath is wet skin. When taking a bath, a person submerges themselves in water, typically in a bathtub, to clean their body and relax. As a result of this submersion, their skin becomes wet. Wet skin is a natural and expected outcome of taking a bath, as the water comes into contact with the surface of the skin. The other options have different implications: - Use of water: While this is a fundamental aspect of taking a bath, it is not a side effect. Using water, often combined with soap or other bathing products, is the primary means of cleaning oneself during a bath. - Drowning: This is a rare and dangerous risk associated with bathing, especially for children and vulnerable individuals, but it is not a common side effect. Proper supervision, safety precautions, and common sense should always be employed when bathing to avoid such risks. - Rash: While skin rashes or irritation can occur during or after a bath, this is not the most common side effect. Rashes may develop due to an allergic reaction to a particular bath product or soap, sensitivity to hot water, or as a result of other underlying skin conditions that may be aggravated by bathing. - Dry skin: After a bath, the skin may feel dry due to the removal of natural oils produced by the body. Continued submersion in water, especially hot water, can strip away these oils, leading to dryness and tightness. However, this side effect is not as common and can be mitigated by moisturizing the skin after a bath. Therefore, wet skin remains the most common and expected but not long-lasting side effect of having a bath, as the skin will naturally dry off as the excess water evaporates or is removed by patting dry with a towel."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Tim Warden, a boy with autism, has supposedly witnessed his parents' double murder. Jake Rainer, a former child psychiatrist turned therapist, is called on to probe the child's mind in order to solve the case. The psychological drama is provided by the fact that not even Jake can entice Tim to communicate what he has or has not seen regarding the crime. Tim's sister, Sylvie, is protective of him. She eventually warms to Jake's efforts, but is concerned when she learns he was implicated in the suicide of another young child who was under his care. Jake gradually befriends Tim. At first, Jake thinks that Tim is trying to communicate by cutting up playing cards, but Sylvie reveals that Tim is good at mimicking voices. Jake is able to trigger Tim's memory so that Tim mimics the voices he heard on the night of the murder by using the trigger phrase \\"God Damn,\\" which were the first words Tim heard from the murder. He attempts to piece together the chronology of the murder, suspecting that Tim interrupted a fight between his parents and an intruder. Sheriff Mitch Rivers threatens to use drugs to get Tim to talk about the murder and Dr. Rene Harlinger successfully hypnotizes Tim into breaking down a locked door. The police chief, seeing this as proof of Tim's strength, concludes that Tim was the murderer, after finding photographs showing that Tim's father was molesting him. That night, Sylvie plans to take Tim away and attempts to convince Jake to run away with them. She fails, and instead paralyzes Jake and throws him into an icy lake to drown him. Tim mimics the police chief's voice over the phone to lure Sylvie to the police station and pulls Jake out of the lake while she is away.

What is the answer?","completion":"French aviator Louis Bleriot was the first person to fly across the English Channel in an aeroplane on 25th July 1909. This historic flight was a milestone in aviation history as it demonstrated the potential of air travel and highlighted the advancements made in aviation technology. Louis Bleriot, born on July 1, 1872, was a French inventor and aviation pioneer. He was initially trained as an electrical engineer, but his passion for aviation led him to establish his own aircraft manufacturing company, Bleriot Aeronautique, in 1905. Bleriot was committed to creating innovative and efficient aircraft designs. One of his most significant achievements was developing the first practical headlamp for automobiles, which eventually funded his experiments in aviation. The historic flight across the English Channel was undertaken in Bleriot's Model XI aircraft—the Bleriot XI monoplane. This aircraft was powered by a 25-horsepower engine designed by Alessandro Anzani, an Italian engine manufacturer. With a wingspan of 7.79 meters and a maximum speed of 76 kilometers per hour, it was an advanced aircraft for its time. The idea of crossing the English Channel by air was highly competitive, and Bleriot and fellow aviator Hubert Latham were both vying for the £1,000 prize offered by London's Daily Mail newspaper for the first successful aviator to make the crossing. On 25th July 1909, Bleriot took off from Les Baraques, near Calais, in his Bleriot XI monoplane. Despite adverse weather conditions and a damaged engine that faltered during the journey, Bleriot managed to complete the 36-kilometer (22-mile) flight in just 37 minutes, landing in Dover, England. Bleriot's groundbreaking flight laid the groundwork for the future of aviation. Not only did it highlight the possibilities of air travel, but it also captured the public's imagination and marked the beginning of international cooperation in aviation. Bleriot went on to become a successful aircraft manufacturer, and his innovations continued to shape the future of aviation. In conclusion, Louis Bleriot's achievement of being the first to fly across the English Channel on 25th July 1909 was a turning point in aviation history. It demonstrated the potential for long-distance air travel, spurred interest in aviation, and paved the way for technological advancements that would shape the industry for years to come."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Answer the following question: Do you think the right answer to the question \\"what influences the survival chances of bees?\\" is \\"the environment\\", given that bee population size infleunces the bees' survival chance? Answer:","completion":"Yes, the environment plays a crucial role in influencing the survival chances of bees, but it is not the sole factor. There are several aspects, both environmental and non-environmental, that contribute to the survival chances of bees. These factors can interact and influence each other, making it essential to consider them holistically. Here's a detailed explanation to provide a comprehensive understanding. 1. Environmental Factors: a. Habitat availability: Bees require suitable habitats to nest, forage, and reproduce. Habitat loss due to urbanization, agriculture, and deforestation can severely impact bee populations. b. Food resources: Bees rely on flowers for nectar and pollen, which are their primary food sources. Flower availability depends on plant diversity, seasonality, and climate. Disruptions in these factors can threaten the bees' survival chances. c. Climate change: Global climate change has led to shifts in temperature and precipitation patterns, affecting plant growth and flowering times. These changes can have cascading impacts on bees and their food resources. d. Pesticides and pollutants: The widespread use of pesticides, particularly neonicotinoid insecticides, can be toxic to bees. Additionally, other pollutants, like air and water pollution, can harm bee populations. 2. Non-Environmental Factors: a. Bee population size: A larger bee population can provide better chances of survival due to increased genetic diversity and resilience to external threats. However, larger populations may also face increased competition for resources. b. Parasites and diseases: Pests such as Varroa mites and diseases like American Foulbrood can significantly impact the health of bee colonies. These parasites and pathogens can weaken bees, making them more susceptible to additional stressors. c. Colony and social structure: The organization and behavior of bees within their colonies can influence their survival chances. A strong, cohesive colony can communicate effectively, adapt to changes, and withstand stressors more than colonies experiencing internal issues. d. Genetic diversity: High genetic diversity within bee populations can promote resilience, increase resistance to diseases, and facilitate adaptation to environmental fluctuations. In conclusion, while the environment plays a significant role in influencing the survival chances of bees, it is important to consider various interconnected factors, including population size, parasites and diseases, and genetic diversity. All of these factors contribute to the overall likelihood of bee survival and must be taken into account to ensure their long-term persistence."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Clippers sale hangs in balance as trial begins FILE - In this Nov. 12, 2010, file photo, Shelly Sterling sits with her husband, Donald Sterling, right, during the Los Angeles Clippers' NBA basketball game against the Detroit Pistons in Los Angeles. (AP Photo/Mark J. Terrill, File) LOS ANGELES – With the potentially record-breaking 2 billion sale of the Los Angeles Clippers hanging in the balance, a trial beginning Monday will focus on whether Donald Sterling's estranged wife had the authority under terms of a family trust to unilaterally negotiate the deal. Shelly Sterling struck a deal to sell the Clippers to former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer after Donald Sterling's racist remarks to a girlfriend were publicized and the NBA moved to oust him as team owner. In order to do so, she had two doctors examine her 80-year-old husband and they declared him mentally incapacitated and unable to act as an administrator of The Sterling Family Trust, which owns the Clippers. The terms of the trust say incapacitation can be determined by two licensed doctors without ties to the family who are specialists in their field. A trustee must cooperate with such exams. The judge must find that Shelly Sterling acted in accordance with the trust and that the deal still applies -- even though the trust has since been revoked by Donald Sterling -- for the sale to proceed. Donald Sterling's attorneys say that his wife \\"blindsided\\" him and he submitted to examinations under false pretenses. They allege there was undue influence in the doctors' findings, and that the exams and letters regarding his mental capacity were defective and incomplete. They say that if he'd been properly informed, he would have participated at a more convenient time instead of being pulled out of legal meetings. \\"He would have also eaten properly and have been well rested for the examinations and focused on taking the exam with the full and complete understanding what it was for and the serious nature of the exam,\\" they wrote in filings. But Shelly Sterling's attorney, Pierce O'Donnell, said that Donald Sterling voluntarily went to take scans of his brain and there was no requirement to remind Donald Sterling, who is an attorney, or his legal team of the trust's conditions. The trial will also focus on the question of what happens to a deal that hasn't been closed once a trust is revoked. Donald Sterling revoked the trust on June 9 -- weeks after Shelly Sterling negotiated the deal with Ballmer. Shelly Sterling's attorneys also contend that finishing the deal is part of \\"winding down\\" the trust's affairs and that she has an obligation to close or Ballmer will sue. Donald Sterling's attorneys argue that the probate court now lacks jurisdiction and that winding down affairs refers to passive actions, not a sale that markedly changes the assets in the trust and its value. Donald Sterling's attorneys made a late move last week to shift the case to federal court so their allegations of medical privacy violations in the probate case can be heard. Attorneys for both Shelly Sterling and Ballmer called the filing a \\"desperate\\" tactic that they would seek to block. It was not immediately clear when a federal judge would rule on the filing or how it would affect the probate proceedings, but the trial remained on schedule to start Monday morning. Whatever happens, timing is tight. NBA owners must approve what would be a record-breaking deal and are scheduled to meet July 15 to vote. That's the same day Ballmer's offer is set to expire -- and there is no deal without the judge's approval of the sale. If the sale isn't completed by Sept. 15, the league said it could seize the team and put it up for auction.

As he finishes aligning the last piece of the cube, he swiftly places it on the desk and reaches to stop a timer he had set up before starting the challenge. This indicates that not only was the young boy working on solving the Rubik's cube, but he was also trying to accomplish this task within a certain timeframe, perhaps aiming for a personal record or simply challenging himself to improve his solving skills. The satisfaction of completing the puzzle and stopping the timer highlights the boy's dedication and determination towards this intellectual activity. In the future, the young boy might continue to practice and refine his Rubik's cube-solving skills, possibly participating in competitions or sharing his passion for puzzles with friends and family members.

User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Sentence 1: well, OK, figures of evil and more evil. Sentence 2: Well, no, figures of good and greater. If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","completion":"To determine if the second sentence is true given the truth of the first sentence, let's examine the statements step by step: Step 1: Analyze Sentence 1. Sentence 1 states, \\"well, OK, figures of evil and more evil.\\" This suggests that there are two figures being compared, one of evil and the other of more evil. Step 2: Evaluate the truth condition. We are given the information that Sentence 1 is true. Therefore, it is indeed true that there are figures of evil and more evil. Step 3: Analyze Sentence 2. Sentence 2 states, \\"Well, no, figures of good and greater.\\" This sentence suggests that there are two figures being compared, one of good and the other of greater good. Step 4: Compare the sentences. Both Sentence 1 and Sentence 2 are talking about figures being compared, but the nature of these figures is different. Sentence 1 refers to evil figures, while Sentence 2 refers to good figures. Step 5: Evaluate the dependency between the sentences. There is no direct logical or causal dependency between the statements. The truth of the first sentence does not contribute to or detract from the truth of the second sentence. Conclusion: The truth of Sentence 1 does not affect the truth of Sentence 2 as they describe different sets of figures. Therefore, we cannot determine if Sentence 2 is true or false based solely on the truth of Sentence 1."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Although an unknown property in the industry at the time, the venue was packed out. In Burman's words: \\"I immediately got the chills! I thought their song 'Leader of Men' was a smash hit.\\" Off the stage he was impressed by their industry and initiative in managing their career. Despite this, it still took Burman three months for him to convince his label bosses to approve the signing, a decision that would mark Roadrunner's first move into mainstream rock.

After a bit of gossip flies around the salon these wealthy women visit, Mary's friend and cousin Sylvia Fowler (Rosalind Russell) learns from a manicurist, Olga (Dennie Moore), that Mary's husband has been having an affair with a predatory perfume counter girl named Crystal Allen (Joan Crawford). A notorious gossip, Sylvia delights in sharing the news with Mary's other friends, and sets up Mary with an appointment with Olga so that she hears the same rumor about Stephen's infidelity. While Mary's mother, Mrs. Morehead (Lucile Watson), urges her to ignore the gossip concerning the affair and continue on as if nothing has happened, Mary begins to have her own suspicions about her husband's increasingly frequent claims that he needs to work late, and decides to travel to Bermuda with her mother to think about the situation and hope that the affair and the rumors surrounding it will fade. Upon her return from Bermuda a few weeks later, feeling well-rested and more sure of herself, Mary heads out to a fashion show at a high-end clothing store and learns that Crystal is in attendance, trying on clothes from the show in a dressing room across the hall. Sylvia joins Mary and baits her into storming into Crystal's dressing room and confronting her about the affair. Crystal is completely unapologetic about her ongoing affair with Stephen and is satisfied with her \\"meal ticket,\\" but does reveal that Stephen's strong feelings of sentiment prevents him from seeking a divorce from Mary in order to marry her.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Villa told a number of conflicting stories about his early life, and his \\"early life remains shrouded in mystery.\\" According to most sources, he was born on 5 June 1878, and named Jose Doroteo Arango Arambula at birth. His father was a sharecropper named Agustin Arango, and his mother was Micaela Arambula. He grew up at the Rancho de la Coyotada, one of the largest haciendas in the state of Durango. After Villa successfully captured the strategic prize of Torreon, Carranza ordered Villa to break off action south of Torreon and instead to divert to attack Saltillo. He threatened to cut off Villa's coal supply, immobilizing his supply trains, if he did not comply. This was widely seen as an attempt by Carranza to divert Villa from a direct assault on Mexico City in order to allow Carranza's forces under Alvaro Obregon, driving in from the west via Guadalajara, to take the capital first. This was an expensive and disruptive diversion for the Division del Norte. Villa's enlisted men were not unpaid volunteers but paid soldiers, earning the then enormous sum of one peso per day. Each day of delay cost thousands of pesos. Disgusted but having no practical alternative, Villa complied with Carranza's order and captured the less important city of Saltillo, and then offered his resignation. Felipe Angeles and the rest of Villa's staff officers argued for Villa to withdraw his resignation, defy Carranza's orders, and proceed to attack Zacatecas, a strategic railroad station heavily defended by Federal troops and considered nearly impregnable. Since the colonial era, Zacatecas was the source of much of Mexico's silver, and thus a supply of funds for whoever held it. Villa accepted his staff's advice and cancelled his resignation, and the Division del Norte defied Carranza and attacked Zacatecas. Attacking up steep slopes, the Division del Norte defeated the Federals in the Toma de Zacatecas (Taking of Zacatecas), the single bloodiest battle of the Revolution, with Federal casualties numbering approximately 7,000 dead and 5,000 wounded, and unknown numbers of civilian casualties. (A memorial to and museum of the Toma de Zacatecas is on the Cerro de la Bufa, a key defense point where the Federal Army was entrenched.) Villa's victory at Zacatecas in June 1914 broke the back of the Huerta regime. Huerta left the country on 14 July 1914. The Federal Army collapsed, ceasing to exist as an institution. In August 1914, Carranza and his revolutionary army entered Mexico City ahead of Villa. Civil war between the winners was the next stage of the Revolution. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: What happen after the capture","completion":"After the capture of the city of Saltillo, Villa offered his resignation. However, his staff officers, like Felipe Angeles, convinced him to cancel his resignation and instead attack Zacatecas, a very important and well-defended city with a strategic railroad station. Villa followed this advice, and his forces, called the Division del Norte, won a big battle called the Toma de Zacatecas. This victory was very important and led to the end of the Huerta regime. After that, the civil war between the winning groups started, and Carranza entered Mexico City before Villa did."},{"prompt":"Given the question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Today we bring you an old tale. It's the story of the three little pigs and the big bad wolf that blew down a house made of straw and one made of sticks. The only house left standing was the one made of bricks. Now there is new evidence to suggest that houses built with bales of straw can be very strong. They are also very environmental. Pete Walker is a professor at the University of Bath in Britain. He and a team of researchers there have built a house made out of straw bales and hemp material. During the next twelve months the team will study the effectiveness of these materials in home building. Professor Walker says there are many good reasons for using straw. Professor Walker: \\"One of the benefits is it's a relatively inexpensive renewable material that's readily available.\\" He also agrees that straw takes in carbon dioxide as it grows and helps the environment in other ways. So it can be seen as having no harmful effects on the environment. Professor Walker: \\"The straw bale walls are relatively thick and so all that straw provides very good thermal insulation. So we make buildings that require very little heating in the winter or indeed very little cooling in the summer. So they require very little additional energy.\\" Professor Walker says this reduces home operating expenses. It also reduces the effect on the environment. He says the current interest in straw bale houses is a direct response to the problem of climate change. David Lanfear owns an eco-friendly home building service in the United States called Bale on Bale Construction. He says he laughed when some friends first told him about houses built of straw. But after doing his own research, he learned that building with straw bales made a lot of sense. He has now helped to build more than ten straw bale houses and says the building material is becoming more widely accepted. To build the houses, he fills a wood frame with tightly packed bales of straw. Next he coats the walls inside and out with layers of clay plaster. He says the common ideas... The answer is:","completion":"Which of the following statements is true about houses built with bales of straw, according to the article? A. Straw houses are weak and cannot withstand harsh weather conditions. B. Building with straw bales is an expensive and non-renewable method. C.

There are no eco-friendly home building services that support the use of straw as a construction material."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

China has a huge population, and it is said that there is at least one bicycle for every two people within the country. Of course, many people in China ride bicycles purely for sport or exercise, but it's also a much more commonly accepted means of everyday transportation, as compared to countries such as the United States. If you are living for a long period of time in China, chances are you will want to purchase your own bicycle so that you can use it whenever you want for transportation or just for the enjoyment of riding. Even if you don't use a bicycle for everyday transportation, owning one can be a great way of enjoying some of the trails in the rural areas, just for fun. However, if you are just visiting China, renting a bicycle can be a more convenient choice. It is important to choose the correct bicycle for your use. You'll find that in China, the one-speed style of bicycle is extremely popular. These bicycles are great if you want to ride around in the city to see the sights. They are quite comfortable and easy to ride. You can often rent a bicycle for an entire day for around 15. However, if you wish to ride on some of the rural paths, a mountain bike style would be a better choice. They are great for different kinds of road surfaces, providing for a safer ride.

Which cousin learned less about wolves? Two cousins were fascinated about food chains in nature. Liam started reading about apex predators, while Fox read about grazers and large herbivores. Hint: An apex predator, also known as an alpha predator or top predator, is a predator at the top of a food chain, with no natural predators.Apex predators are usually defined in terms of trophic dynamics, meaning that they occupy the highest trophic levels. Food chains are often far shorter on land, usually limited to being secondary consumers – for example, wolves prey mostly upon large herbivores (primary consumers), which eat plants (primary producers). The apex predator concept is applied in wildlife management, conservation and ecotourism. Answer:","completion":"Fox learned less about wolves than Liam. This is because Liam focused his reading on apex predators, which, as mentioned in the paragraph, include wolves since they prey mostly on large herbivores and have no natural predators. On the other hand, Fox concentrated his reading on grazers and large herbivores, which are primary consumers and not directly related to the study of wolves as apex predators.

The first question is about moving to another country with a significant amount of funds and good business experience, while the second question is about gaining journalism experience despite having a degree in a different field. Here, I will provide detailed answers to both questions. 1. How can I move to another country with 1 million euros and good business experience but no degree to start a new life? To move to another country and start a new life with 1 million euros and good business experience, follow these steps: a. Choose a destination: Research various countries and choose one that aligns with your lifestyle, values, and future goals. Factors to consider include language, climate, political stability, cost of living, job opportunities, and social life. b. Assess legal matters: Each country has its own immigration policies. You may need a work visa, residence permit, or a business visa, depending on your intentions. Research the specific requirements of your chosen country and gather the required documentation. c. Plan your financial strategy: With 1 million euros, you have several options for investing in your new home country. You can start a business, purchase real estate, invest in local stock markets, or put your money in local banks. Research these options and select a strategy that is best suited to your risk tolerance and long-term financial goals. d. Network with local professionals: Leverage your professional experience in business to network with professionals in your destination country. Connect with local business organizations and expatriate communities to build relationships that can help you navigate the local business environment and identify potential opportunities. e. Find suitable accommodation: Before you move, research the housing market in your chosen destination and secure temporary or long-term accommodation that meets your needs and budget. f. Learn the language: If your destination country does not speak your native language, begin learning the local language to facilitate communication and cultural integration. g. Arrange for transportation: Plan your transportation in advance, whether that be air travel, shipping personal belongings, or purchasing a vehicle. h. Attend cultural orientations: Participate in cultural orientations or workshops designed for expatriates, to learn about local customs, etiquette, and other essential aspects of settling into a new country. 2. As an aspiring journalist with no journalism qualifications (but a masters in business and economics), how can I gain writing experience? To gain writing experience without a journalism degree, follow these steps: a. Write for online platforms: Start by creating content for your own blog or by contributing to existing ones. Write about topics related to your expertise (e.g., business and economics) or subjects you are passionate about. b. Freelance writing: Search for freelance writing opportunities in various publications, both online and print. Platforms like Upwork, Freelancer, and Fiverr can provide a starting point to find such opportunities. c. Look for internships or volunteer positions: Many publications and media companies offer internships or volunteer positions that can provide valuable writing experience. They may not always be paid, but they can help you establish a professional portfolio and gain exposure to industry practices. d.

All the fashionable Parisian ladies partake of the current cure for anemia by stopping at the abattoir [slaughterhouse] for their therapeutic glass of ox blood. Some ladies, however, have taken the cure to a higher level. Somewhere near Paris, Mark [Jean-Marie Lemaire] (a thief trying to escape from four other thieves who want the gold coins he is carrying to London) takes refuge in a castle currently inhabited by two lesbian chambermaids, Elisabeth [Franka Mai] and Eva [Brigitte Lahaie], who are awaiting the arrival of the marchioness and her servants. Elisabeth feels an immediate attraction to Mark but, while the gang of thieves lay outside the castle awaiting the chance to kill him, Mark is seduced by Eva, much to Elisabeth's chagrin. When the marchioness and her servants arrive, they hold a party in which Mark (the only male) is showered with attention. When midnight comes, however, everything changes. The women are revealed as \\"vampires\\" who want Mark's blood. Elisabeth helps Mark to escape, while the four servants sate their bloodlust on Eva. When Mark confesses to Elisabeth that he is also in love with her, Elisabeth changes her mind, decides that she never really loved Mark, and shoots him. It is Elisabeth and the marchioness who go into the sunrise together.

The individual is wearing a red hat and winter jacket, suggesting they may be outside in cold weather and require protection from the elements. 2. The person is looking into the distance, indicating that they are likely focusing on something far away from their current location. However, there are crucial pieces of information missing from the premise that would be necessary to determine whether the hypothesis is true: 1. The identity or occupation of the individual: The premise does not mention whether the person in question is a farmer or has any connection to agriculture or livestock. If the given scenario is not about a farmer, it is impossible for the hypothesis to be true. However, the presence of a hat and winter jacket could suggest an occupation that involves outdoor work, such as farming. 2. The context or purpose of the person's actions: The premise establishes that the person is gazing into the distance, but it does not specify the reason for this behavior. Are they searching for something in particular like the hypothesis proposes, or simply enjoying the view? Without this information, we cannot be certain that the individual is searching for a cattle herd as the hypothesis suggests. With the information provided in the premise, we cannot confirm or deny the hypothesis. There could be numerous reasons why a person wearing a red hat and winter jacket looks into the distance, and the premise does not supply enough context to guarantee that the scenario involves a farmer seeking their cattle herd.

Hence, I used uppercase to start each word to maintain the integrity of that title distinction. Step 3: For 'Read Bible online,' I regarded this as a directive or a sentence on its own, and thus it needed to be capitalized like a normal sentence, hence 'Read' is capitalized.

She was a British children's author, which means she came from a place called Britain and wrote special stories just for kids. Beatrix was like a friend who told bedtime stories that kids loved, and her books were adored all around the world. You might know some of them, like \\"The Tale of Peter Rabbit\\" or \\"The Tale of Benjamin Bunny.\\" These stories were filled with fun creatures, like rabbits, ducks, and mice, who had amazing adventures. Beatrix didn't just write words; she drew beautiful pictures, too. When she created a character, she would show us what they looked like with her artwork. This made her stories magical and helped bring them to life. What made Beatrix's stories extra special was that they taught important lessons. Sometimes her characters would learn to be brave or kind or to fix mistakes they made. All these lessons help children grow and learn, just like how eating your vegetables helps you grow big and strong. Beatrix Potter was not only an amazing storyteller; she was also a very smart lady. She loved nature and spent lots of time outdoors, exploring the world around her. This love for nature inspired her stories, and she made sure to share her knowledge with her readers. So today, we celebrate 150 years of Beatrix Potter's life, remembering the joy and imagination she brought to children with her stories. By reading and sharing her books with friends and family, we can keep her memory alive for many more years to come. The end."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

It is the first successful hijacking of a major commercial vessel in the Somali Basin since 2012 and is prompting debate over whether shipping companies have become complacent about the risk of maritime piracy. The MT Aris 13 was travelling from Djibouti to Mogadishu on 13 March when, instead of giving the Somali coast a wide berth as advised, it took a short cut between the tip of the Horn of Africa and the Yemeni island of Socotra. Somali pirates then ambushed the vessel just 11 miles (17km) from shore with two fast speedboats, known as skiffs, while aiming their weapons at the crew. The vessel and its crew of eight Sri Lankan seafarers have now been seized by the pirates and are being held pending either ransom negotiations or a rescue attempt by the regional Puntland authorities. This brings to 16 the number of seafarers currently being held by Somalia-based pirates, the remaining eight being Iranians. \\"For a vessel passing that close to the coast of Somalia without armed guards shows a level of complacency,\\" said a spokesman for Neptune Maritime Security, which is currently running armed protection teams on around 70 vessels this month as they pass through the area of the western Indian Ocean known as the High Risk Area (HRA). Employing armed teams, usually former servicemen, is seen by many shipping companies as prohibitively expensive. Shipping industry analysts say many vessels, especially those with a high freeboard (the vertical distance between the surface of the sea and the deck) have simply been speeding up to avoid capture. This is part of what is known as Best Management Practice, or BMP4. Although pirates have, in the past, been incredibly adept at scaling the sides of big ocean-going vessels while in motion, this becomes very hard to do at speeds of 15 knots or more, especially if the captain takes evasive action, creating an unpredictable bow wave that can sink the pirates' skiffs. In recent years the European Union and other nations, including China, have mounted naval patrols to deter Somali piracy and escort convoys along the coast of Yemen. But the area is so vast that their ships were rarely able to reach a vessel in distress in time. Once pirates were onboard it became a hostage situation which most naval vessels' rules of engagement prevented them from getting involved in. \\"The navies' presence is good,\\" says John Steed from the seafarers' welfare group Oceans Beyond Piracy, \\"but the primary factor in deterring Somali piracy has been the presence of armed guards onboard, along with best practice like speeding up,\\" he added. The ship that was captured on Monday had a low freeboard and was travelling so slowly that it was, he says \\"almost a sitting duck\\". So will this latest hijacking be a wake-up call that prompts more precautions being taken at sea or will it signal the start of a new wave of piracy? Worryingly, the factors that drove many Somali coastal fishermen to become pirates nearly a decade ago are still there. Somalia is currently in the grip of a famine and poverty is widespread; there are few employment options for young people. There is massive and growing local resentment at the poaching of fish stocks off the coast by Asian trawlers. According to Oceans Beyond Piracy, some foreign vessels have \\"dubious\\" licences issued by officials in Puntland, but the local people never get to see any benefit from them. The high point in Somali piracy came in 2010, both in terms of vessels hijacked and the number of seafarers taken prisoner for ransom. Soon after that, shipping companies began placing armed guards onboard who would \\"show weapons\\" to circling pirates and if necessary fire warning shots to ward them off. This effectively broke the pirates' business model as, until then, they had been able to approach a ship, often at dawn after a night of chewing the narcotic qat leaf, open fire on the bridge to scare the captain into slowing down and stopping, and then they would board it using ladders. They would then hold the vessel, its crew and its cargo for ransoms of millions of dollars. After 2010 they were no longer able to do this with impunity. But now that news will have spread that many vessels are not carrying that armed protection there are concerns that the lucrative business of Somali maritime piracy may be set to return. What was that article about?","completion":"The article discusses the hijacking of the MT Aris 13, a commercial vessel, by Somali pirates in 2017, which marked the first successful hijacking in the region since 2012.

The article examines the reasons behind the hijacking, including the vessel's decision to take a shortcut and the lack of armed guards on board. It also explores the factors that have driven piracy in the region, such as widespread poverty, unemployment, and local resentment over the poaching of fish stocks by foreign trawlers.

Question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the full name of the doctor that commented on a symphony written by a man who based it on works of a 13th century poet? ? Rachmaninoff's choral symphony The Bells reflected the four-part progression from youth to marriage, maturity, and death in Poe's poem. Britten reversed the pattern for his Spring Symphony—the four sections of the symphony represent, in its composer's words, \\"the progress of Winter to Spring and the reawakening of the earth and life which that means.... It is in the traditional four movement shape of a symphony, but with the movements divided into shorter sections bound together by a similar mood or point of view.\\"The gestation of Shostakovich's Thirteenth Symphony, Babi Yar, was only slightly less straightforward. He set the poem Babi Yar by Yevgeny Yevtushenko almost immediately upon reading it, initially considering it a single-movement composition. Discovering three other Yevtushenko poems in the poet's collection Vzmakh ruki (A Wave of the Hand) prompted him to proceed to a full-length choral symphony, with \\"A Career\\" as the closing movement. Musicologist Francis Maes comments that Shostakovich did so by complementing Babi Yar's theme of Jewish suffering with Yevtushenko's verses about other Soviet abuses: \\"'At the Store' is a tribute to the women who have to stand in line for hours to buy the most basic foods,... 'Fears' evokes the terror under Stalin. 'A Career' is an attack on bureaucrats and a tribute to genuine creativity\\". Music historian Boris Schwarz adds that the poems, in the order Shostakovich places them, form a strongly dramatic opening movement, a scherzo, two slow movements and a finale.In other cases, the choice of text has led the composer to different symphonic structures. Havergal Brian allowed the form of his Fourth Symphony, subtitled \\"Das Siegeslied\\" (Psalm of Victory), to be dictated by the three-part structure of his text, Psalm 68; the setting of Verses 13–18 for soprano solo and orchestra forms a quiet interlude between two wilder, highly chromatic martial ones set for massive choral and orchestral forces. Likewise, Szymanowski allowed the text by 13th-century Persian poet Rumi...

The situation described in the statement portrays a traditional scene of a cowboy on horseback while using a lasso, which is a rope with a loop used in various activities such as capturing animals, ranching, and rodeo events. The cowboy's action of spinning the lasso has no direct connection to the game of tennis. Tennis is a sport played with rackets and a small, hollow, rubber ball called a tennis ball. Players, either individually or in teams of two, strike the ball back and forth over a net. The objective of the game is to hit the ball in such a way that the opponent cannot return it within the bounds of the court. This sport is typically played indoors or outdoors on a variety of court surfaces such as grass, clay, or hardcourt. The game has specific rules and well-delineated boundaries and is different from a cowboy spinning a lasso on horseback. In conclusion, the statement describing a cowboy on horseback spinning a lasso does not provide any information, directly or indirectly, about the cowboy playing tennis. Therefore, we can confidently choose option (c) – no, as our answer."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

Part #2: A is a list Usage: ['U', '3605', '7925', 'Y', 'j', 's', 'N', '5087'] is the given list A. This list contains various strings, some of which represent numerical elements. Part #3: Sum of all numerical elements between positions i and j (inclusive) Usage: For the given i = 5 and j = 7, the elements in list A within the range [5, 7] are ['s', 'N', '5087']. Among these elements, '5087' is a numerical element, so the sum will be 5087. Part #4: Return 0 if no numerical element is present in the range Usage: Given the same list, if the range was [1, 2], the elements would be ['3605', '7925']. However, these elements (while containing numbers) are still strings and NOT numerical elements. In this specific case, the task definition is ambiguous, since it's unclear if string representations of numbers are to be treated as numbers or non-numerical elements. Part #5: i and j will be non-negative and have a value less than the length of list A Usage: i and j values 5 and 7 are both non-negative (greater than or equal to 0) and less than the length of the list A, which is 8. This ensures that the given range falls within the boundaries of the list A. Part #6: i will always be less than j Usage: Since i = 5 and j = 7, it meets the criteria of i being less than j.

Given the question: Given the following context: White Brazilians descended from the original Portuguese settlers. From the 1870s onwards this ethnic group also included other European immigrants: mainly Italians, Spaniards and Germans. Although whites could be found throughout the country, they were the majority group in the southern region and in São Paulo province. Whites also comprised a significant proportion (40%) of the population in the northeastern provinces of Ceará, Paraíba and Rio Grande do Norte. Black Brazilians of Sub-Saharan African ancestry inhabited the same areas as mulattoes. The majority of the population of Rio de Janeiro, Minas Gerais, Espírito Santo, Bahia, Sergipe, Alagoas and Pernambuco provinces (the last four having the smallest percentages of whites in the whole country—less than 30% in each) were black or brown. The Indians, the indigenous peoples of Brazil, were found mainly in Piauí, Maranhão, Pará and Amazonas.Because of the existence of distinct racial and cultural communities, 19th century Brazil developed as a multi-ethnic nation. However the data is problematic as no reliable information is available for the years prior to 1872. The first official national census was compiled by the government in 1872 showing that out of 9,930,479 inhabitants there were 38.1% whites, 38.3% browns, 19.7% blacks and 3.9% Indians.

How do you do this: To replace eggs in a recipe.","completion":"Replacing eggs in a recipe can be done through several methods depending on the purpose of egg in the recipe. The rationale behind each replacement will differ. Follow the steps below to replace eggs efficiently in any recipe. Eggs play different roles in recipes such as: acting as a binder (holding the recipe together), providing moisture, or creating leavening (helping the recipe rise). Various alternatives can be used accordingly: 1. **For Binding:** If the egg is used for binding, consider using mashed bananas, applesauce, or pureed prunes. These all provide the 'stickiness' that eggs would normally provide in a recipe, and they also add a bit of sweetness. 2. **For Moisture:** If the egg is used for adding moisture, yogurt, buttermilk, or mashed avocados can be used as an egg replacement. Their high water content helps keep the recipe moist. 3. **For Leavening:** If eggs are used for leavening to help the recipe rise, vinegar mixed with baking powder, or even carbonated water could work. They create the gas that helps doughs and batters rise. Here are measurements for these replacements approximately equivalent to one egg: - Mashed banana - 1/4 cup - Applesauce - 1/4 cup - Pureed prunes - 1/4 cup - Yogurt/ Buttermilk - 1/4 cup - Mashed avocado - 1/4 cup - 1 teaspoon of vinegar with 1 teaspoon of baking powder - Carbonated water - 1/4 cup Remember that these substitutions can alter the taste, texture, and appearance of your recipe.

Fact 2: Underfoot, loose rocks make footing perilous, while smooth marblelike stones make it slippery. Given the two facts above, answer the question \\"contact between rocks over long periods of time causes rocks to be what?\\" with the following options: - erosion - Loose - slippery - loose soil - homogenous - coiled - imbalanced - threatened Answer:","completion":"Contact between rocks over long periods of time causes rocks to be eroded and potentially slippery. To elaborate, let's examine each option in relation to the given facts: - Erosion: This is the most fitting answer, as the interaction between rocks over an extended period results in the gradual breaking down and smoothing of their surfaces. This is a direct result of erosion, which is the process of wearing away rocks and other materials on the Earth's surface due to natural forces like wind, water, and ice. In this scenario, the contact between rocks over time causes the rocks to become smooth and eroded. - Loose: While loose rocks can indeed make footing perilous (as mentioned in Fact 2), the question focuses on the effects of contact between rocks over time. The fact that rocks may become loose is unrelated to the smoothing effect caused by erosion. - Slippery: The continuous contact between rocks can result in the formation of smooth surfaces, which can make the rocks slippery, as stated in Fact 2. This is especially true when the worn-down rocks are compared to marble-like stones. - Loose soil: The contact between rocks over a long period does not directly result in the formation of loose soil. However, eroded rock particles can contribute to the formation of soil over time. - Homogenous: Prolonged contact between rocks will not make them homogenous, as this term refers to uniformity in composition or structure. Erosion can create a more uniform surface on the rocks, but it does not change their overall composition. - Coiled: This term is not applicable to the interaction between rocks over extended periods. Coiled refers to something being shaped into a series of spirals, which does not describe any known geological process caused by contact between rocks. - Imbalanced: Imbalanced has no direct connection to the long-term contact between rocks. Erosion can create uneven surfaces and cause rocks to become misshapen; however, it is more related to the gradual wearing down of rock surfaces than to the overall balance or stability of the rocks themselves. - Threatened: This term is not relevant to the interactions between rocks over long periods. \\"Threatened\\" implies a sense of danger or risk, which does not directly relate to the geological processes at work during rock erosion. In summary, contact between rocks over long periods of time causes the rocks to be eroded and potentially slippery. The process of erosion leads to the gradual wearing down and smoothing of the rock surfaces, while the smoothness can result in slippery rocks similar to those mentioned in Fact 2."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. The Los Angeles-based web hosting firm Dreamhost is fighting the Department of Justice over the attempted exposure of visitors to the anti-Donald Trump website DisruptJ20.org, the company has revealed. On Monday, Dreamhost said the DOJ hit it with a search warrant a month ago, requesting all the data that the hosting firm has on the website, which is one of its clients. Crucially, this data includes details that could be used to identify the 1.3 million people who have visited the site. DisruptJ20.org was used to organize protests in Washington, D.C. on Trump’s inauguration day, 20 January. The protests turned violent in part, and the site is now primarily being used to organize legal support for the hundreds of protestors who were arrested. Read: Donations Double to the EFF on Eve of Trump Presidency The Justice Department wants Dreamhost to hand over the IP addresses of all the site’s visitors – this refers to the numerical strings identifying the physical internet connections that people used to access the site. It also wants “contact information, email content, and photos of thousands of people,” Dreamhost said. “That information could be used to identify any individuals who used this site to exercise and express political speech protected under the Constitution’s First Amendment,” the hosting firm wrote in a blog post. “That should be enough to set alarm bells off in anyone’s mind.” Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter. Dreamhost said its general counsel, Chris Ghazarian, had “taken issue” with the demand’s untargeted nature. When the company pushed back, the government asked the Washington, D.C. Superior Court to order Dreamhost to hand over its records. Now the company has filed a response in opposition to the government’s motion. “Internet users have a reasonable expectation that they will not get swept up in criminal investigations simply by exercising their right to political speech against the government,” Dreamhost said. “We intend to take whatever steps are necessary to support and shield these users from what is, in our view, a very unfocused search and an unlawful request for their personal information.” The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), the world’s biggest digital rights organization with over 30,000 paid-up members, has been giving Dreamhost professional support in the case, though not representing it as such. “The Fourth Amendment was designed to prohibit fishing expeditions like this,” the EFF wrote in a separate blog post. ||||| Web hosting service DreamHost is fighting a Department of Justice demand to scoop up all the IP addresses of visitors to an anti-Trump website. The website in question, disruptj20.org, organized participants of political protests against the current U.S. administration. Blogging about its objections to the warrant yesterday, DreamHost’s general counsel describes it as “a highly untargeted demand that chills free association and the right of free speech afforded by the Constitution”. DreamHost says it has not been able to see the affidavit pertaining to the warrant as those records are sealed. The search warrant can be found here. In the warrant the DoJ demands that DreamHost hand over 1.3 million visitor IP addresses to the disruptj20.org website, along with contact information, email content, and photos of thousands of people. “That information could be used to identify any individuals who used this site to exercise and express political speech protected under the Constitution’s First Amendment. That should be enough to set alarm bells off in anyone’s mind,” argues DreamHost. “This is, in our opinion, a strong example of investigatory overreach and a clear abuse of government authority.” The latest developments in what has been a months-long disagreement already, are that DreamHost has now filed arguments in opposition of the DoJ demand. Its counsel will be attending a court hearing on the matter on August 18 in Washington, D.C. DreamHost initially challenged the government to narrow the scope of the warrant but says instead the DoJ filed a motion in the Washington, D.C. Superior Court asking for an order to compel it to produce the records. Also blogging about the issue yesterday, the Electronic Frontier Foundation accuses D.C. prosecutors of using “unconstitutional methods” to pursue their investigation into the J20 protests, aka the day President Trump was inaugurated. “In just one example of the staggering overbreadth of the search warrant, it would require DreamHost to turn over the IP logs of all visitors to the [disruptj20.org] site. Millions of visitors — activists, reporters, or you (if you clicked on the link) — would have records of their visits turned over to the government. The warrant also sought production of all emails associated with the account and unpublished content, like draft blog posts and photos,” the EFF writes. “No plausible explanation exists for a search warrant of this breadth, other than to cast a digital dragnet as broadly as possible. But the Fourth Amendment was designed to prohibit fishing expeditions like this. Those concerns are especially relevant here, where DOJ is investigating a website that served as a hub for the planning and exercise of First Amendment-protected activities.” ||||| The US government is seeking to unmask every person who visited an anti-Trump website in what privacy advocates say is an unconstitutional “fishing expedition” for political dissidents. The warrant appears to be an escalation of the Department of Justice’s (DoJ) campaign against anti-Trump activities, including the harsh prosecution of inauguration day protesters. On 17 July, the DoJ served a website-hosting company, DreamHost, with a search warrant for every piece of information it possessed that was related to a website that was used to coordinate protests during Donald Trump’s inauguration. The warrant covers the people who own and operate the site, but also seeks to get the IP addresses of 1.3 million people who visited it, as well as the date and time of their visit and information about what browser or operating system they used. In America, bias, hate and racism move from the margins to the mainstream | Al Sharpton Read more The website, www.disruptj20.org, was used to coordinate protests and civil disobedience on 20 January, when Trump was inaugurated. “This specific case and this specific warrant are pure prosecutorial overreach by a highly politicized department of justice under [Attorney General Jeff] Sessions,” said Chris Ghazarian, general counsel for DreamHost. “You should be concerned that anyone should be targeted simply for visiting a website.” The warrant was made public Monday, when DreamHost announced its plans to challenge the government in court. The DoJ declined to comment. A hearing is scheduled for Friday. The government has aggressively prosecuted activists arrested during the 20 January protests in Washington DC. In April, the US attorney’s office in Washington DC filed a single indictment charging more than 217 people with identical crimes, including felony rioting. Ghazarian said that DreamHost provided the government with “limited customer information about the owner of the website” when it first received a grand jury subpoena a week after the protests occurred. But the government came back in July with the much broader search warrant. “We’re a gatekeeper between the government and tens of thousands of people who visited the website,” said Ghazarian. “We want to keep them protected.” The Electronic Frontier Foundation, which has been advising DreamHost, characterized the warrant as “unconstitutional” and “a fishing expedition”. “I can’t conceive of a legitimate justification other than casting your net as broadly as possible to justify millions of user logs,” senior staff attorney Mark Rumold told the Guardian. Logs of IP addresses don’t uniquely identify users, but they link back to specific physical addresses if no digital tools are used to mask it. “What they would be getting is a list of everyone who has ever been interested in attending these protests or seeing what was going on at the protests and that’s the troubling aspect. It’s a short step after you have the list to connect the IP address to someone’s identity,” he said. Wide-reaching warrants for user data are sometimes issued when the content of a site is illegal such as pirated movies or child sexual abuse imagery, but speech is rarely prohibited. “This [the website] is pure first amendment advocacy – the type of advocacy the first amendment was designed to protect and promote,” Rumold added. “Frankly I’m glad DreamHost is pushing back on it.” It’s not the first time that the US government has sought to unmask people protesting against Trump or his policies. President's first Trump Tower homecoming met with mass protest Read more In March this year, Customs and Border Protection (CBP), a division of the homeland security department, ordered Twitter to hand over the phone number, mailing addresses and IP addresses associated with @ALT_USCIS, an account that purported to convey the views of dissenters within the government. The account, whose username is a reference to the US Citizenship and Immigration Services, is one of dozens of alternative Twitter accounts established after Trump was inaugurated. The unverified accounts claimed to provide an uncensored view of civil servants who disagreed with Trump’s policies. To protect the identity of the person running the account, Twitter launched a lawsuit against the Trump administration, arguing that it would have “a grave chilling effect on the speech of that account in particular and the many other ‘alternative agency’ accounts that have been created to voice dissent to government policies”. After public outcry over the administration’s overreach, CBP dropped the request. ||||| Write a summary.","completion":"US web hosting firm DreamHost is fighting a Department of Justice (DoJ) demand for the IP addresses of 1.3 million visitors to an anti-Trump website.

After all the Essential Phone was the perfect opportunity to see what Andy Rubin the \\"Father of Android\\" and leader of Essential had to say about the Android OS' direction since he left Google in 2014. Would he put his personal touch on the software showing us what the OS might have looked like had he stayed at Google? As it turns out it appears instead that Rubin had more to say about a smartphone's design than he did about the Android OS. I suppose I was expecting something different from Rubin . He did mention in May that the Essential Phone would run stock Android but I wasn't expecting him to have such an extremely light touch and to barely alter anything about the OS. Rubin created Android so he 's no stranger to developing mobile phone software. And given how much attention Essential paid to every little detail of the phone's hardware it's a good bet that Rubin didn't just go with the plain version of Android out of sheer laziness. The move suggests that Rubin believes stock Android is still the best Android compared to what you see on phones from Samsung LG and the numerous Chinese companies like Huawei. Stock Android means none of the duplicate apps from the smartphone maker and carrier cluttering things up. Android looks and works exactly the way Google intended it to. To be clear those companies make great phones as their popularity shows. Yet I've always believed that nothing beats stock Android. So thanks Andy Rubin for backing me up.

Abbott's charge against Obama's executive order limiting deportations has vaulted the Republican onto the national stage, giving him a lead role on a prominent issue just as he prepares to replace outgoing Gov.

Fifth Option: The focus of the story is on Texas, not the Republican party. It is less relevant to say that the \\"Republican will once again sustain consequences.\\" 4.

Brendan Rodgers has confirmed he will sign a new long-term deal this summer as he prepares to lock horns with the man who advised him to join Liverpool. Though Rodgers has put all discussions about his future on hold to prevent distractions during Liverpool's title charge, he has revealed it is now simply a case of 'when' rather than 'if' he puts pen-to-paper. It has long been the intentions of Liverpool's owners to reward Rodgers, who has 12 months plus the option for another year on his current contract, but the manager's first priority is stopping Jose Mourinho. Red leader: Brendan Rodgers is ready to sign a new contract to stay at Liverpool. Selection policy: The Liverpool boss revealed that Jose Mourinho (R) advised him to choose the Reds. Rodgers and the Chelsea manager remain. close friends but, as Liverpool home in on their date with destiny, all. acquaintances will be shelved. Nothing is going to disturb Rodgers' focus in what is their biggest domestic fixture for 25 years. 'There. is nothing really (planned) until the end of the season,' said Rodgers,. discussing his future. 'But there is no doubt that, at some point, we. will agree another deal. I am sure of that.' With. each passing week over the last 18 months, Liverpool's decision to. recruit Rodgers has looked increasingly shrewd as they have been. transformed from perennial underachievers to potential champions. And. for that Fenway Sports Group owe Mourinho a small debt of gratitude:. Rodgers was being courted by Tottenham as well as Liverpool but, after. an exchange of text messages, Mourinho nodded his protege in the. direction of Anfield. Who's the boss? Liverpool are five points clear at the top of the Premier League with three games to play. 'Jose. told me to take the job and what a great club Liverpool was,' Rodgers. revealed. 'I had spoken to him on it, he encouraged me about the sheer. scale of the club. I was talking to him about a choice I maybe had, he. knows the size of this. 'It. is a friendship (we have). It has been a continual relationship since. 2004. We have just kept in contact. I have got on with my life and work. and that's it. He's been supportive of me wherever I have been even, in. my time here. 'We might be considered a rival but I know that if they didn’t win the league he would want us to win it.' But. is their relationship strong enough to withstand rivalry? Liverpool and. Chelsea antagonise each other and the increase in tensions stem from. Mourinho's first spell in England, when the clubs played each other 15. times in three years. Helping hand: Mourinho has been supportive of Rodgers ever since the pair worked together at Chelsea. 'I. understand the history because I was on the opposite side,' said. Rodgers. 'In that period maybe it was made to be the managers (Mourinho. and Rafa Benitez) and that was the rivalry, but I am a different person. and man. 'I only concentrate. on things I can control which is the players and my club. I will always. fight for the club however that may be. I am sure it will be a. brilliant atmosphere because of the past but more important how we are. doing now.' There is little. doubt Anfield will, as Rodgers says, be \\"in bloom\\" for this game, a. swirling mass of scarves, flags and banners. Liverpool have not been. this close to to the title since 1990 and the locals are trying to lift. them over the line. Sign of the times: Liverpool fans can feel the title returning to Anfield for the first time since 1990. Cauldron: Former Chelsea defender Glen Johnson knows the atmosphere will be intense at Anfield. It will. be another afternoon when the noise is pumped up to mind-scrambling. levels and Glen Johnson, who was on the Chelsea bench in 2005 during the. fabled Champions League semi-final, has explained the influence Anfield. can have. 'I’ve seen it. from both sides and I remember the atmosphere that night,' said Johnson. 'Of course I didn’t enjoy it at the time but looking back, that is what. you play football for, to be involved in those nights. Whether. I was playing for Liverpool or not, I could appreciate the support. It. definitely takes a bit out of you when you are the away team. When the. atmosphere is that intense, it does give you that extra 10 per cent 'I’m. pretty sure the fans will be like they were against Man City and now we. have to follow up with the same result. If we play like we did that. day, we can beat anyone.'

Perhaps you spilled coffee all over your customers or your boss told you that you have to work weekends for a while. When times on the job get rough, use your breaks to get away for a bit. Instead of having lunch in the office, go off site. Take a walk around the block when you have five or ten minutes to yourself. When life gets overwhelming, don't keep your feelings inside. Take a notepad and write down all the issues you're having. Getting it out can help you process the problem and figure out what steps to take to fix it. For instance, you might write down that your coworker got an attitude with you as soon as you came to the office. You might add that you had to work outdoors and it rained all day. Journaling your problems is even more effective if you look back on it later when you are less stressed and try to come up with possible solutions. Identify someone, whether a family member or a friend, and call them up to vent. Get advice if you'd like or just use this time to express your frustrations. You might call up your spouse and say “Hey honey, do you have a minute? I wanna talk about something that bothered me at work and I want to see what you think about it.” Music is a temporary distraction from the negativity that might surround you. If you have your own office, shut the door and listen to a few songs to lift your mood. If you don't have your own space, use headphones. If you can't listen to music at work, take a restroom break and listen to a song. Instead of continuing to be down in the dumps, find a way to smile. Funny YouTube videos can be a great distraction to a bad work day. Revisit some of your old favorite videos or look for funny memes. Try to limit your time watching videos to ten minutes or less. Though laughter can be helpful, sometimes you just need a good cry. When you feel the tears coming, step away as quickly as you can to the nearest restroom. Take a few moments to cry and then pull yourself together. Blow your nose and splash your face with cool water to get rid of your puffy eyes and red face.

Kosova, hem Sırp hem de Arnavut nüfuslarından oluşuyor ve bu iki etnik grup arasındaki gerilim devam ediyor. Uzun yıllardır süregelen bu gerilim, Balkanlarda yaşanan son savaşların arka planında da önemli bir etkendir. 2008'de, Kosova, büyük ölçüde Arnavut nüfusunun desteğiyle bağımsız ilan edildi, ancak bu, Sırbistan ve Rusya gibi bazı ülkeler tarafından kabul edilmedi. Evrensel bir uzlaşmanın sağlanamaması, bölgedeki sürtüşme ve gerilimin sürekli hâle gelmesine yol açtı. Ahtisaari, Kosova'daki durumu ele alarak, tarafların tekrar masaya oturup kapsamlı bir şekilde konu üzerinde çalışmalarını amaçlamaktadır. Bu amaçla, bölge ve tüm sorunlarının tamamen anlaşılması için çaba sarf etmektedir ve sürece tarafsız bir şekilde yaklaşmaktadır. Önemli bir adım olarak, Ahtisaari, hem Kosova hükûmeti ve Arnavut liderlerle hem de Sırbistan hükûmeti ve Sırp liderlerle görüşmelere devam etmektedir. Bu görüşmeler sayesinde, her iki tarafın hassasiyetleri ve çıkarları değerlendirilerek, ortak noktalar belirlenmeye çalışılır. Üst düzey siyasi amaçlarını göz ardı etmeden, yapılandırılmış bir diyalog süreci ve somut adımlar atılması planlanmaktadır. Ahtisaari'nin, Kosova sorununu çözmeye yönelik ana prensipleri şunlardır: her iki tarafın haklarını ve özgürlüklerini korumak, hukukun üstünlüğünü sağlamak, ekonomik kalkınma ve yeniden yapılanma süreçlerine desteği arttırmak ve bölgeler arası işbirliği sağlamak. Tüm bu amaçlar çerçevesinde, gelecekte Kosova'da daha sağlam ve huzurlu bir ortam yaratmayı hedeflemektedir. Uzlaşma sağlanabilmesi için, Ahtisaari'nin öncülük ettiği sürece, uluslararası camia da desteğini sunmalıdır. Avrupa Birliği, Birleşmiş Milletler ve Amerika Birleşik Devletleri gibi önemli aktörler, Kosova'daki tarafların etkili ve kalıcı bir uzlaşma sağlamalarında yardımcı olabilir belki de. Sonuç olarak, Ahtisaari, Kosova'da uzlaşmayı sağlama adına önemli bir çaba göstermektedir ve bu tür müzakerelerin hem ulusal hem de bölgesel düzeyde daha geniş bir huzuru mümkün kılmak için yapılanıp süregeldiği değerli bir örnektir.

The answer to the question: What is the name of the drilling fluid that is significantly more expensive than untreated petroleum fuels? is inside the article: Drilling fluids are necessary for borehole stability in deep cores, and can also be used to circulate cuttings away from the bit. Fluids used include water, ethanol/water and water/ethylene glycol mixtures, petroleum fuels, non-aromatic hydrocarbons, and n-butyl acetate. Water is the cheapest and cleanest option; it may be present on the glacial surface or may be created by thermal drilling. In cold ice some form of antifreeze is necessary, or heat must be reapplied by reaming the hole periodically. Ethanol and water. Ethanol acts as an anti-freeze in water; at sufficient concentrations it can reduce the freezing temperature of the mixture to well below any temperature likely to be encountered in ice drilling. The concentration must be chosen to prevent the liquid freezing and also to maintain the borehole against the ice overburden pressure. Because the density of the mixture decreases with lower temperatures, vertical convection will develop in boreholes where temperatures decrease with depth, as the lighter mixture rises. This causes slush to form in the borehole, though successful drilling is still possible. Ethanol is one of the cheapest options for a drilling fluid, and requires less storage space than other options because in use it is diluted with water. A Soviet expedition left an 800 m borehole in Antarctica filled with ethanol and water at an ice temperature of −53 °C; after 11 months the borehole remained open and drilling was resumed with no problems. A problem with this option is that the mixture will penetrate cores that have cracks. Ethylene glycol and water was used at Camp Century in 1966 in the lower part of the hole to dissolve the cuttings. Petroleum fuels. This includes diesel, jet fuel, and kerosene.

This means the (A) marble (B) rock has stronger gravity. What is the most sensical answer between \\"marble\\" and \\"rock\\"? Answer:","completion":"The most sensical answer between \\"marble\\" and \\"rock\\" is (B) rock. To provide a deeper understanding, let's first briefly discuss the concept of gravity. Gravity is a universal force that attracts any two objects that have mass to each other. The force of gravity between two objects depends on two factors: 1. The mass of the objects: Greater mass means a stronger force of gravity. 2. The distance between the objects: A shorter distance means a stronger force of gravity. In the context of the short story, Jimbo knows that his marble has a lesser mass compared to his rock. As the force of gravity is directly proportional to the mass of the objects involved, the heavier object (the rock) will have a stronger gravitational force. In summary, based on the mass of each object, the answer is (B) rock, as it has stronger gravity due to its higher mass compared to the marble."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

After Charles VII's successful Normandy campaign in 1450, he concentrated his efforts on Gascony, the last province held by the English. Bordeaux, Gascony's capital, was besieged and surrendered to the French on 30 June 1451. Largely due to the English sympathies of the Gascon people, this was reversed when John Talbot and his army retook the city on 23 October 1452. However, the English were decisively defeated at the Battle of Castillon on 17 July 1453. Talbot had been persuaded to engage the French army at Castillon near Bordeaux. During the battle the French appeared to retreat towards their camp.

In this context, \\"explained\\" is translated to \\"a explicat,\\" which is the past tense of the verb \\"a explica\\" (to explain). The conjugation implies a completed action in the past. 2. \\"that\\" - In this context, \\"that\\" is a conjunction introducing a subordinate clause. In Romanian, it is translated as \\"că.\\" 3. \\"the figure\\" - This phrase is translated as \\"această cifră\\" in Romanian. It refers to a specific number or amount mentioned in the text. \\"Această\\" is a demonstrative adjective for the word \\"cifră,\\" meaning this particular figure. 4. \\"excludes\\" - The verb \\"to exclude\\" is translated in Romanian as \\"a exclude.\\" In this context, it must be conjugated according to the subject, which is \\"cifră.\\" The correct form is \\"nu include\\" (does not include), as it is in present tense and third person singular. In Romanian, the negation is expressed by adding \\"nu\\" before the verb. 5. \\"the cost of building new facilities\\" - This phrase is translated as \\"costul construirii unor facilități noi.\\" Here, \\"costul\\" means \\"the cost,\\" \\"construirii\\" is the genitive form of \\"construire\\" (building), \\"unor\\" is an indefinite article used for plural countable nouns, \\"facilități\\" means \\"facilities,\\" and \\"noi\\" is an adjective that means \\"new.\\" In Romanian, the genitive construction is applied to show possession or belonging, in this case, \\"the cost of building.\\" The adjective \\"new\\" is placed after the noun, which is a common rule in Romanian.

It is an exciting and effective way to move down the field and score touchdowns. But how many of these spectacular moments are attributed to passing plays? In this article, we'll dive into touchdown statistics to find out how many touchdowns are scored through passing and discuss their significance in the outcome of games. Step 1: Gathering the data To provide an accurate answer to this question, we first need to gather information about the number of passing and rushing touchdowns in a given season. We'll look at the data from the most recent completed season to maintain relevance. Step 2: Analyzing passing touchdowns After collecting the data, we can calculate the total number of touchdowns scored through passing. To do this, we'll sum up all the touchdown passes thrown by quarterbacks and differentiate them from those scored through rushing plays. Step 3: Comparing with total touchdowns With the total number of passing touchdowns calculated, we'll then divide that figure by the overall number of touchdowns scored throughout the season. This will give us the percentage of touchdowns scored through passing plays. Step 4: Taking it a step further After determining the percentage of passing touchdowns, we can take our analysis a step further by breaking down the passing touchdowns by team and position. This will provide insight into which teams and players rely most heavily on passing plays to score touchdowns. Results and Conclusion: According to our analysis, a total of X passing touchdowns were scored during the Y season, accounting for Z% of all touchdowns. The team with the most passing touchdowns was [Team Name], while [Player Name] led the league in individual passing touchdowns. While many factors contribute to a team's success, it is clear that passing plays are an essential part of the scoring strategy. The numbers indicate that teams who excel in the passing game are more likely to find themselves in the end zone. As the game continues to evolve, the reliance on passing plays for scoring touchdowns is only expected to grow. In conclusion, passing plays contribute significantly to the overall number of touchdowns scored in football. While it varies from team to team and season to season, it remains a vital part of a winning strategy and an electrifying aspect of the sport that fans love."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Given the background: Old age begins in the mid-60s and lasts until the end of life. Many people over 65 have retired from work, freeing up their time for hobbies, grandchildren, and other interests. Stamina, strength, reflex time, and the senses all decline during old age, and the number of brain cells decreases as well. The immune system becomes less efficient, increasing the risk of serious illnesses such as cancer and pneumonia. Diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease that cause loss of mental function also become more common. and the situation: Mark has just graduated high school and is going to visit his grandpa, Tom, over the summer for a couple days. Since Tom is retired, he often has plenty of time to go fishing, and he even has a small cabin by the lake. The two men are planning to spend several days at the cabin cooking, fishing, chopping firewood to make fires and just general outdoor activities. Answer the following question: Is Tom's chance of getting sick while at the cabin higher or lower than Mark's? A:","completion":"Based on the given background information, Tom's chance of getting sick while at the cabin would likely be higher than Mark's. This is because Tom is in old age, and as a result, his immune system has become less efficient, increasing his risk of serious illnesses such as cancer and pneumonia. Additionally, his stamina, strength, reflex time, and senses have all declined, which may further increase his susceptibility to injuries or illnesses during outdoor activities. On the other hand, Mark, being young and having just graduated high school, is likely to have a stronger immune system and greater physical capabilities, which would contribute to a lower chance of getting sick when compared to Tom."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The Georgian-Armenian War was a short border dispute fought in December 1918 between the newly-independent Democratic Republic of Georgia and the First Republic of Armenia, largely over the control of former districts of Tiflis Governorate, in Borchaly and Akhalkalaki. In March 1918, Russia signed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk and in doing so agreed to return to the Ottoman Empire territory gained during the 1877-78 Russo-Turkish War. These territories were, however, no longer under the functional control of the Russian central government; rather, they were being administered collectively by the Georgians, Armenians and Azerbaijanis through the Transcaucasian Sejm. The Trebizond Peace Conference aimed to resolve the dispute, but when the conference failed to produce a resolution, the Ottomans pursued a military campaign to control the disputed territories. Under persistent attack, the Transcaucasian collective eventually dissolved with the Georgians, Armenians and Azerbaijanis declaring independent nation states in quick succession in late-May 1918. On 4 June, the Ottoman Empire signed the Treaty of Batum with each of the three Transcaucasian states, which brought the conflict to an end and awarded the southern half of the ethnically-Armenian Lori Province and Akhalkalaki district to the Ottomans. Against the wishes of Armenia, Georgia, supported by German officers, took possession of northern Lori and established military outposts along the Dzoraget River. When the Ottomans signed the Armistice of Mudros in October, they were subsequently required to withdraw from the region. Armenia quickly took control of territory previously controlled by the Ottomans, and skirmishes between Armenia and Georgia arose starting on 18 October. Open warfare began in early December, after diplomatic efforts failed to resolve the issue of the disputed border, and continued until 31 December, when a British-brokered ceasefire was signed, leaving the disputed territory under joint Georgian and Armenian administration.

Marley tells Scrooge that the uncharitable are tormented after death, and he has come to warn Scrooge as well as tell him that Scrooge will be visited by three ghosts over the next three nights. The ghosts will try to convince Scrooge to reform. At midnight, Scrooge is visited by the Ghost of Christmas Past (Joel Grey). They visit Ebenezer Scrooge as a child, who is forced to spend his holidays at school due to his father's rejection. Scrooge's sister, Fran, arrives to tell Scrooge he is welcome at home again. The ghost then takes Scrooge to the business of his mentor, Albert Fezziwig (Ian McNeice).

To do this, we'll divide both sides by 35: -280 / 35 = 35 * j / 35 This gives us: -8 = j So, j (or candies) is equal to -8.

After the Heartbleed bug, researchers took a closer look at OpenSSL - and found more problems The Internet had a collective panic attack in April when researchers disclosed a major security flaw in an encryption library used by servers across the Web to secure sensitive Web traffic against digital snooping. The bug, termed \\"Heartbleed,\\" allowed hackers to grab the random bits of data, potentially exposing users passwords and encryption keys. There was a mad rush to fix the problem, which affected some major tech companies, including Yahoo and Google. But security experts say servers vulnerable to coding bugs on a open source encryption library known as OpenSSL are still out there in the digital wild. On Thursday, OpenSSL disclosed a handful of new bugs discovered since Heartbleed and also shared the fixes. The most significant of the issues left some users vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle attack, in which a hacker can jump between users and online services and trick them into using weak encryption keys that could allow the hackers to intercept or even modify traffic. Security experts say the problem appears to have existed in some versions of the code dating back as far as 1998. But executing an attack via this bug would require a pretty specific set of circumstances: Both the server and the end user's client (a browser, another type of software package that connects online, or the connection on an embedded device) need to be using an affected version. Plus, the bad guy has to be somewhere between the both of them, be it sniffing on an open coffee shop wireless or somewhere with access at the Internet Service Provider level, said Nicholas J. Percoco, vice president of strategic services at cybersecurity firm Rapid7. And major desktop browsers including Chrome, Firefox, Safari and Internet Explorer aren't at risk, according to security experts, although Google did release an update of Chrome for Android on Thursday to address issues related to OpenSSL. Most experts agree that the specific circumstances needed to mount this type of attack makes it less serious that Heartbleed, but Percoco said the bug still raises a number of issues. Chief among them, he said, is that, although this bug was recently discovered by a Japanese security researcher working at cybersecurity firm Lepidum, that worker might not have been the first person to find it. Because the man-in-the-middle attack works by tricking both the user and the server simultaneously and has been around for a long time, Percoco said there's no way to know if an individual hacker or even a group may have been exploiting it for years. Percoco said the bug could be a threat to some \\"embedded\\" devices, such as Internet-connected kitchen appliances that run older versions of the OpenSSL and do not have a way to update. The recently discovered OpenSSL bugs are the latest in a string of incidents that call into question the security of open source tools that many Web sites rely on to protect sensitive information. “It doesn't surprise me that we are seeing a number of new reported flaws in OpenSSL,” HyTrust chief architect Steve Pate said in a statement. “After the Heartbleed bug was announced, one thing we could guarantee was that all eyes would be on the OpenSSL source code, scrutinizing it for issues.” Indeed, Masashi Kikuchi, the researcher who detected the man-in-the-middle bug with OpenSSL, said he found it when he started taking a closer look at OpenSSL after learning about Heartbleed. And he's not the only one. At the time Heartbleed was disclosed, many wondered why a security tool so widely deployed was being maintained by a lone employee working out of his house near Frederick, Md., and a volunteer force of less than a dozen developers around the world. Compared to some for-profit projects, Percoco said, OpenSSL and other open source encryption tools are \\"extremely under-resourced.\\" Often, open source projects aren't put through the same the same level of testing that privately-developed tools are, he said. However, Percoco also noted that there is a trade-off. Tools developed in the open can be audited by a member of the public at any time. Think of it as crowdsourcing security. But Heartbleed and other high-profile issues with open source security tools, like the mysterious situation with TrueCrypt, may suggest that's not enough, security experts say. Weeks after the Heartbleed disclosure, a coalition of major tech companies and the Linux Foundation joined together to create the Core Infrastructure Initiative -- committing millions over the next few years to maintain and support open source tools deemed key to keeping the Internet running smoothly. What was the first project they announced they'd be supporting? OpenSSL.

The system required the user to encode the default spelling first into a quasi-phonetic rendering .","completion":"Yes, the two sentences do essentially mean the same thing. They both indicate that a system is asking for the user to transform what is referred to as the \\"standard\\" or \\"default\\" spelling of a word or words into a format that is quasi-phonetic, or somewhat representative of the sounds of the words. Both sentences involve the same actors (system, user) and the same actions (requiring, encoding). The only differences are the adjectives used to describe the type of spelling (standard vs. default) and the position of \\"first\\". 1. In the first sentence, \\"The system required the user to first encode the standard spelling into a quasi-phonetic rendering.\\", 'first' refers to the order in which the system requires the actions to be performed, in a sense indicating urgency or priority. It suggests that before doing anything else, the user must encode the spelling. 2. In the second sentence, \\"The system required the user to encode the default spelling first into a quasi-phonetic rendering.\\", 'first' still indicates the order of operations, but it is less immediately imperative in its positioning, indicating that this step must come first in the process, but not necessarily before all other actions in general. In terms of the difference between \\"standard\\" and \\"default\\", while they could potentially mean different things in different contexts, in this case they seem to be used synonymously, indicating the regular or common spelling of the words in question. However, to further understand if there is any nuance between \\"standard\\" and \\"default\\", they could be interpreted as such: - \\"Standard spelling\\" refers to the generally accepted correct way of spelling as per linguistic rules, dictionaries, and common use. - \\"Default spelling\\" could refer to the most commonly used spelling or the spelling that a particular system or resource (like a word processor) automatically assumes or suggests. Again, in the given sentences, they are most likely considered to be synonyms. But if there were further context, the interpretations could vary. So, summing up, despite the minor variations in word choice and placement, the main idea communicated in both sentences is effectively the same: the system requires that the user first takes the usual spelling of words and encodes it into a quasi-phonetic rendering. The variations in wording don't significantly alter the fundamental meaning of the sentences."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Many people think that in the future computers will be used a lot in everyday's life. It is thought that we won't have to go shopping because we will be able to get most things which are sold in shops on the Internet. There will be fewer books because we will be able to get all texts from computers. The Internet will be used to play games, see films and buy food. Most telephone calls will be made by computers, too. Some people are glad about these new ways of shopping and communicating . Others do not think that computers will replace our old ways. Let's take books for example. Some people think that one day we won't read books made of paper. Instead, we will buy and read books using computers. We will read texts on small pocket computers. The computers will keep many different books in them at the same time. We won't need to turn lots of pages and paper will be saved. Computerized books will be used more and more. Is Internet shopping such a pleasure as going to the shop? Many people say it is not. It is a pleasure to go into shops and look at things you want to buy. It is also unlikely that many people will want to read large texts on our computers. Because paper books will perhaps be more friendly. Maybe computers won't change these two habits .

Here's a question: What is likely the result of falling in gravel while running? Here are possible answers to this question: - heart attack - falling down - weight loss - stitches - exhaustion I believe the correct choice is \\"stitches\\", here's why: Answer:","completion":"Falling in gravel while running is likely to result in injuries, with the most probable outcome being cuts and abrasions that might require stitches. Here's an analysis of the possible answers you provided: 1. Heart attack: A heart attack is not directly related to falling in gravel. It is a medical emergency caused by the blockage of blood flow to the heart muscle, typically due to a blood clot. 2. Falling down: Falling down is a description of the action itself, not the result of the action. When you fall in gravel while running, falling down is what happens, rather than the outcome. 3. Weight loss: Falling in gravel while running does not contribute to weight loss. Weight loss occurs when you consistently burn more calories than you consume through a combination of exercise and a calorie-controlled diet. 4. Stitches: This is the most likely result among the options provided. When you fall in gravel while running, you risk sustaining cuts and abrasions on your skin. If these cuts are deep enough, they may require stitches to close the wound and prevent infection. 5. Exhaustion: While running could cause exhaustion, falling in gravel does not usually lead directly to exhaustion. Exhaustion is a state of extreme physical or mental fatigue and is more related to overall exertion and activity levels rather than the result of a single fall. In conclusion, the most likely result of falling in gravel while running is sustaining cuts and abrasions that might require stitches, depending on the depth and severity of the injuries."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Generate a question about the following movie plot: On an unidentified planet, a strange lifeform in the shape of gel-like spores drifts up into the atmosphere, where it moves slowly through space, drifting until it reaches Earth. The spores enter the atmosphere and are swept downward, emerging in a rainstorm in San Francisco. On the ground, the spores begin to develop, growing on leaves of earthly plants and taking the shape of small pods with a pink flower in the middle.Elizabeth Driscoll (Brooke Adams) notices one of the pods, taking it back to the home she shares with her boyfriend, Geoffrey (Art Hindle). Unable to find the flowering pod in any of her botany books, she hesitantly identifies her new find as a cross-breeding of two different species, a \\"grex.\\"Matthew Bennell (Donald Sutherland) is an inspector for the health department who uncovers unsanitary conditions at a French restaurant. As he threatens the owner with indictment over finding rat droppings in the food, the other employees quietly slip out to the parking lot and smash Matthew's windshield with a bottle of wine. Matthew is cold and calculating, refusing to let them see his frustration at finding his car vandalized, but when he gets home he calls Elizabeth. They work together at the health department, and Matthew jokes with her about what happened to him at the restaurant. As Elizabeth goes to bed, she forgets about the weird pod, which has suddenly sprouted roots in the glass of water she keeps it in next to their bed.When Elizabeth wakes the next morning, Geoffrey is already awake and dressed, cleaning up the remains of the glass of water next to the bed, as well as some other, unidentifiable mess (resembling some kind of dust). His behavior is strange, and she follows him downstairs as he takes a plastic garbage bag out to a waiting dump truck. At work, she confides to Matthew that Geoffrey is acting strange. Later that night, Elizabeth tries to talk it over with Geoffrey but he ignores her, instead telling her that he's going out and giving her no explanation. Elizabeth touches him... The answer to this question is:","completion":"Given the depth and detail of the movie plot, here is a possible question: \\"Discuss the foreshadowing, the role and transformation of key characters like Elizabeth Driscoll and Matthew Bennell, as well as the symbolic use of alien lifeforms in the form of gel-like spores, and the implications of these narrative elements on the overall themes and messages in the sci-fi movie.\\" To address this question, one would need to firstly analyze the foreshadowing aspect in the film. The appearance of the gel-like spores traveling through space and arriving on Earth sets a tone for the upcoming events where Earth's life forms undergo transformation. It sets the stage for suspense and paves the way for the strange occurrences that follow. Elizabeth's character plays a crucial role in the plot, as she could be seen as the first human who senses the strangeness brought about by the spores. Her reaction to the unusual pod she discovers and her attentive observation of Geoffrey's changing behaviors highlight her keen sense of detection. This raises questions about human alienation, identity, and the fear of the unknown. Her boyfriend, Geoffrey, serves as the first evidence of the spore's influence, and gives us insights into the intentions and capabilities of these alien life forms. Matthew Bennell's persona as an inspector further adds intrigue to the narrative. His experience with the restaurant employees foreshadows the resistance and confrontations the main characters are likely to face from the forces of the alien spores. Bennell stands as a symbol of authority, law, and discipline, pushing against the chaotic, inhuman influence of the spores. Talking about the symbolic use of alien lifeforms (spores), they could be symbolic of any foreign or unknown entity that imposes sudden and gradual changes on a community, suggesting themes of invasion, loss of control, or the struggle of adapting to change. The overall theme of the film can be seen as a commentary on the fear of the unknown, the threat of external forces, human identity or life being disrupted by forces beyond their control. The transformation of characters under the influence of the alien spores could also draw parallels to societal changes, the loss of individuality, and humanity's struggle to maintain its essence amid external pressures."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Anger against the small settlement of La-Mort-aux-Juifs - which has a population of less than 20 and is around 60 miles south of Paris - comes amid increasing claims of anti-Jewish prejudice in France. The Simon Wiesenthal Centre, an. internationally renowned Jewish pressure group, has now sent a letter to. France's Interior Minister to complain about the hamlet's name, and. express shock that nothing has previously been done to address its. controversial moniker. Controversial: Anger against the small settlement of La-Mort-aux-Juifs (pictured) - which has a population of less than 20 and is 60 miles south of Paris - comes amid increasing claims of anti-Jewish prejudice in France. Shimon. Samuels, director of the SWC, said he was 'shocked to discover the. existence of a village in France officially called 'Death to Jews'. Referring. to the Second World War Nazi Occupation and the French collaborator. government, Mr Samuels added: 'It is extremely shocking that this name. has slipped under the radar in the 70 years that have passed since. France was liberated from Nazism and the Vichy regime.' Local police and the national railway, the SNCF, assisted the Nazis during the Holocaust, which saw about 76,000 French Jews murdered. Many more were persecuted in major cities, including Paris, where 'round-ups' were regularly carried out by the Nazis. But the deputy mayor of the village of Courtemaux - population 289 - which has jurisdiction over 'La-Mort-aux-Juifs', said nobody had anything to be ashamed of. 'It's ridiculous. This name has always existed,' said Marie-Elizabeth Secretand, in an interview with France's national news agency, AFP. 'No one has anything against the Jews, of course. It doesn't surprise me that this is coming up again.' History: Local police and the national railway, the SNCF, assisted the Nazis during the Holocaust, which saw about 76,000 French Jews (pictured) murdered. Changing the name would require a decision by the municipal council, and Ms Secretand said this was unlikely to be successful. 'Why change a name that goes back to the Middle Ages or even further?,' she said. 'We should respect these old names. 'A previous municipal council, at least 20 years ago, already refused to change the name of this hamlet, which consists of a farm and two houses.' The Israeli offensive against Gaza, in which hundreds of civilians including young children have died, has led to claims of increased anti-Semitism in France. Others say that the increasing electoral success of the far-right National Front, whose founder Jean Marie Le Pen is a convicted anti-Semite, is another reason why Jews are feeling unsafe. There are currently around 500,000 Jews in France, but many are expressing a desire to emigrate to places where they will feel more secure. Castrillo Matajudios - which means 'Castrillo Kill Jews' - is a Spanish village which voted to change its name in May.","completion":"A small village in France called \\"Death to Jews\\" has a name that some people don't like, because it sounds mean towards Jewish people. Some people want the village to change its name, but the leaders of the village say the name is very old and doesn't need to be changed. They say the name doesn't mean they don't like Jewish people.

Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers: Energy also constantly changes back and forth between kinetic and potential energy. Kinetic energy is the energy of movement. For example, a ball falling through the air has kinetic energy because it is moving ( Figure below ). The random motion of molecules is due to kinetic energy, and the driving force behind diffusion.

As stated in the paragraph, \\"Energy also constantly changes back and forth between kinetic and potential energy.\\" Potential energy is the stored energy of an object based on its position or state. It can be converted to kinetic energy, which is the energy of movement. This constant change between kinetic and potential energy occurs in many natural systems, like a ball falling through the air or the random motion of molecules due to kinetic energy and diffusion. For example, a ball held in the air has potential energy due to its position relative to the ground. As it falls, the potential energy is converted to kinetic energy, which is the energy of the ball's motion. When the ball reaches the ground, it may bounce back up, converting some of its kinetic energy back into potential energy as it rises against gravity. This cycle of energy conversion between kinetic and potential forms is a fundamental principle in the study of energy and motion."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Mark Rutte is identified as the current leader of the Netherlands, suggesting him to be a prominent figure in the country's political sphere. A leader can be anyone in a position of authority or superiority, whether in government, industry, academia, or other fields. Here, given the context, it appears to refer to a political leader, likely the Prime Minister or similar high-ranking position. The second piece of information relates to Ab Klink. The data does not specify his occupation or status, but by including his name next to a noted personality like Mark Rutte, it is implied that he is of some importance. The common factor between them is their birthplace, the Netherlands. This implies that Ab Klink, like Mark Rutte, is a Dutch national. Presumably, these data points would be related or relevant in a broader context. For instance, they could be used in a study or report regarding notable individuals from the Netherlands or in a comparative analysis of Dutch-born individuals in various professional fields. The facts might also be relevant to investigations into their personal backgrounds, professional achievements, or contributions to Dutch society or globally. While the exact relevance or application of these facts would depend largely on the broader context, this sentence effectively conveys these specific data points. It succinctly communicates the nationality and (in Rutte's case) the professional status of these two individuals, leaving further details to be explored or discussed in the surrounding material. In conclusion, the sentence presents two individuals, Mark Rutte and Ab Klink, identifies their shared birthplace as the Netherlands and states Rutte's position as a leader. Each of these details could be elaborated upon or investigated further depending on the context and purpose for which this information is being used."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question 2: Why did MS Dhoni step down from the captaincy of limited overs? Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","completion":"Yes, questions 1 and 2 are asking the same thing. They are both inquiring about the reasons behind MS Dhoni stepping down as captain of India's limited overs side. Answer: Mahendra Singh Dhoni, commonly known as MS Dhoni, is widely considered one of the greatest cricketing captains of all time. He has led the Indian cricket team to numerous victories, including the 2007 ICC T20 World Cup, the 2010 and 2016 Asia Cups, and the 2011 ICC Cricket World Cup. Despite his immense success as a leader, Dhoni decided to step down from the captaincy of India's limited overs team in January 2017. There are several factors that contributed to this decision: 1. Prioritizing personal batting performance: Dhoni is not only an excellent captain but also one of the most effective finishers and wicket-keeper batsmen in the cricket world. By stepping down as captain, Dhoni aimed to focus more on his batting performance, which might have been affected due to additional responsibilities as captain. As a veteran cricketer, he wanted to ensure that he was still able to contribute effectively to the team as a player. 2. Developing future leadership: As a forward-thinking player, Dhoni recognized that it was essential for the Indian cricket team to develop a new set of leaders who could guide the team in the future. He wanted to give an opportunity to younger and emerging players like Virat Kohli, who was already successful as the Test captain, to lead the team and gain experience in the limited overs format. 3. Maintaining a well-balanced team for major tournaments: Around the time when Dhoni resigned from captaincy, the Indian cricket team was undergoing a transition phase with the infusion of new talents. Dhoni felt that it was necessary to find the best combination of players and leadership to ensure a strong and balanced team for upcoming major tournaments such as the 2019 ICC Cricket World Cup. 4. Handling workload and management of professional career: Leading an international cricket team involves tremendous dedication, hard work, and mental strength. As a captain, Dhoni had to manage various aspects related to the team’s performance, strategy, and other off-field responsibilities. Stepping down from captaincy allowed him to manage his workload better, reduce any potential stress, and prolong his professional cricket career. 5. Setting an example of selflessness and sportsmanship: Dhoni has always been known for his humility, calm demeanor, and selfless attitude. His decision to step down from captaincy demonstrated his willingness to put the team's interests ahead of his personal achievements and success. By choosing not to hold onto the captaincy, Dhoni set an example of sportsmanship for the next generation of cricketers. In conclusion, MS Dhoni's decision to step down as the captain of India's limited overs team was driven by a combination of factors, including focusing on his personal performance, preparing future leadership, and prioritizing the best interests of the team. His decision has allowed new talents to emerge and take up the mantle, ensuring that Indian cricket continues to thrive and evolve."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The three Kansas militiamen planned to blow up an apartment complex housing Somali refugees during the 2016 presidential election, unleashing what one of them called \\"Crusades 2.0.\\" But their plan was foiled after their arrest just weeks before the election, highlighting the changing enemy list of a movement founded on the back of anti-government activism a generation ago. And with the election of a president whose policies many militia members support, the urge to confront the government appears to have lost some of its urgency. Instead of railing at the government, they have in recent years turned their venom against new-found foes: Muslims, immigrants, the Antifa. \\"Some of the militia groups have been refocusing their attention on secondary enemies for the movement,\\" said Mark Pitcavage, who researches extremism at the Anti-Defamation League civil rights group. Often lumped together with other right-wing groups, the anti-government movement comes in different forms. There are the \\"preppers,\\" so called because they stockpile water, food and other essentials in preparation for civil unrest. There are the \\"survivalists,\\" people who learn skills to “live off the land” in case of a disaster. There are “sovereign citizens” such as the suspect in the recent shooting at a Waffle House in Tennessee who are opposed to paying taxes and believe they should decide which laws to follow. And then there are the militiamen who conduct regular military-style training to resist a government they see as engaged in a global plot to take away their guns and constitutional rights. The modern militia movement dates back to a series of events in the early 1990s, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center.

However, that being said, some key figures and pioneers in DJ history can be credited with significant contributions to the development of DJ culture and techniques. 1. Kool Herc: Clive Campbell, better known as DJ Kool Herc, is often regarded as the father of hip-hop. Born in Jamaica and raised in New York City, Kool Herc was one of the earliest DJs to gain widespread recognition for his innovative techniques, like extending the instrumental breaks in records for dancers to perform during \\"breakbeats.\\" This laid the foundation for what later became known as hip-hop culture. 2. Grandmaster Flash: Joseph Saddler, better known as Grandmaster Flash, is another influential figure in DJ music's early days, especially within hip-hop. Flash perfected the art of \\"cutting\\" and \\"scratching,\\" which involves manipulating the vinyl records on a turntable to create new sounds and rhythmic patterns. He and the Furious Five, his group, are widely credited with popularizing hip-hop and rap music. 3. Frankie Knuckles: Born in the Bronx, Frankie Knuckles, also known as the \\"Godfather of House Music,\\" is one of the key pioneers of the house genre. After moving to Chicago, he became a resident DJ at the famous Warehouse club, where he mixed disco, electronic, and soul music with innovative EQ and effects techniques to create the basis for what is now known as house music. 4. Larry Levan: Another crucial figure in the evolution of DJ culture, Larry Levan was a DJ at New York's legendary Paradise Garage club. His eclectic mix of music and innovative DJing techniques, including blending various genres like disco, punk, and funk, greatly influenced the development of dance music throughout the late 1970s and 1980s.

Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: You may have read some of the scary research recently that links parabens (a preservative ingredient found in loads of health and beauty products) with breast cancer, and whilst there is no evidence yet to prove that using parabens causes breast cancer more and more people are choosing to ditch parabens in favour of something more natural. I’m gradually trying to replace all of my old skincare and bodycare products with natural alternatives so that my body comes into contact with less parabens and other nasty chemicals. One of the types of products which seems to be very late to the natural table is deodorant, there isn’t a wide variety of paraben-free products available yet but I was really pleased to see that Soft & Gentle, a well-known household brand, had brought out this new 0% Aluminium Dry Deodorant. It’s free from parabens, allergens and aluminium and uses astringent plant extracts that shrink the sweat pores to reduce perspiration whilst natural herb sage acts as a deodoriser. Available in three fragrances – Active, Floral and Care – I’ve been using the Floral Soft & Gentle 0% Aluminium Dry Deodorant for over 2 weeks and I’ve really put it through its paces as the temperature has been fairly hot and humid for the last fortnight. With a deodorant there are 2 main factors that we can look at to evaluate its success – dryness and odour control. So how did this paraben free Soft & Gentle deodorant fare? With regard to dryness I found that it kept me dry all day. I’ve been walking 2 miles or more most days and the weather has been warm, over 25 degrees some days, and I’ve been feeling generally a bit hot and sticky. But not on my underarms, they’ve been dry and I feel confident that this deodorant controls my sweat. In the first couple of days I did notice a little bit of unpleasant odour, but then I increased the amount that I was spraying under each arm and after this I’ve experienced no problems whatsoever, even after doing exercise or going on a long walk.

Context: Paul Reynolds crisscrossed his sketchbook with furious strokes, filling the pages with images of the vengeance he would take on his former coworkers at Fear and Loading Games. He'd founded the company three years back and, just a few hours ago, his partners and erstwhile friends had fired him without cause or warning. He concentrated hard as his pen brought to life demonic figures from one of the best-selling comics he'd created, scythe wielding cyber-men called Myrmidons who tore into surprised computer programmers with fangs and claws. Elsewhere on the page, computers assembled themselves into 21st century Golems, rising up against traitorous CEO's and producers to crush them to bloody pulp as they cowered beneath their desks. Sitting at the bar in Señor Goldstein's Mexican Restaurant in San Jose, California, Paul's own artwork engaged him for the first time in months, maybe years. Under other circumstances, that would have made him happy. But today's circumstances allowed only two emotions: despair and a burning desire for revenge. Not wanting to succumb to the former, and not quite wanting to find a gun and go back to the office, he instead drew. He had turned to a fresh page and begun to sketch his most elaborate revenge-scheme yet when a woman walked into his line of vision. There were four or five other women in the restaurant already (most of them employees), but this one stood out. This one would've stood out anywhere. Her hair, cut short and spiky, was dyed a magenta so bright it nearly glowed. She wore a tight black t-shirt, baggy olive drab shorts that hung on shapely hips, and heavy black boots with two inch thick soles. She had a faded black messenger bag slung across her chest, the strap pressing between her breasts. If Paul had to guess, she wasn't wearing a bra.

The people who take care of a big, important building called the British Museum bought this cup for a lot of money (£1.8 million!). They thought this cup was very special and very, very old. They believed it was made by people who lived a long time ago, called the Romans. But now, there is a person called an archaeologist who thinks the cup is not as old as the museum people thought it was. Instead of being from the time when the Romans lived, this cup might be from a time much closer to us, in the 20th century. The Warren Cup is beautifully decorated and it has pictures on it that tell us about the people who made it. The people at the British Museum thought these pictures were from the time of the Romans, but now they are not so sure. The archaeologist who thinks the cup is not as old as it seems studied it very, very carefully. He looked at the pictures and the way the cup was made, and he said, \\"I think this cup might be from the 20th century.\\" This discovery has created quite a surprise for the people who take care of the British Museum. They spent a lot of money on the Warren Cup because they thought it was very, very old. Now, they are looking at the cup again and trying to figure out if the archaeologist is right.

In the end, whether it's from the ancient Roman times or the 20th century, the Warren Cup is still a very interesting and valuable piece of history. It teaches us to be careful when we try to learn about the past, and it reminds us that sometimes, even very smart people can make mistakes.

Question: Question: \\"What determined the end?\\" Context: \\"In 1926, Universal opened a production unit in Germany, Deutsche Universal-Film AG, under the direction of Joe Pasternak. This unit produced three to four films per year until 1936, migrating to Hungary and then Austria in the face of Hitler's increasing domination of central Europe. With the advent of sound, these productions were made in the German language or, occasionally, Hungarian or Polish. In the U.S., Universal Pictures did not distribute any of this subsidiary's films, but at least some of them were exhibited through other, independent, foreign-language film distributors based in New York, without benefit of English subtitles. Nazi persecution and a change in ownership for the parent Universal Pictures organization resulted in the dissolution of this subsidiary.\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"The end of Deutsche Universal-Film AG, Universal's production unit in Germany, was determined by a combination of factors, including Nazi persecution, Hitler's increasing dominance in central Europe, and a change in ownership for the parent company, Universal Pictures. The unit initially produced films from 1926 until 1936, but as Hitler expanded his control, the unit moved to Hungary and Austria. Alongside these challenges, the advent of sound led to productions being made in German or other languages, which limited their distribution in the United States.

The original question asks about the number of representatives in Congress in 2011 and the suggested answer focuses on the Democrats retaining their Senate majority.

Instead, consider the following detailed answer: The United States Congress is divided into two chambers: the House of Representatives and the Senate. The question asks for the number of representatives in Congress in 2011, which suggests that it specifically relates to the House of Representatives. Every two years, all 435 seats in the House of Representatives are up for election. The number of representatives remains the same across different years, despite the possibility of changes in party composition. In 2011, the 112th Congress held session, with the following party breakdown in the House of Representatives: The Republicans held 242 seats, and the Democrats held 193 seats. Consequently, there were 435 representatives in Congress during the year 2011. To provide more context, it is worth mentioning that although the Democrats did retain their majority in the Senate, it was reduced from 57 (plus 2 independents who caucused with them) in the previous (or 111th) Congress to 53 (plus 2 independents who caucused with them) in the 112th Congress.

Given the context: What will happen to Others? Possible answers: be thankful, keep playing, be bothered The answer is:","completion":"be bothered. Given that Sasha is playing bass guitar very skillfully in the middle of the night, it is likely that others around her will be affected by her actions. Depending on the living situation, her neighbors or family members may be disturbed by the sound of her playing, regardless of how well she is playing. While it is true that some individuals may be thankful for the skill with which Sasha is playing, it is important to consider the timing of her actions. In the middle of the night, most people are trying to sleep, and any kind of noise disruption can be quite bothersome. Furthermore, the bass guitar is known for its low-frequency, rich sound that can easily penetrate walls and become an annoyance for those who wish to rest. Even though Sasha's talents and her love for playing bass guitar might encourage her to keep playing, it is important to be considerate of those around her. Many people might struggle to fall back asleep after being awakened by the sounds of a bass guitar, leading to potential frustration and discomfort. Additionally, the continuous disturbance during nighttime hours may result in strained relationships between Sasha and her neighbors or family members. To minimize the impact of her late-night practice sessions on those around her, Sasha might consider soundproofing her practice space or investing in an electronic instrument with headphones. This would allow her to continue honing her skills without causing disturbances to the people in her surroundings. In conclusion, given the context of Sasha playing bass guitar skillfully in the middle of the night, the most probable reaction from others would be to feel bothered by the noise. Although her skill level might be impressive, the timing of her playing sessions is not ideal and could lead to negative consequences for both herself and those around her. It is important for her to find a more suitable time or alternative methods of practicing to ensure that her passion for music does not inadvertently impact the well-being of others."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Article:","completion":"Title: Be a Super Helper: Taking Initiative and Becoming Better at Problem Solving Hey kids, have you ever wanted to be a superhero that can solve problems and help people? Well, you don't need a cape or special powers to be a super helper. All you need to do is take initiative, challenge yourself, and boost your creativity! Let's find out how you can become a master at solving problems and helping others. First, let's talk about taking initiative. Initiative means doing things without waiting for someone to tell you to do it. This is like when you see your toys on the floor and put them away without your mom or dad asking you to. By doing tasks without being asked, you can show that you are responsible and willing to help others. Next, seek more challenging work. When you work on things that are easy for you, it's like playing with the same toy over and over again – it can get boring! Instead, try new challenges to make your brain stronger, just like exercising does for your muscles. For example, if you are good at coloring inside the lines of a picture, try drawing your own picture. Or if you can build a small tower with your blocks, try building something bigger and more complicated, like a castle. When you solve harder problems, you learn new skills that can help you become a super problem solver! Now, let's talk about improving your problem-solving skills. Remember a time when you had to figure something out, like a puzzle or a math problem? It felt good when you found the right answer, didn't it? To get better at problem-solving, practice doing puzzles or asking questions about how things work. For example, if you don't understand why the sky is blue, ask your teacher or look for a book that explains it in a fun way. The more questions you ask and problems you try to solve, the stronger your problem-solving superpowers will become! Lastly, it's important to boost your creativity. Creativity is like using your imagination to come up with new ideas or make something amazing. You can do this by trying new art projects, playing music, or making up stories with your friends. When you use your creativity, you become more likely to think of unique solutions to problems that other people might not see. So, remember, to be a super helper, take initiative by doing tasks without waiting for someone else to ask; challenge yourself with harder work to learn new skills; practice solving puzzles and asking questions; and, most importantly, have fun exploring your creativity! By doing these things, you'll become a problem-solving superhero who can help others and make the world a better place."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

When Roman goes to meet with him again he finds Roenick murdered seconds before other police arrive, pinning him as the prime suspect. Things only get worse for Roman when Internal Affairs investigator Terence Niebaum (J. T.

After the gun that killed Roenick is linked to a case Roman had worked on, Niebaum and other investigators search Roman's house and discover papers for an offshore bank account with a deposit equal to one of the amounts of money embezzled. Roman is made to surrender his gun and badge and his colleagues are doubtful of his protests of innocence. With murder and embezzlement charges pending, Roman storms into Niebaum's office and demands answers about who set him up. When Niebaum stonewalls, Roman takes Niebaum, his administrative assistant Maggie (Siobhan Fallon), police commander Grant Frost (Ron Rifkin), and two-bit con man Rudy Timmons (Paul Giamatti) as hostages. With the building evacuated and placed under siege by his own CPD unit and the FBI, Roman issues his conditions: finding Roenick's informant and summoning police Lt.

Roman believes he can trust Sabian because he negotiates for as long as possible and see using force as a last resort, and being from another precinct eliminates him as a suspect in the disability fund scheme.

The Colts headed to Gillette Stadium for a highly anticipated Sunday Night Football matchup with the New England Patriots in Week 9. In the first quarter, an interception in the end zone by Colts rookie FS Antoine Bethea set up the Colts' first scoring drive, a 68-yard march that ended with a 5-yard touchdown pass from QB Peyton Manning to WR Marvin Harrison for the only score of the quarter. Already banged up on defense, the Patriots lost SS Rodney Harrison to a shoulder injury in the first quarter, and he never returned to the game. The second quarter was a lot more eventful after two scores by Patriots RB Corey Dillon, a TD run by Colts rookie RB Joseph Addai, and a field goal by Colts kicker Adam Vinatieri. The Patriots played from behind for the rest of the game and could not catch up to the Colts. Patriots QB Tom Brady was intercepted four times in the defeat, and Colts LB Cato June intercepted two of those passes. Also of note, Colts WR Marvin Harrison had 8 catches in the game for 145 yards and two touchdowns. The victory marked the Colts' second straight versus the Patriots after having lost the previous six. With the win, the Colts became just the second team in NFL history to begin consecutive seasons 8-0 (the Green Bay Packers began three consecutive seasons 8-0 from 1929 to 1931).

The other members did not take his statement seriously, until an article appeared in New Musical Express on 4 April featuring Quaife's new band, Maple Oak, which he had formed without telling the rest of the Kinks. Ray Davies pleaded with him to return for the sessions for their upcoming album, but Quaife refused. Davies immediately called up John Dalton, who had filled in for Quaife in the past, as a replacement. Dalton remained with the group until 1977, when the album Sleepwalker was released.Ray Davies travelled to Los Angeles in April 1969 to help negotiate an end to the American Federation of Musicians' ban on the group, opening up an opportunity for them to return to touring in the US. The group's management quickly made plans for a North American tour, to help restore their standing in the US pop music scene. Before their return to the US, the Kinks recorded another album, Arthur (Or the Decline and Fall of the British Empire). As with the previous two albums, Arthur was grounded in characteristically English lyrical and musical hooks. A modest commercial success, it was well received by American music critics. Conceived as the score for a proposed but unrealised television drama, much of the album revolved around themes from the Davies brothers' childhood; their sister Rosie, who had migrated to Australia in the early 1960s with her husband, Arthur Anning, the album's namesake; and life growing up during the Second World War. The Kinks embarked on their tour of the US in October 1969. The tour was generally unsuccessful, as the group struggled to find cooperative promoters and interested audiences; many of the scheduled concert dates were cancelled. The band did, however, manage to play a few major venues such as the Fillmore East and Whisky a Go Go. Guess a valid title for it!

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose the limestone is covered and less water can reach it happens, how will it affect more limestone will disintegrate. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer is:","completion":"Yes, the supposed perturbation does have a direct effect on the process. In the outlined process, rainwater is responsible for causing an acidic reaction which, over time, disintegrates the limestone and forms a cave. If the limestone is covered and less water can reach it, the rate of limestone disintegration will be affected. When less water reaches the limestone, the acidic reaction caused by rainwater and limestone will be slowed down. Consequently, the rate at which the limestone disintegrates will decrease, leading to a slower process of cave formation. This perturbation directly impacts the erosion and dissolution of limestone, which in turn affects the formation of caves. Nonetheless, the process of cave formation will not be completely stopped because some level of water might still interact with the limestone, albeit with a reduced intensity. It is important to note that cave formation can also be influenced by other factors like the type and composition of the limestone, climate, and infiltration pathways. However, in the context of the mentioned perturbation, the decrease in rainwater exposure to limestone will have a direct effect on the rate of limestone disintegration and cave formation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

By urging the court to speed up the process, he aims to demonstrate the government's commitment to holding Saddam and his allies accountable for their actions while bringing a sense of closure for the Iraqi people who suffered under their rule. It is crucial to note that the underlying tone of the text also highlights the broader context of the political climate, international scrutiny, and the power dynamics in Iraq at the time. The call for faster proceedings could signify a desire to achieve justice swiftly and move forward from the trauma of the past, reinforcing the legitimacy of the interim government and ultimately facilitating the transition towards democracy and a more stable society."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Given the following passage \\"Culturally, an Ashkenazi Jew can be identified by the concept of Yiddishkeit, which means \\"Jewishness\\" in the Yiddish language. Yiddishkeit is specifically the Jewishness of Ashkenazi Jews. Before the Haskalah and the emancipation of Jews in Europe, this meant the study of Torah and Talmud for men, and a family and communal life governed by the observance of Jewish Law for men and women. From the Rhineland to Riga to Romania, most Jews prayed in liturgical Ashkenazi Hebrew, and spoke Yiddish in their secular lives. But with modernization, Yiddishkeit now encompasses not just Orthodoxy and Hasidism, but a broad range of movements, ideologies, practices, and traditions in which Ashkenazi Jews have participated and somehow retained a sense of Jewishness. Although a far smaller number of Jews still speak Yiddish, Yiddishkeit can be identified in manners of speech, in styles of humor, in patterns of association. Broadly speaking, a Jew is one who associates culturally with Jews, supports Jewish institutions, reads Jewish books and periodicals, attends Jewish movies and theater, travels to Israel, visits historical synagogues, and so forth.

It's also the 10th anniversary of the completion of the Human Genome Project, which set out to sequence the more than 3 billion letters in our genetic code. Biologist James Watson and physicist Francis Crick realized our DNA molecules form a three-dimensional double helix in 1953. But DNA research dates back to the late 1860s, according to Nature Education. Friedrich Miescher was the first to identify \\"nucleic acid\\" in our white blood cells; his 1869 finding was later named deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA. Others later defined the components that make up DNA molecules, identified RNA (ribonucleic acid, the other type of nucleic acid found in all cells along with DNA) and determined that although DNA differs in each species, it always maintains certain properties. Those findings led to Watson and Crick's conclusion, which paved the way for decades of DNA discoveries. Today we use DNA tests to tell us about all kinds of things -- from Justin Bieber's baby daddy status to the innocence of a man sitting on death row. But genetic scientists are doing more than trying to prove Bigfoot's existence. Here are five cool things DNA testing can do:. Map your family tree. A 99 DNA test could give you thousands of new relatives (although if they're anything like ours, we're not sure why you'd want them). Sites such as Ancestry.com offer to compare your DNA to those they already have on record in hopes of connecting you to unknown branches of your family tree. Ancestry.com's test can also tell you your genetic ethnicity. \\"The new test looks at a massive amount of your DNA ... and compares it to other DNA samples from around the world. By detecting similarities, we can trace back generations to connect you to the lands your ancestors once called home,\\" the site states. Solve ancient mysteries. No one knew where Richard III, one of the most famous kings of England, was buried until his remains were discovered in a parking lot in Leicester. The remains showed evidence of battle wounds and scoliosis, but scientists weren't sure the skeleton was Richard III's until DNA extracted from the bones was matched to Michael Ibsen, a direct descendant of the king's sister. It wasn't the first time ancient remains had been identified using DNA. If it's stored in a cold, dry, dark place, DNA can last for thousands of years. In 2009, a DNA analysis of some bone fragments showed two of Czar Nicholas II's children were killed along with the rest of the family during the Russian Revolution, despite speculation they could have escaped. Scientists have even extracted DNA from Neanderthals, who went extinct about 30,000 years ago, in hopes of gaining insight into the evolution of humans. Shakespeare, thou art stored in DNA. Distinguish your mutt. \\"Where does Buddy get his curly tail from? Why does he love digging holes in the backyard? Could I be doing more to make him happier and healthier? Your dog may not be able to tell you the answers -- but his DNA can,\\" claims one dog DNA site, WisdomPanel.com. You'll probably never figure out why Buddy loves to eat your favorite Italian pumps (other than the fact he's a dog) but you can figure out where he comes from. WisdomPanel.com will test your mutt's DNA against that of more than 190 breeds to determine his genetic background. \\"But why?\\" cat lovers may be asking. \\"When you understand your dog's natural tendencies, you can tailor a training, exercise and nutrition program to his needs,\\" the site explains. Predict the future. Using blood from the mother and saliva from the father, scientists can now determine whether a fetus has any chromosomal abnormalities that could cause a genetic disorder. For example, DNA testing can reveal if an unborn baby will have trisomy 21, or Down syndrome. Researchers are beginning to expand the field of prenatal genetic testing even further, using it to identify potential developmental delays and intellectual disabilities such as autism. Genetic testing can also reveal risk factors you may have inherited from your parents, such as a high risk for breast or colon cancer. While this genetic risk factor does not guarantee you will get the disease, it does increase your chances; knowing about the risk may help you take preventive steps. Help you lose weight. A growing body of research suggests that our ability to lose weight -- or gain 10 pounds by simply looking at a piece of chocolate -- is shaped in large part by our genes. Scientists have identified several gene variants that may predispose us, and our children, to obesity. Rodent studies have also shown that up to 80% of body fat is regulated by our genes, according to TIME. That said, we wouldn't search for a customized DNA Diet just yet. While there is a genetic component to obesity, our understanding of it is limited, says CNN diet and fitness expert Dr. Melina Jampolis. Researchers are still trying to figure out how genetics, nutrition and exercise are related so we can help people lose weight and keep it off. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"Happy National DNA Day! This day celebrates the discovery of the double helix structure of DNA by scientists James Watson and Francis Crick in 1953, as well as the completion of the Human Genome Project in 2003. DNA is a very important part of our body and helps us know many things about ourselves. Here are five cool things DNA testing can do: 1. Map your family tree: DNA tests can help you find your long-lost relatives and learn about your genetic background. 2. Solve ancient mysteries: Scientists can use DNA from old bones to learn about people who lived a long time ago, like kings and queens. 3. Learn about your dog: By testing your dog's DNA, you can find out what breed they are and understand their behavior better. 4. Predict the future: DNA tests can tell us about the health of unborn babies and if they may have certain medical conditions. 5.

Answer based on context: The largest population centres of the Sinhalese diaspora are mainly situated in Europe, North America and Australia. The city of Melbourne contains just under half of the Sri Lankan Australians. The 2011 census recorded 86,412 Sri Lanka born in Australia. There are 73,849 Australians (0.4 of the population) who reported having Sinhalese ancestry in 2006. The Sinhalese language was also reported to be the 29th-fastest-growing language in Australia (ranking above Somali language but behind Hindi language and Belarusian language). Sinhalese Australians have an exceptionally low rate of return migration to Sri Lanka. In the Canada 2011 Census, 7,220 people identified themselves as of Sri Lankan Canadians, out of 139,415 Sri Lankans. There are a small amount of Sri Lankans in India, scattered around the country, but mainly living in and around the North India and South India regions. Sri Lankan New Zealanders comprised 3% of the Asian population of New Zealand in 2001. The numbers arriving continued to increase, and at the 2006 census there were over 7,000 Sri Lankans living in New Zealand. The Sri Lankan American number about 12,000 in the U.S. The New York City Metropolitan Area contains the largest Sri Lankan community in the United States, receiving the highest legal permanent resident Sri Lankan immigrant population, followed by Central New Jersey and the Los Angeles metropolitan area. Many Sri Lankans in Italy have migrated to Italy since the 1970s. Italy was attractive to the Sinhalese due to perceived easier employment opportunities and entry, compared to other European countries. It is estimated that there are 30,000-33,000 Sinhalese in Italy. The major Sinhalese communities in Italy are located in Lombardia (In the districts Loreto and Lazzaretto), Milan, Lazio, Rome, Naples, and Southern Italy (Particularly Palermo, Messina and Catania). Though British Sri Lankans people in particular and Sri Lankans in general have migrated to the UK over the centuries beginning from the colonial times, the number of Sinhalese people in the UK cannot be estimated accurately due to inadequacies of census in the UK.

Using a butter knife or a similar blunt tool: a) Hold the envelope horizontally with the sealed flap facing up. b) Choose a butter knife or another blunt-edged tool for this method. The tool should be thin enough but not too sharp to avoid cutting the envelope. c) Gently slide the blunt edge of the tool under the flap a little away from one corner, and rock it back and forth gently to loosen the adhesive. Be sure not to force the tool under the flap, as this may cause tearing. d) Once the edge is loosened, slide the tool along the seam of the sealed flap, carefully separating the adhesive all the way to the other corner. e) Use your hands or the knife to carefully lift the flap open, ensuring it doesn't tear. 3. Using a plastic card (like a credit card): a) Hold the envelope horizontally with the flap facing up. b) Take a plastic card, such as a credit card or an ID card, and make sure it has no rough or sharp edges that can damage the envelope. c) Gently insert the card under the flap a little away from one corner. Push the card carefully but firmly along the seam of the flap, separating the adhesive without damaging the paper. d) As you reach the other corner, the flap's adhesive should be loose enough that you can carefully open the envelope without tearing it. 4. Softening the adhesive with steam: a) Boil water in a kettle, or heat water in a pan until it produces steam. b) Hold the sealed envelope flap above the steam, with a safe distance of about 5-6 inches away to avoid burns. The steam causes the adhesive to soften, making it easier to open without tearing. c) Periodically check the adhesive by gently poking the flap. You'll notice that it starts to give in. This process may take a couple of minutes, so be patient. d) Once the adhesive is softened enough, pull the flap open using your hands with the utmost care. Remember, the key to opening a letter without ruining the envelope is patience and gentle, precise movements. Taking your time and using one of the mentioned methods will help you achieve a neatly opened, unblemished envelope."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Your job is to determine which sentence(s) from the passage can be used to search for further information needed to answer the question. Problem:Question: In which country was the battle fought where O'Connor commanded the VIII Corps? Passage:General Sir Richard Nugent O'Connor, (21 August 1889 – 17 June 1981) was a senior British Army officer who fought in both the First and Second World Wars, and commanded the Western Desert Force in the early years of the Second World War. He was the field commander for Operation Compass, in which his forces destroyed a much larger Italian army – a victory which nearly drove the Axis from Africa, and in turn, led Adolf Hitler to send the German Africa Corps under Erwin Rommel to try to reverse the situation. O'Connor was captured by a German reconnaissance patrol during the night of 7 April 1941 and spent over two years in an Italian prisoner of war camp. He eventually escaped after the fall of Mussolini in the autumn of 1943. In 1944 he commanded VIII Corps in the Battle of Normandy and later during Operation Market Garden. In 1945 he was General Officer in Command of the Eastern Command in India and then, in the closing days of British rule in the subcontinent, he headed Northern Command. His final job in the army was Adjutant-General to the Forces in London, in charge of the British Army's administration, personnel and organisation. Solution:","completion":"Part #1: Identify the question's main focus. Usage: In which country was the battle fought where O'Connor commanded the VIII Corps?

BACKGROUND According to willingness of the Ministry of Health, Iran and presence of appropriate conditions for disease elimination, national malaria control program decided to conduct a research to clarify malaria status in 2007 and to provide required information to perform the elimination program. This review is comprised of the basis of national malaria elimination program in vision of 2025, which was started in 2010. METHODS In this descriptive study, data were analyzed by applications of different variables at district level. All districts in the three south eastern provinces, in which malaria has local transmission, were considered. Malaria cases has been determined and studied based on the national malaria surveillance system. RESULTS Since vivax malaria is predominant in Sistan & Baluchestan Province, number of vivax cases is equal to malaria positive cases approximately. The important point is that Nikshahr contains the maximum number of local vivax cases in this province and the maximum number of falciparum cases is reported from Sarbaz district. Among all districts of Hormozgan Province, no case of autochthonous falciparum was detected except in Bandar Jask and one case in Minab. There was no case of autochthonous falciparum in Kerman Province, except in Kahnoj and Ghale Ganj that each of them had one case in 2007. CONCLUSION It appears that the report of locally transmitted cases in Iran is increasing over the past few years, before starting malaria elimination plan. Since the Afghan refugees started to return to their own country so the main source of reporting of imported malaria cases reduced and local cases would be demonstrated more clearly.","completion":"Part 1: Topic sentence (or key sentence) in the abstract.

He has Tweeted many photos from the international space station. USATODAY Clouds cover Italy and the Alps in this photo from the International Space Station. (Photo: Scott Kelly/Twitter) Just over a year ago, astronaut Scott Kelly left Earth to spend a year at the International Space Station. He returns late Tuesday night. Kelly shared one of his last sunrises Saturday morning, claiming it to be one of the best— and that's saying a lot since the International Space Station goes around the Earth so quickly that day and night come every 92 minutes, Kelly tweeted in September. Of all the sunrises I've seen on my #YearInSpace, this was one of the best! One of the last too. Headed home soon. pic.twitter.com/AD4YEiN5kR — Scott Kelly (@StationCDRKelly) February 27, 2016 Kelly's been documenting his year tirelessly, posting on social media usually several times a day. Let's take a look at some of his raddest photos. He flew over Texas two months into his trip and spotted a storm coming in. This stunning photo of the Milky Way came soon after to celebrate Hubble's 25th Anniversary. Chicago looks beautiful with the unusual sight of the Aurora Borealis in the background. The colors of the Sahara Desert are unbelievable from space. The color he sees remind him of watercolors, he mentioned in a few photos. Pictures like this make me really regret that my watercolors didn't make it up here. #EarthArt#YearInSpacepic.twitter.com/bWqfeNXyOr — Scott Kelly (@StationCDRKelly) November 22, 2015 The French Riviera looks just as beautiful as ever in this photo. This frozen lake in the Himalayas that he photographed just a few weeks ago will make you want to do the Polar Plunge. Central America is stunning in the early morning. Once again, Kelly proves the Earth is beautifully colorful through his 'Colors of Earth' photos. These sands in Africa are awe-inspiring with their vibrant colors and patterns.

Sure, we didn't walk on the Moon, but we did have a very close encounter with Pluto, grew crops in space, and started the hiring process for the first manned mission to Mars. And through it all, astronaut Scott Kelly has been orbiting Earth on the International Space Station, providing us with incredible images and setting the American record for the most time in space. Sadly all good things must come to an end, and in preparation for his departure back to Earth on March 1, Kelly handed over command of the International Space Station to NASA astronaut Tim Kopra just a few hours ago. For anyone like us who's followed the almost year-long journey of Kelly and cosmonaut Mikhail Kornienko so far, the ceremony below is pretty emotional. Even if you haven't heard of the record-breaking Year in Space mission until now, you have to admit that spending 340 days straight on a spacecraft roughly the size of a football field is pretty impressive - not to mention the fact that Kelly drank an estimated 730 Litres of his own sweat and urine during the mission - all so he could help scientists back on Earth figure out what long-term space travel does to the body. In the ceremony, Kelly thanks Kornienko ('Misha' for short) and admits goodbyes are always \\"bittersweet when you're leaving this incredible place\\". Kornienko will be travelling back to Earth on March 1 along with Kelly and cosmonaut Sergey Volkov, who's been on the space station with them for the past six months. \\"Obviously, you know, Misha and I have been up here for a really, really long time and recently we've been joking with each other that we'll say something like 'We did it!' or 'We made it!'\\" says Kelly in the ceremony below. \\"But we both recognise that this is a lot more about teamwork and all the people that it takes to put these missions together and be successful than it is about us.\\" \\"Spaceflight is the biggest team sport there is, and it's incredibly important that we all work together to make what is seemingly impossible possible,\\" he adds. No, we're not crying, it's just allergies. Once Kelly lands, NASA scientists will begin to assess the toll that space has had on his body, and compare him closely with his twin brother Mark Kelly, who stayed firmly on Earth throughout the year in space. What we learn about the impact of microgravity and space travel during such long missions will help us better understand how to keep humans healthy on the way to Mars - and maybe one day even further into the Solar System. As NASA control tells Kelly and Kornienko at the end of the handover: \\"What you have provided for our human spaceflight endeavours has been monumental ... We look forward to seeing you back safe on the ground and back in Houston.\\" Here's a hero, signing off: ||||| One year ago, NASA embarked on its very own astronaut twin experiment. Scott Kelly shot up to the International Space Station while his identical-except-for-the-mustache twin, retired astronaut Mark Kelly1, stayed firmly planted on Earth. Now on March 1, after 340 days in orbit, Kelly-the-spacebound is coming home. Riding inside the snug Soyuz back with him will be fellow year-in-space resident, cosmonaut Mikhail Korniyenko. But back to the twins (sorry, Mikhail), because that’s one of the most exciting parts of this year-in-space adventure. While Kelly-the-Earthbound wasn’t spending time munching space lettuce or drinking space coffee or doing important astronaut stuff, he was collecting blood, urine, saliva, and poop—for science! At the same time, NASA has been taking samples from his identical twin. By comparing the data, scientists hope to get a better handle on what happens to human bodies in space. One year is twice as long as the typical ISS trip—but it is how long astronauts will have to spend in interplanetary space to get to Mars and back. That’s one year for the body to slowly break down in space thanks too little gravity and too much radiation. Some of the effects of microgravity are obvious. When bones and muscles no longer have to bear the weight of walking, they start to weaken. Bones thin, muscles atrophy. To counteract that, ISS astronauts spend an average of two hours a day exercising, strapped onto a treadmill with elastic bands or doing weight resistance training. Supplements like vitamin D also help. But still, astronauts lose on average 1.5 percent of their bone mass per month in space. Less obvious are the effects of gravity on fluids. Yes, your internal fluids! Like your blood and urine and the all the interstitial fluid that bathes the cells of your body. Without gravity, for example, the heart shrinks because it no longer has to work as hard to pump blood to the legs and back. It also accounts for the Charlie Brown effect, where fluids in the face make astronauts more round-cheeked than they typically are on Earth. This makes it harder to smell food, but more seriously, also harder to see. Swollen tissues in the head put pressure on the optic nerve, leading to decreased vision. To counteract some of this, NASA has a device called a chabis, basically an uncomfortable-looking pair of pants that pull fluids back down to the legs. Cosmic radiation is another very present danger. The ISS sits low enough in Earth’s orbit that it still enjoys some protection from the Earth’s mass and magnetic field; out in space en route to Mars, radiation becomes an even more pressing problem. NASA needs to find out exactly how big of a dose of space radiation is dangerous. When Scott Kelly touches down on Earth, most of the data collecting part of the twin study will be over. But analyzing the data will have only just begun. 1UPDATE 1:15PM ET 2/29/16: This story has been updated with the correct name for Scott Kelly's brother, Mark Kelly. ||||| In this Jan. 21, 2016 photo made available by NASA, one-year mission crew members Scott Kelly of NASA, left, and Mikhail Kornienko of Roscosmos celebrate their 300th consecutive day in space. By spending... (Associated Press) CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — As soon as he returns from the International Space Station, NASA's first and only yearlong spaceman, Scott Kelly, will try to pop up from a lying position and stand still for three minutes. He'll take a crack at a mini-obstacle course and attempt to walk a straight line, heel to toe — all so researchers can see whether he'd hit the ground running if this were Mars instead of Earth. NASA considers it crucial prep work for future Mars explorers who will have to spend much longer in space and won't have the help of a welcoming committee. In fact, this mission — which began with a launch last March — is all about Mars. \\"I think we'll learn a lot about longer-duration spaceflight and how that will take us to Mars someday,\\" Kelly said Thursday in his final news conference from orbit. \\"So I'd like to think that this is another of many steppingstones to us landing on Mars sometime in our future.\\" Kelly's 340-day mission — the longest by 125 days for NASA — comes to a dramatic end Wednesday on the remote steppes of Kazakhstan. (It will be Tuesday night in the U.S.) The astronaut will ride a Soyuz spacecraft back with two Russians, including Mikhail Kornienko, his roommate for the past year. Once out of the capsule, the two will submit to a multitude of field tests. What could new arrivals do on Mars, asks Dr. Stevan Gilmore, the lead flight surgeon who will be at the landing site to receive Kelly. Could they jump up and down? Could they open a hatch? Could they do an immediate spacewalk? The tests on Kelly and Kornienko should provide some answers. There will also be blood draws, heart monitoring and other medical exams. The testing will continue for weeks if not months once they're back home in Houston and at cosmonaut headquarters at Star City, Russia. Checkups will also continue for Kelly's identical twin, retired astronaut Mark Kelly. The 52-year-old brothers joined forces to provide NASA with a potential gold mine of scientific data: one twin studied for a year in orbit — twice the usual space station stay — while his genetic double underwent similar tests on the ground. While a handful of Russians have spent longer in space, the record being a 438-day flight, those expeditions date back to the 1980s and 1990s aboard the Mir space station, rustic if not rickety compared with the current space station. Medical testing was spotty back then, and the data weren't always widely shared. As of Thursday — Day 335 — Kelly professed to feeling pretty good. Indeed, flight surgeon Gilmore doesn't expect any alarming results at touchdown. Kelly's vision has degraded a bit as it did during his last mission, a normal outcome for some astronauts because of increased pressure inside the skull in weightlessness. He anticipates his bones and muscles have weakened as well, despite daily exercise in orbit. The real question mark — and Kelly's biggest concern — is the possible lingering effects of space radiation. \\"Hopefully, I'll never find out what the true effects are of that,\\" Kelly said in a TV interview last week. NASA will need to tackle the problem for Mars trips because of the increased level of exposure. Johnson Space Center physiologist John Charles puts the psychological side of long-duration spaceflight right up there with radiation, as well as in-flight medical care and even food preservation and packaging for the long haul. \\"Just about everything is a big problem for Mars,\\" Charles said in a phone interview. Mars expeditions planned for the 2030s will last 2½ years; the anticipated crew size will be four to six. The astronauts will almost certainly have to grow some of their own food; that's the reason for an experimental greenhouse aboard the space station. Kelly and his crewmates grew red romaine lettuce in the mini-hothouse last summer and sampled some of the crop. Even more impressive, Kelly nursed zinnias back to health in January, displaying a lush orange and yellow bouquet on Valentine's Day. He had to \\"channel my inner Mark Watney\\" — the lone astronaut who survives on potatoes in last year's blockbuster movie \\"The Martian\\" — to save the zinnias from mold. Trust me when to add water, Kelly urged Mission Control, not some preflight script. That's how it will need to be when astronauts venture to Mars, he gently reminded everyone. Charles stresses that Mars travel will be different than a space station stay. No regular phone chats with the husbands, wives and kids back home. No constant whispering in the astronauts' ears from Mission Control. Support would come via email. \\"They're going to be highly autonomous,\\" Charles said of the Mars explorers, \\"and that's something that we're trying to practice on the space station now ... learning how to get Mission Control out of the back pockets of the astronauts.\\" Kelly points out that crew quarters on Mars-bound craft will be much tighter than the space station — and nothing like the spaceships of science fiction. Between sleeping and working on his laptop, Kelly estimates he's spent almost half his time inside his personal cubicle — about the size of a phone booth. NASA will need to improve privacy on Mars missions, he said, if it hopes to combat crew stress and fatigue. The toughest part for Kelly has been the physical isolation from everyone he loves, 250 miles below him. But on a trip to Mars, tens of millions of miles away, astronauts won't be able to even see Earth. \\"Obviously going to Mars, there are a lot of other challenges, but none of these we can't overcome,\\" Kelly said. NASA is discussing doing more one-year flights with the other countries involved in the station program; more subjects are needed for a better understanding of all the challenges. It's a long time, no matter how you cut it. Just ask Kelly, who recently acknowledged, \\"a year now seems longer than I thought it would be.\\" ___ Online: NASA: https://www.nasa.gov/1ym/ ||||| This collaborative project is an extension of the 2016 End of Term project, intended to document the federal government's web presence by archiving government websites and data.

He also departs with a record as a social media maven and renowned photographer from space. Kelly made four trips to space, the most prominent being a 340-day journey that ended last month. During that flight, Kelly made more than 5,000 trips around the Earth, and drank nearly 200 gallons of drinking water made from recycled sweat and urine. From his perch 400 kilometers (249 miles) above the earth’s surface, he snapped hundreds of beautifully abstract photographs of our planet’s landforms and waterways. He spotted hurricanes ominously swirling on sapphire-blue oceans. He gazed out at the aurora’s glittering fog. He consistently turned Earth’s lands and waters into an abstract artist’s dream, with shots of beaches, deserts, forests, and everything in between. And he did it all with equipment accessible to earthlings, taking most of his images with a Nikon D4 digital camera with lenses more commonly used to photograph football games. Kelly’s photographs gained him a massive following. From Twitter to Tumblr, hundreds of thousands of social media users expressed their wonderment at the photos—and a devoted band of mapping experts tagged along, helpfully noting where Kelly snapped his pics. “It’s fun to be a part of the public’s reaction,” says David MacLean of Nova Scotia Community College’s Centre of Geographic Sciences, who’s among the most influential of Kelly’s hobbyist geotaggers. MacLean has been mapping astronauts’ photos since 2013, but says Kelly’s penchant for abstraction sets his pictures apart. “Other astronauts have more of a city and regional view: ‘Here’s Indianapolis from space,’” MacLean says. Kelly, on the other hand, “has concentrated on details of little pieces of the world.” “He’s caught the interest of quite a lot of people, [who] see these [places] in a whole new way.” And Kelly’s eye for composition hasn’t gone unnoticed at National Geographic. “Kelly’s photographs are striking and incredibly artistic,\\" wrote Patrick Witty, National Geographic’s deputy director of photography. “[It’s] hard to believe they were made by an astronaut and not a working professional photographer.” “I’m sure every photographer on Earth is incredibly jealous of his angle.” To celebrate Kelly’s #YearInSpace, we’ve selected our favorite Scott Kelly space pictures. We hope you enjoy the photos—and check out National Geographic's photographic coverage of Kelly’s final return to Earth. |||||Summary:","completion":"After spending 340 consecutive days in space, astronaut Scott Kelly returned from his International Space Station mission.

Q:What is the missing first step of the following process: - Over time, more sediment piles on top - The resulting heat and pressure transforms the organic layer into a dark and waxy substance known as kerogen - Left alone, the kerogen molecules eventually crack - The molecules break up into shorter and lighter molecules composed almost solely of carbon and hydrogen atoms - It will turn into either petroleum or natural gas - A:","completion":"A: The missing first step of the process is the accumulation and deposition of organic matter in a sedimentary environment. This happens when dead plants, animals, and microorganisms settle at the bottom of a body of water, such as an ocean or lake, forming an organic-rich layer. This layer is mixed with and often trapped within inorganic sediments like mud, clay, and sand. As more sediment is deposited on top of the organic material, it becomes buried deeper in the earth, leading to the subsequent steps of the process. These steps are: 1. Accumulation and deposition of organic matter in a sedimentary environment (the missing first step). 2. Over time, more sediment piles on top, increasing the pressure and temperature on the buried organic material. 3. The resulting heat and pressure transform the organic layer into a dark and waxy substance known as kerogen. 4. Left alone, the kerogen molecules eventually crack or break due to the continuous increase in temperature and pressure. 5. The molecules break up into shorter and lighter molecules composed almost solely of carbon and hydrogen atoms. 6. The resulting hydrocarbon compounds migrate through porous rock layers and accumulate in reservoirs, ultimately forming either petroleum or natural gas."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A volleyed goal from substitute Tadanari Lee in the second half of extra time earned Japan a 1-0 victory over Australia and a record fourth Asian Cup Saturday. Lee hammered home a cross from Yugo Nagatomo in the 109th minute to settle the clash and leave Holgar Osieck's Australia heartbroken at Qatar's Khalifa International Stadium. The Socceroos had twice gone close with Everton's Tim Cahill having an effort cleared off the line and winger Harry Kewell firing straight at goalkeeper Eiji Kawashima when clean through on goal. But Alberto Zaccheroni's \\"Blue Samurai\\" weathered the storm to add to their previous triumphs in 1992, 2000 and 2004 as Lee proved their hero. With 20 minutes left Kewell spurned his chance when one-on-one with Kawashima and as the game drifted towards extra-time,","completion":"Australia seemed to be growing in confidence. The Socceroos had controlled possession for large parts of the match and looked to use their physicality to wear down the Japanese side. Throughout the game, both Kewell and Cahill were constant threats for Australia, but the Blue Samurai remained disciplined in defense, largely thanks to the efforts of captain Makoto Hasebe and defender Yasuyuki Konno. As the match entered extra time, the level of intensity increased on both sides. Nagatomo and Shinji Okazaki had chances to score for Japan, but were denied by Australian goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer. Meanwhile, Australia continued to create chances of their own, with Mile Jedinak and Robbie Kruse coming close, but ultimately, they were unable to break the deadlock. It was then, in the second half of extra time, that the game's decisive moment arrived. In the 109th minute, Nagatomo, who had been a constant threat down Japan's left flank throughout the match, found himself with space to deliver a pinpoint cross. Lee, who had been introduced as a substitute only 10 minutes earlier, met the ball with a thunderous volley, giving Schwarzer no chance as the ball hit the back of the net. It was a sublime finish that highlighted the quality of the Japanese side. The goal sent the Japanese supporters into euphoria, while the Australian players, who had given their all throughout the match, were left devastated. Despite the Socceroos' valiant efforts and numerous chances, they simply could not find a way past Kawashima and Japan's solid defense. As the final whistle blew, Japan were crowned champions for a record fourth time - an achievement that underlined the team's growing stature on the continent and the global football stage. The victory was also significant for Japan's Italian coach, Alberto Zaccheroni, who had taken charge of the team less than a year earlier. His tactical acumen and the players' determination proved vital in securing the Asian Cup title. In the end, Lee's goal proved to be the defining moment of the match and etched his name in Asian Cup history. The victory demonstrated Japan's strength and their status as the powerhouse of Asian football, while Australia, although disappointed, could take pride in their performance and their progress in the tournament. The thrilling finale to the 2011 Asian Cup showcased the exciting talent and potential of both teams and served as a fitting conclusion to a hard-fought and memorable edition of the competition."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Please briefly summarize this news article: State of the Series: Rangers go back home down 0-2 SAN FRANCISCO -- Everything has gone according to plan for the San Francisco Giants. They've won one game with outstanding hitting and another with lock-down pitching. The Texas Rangers, meanwhile, will be looking for some home cooking to help get them back in the World Series. But history is against them. The last 14 times one team has taken a 2-0 lead in the World Series, that team has gone on to hoist the trophy 13 times. \\"It's nice to get the first two,\\" Giants manager Bruce Bochy said after a 9-0 victory Thursday night, \\"but that's what it is. You've got to get to this number before your next number.\\" Of course, the Giants have had the Rangers' number so far in this series. They're hitting just .231 as a team after Matt Cain and Co. shut them down in Game 2. \\"I think that's more or less has to do with the pitching we've been facing,\\" said Texas manager Ron Washington. \\"You know those guys were good, especially Cain tonight. …I think you have to tip your hat to the pitching over there right now.\\" For the American League champions to bounce back, they'll have to show some of the potent offense that carried them past the New York Yankees in the ALCS. So where do the Rangers turn for solace? Perhaps in the fact that they were only a bounce from taking the early lead in Game 2. In the top of the fifth, Ian Kinsler's fly ball to deep center field hit the top of the wall and bounced back into play. He had to settle for a leadoff double and never came around to score. \\"We're getting guys on base, we're just not knocking them in,\\" said Texas third baseman Michael Young. \\"We keep getting guys on, then I like our chances of getting them in. We're just too good an offense not to.\\" The stats bear him out. In Game 2, the Rangers were 0-for-9 with runners in scoring position and they left nine men on base. In an 11-7 loss in Game 1, they left eight men on. The real problem may lie in the Rangers pitching. Game 2 starter C.J. Wilson was effective -- giving up only one run before walking the leadoff batter in the seventh and leaving with a blister problem. But the Giants have teed off on Texas relievers, averaging 10 runs per game in their formerly pitching-friendly home park. Now the Series moves to Texas, where the hits are usually expected to keep on comin'. After a travel day on Friday, Colby Lewis, who shut down the New York Yankees in winning the ALCS clincher, will be on the mound for the Rangers against Giants left-hander Jonathan Sanchez.","completion":"The San Francisco Giants have taken a 2-0 lead in the World Series against the Texas Rangers, demonstrating impressive hitting and pitching, while the Rangers are struggling to keep up. With history against them, the Rangers need to show the potent offense they displayed during the American League Championship to increase their chances of winning. While their batters have managed to get on base, they have fallen short in bringing players home. Adding to their concerns is the performance of their pitchers, particularly their relievers who have given up an average of 10 runs per game. To bounce back, the Rangers will rely on their home advantage as the Series moves to Texas, with Colby Lewis aiming for a repeat performance of his winning efforts in the American League Championship."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Translate to French: Foundations of State authority at the local level 47 - 49 10","completion":"Les fondements de l'autorité de l'État au niveau local 47 - 49 10 Il est important de reconnaître que les fondements de l'autorité de l'État au niveau local sont la pierre angulaire de l'organisation et du fonctionnement du gouvernement dans de nombreux pays. En France, par exemple, l'administration territoriale est constituée d'une série de niveaux allant des communes et des départements jusqu'aux régions et à l'État lui-même. Chaque niveau de gouvernement joue un rôle clé dans la façon dont les politiques sont élaborées et mises en œuvre et, par conséquent, dans la manière dont les services sont fournis à la population. La constitution française a établi un certain nombre de principes fondamentaux concernant l'autorité de l'État au niveau local. Le principe général de la décentralisation est consacré dans la constitution, reconnaissant que les collectivités territoriales sont libres de gérer leurs affaires en fonction de leurs compétences propres. En outre, l'autonomie financière des collectivités territoriales est également garantie par la constitution, leur permettant de disposer des ressources fiscales nécessaires pour s'acquitter de leurs missions. Le chiffre 47 correspond à la compétence des communes, les unités administratives qui constituent la base du système local français. Les communes sont responsables de l'administration et de la gestion des affaires locales, y compris la fourniture de services tels que la voirie, l'éducation, la santé publique et l'urbanisme. Les maires sont élus à la tête des communes, et ceux-ci travaillent avec des conseils municipaux composés d'élus locaux pour prendre les décisions affectant la communauté. Le chiffre 49 fait référence à la compétence des départements, qui sont un niveau de gouvernement intermédiaire entre les communes et les régions. Les départements sont responsables de questions telles que la protection sociale, les transports et l'équipement, ainsi que certaines infrastructures. Les conseils départementaux, composés de conseillers départementaux élus au suffrage universel direct, sont chargés de prendre les décisions pour ces domaines de compétence. Le chiffre 10, quant à lui, peut être interprété comme un rappel du fait qu'en France, il existe également d'autres niveaux d'autorité de l'État au niveau local. Parmi ceux-ci se trouvent les régions, qui sont responsables de l'aménagement du territoire, du développement économique et des formations professionnelles, et les établissements publics de coopération intercommunale (EPCI), qui regroupent plusieurs communes pour collaborer sur des projets d'intérêt commun. En résumé, les fondements de l'autorité de l'État au niveau local en France sont constitués par une série de niveaux de gouvernement, dont les communes, les départements, les régions et divers autres types de collectivités territoriales. Chacun de ces niveaux joue un rôle important dans le fonctionnement du gouvernement local et permet de répondre aux besoins spécifiques des citoyens dans différentes domaines. Les chiffres 47, 49 et 10 correspondent respectivement aux compétences et responsabilités des communes, des départements et d'autres niveaux d'autorité de l'État au niveau local."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Direct access to sunlight: Windowsills provide direct access to sunlight, allowing plants to receive the necessary light they need to conduct photosynthesis. By placing plants by the window, you ensure that they can benefit from the sun's rays during the day. 2. Convenient and space-efficient: Windowsills are usually found within homes, making them extremely convenient for plant placement. This location also allows for efficient utilization of vertical space, which can be helpful for individuals with limited room for their plants. 3. Easy to monitor and care for: Having your plants on a windowsill makes it easy for you to monitor their growth and health. You can quickly assess their needs, such as watering or fertilizing, without having to venture outside. 4. Climate control: By placing your plants indoors, you can better control the environment in which they grow. This means that your plants will not be subjected to harsh outdoor conditions like heavy rain, strong winds, or extreme temperatures, which could potentially harm them. In comparison, options like the roof, ground, park, and surface of the earth often imply outdoor placement and can expose your plants to unfavorable environmental conditions and a lack of consistent access to sunlight.

Monte Ne was entirely conceived and funded by William \\"Coin\\" Hope Harvey, a well-known businessman, politician, lecturer and author during the 1890s. Although Harvey was financially successful at silver mining in Colorado, Monte Ne seems to have been funded mostly by the sales of Harvey's writings which dealt with the subject of free silver. His most popular pamphlet, entitled Coin's Financial School, was published in 1893. Sales were buoyed by Harvey's involvement in the 1896 presidential campaign of William Jennings Bryan, and it sold two million copies. Though Bryan lost his bid for President, Harvey had become so important to the campaign that he was made chairman of the Democratic Ways & Means Committee to collect money for the 1900 campaign. However, as a result of an argument before the campaign, he resigned.After Bryan lost his bid for President, Harvey retreated to the Ozark mountains of Northwest Arkansas. In October 1900 he purchased 320 acres (130 ha) of land in Silver Springs (close to present day Rogers) from Reverend Bailey. From that time on he lived in Arkansas, and claimed that he preferred the state because it had no large cities or extremely wealthy people. Leaving his family behind in Chicago, Harvey moved into Reverend Bailey's run-down log house. Harvey's son Tom joined him shortly thereafter to help prepare the house for the rest of the family. They were joined later by Harvey's wife Anna and their children, Annette and Hal. The house burned down a few months after they took up residence, and all of the family's possessions, including Harvey's large library, were lost. Harvey carried no insurance on the house, and after its destruction Anna went back to Chicago, returning to Arkansas only a few times thereafter for brief visits.Harvey's land purchase in Silver Springs coincided with a desire by the local postmaster to change the name of the area, because it was often confused with Siloam Springs, Arkansas.

When American 11 struck the World Trade Center at 8:46, no one in the White House or traveling with the President knew that it had been hijacked. While that information circulated within the FAA, we found no evidence that the hijacking was reported to any other agency in Washington before 8:46. Most federal agencies learned about the crash in New York from CNN. Within the FAA, the administrator, Jane Garvey, and her acting deputy, Monte Belger, had not been told of a confirmed hijacking before they learned from television that a plane had crashed. Others in the agency were aware of it, as we explained earlier in this chapter. Inside the National Military Command Center, the deputy director of operations and his assistant began notifying senior Pentagon officials of the incident. At about 9:00, the senior NMCC operations officer reached out to the FAA operations center for information. Although the NMCC was advised of the hijacking of American 11, the scrambling of jets was not discussed. In Sarasota, Florida, the presidential motorcade was arriving at the Emma E.

The 2nd Cavalry Division was responsible for various key operations, while the 93rd Infantry Division was an African American unit that fought in the Pacific theater and was involved in important battles against Japanese forces. After the war, Johnson continued to serve in various capacities, contributing to the efforts of the United States military and upholding the principles on which the nation was founded. Johnson's life came to an end on August 6, 1987, at the age of 92. He passed away in Kerrville, Texas, leaving behind a legacy of leadership and sacrifice. In recognition of his service, Johnson was laid to rest at the Fort Sam Houston National Cemetery. Throughout his life, Harry H. Johnson demonstrated unwavering commitment and loyalty to his country. His contributions during two world wars and his ability to lead and inspire those under his command reflect the highest standards of military service.

Those with political connections unfairly gained large wealth, which has discredited privatization in these regions. While media have reported widely the grand corruption that accompanied the sales, studies have argued that in addition to increased operating efficiency, daily petty corruption is, or would be, larger without privatization, and that corruption is more prevalent in non-privatized sectors.

Summarize: Texts seen by the BBC suggest ex-IAAF consultant Papa Massata Diack, now wanted by Interpol, secured votes for Lord Coe's August election win. The programme also suggests Coe may have misled the UK parliament. The double British Olympic 1500m champion, 59, denies any wrongdoing. The text messages suggest Diack, son of the disgraced former IAAF president Lamine Diack, helped secure African delegate votes for Coe. The investigation also uncovers evidence Coe may have misled a parliamentary select committee over when he first became aware of the allegations of doping and corruption in athletics. Coe became IAAF president in the midst of a growing corruption scandal involving blackmail and state-sponsored doping in Russia. Within weeks of his election, his predecessor, Diack Sr, was arrested and a warrant issued for the arrest of his son, a marketing consultant for the IAAF. The corruption scandal had originally come to light in a German television documentary in December 2014. The documentary reported that Russian and IAAF officials, including Diack Jr, had conspired to cover up doping by the Russian marathon runner Lilya Shobukhova, as well as attempt to blackmail her. Media playback is not supported on this device Coe was not personally caught up in any of the doping or corruption allegations, but he had been a member of the IAAF council since 2003 and a vice-president since 2007. He was asked by MPs at a meeting of the Culture, Media and Sport select committee last year why he had not been more prominent in pressing the doping issue while he was a vice-president. He told them: \\"I was certainly not aware of the specific allegations that had been made around the corruption of anti-doping processes in Russia.\\" When he was asked if he was aware of allegations against Diack Jr, Coe replied: \\"Well, they were allegations that were aired in the ARD documentary.\\" But evidence seen by the BBC and the Daily Mail reveals that, four months before the German television documentary was broadcast, an email was sent to Coe containing a number of attachments detailing the corruption, extortion and bribery claims, as well as the suggestion Diack Jr could have been involved. The attachments included a detailed complaint from the agent of Shobukhova, alleging she had paid Russian and IAAF officials 450,000 euro (£356,000) to cover up her doping and allow her to run in the London 2012 Olympics. Damian Collins MP, who sits on the Culture, Media and Sport Committee, said: \\"I think his (Lord Coe's) answer to the select committee was deliberately misleading to create the impression that he was totally unaware of any specific allegations of this kind. \\"These involved serious criminal matters. The right thing to do would be to put that information into the hands of the criminal authorities straight away.\\" He added: \\"If he won't be drawn on the past and what he knew and can't come up with a compelling argument for the way he conducted himself, then I don't see how he could continue as president of the IAAF because he would lack the public support to do so.\\" In a statement, Coe, who won 1500m gold at the 1980 and 1984 Olympics, said he was forwarded emails about the corruption allegations, which he then sent on to the IAAF ethics committee, leaving it to investigate. His director of communications, Jackie Brock-Doyle, added: \\"He did not feel it was necessary to read the attachments. \\"You may think this shows a lack of curiosity. He, and we, would argue that it shows a full duty of care, ensuring the right people in the right place were aware of allegations and were investigating them.\\" Diack Jr claims that he and Coe met during the IAAF presidential campaign, twice in Beijing and once in the Bahamas. This was almost a year after Coe was sent the email about allegations against Diack Jr and several months after it was revealed the Senegalese had been accused of corruption on a grand scale. The claims of Diack Jr, who has been banned for life by the IAAF, have to be treated with extreme caution, but there is evidence - in the form of emails and text messages between Diack Jr, Coe and Nick Davies, the IAAF's head of communications - that he did indeed help Coe during his presidential bid. At the time, Davies was helping Coe's election campaign. The following are some of text messages, seen by Panorama, which call into question how Coe ran his successful IAAF presidency election campaign. These messages are from 2015 - several months after the world knew Diack Jr had been accused of dishonesty on a grand scale. Coe also appeared keen to ensure Diack Jr made an important meeting. Diack Jr told the BBC that the \\"friend\\" mentioned in this message was Hamad Kalkaba Malboum, president of the Confederation of African Athletics, whose support was crucial. In the days before the election, Diack Jr appeared to provide information on the election tactics of Coe's rival, Sergey Bubka, the Ukrainian former Olympic pole vault champion. Diack Jr also seemed to provide intelligence on how IAAF delegates might vote in the presidential election, asking Davies to get a message to Coe to speak to Phil Knight of Nike for confirmation from the USA delegate Steve Miller. This next message refers to the 24 out of 30 nations Diack Jr claims he could talk to and get support for Coe. The Briton won the election by a margin of 23 votes, 115-92. The BBC showed these text messages to Jack Robertson, a former chief investigator for the World Anti-Doping Agency and the man who investigated the Shobukhova doping scandal. \\"It appears that Coe is taking advice from someone who is at the centre of this scandal to extort athletes,\\" said Robertson. \\"It's wrong on so many fronts. It's not just disappointing, it's disgusting.\\" In an interview with Panorama, Diack Jr said Lord Coe would not have become IAAF president without his help. \\"If he had not the blessing of Lamine Diack or my support, he would have never been elected as the IAAF president,\\" he said. \\"He knows that.\\" Coe refused the BBC's request for an interview to discuss his relationship with Diack Jr and said the suggestion he sought the Senegalese's support was wrong. The Briton's spokeswoman added: \\"As with any campaign, lots of people offer advice - wanted or not, some helpful, some not. You try to be civil but wary. \\"This was the case with Mr Diack. He sent messages of support whilst at the same time supporting other candidates and accusing Seb Coe of leading a British media campaign against both him and his father.\\" Diack Jr is currently living in Senegal and Interpol has issued a notice for his arrest over allegations of bribery and corruption, which he rejects. \\"I have never, never, never been involved in any payment or any extortion of Lilia Shobukhova,\\" he said. \\"All we did about this Russian affair was to protect our World Championships. There was no cover-up of any, any, any doping matters.\\" Last week, the IAAF's ethics board announced that Davies was one of three IAAF members being provisionally suspended over allegations they took money to delay naming Russian drugs cheats. Given he is now the subject of an IAAF investigation, Davies said it would be inappropriate for him to comment on the Panorama programme. But Robertson is happy to speak out and said: \\"I hate to use the word, but he [Coe] got in bed with the devil to win the election. \\"I don't mean to call Papa Diack the devil, but he was certainly in the middle of the investigation. \\"And if he [Coe] makes a decision such as that, how can we trust him with other decisions? My bottom line is clean athletes deserve better.\\" The Panorama programme airs on the eve of an IAAF meeting in Vienna to decide whether to allow Russian athletes to compete at the Rio Olympics.","completion":"Text messages shown to the BBC suggest Papa Massata Diack, a former consultant to the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) and now wanted by Interpol, secured votes for the election of Lord Coe in August.

In the first quarter, the Raiders grabbed the early lead, with a 48-yard field goal by placekicker Sebastian Janikowski. The Broncos responded, with quarterback Tim Tebow hooking up with wide receiver Eric Decker on a 27-yard touchdown pass. The Raiders re-claimed the lead in the second quarter, with quarterback Carson Palmer throwing two touchdown passes: an 11-yarder to running back Michael Bush, followed by a 40-yarder to fullback Marcel Reece. In the third quarter, the Broncos cut into the Raiders' lead, with a 26-yard touchdown pass from Tebow to wide receiver Eddie Royal.

Answer the following question: Information: - The Roman Empire (Koine and Medieval Greek: , tr. ) was the post-Roman Republic period of the ancient Roman civilization, characterized by government headed by emperors and large territorial holdings around the Mediterranean Sea in Europe, Africa and Asia. The city of Rome was the largest city in the world BC AD, with Constantinople (New Rome) becoming the largest around 500 AD, and the Empire's populace grew to an estimated 50 to 90 million inhabitants (roughly 20% of the world's population at the time). The 500-year-old republic which preceded it was severely destabilized in a series of civil wars and political conflict, during which Julius Caesar was appointed as perpetual dictator and then assassinated in 44 BC. Civil wars and executions continued, culminating in the victory of Octavian, Caesar's adopted son, over Mark Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC and the annexation of Egypt. Octavian's power was then unassailable and in 27 BC the Roman Senate formally granted him overarching power and the new title \\"Augustus\\", effectively marking the end of the Roman Republic. - In historiography, the Western Roman Empire consists of the western provinces of the Roman Empire at any one time during which they were administered by a separate independent Imperial court, coequal with (or only nominally subordinate to) that administering the eastern half. Both \\"Western Roman Empire\\" and \\"Eastern Roman Empire\\" (or \\"Byzantine Empire\\") are modern terms describing \\"de facto\\" independent entities; however, at no point did Romans consider the Empire split into two, but rather considered it a single state governed by two separate Imperial courts out of administrative expediency. The view that the Empire was impossible to govern by one emperor was established by Diocletian following the disastrous civil wars and disintegration of the Crisis of the 3rd century, and was instituted in Roman law by his introduction of the Tetrarchy in AD 285, a form of government which was legally to endure in one form or another for centuries. The Western Court was periodically abolished and recreated for the next two centuries until final abolition by the Emperor Zeno in 480, by which time there was little effective central control left in the area legally administered by the Western Court. - The Byzantine Empire, also referred to as the Eastern Roman Empire, was the continuation of the Roman Empire in the East during Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages, when its capital city was Constantinople (modern-day Istanbul, which had been founded as Byzantium). It survived the fragmentation and fall of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century AD and continued to exist for an additional thousand years until it fell to the Ottoman Turks in 1453. During most of its existence, the empire was the most powerful economic, cultural, and military force in Europe. Both \\"Byzantine Empire\\" and \\"Eastern Roman Empire\\" are historiographical terms created after the end of the realm; its citizens continued to refer to their empire as the \\"Roman Empire\\" (tr. ), or \\"Romania\\", and to themselves as \\"Romans\\". - The term tetrarchy (from the , \\"tetrarchia\\", \\"leadership of four [people]\\") describes any form of government where power is divided among four individuals, but in modern usage usually refers to the system instituted by Roman Emperor Diocletian in 293, marking the end of the Crisis of the Third Century and the recovery of the Roman Empire. This tetrarchy lasted until c. 313, when internecine conflict eliminated most of the claimants to power, leaving Constantine in control of the western half of the empire, and Licinius in control of the eastern half. - A civil war, also known as an intrastate war in polemology, is a war between organized groups within the same state or country, or, less commonly, between two countries created from a formerly united state. The aim of one side may be to take control of the country or a region, to achieve independence for a region or to change government policies. The term is a calque of the Latin \\"bellum civile\\" which was used to refer to the various civil wars of the Roman Republic in the 1st century BC. - Diocletian, born Diocles (244312), was a Roman emperor from 284 to 305. Born to a family of low status in the Roman province of Dalmatia, Diocletian rose through the ranks of the military to become cavalry commander to the Emperor Carus. After the deaths of Carus and his son Numerian on campaign in Persia, Diocletian was proclaimed emperor. The title was also claimed by Carus' other surviving son, Carinus, but Diocletian defeated him in the Battle of the Margus. Diocletian's reign stabilized the empire and marks the end of the Crisis of the Third Century. He appointed fellow officer Maximian as Augustus, co-emperor, in 286. - Valens ( 328 -- 9 August 378 ) , fully Flavius Julius Valens Augustus ( Latin : FLAVIVS IVLIVS VALENS AVGVSTVS ) , was Eastern Roman Emperor from 364 to 378 . He was given the eastern half of the empire by his brother Valentinian I after the latter 's accession to the throne . Valens , sometimes known as the Last True Roman , was defeated and killed in the Battle of Adrianople , which marked the beginning of the collapse of the decaying Western Roman Empire . - Valentinian I (3 July 321 17 November 375), also known as Valentinian the Great, was Roman emperor from 364 to 375. Upon becoming emperor he made his brother Valens his co-emperor, giving him rule of the eastern provinces while Valentinian retained the west. - The Roman emperor was the ruler of the Roman Empire during the imperial period (starting in 27 BC). The emperors used a variety of different titles throughout history. Often when a given Roman is described as becoming \\"emperor\\" in English, it reflects his taking of the title \\"Augustus\\" or \\"Caesar\\". Another title often used was \\"imperator\\", originally a military honorific. Early Emperors also used the title \\"princeps\\" (first citizen). Emperors frequently amassed republican titles, notably \\"Princeps Senatus\\", \\"Consul\\" and \\"Pontifex Maximus\\". - Augustus (23 September 63 BC 19 August 14 AD) was the founder of the Roman Principate and considered the first Emperor, controlling the Roman Empire from 27 BC until his death in AD 14. - The Principate is the name sometimes given to the first period of the Roman Empire from the beginning of the reign of Augustus in about 30 BC to the Crisis of the Third Century in 284 AD, after which it evolved into the so-called \\"Dominate\\". - Edirne, historically known as \\"Adrianople\\", in Bulgarian known as \\"Odrin\\", is a city in the northwestern Turkish province of Edirne, in the region of East Thrace, close to Turkey's borders with Greece and Bulgaria. Edirne served as the third capital city of the Ottoman Empire from 1363 to 1453, before Constantinople (present-day Istanbul) became the empire's fourth and final capital. At present, Edirne is the capital of Edirne Province in Turkish Thrace. The city's estimated population in 2014 was 165,979. - The Goths were an East Germanic people, two of whose branches, the Visigoths and the Ostrogoths, played an important role in the fall of the Western Roman Empire and the emergence of Medieval Europe. The Goths dominated a vast area, which at its peak under the Germanic king Ermanaric and his sub-king Athanaric possibly extended all the way from the Danube to the Don, and from the Black Sea to the Baltic Sea. - Historiography is the study of the methodology of historians in developing history as an academic discipline, and by extension is any body of historical work on a particular subject. The historiography of a specific topic covers how historians have studied that topic using particular sources, techniques, and theoretical approaches. Scholars discuss historiography by topic such as the \\"Historiography of the United Kingdom\\", the \\"Historiography of Canada\\", \\"Historiography of the British Empire\\", the \\"historiography of early Islam\\", the \\"historiography of China\\" and different approaches and genres, such as political history and social history. Beginning in the nineteenth century, with the ascent of academic history, there developed a body of historiographic literature. The extent to which historians are influenced by their own groups and loyalties such as to their nation state is a debated question. - The Battle of Adrianople (9 August 378), sometimes known as the Battle of Hadrianopolis, was fought between an Eastern Roman army led by the Eastern Roman Emperor Valens and Gothic rebels (largely Thervings as well as Greutungs, non-Gothic Alans, and various local rebels) led by Fritigern. The battle took place about north of Adrianople (modern Edirne in European Turkey, near the border with Greece and Bulgaria) in the Roman province of Thracia.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. News article: Mitt Romney isn’t going to shake up his staff. Should he? Talk of a shakeup in Mitt Romney’s presidential campaign is running rampant, with the expectation within the Republican political class that the former Massachusetts governor will add seasoned hands rather than part ways with any of his current senior staffers. Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney finishes speaking about the Supreme Court ruling on health care in Washington, Thursday, June 28, 2012. (AP Photo/Charles Dharapak) At the heart of the critique of the Romney campaign, which began with a tweet from News Corp. CEO Rupert Murdoch and has continued with a stinging Wall Street Journal op-ed and harsh words for the campaign from the Weekly Standard’s Bill Kristol today, is the idea that the presidential candidate’s staff may not be up to the task of running the sort of race it will take to beat President Obama. “The campaign needs to show the GOP elite world and the media a lot of competence going forward or this shake-up talk will only get louder and continue,” predicted one Republican adviser watching from the sidelines. In conversations with a handful of senior Republican operatives — none of whom are formally affiliated with the campaign and all of whom spoke under the condition their names not be used in order to allow them to speak candidly — opinions differed on whether some staff change might be a good thing. The one thing the whole group agreed on is that Romney is likely to add people before he subtracts anyone at a senior level. “The talent in senior staff is mostly one of their assets, not one of their problems,” said one longtime Republican consultant. “Nobody will lose their job,” added another. “They will probably add a couple of high visibility strategists/operatives relatively soon, if only to keep the critics at bay.” The loyalty and long service of Romney’s inner circle has always — or at least to this point — been seen as a strength not a weakness for the candidate. Matt Rhoades, the campaign manager, served as communications director during Romney’s 2008 campaign and then ran the candidate’s political action committee in the interregnum between races. Beth Myers, who is overseeing the vice presidential search, managed Romney’s 2008 campaign and was a part of the Romney Administration in Massachusetts. Ditto Eric Fehrnstrom who has long been considered Romney’s alter-ego. “Matt Rhoades has kept that thing humming with only the minimal amount of drama,” said one Republican consultant. “[Communications Director] Gail Gitcho has been a fantastic off-the-record fighter.” And, in truth, the critique that a candidate’s inner circle is too insular and not able to see the big picture is as old as politics itself. President Obama had to beat back stories during the 2008 campaign that his political inner circle was too small and not big-picture enough. And, even though he won a sweeping victory in 2008, that narrative has resurfaced already in his 2012 re-election campaign. Viewed through that lens, the chatter about a staff shakeup is nothing new. But that doesn’t mean it doesn’t matter or that some of the criticism doesn’t have merit. The largest strain of unhappiness voiced by the strategist class is that the communications side of the campaign isn’t functioning at the highest level — from a slow response to the Post’s story about Romney’s outsourcing/offshoring at Bain to Fehnrstrom’s comments to NBC’s Chuck Todd on Monday regarding the penalty/tax debate on the individual mandate. “I do think they have a problem on the communications end...they’re not sharp, they’re not creative and I think they’re trying too hard to tear down Obama and not hard enough to build Romney up,” said one Republican strategist. The likeliest outcome of this staff foofaraw, according to those familiar with the goings-on in the Romney campaign, is that a few seasoned hands with national campaign experience will be added to the operation. In the waning days of Romney’s primary victory, the campaign hired on Ed Gillespie, a former Republican National Committee chairman, and Brian Jones, a former communications director at the RNC. They have not made any other staff additions since then. “The Romney campaign should have expanded their senior team months ago, once the nomination was in sight,” said one high-level Republican consultant. “They need much more than that, especially on the strategy side. The core team from ‘08 is solid, but has never played at this level.” Whether or not the Romney team agree with that critique — and they likely don’t — adding a few people with past national, presidential experience could go a long way to knocking down the staff shakeup narrative running rampant in the political world at the moment.

Answer:","completion":"Then, lift your left arm over your head and gently place your hand on the right side of your head. Slowly bend your head towards the_left_side and hold this position for about 10-15 counts. While holding this position, take deep breaths and focus on releasing the tension in your neck muscles. Be mindful not to pull too hard on your head, as the goal is to create a gentle stretch, not to strain the neck muscles. Once you have held the stretch for 10-15 counts, slowly release your left hand and bring your head back to the neutral position. Repeat this stretch on the opposite side by placing your left hand under your left thigh or holding the left side of the seat of your chair. Raise your right arm over your head and place your hand on the left side of your head, slowly bending your head towards the_right_side. Hold for 10-15 counts, remembering to maintain deep, even breaths throughout the stretch. Additionally, perform the stretch for each vertebra from your neck to your right shoulder. Begin by dropping your head forward gently to focus on the top of the neck, holding this stretch for two breaths. Slowly roll your head down and to the right, focusing on each vertebra as you make your way towards your right shoulder. This will help you release tension throughout the entire neck area, ensuring that you're targeting all the muscles that may be holding stress. Once you've completed these stretches, try incorporating some movements focused on the rest of your body to further alleviate stress. Starting at the top of your head, gently roll your head in circles, feeling the stretch move throughout your neck and upper shoulders. Then, standing up straight, reach your arms up overhead, stretching your fingertips towards the sky. Slowly bend to the left and then to the right, creating a stretch on both sides of your torso. Finally, stretch down to your toes by bending at the waist, keeping your knees slightly bent. Grasp your right heel with both hands, drawing your chest towards your knee. Feel the stretch in your neck, upper arms, and lower back as you hold this position for a few breaths. Switch to the left side, holding your left heel and drawing your chest towards your left knee, holding for a few breaths. By incorporating these varied stretches into your daily routine, you will not only help to relieve stress in your neck and other areas of your body, but you will also promote better posture, increased flexibility, and improved overall well-being. Always remember to listen to your body and adjust the intensity of your stretches to suit your individual needs, ensuring a safe and effective stretching experience."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Step 2: Establish the Setting The movie is set in a bustling city, a perfect place for aspiring artists and filmmakers. The characters are all in their late twenties, struggling to make a name for themselves in the competitive world of filmmaking and entertainment. Step 3: Introduce the Conflict One day, while cleaning up his video storage, Russ stumbles upon a mysterious tape that he's sure he never recorded. Eager to discover its contents, he decides to watch the tape alone. The footage shocks him - it shows a terrible incident involving his friends from a past party that could potentially ruin their careers if ever released. Step 4: Russ' Lie Disturbed by the footage and fearing its potential consequences, Russ decides to lie to his friends about watching the tape. He casually brings up the topic of the tape during a group dinner and states that it's just an old, harmless project they did together. The friends feel relieved, believing Russ when he says there's nothing to worry about. Step 5: Secrets Unfold and Tensions Rise As time passes, pieces of information about the incident caught on tape start to surface among their circle of friends. This stirs suspicion within the group, and they gradually begin to question Russ's version of the events. The trust and bond that once held them together start to crumble as suspicions rise and relationships become strained. Step 6: Resolution and Climax Faced with mounting pressure and fearing exposure, Russ finally comes clean about his lie to his friends. They are understandably hurt and angry, but the confession presents them with a chance to collectively confront their past mistakes. Together, they decide to destroy the tape and agree to never speak of the incident again. Step 7: Character Growth and Conclusion Although the friends have to face the consequences of their actions, their experience also leads to personal growth and self-improvement. Russ learns the value of honesty and the cost of lying to protect the ones he loves. Likewise, his friends learn to take responsibility for their actions and appreciate the importance of trust in their relationships. In the end, Russ and his friends continue to chase their dreams and aspirations, but they move forward with valuable lessons learned and a stronger bond between them."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The question asks if two statements have the same meaning: Statement 1: Where do we use 1 kB = 1000 bytes, 1 MB = 1000 kB, 1 GB = 1000 MB, 1 TB = 1000 GB? Statement 2: Where do we use 1 KB = 1024 bytes, 1 MB = 1024 KB, 1 GB = 1024 MB, 1 TB = 1024 GB? As well as an additional query: \\"Is the phone OK if it has 1 GB ram?\\" Step 2: Analyze the statements. Statement 1 describes the decimal system of measuring storage capacity, and it is primarily used by the International System of Units (SI) for base-10 prefixes, which include kilo (k), mega (M), giga (G), and tera (T). Statement 2 describes the binary system of measuring storage capacity, and it is used in the context of computer systems, where memory and storage capacities are calculated using base-2 (binary) numbers. In this context, the base-2 prefixes include kibi (Ki), mebi (Mi), gibi (Gi), and tebi (Ti). Step 3: Compare the statements. The two statements describe different measurement systems (decimal and binary) used in different contexts. Therefore, they do not have the same meaning. Step 4: Evaluate the additional query. Answer options: [a]. no. [b]. yes. The query \\"Is the phone OK if it has 1 GB ram?\\" does not directly relate to the similarities or differences between the two measurement systems mentioned in the statements. Therefore, the options provided do not properly address this query. However, to answer this query, it depends on the user's requirements and the specific tasks that the phone needs to handle. For basic use, 1 GB of RAM would be considered sufficient, but for more advanced activities such as gaming or multitasking, additional RAM might be necessary. Step 5: Select the appropriate answer.

Movie title: Above Suspicion Movie plot: Oxford, England, 1939 on the eve of the United States entering World War 2, the Germans have a new secret weapon, a magnetic water bomb that is pulled to a ship and explodes. The British want to know more about how it works and pull in American scholar Richard Myles (Fred MacMurray) to obtain information undercover in the Father land. Richard has just married classmate Frances (Joan Crawford) and the two take off for a private honeymoon on the coast. Before they know it they have agreed to be spies and take off to Germany, Frances with a rose in her hat to signal their presence to an unknown contact who will give them further information on who the main contacts in the country will have information about the destructive weapons of Germany. When they have landed they are contacted by suspicious Hassert Seidel (Conrad Veidt) who leads them to a hotel where another contact gives them more information about a concert with information located in the musical notes, which have been secluded in a tourist guide book. Richard makes friends with fellow Oxford scholar Thornley (Bruce Lester) and the three Americans are thrown together when someone shoots a high-ranking official at a Franz Liszt concert stopping the proceedings for questioning from the Nazis. At the concert disruptions Richard meets another Oxford chum, Sig von Aschenhausen (Basil Rathbone) whose place in Germany is unknown to the Americans until they realize that he is a Nazi himself, and aware of a contingency to gather information back to Britain. Aschenhausen is the perfectly sever German and he kidnaps Frances and tortures her to get information, thus putting Richard, Thornley, and Seidel into action to try to free her, and get back to the land of the free. Answer:","completion":"In the movie \\"Above Suspicion,\\" American scholar Richard Myles, played by Fred MacMurray, is sent to obtain information undercover in the Father land, which is a term often used to refer to Germany. The film is set in 1939, on the eve of the United States entering World War 2. The British, who are interested in learning more about a new magnetic water bomb being developed by the Germans, approach Richard for this covert mission. Richard, who has recently married his classmate Frances, played by Joan Crawford, is not yet aware of the spy life that awaits him. Their covert mission commences when the newlyweds head to Germany for what was supposed to be a private honeymoon on the coast. Frances uses a rose in her hat as a signal to their unknown contact in Germany. This contact is set to provide them with more information on other contacts within the country who may have valuable information about the German's destructive weaponry. Upon their arrival, they are approached by the suspicious Hassert Seidel, played by Conrad Veidt, who directs them to a hotel where another source provides more information. This new information involves the musical notes of a concert, hidden within a tourist guide book, and is revealed to be crucial in their main mission. In the course of their mission, Richard encounters an old Oxford friend, Thornley, played by Bruce Lester. Their paths cross when a high-ranking official is shot during a Franz Liszt concert, leading to questioning by the Nazis. Another Oxford chum, Sig von Aschenhausen, portrayed by Basil Rathbone, also makes an appearance at this point. However, his role in Germany is at first unknown to Richard and Thornley. Their situation gets more complicated when it becomes apparent that Aschenhausen is a Nazi who is aware of the contingency to gather information back to Britain. Taking his role as a severe German to the extreme, Aschenhausen kidnaps Frances and tortures her for information. This act thrusts Richard, Thornley, and Seidel into action as they maneuver to rescue Frances and return to their homeland. So, in summary, the character sent to obtain information undercover in the Fatherland is Richard Myles, who takes on this clandestine role amidst a whirlwind honeymoon and a series of dangerous encounters. It's an equally intellectual and adrenaline-rushing story, providing a mix of suspense, treacherous twists, and war-time intrigue.

After six hours of questioning the cop, Officer Gina Santer, and Detective 'Bub' Bailey let him go, but instruct him to turn over any information he obtains on the client that claimed Santer was his wife. Most of the info on file at Strachey Investigations about this mystery client is fake. Meanwhile, at the home of Dorothy 'Dot' Fisher and her partner Edith Strong, Dorothy chases out a vandal after he breaks into their home and spray paints homophobic graffiti on their wall. The next day, Andrew McWhirter, close friend of Fisher and Strongâand Timmy Callhan's former boyfriendâintroduce Donald and Timmy to the lesbian couple after a contentious school board meeting at which Dorothy, a guidance counselor at the school, is placed on paid leave due to objections from a homophobic parent whose gay son Derek has been counseled by Fisher. The two are invited by the middle-aged women and houseguest Andrew back to their home in Hollis, but the socialization is interrupted when the returning vandal throws a brick through the window. Strachey chases him back to his car, but the license plate is obscured by mud.

Answer the following question: This article: Sir Robert Eric Mortimer Wheeler (10 September 1890 – 22 July 1976) was a British archaeologist and officer in the British Army. Over the course of his career, he served as Director of both the National Museum of Wales and London Museum, Director-General of the Archaeological Survey of India, and the founder and Honorary Director of the Institute of Archaeology in London, in addition to writing twenty-four books on archaeological subjects. Born in Glasgow to a middle-class family, Wheeler was raised largely in Yorkshire before relocating to London in his teenage years. After studying classics at University College London (UCL), he began working professionally in archaeology, specialising in the Romano-British period. During World War I he volunteered for service in the Royal Artillery, being stationed on the Western Front, where he rose to the rank of major and was awarded the Military Cross. Returning to Britain, he obtained his doctorate from UCL before taking on a position at the National Museum of Wales, first as Keeper of Archaeology and then as Director, during which time he oversaw excavation at the Roman forts of Segontium, Y Gaer, and Isca Augusta with the aid of his first wife, Tessa Wheeler. Influenced by the archaeologist Augustus Pitt Rivers, Wheeler argued that excavation and the recording of stratigraphic context required an increasingly scientific and methodical approach, developing the \\"Wheeler method\\". In 1926, he was appointed Keeper of the London Museum; there, he oversaw a reorganisation of the collection, successfully lobbied for increased funding, and began lecturing at UCL. In 1934, he established the Institute of Archaeology as part of the federal University of London, adopting the position of Honorary Director. In this period, he oversaw excavations of the Roman sites at Lydney Park and Verulamium and the Iron Age hill fort of Maiden Castle. During World War II, he re-joined the Armed Forces and rose to the rank of brigadier, serving in the North African Campaign and then the Allied... contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who worked professionally in archaeology, and specialised in the Romano-British period?, what is it ?

Kicker Phil Dawson (4) slaps hands with Garrett Celek (88) after making a 50-yard field goal in the 2nd quarter of a preseason game between the 49ers and the Houston Texans at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, 49ers’ preseason takeaway: What a difference in Davis Mike Davis had no nowhere to go but up after his rookie season, but who expected the 49ers running back to reach such heights Sunday? Yes, it was a preseason game, but the slimmed-down, cutting-on-a-dime Davis looked far shiftier than the first-year version. In 2015, Davis (35 carries, 58 yards) became the sixth running back since 1970 to average less than 2.0 yards a carry with at least 35 attempts in a season (the anonymous others: Louis Carter, Reggie Rivers, Lamar Gordon, Odell Lawson and Willie Spencer). On Sunday, in a 24-13 loss to the Texans, Davis rushed for 71 yards on five carries, ripping off gains of 44 and 17 yards. Chip Kelly was asked if Davis, a fourth-round pick, looked different than the player he’d seen on video in 2015. Kelly began with a joke (“Yeah, he’s a lot bigger in person”), before acknowledging Davis boosted his chances of making the 53-man roster. “I knew that he ran behind his pads really well and he’s shown that,” Kelly said. “He’s really put himself in a position for a spot … Some guys really stepped up and really took advantage of that opportunity and some other guys were kind of looking around and kind of caught up in the moment.” Davis stepped up because he stepped with more burst than he showed in 2015. Davis, listed at 5-foot-9, 217 pounds, isn’t a burner (4.58-second 40), but on Sunday he wasn’t the plodder he resembled as a rookie. 2-8-SF43 (shotgun): Davis right guard pushed ob at HST 13 for 44 yards. Davis, lined up to the right of QB Thad Lewis, began with a counter move that put him in the middle of the backfield. He then bounced back to the right and ran through a sizable hole created by a seal block from TE Blake Bell and pancake block from RT Trent Brown. Five yards beyond the line of scrimmage, Davis hopped over the would-be shoestring tackles of two defenders and raced down the right sideline. 2-10-HOU 13 (shotgun): Davis left tackle to HST 6 for 7 yards Davis, lined up the right of Lewis, ran left as he took the handoff and drifted parallel to the line of scrimmage, before cutting hard off his left foot and running decisively downfield. 2-10-HOU 46 (shotgun): Davis right end to HST 43 for 3 yards David, lined up to the right of Lewis, drifted left before cutting hard right. It initially appeared the cutback would net a decent gain, but Lewis got in his way as he carried out a zone-read fake. Lewis appeared to offer a Davis a my-bad tap on the helmet after the play. 2-5-SF 25 (shotgun): M.Davis left tackle to SF 42 for 17 yards Davis, lined up to the left of Lewis, drifted to the middle of the backfield before cutting hard off his right foot. He avoided a would-be tackler at his feet in the backfield and sprinted into the open field. Said play-by-play man Bob Fitzgerald after the run: “Did Mike Davis just get faster in the offseason?” 2-10-SF 42 (shotgun): Davis right end to SF 43 for 1 yard Davis, lined up the right of Lewis, cut right and probably would have gained about five yards if he squared his shoulders and ran upfield. Instead, he tried to juke a defender, bounced outside and ran four yards in the wrong direction before he was dragged down by a host of defenders. He’s faster than he was last year, but he’s not fast enough to turn the corner on a run like that.

Write an article with the title: \\"Art treasures of the Mughal empire\\"","completion":"Title: Art Treasures of the Mughal Empire Introduction: The Mughal Empire, a dominant power in the Indian subcontinent from the early 16th to the mid-19th century, is well-known for its rich artistic legacy. Spanning over three centuries, this empire left an indelible mark on Indian history and culture with its diverse range of art forms. This article explores the various art treasures of the Mughal Empire that not only epitomize its cultural richness, but also reflect the imperial patronage and refined taste of its rulers. I. Mughal Miniature Paintings: Mughal miniature paintings evolved from the blending of Persian, Indian, and Central Asian styles and were popularized during the reign of Emperor Akbar. They are considered some of the most remarkable achievements in the history of Indian painting. These intricate paintings were usually commissioned to illustrate poetic and historical manuscripts or as independent paintings. Famous for their attention to detail, balance of colors, and sophisticated compositions, Mughal miniatures are rich in symbolism and illuminated with gold and silver. Noteworthy examples include those showcasing the tales of the Persian epic Shahnama, the life and conquests of Emperor Akbar, and the ethereal depictions of Emperor Jahangir and his court. Among the prominent painters were Abdu's Samad, Basawan, Bishndas, and Ustad Mansur, who immortalized Mughal emperors, nobility, and landscapes with their brushes. II. Mughal Architecture: Mughal architecture is characterized by its distinctive fusion of Persian, Indian, and Islamic styles, replete with domes, arches, and ornamental designs. The architectural marvels exhibit the grandeur and opulence of the Mughal era, with exemplary craftsmanship and engineering. Some iconic Mughal monuments include the Taj Mahal, Humayun's Tomb, and the Red Fort. 1. Taj Mahal: An epitome of love, the Taj Mahal was commissioned by Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his beloved wife Mumtaz Mahal. This UNESCO World Heritage Site is constructed primarily of white marble and is adorned with intricate inlay work using precious stones. It stands as a testament to the expertise of Mughal artisans and architects. 2. Humayun's Tomb: Humayun's Tomb, another UNESCO World Heritage Site, was built by his widow, Bega Begum, in 1570. The tomb served as a prototype for Mughal mausoleum architecture, showcasing a synthesis of Persian and Indian styles with its octagonal layout, high arches, and a central dome. 3. Red Fort: Completed in 1648, the Red Fort is a massive fortification in Delhi that served as the main residence for Mughal emperors. It is an outstanding example of Mughal architectural splendor, characterized by its red sandstone walls, grand halls, and intricate lattice screens. III. Decorative and Applied Arts: Mughal decorative and applied arts are renowned for their intricate craftsmanship, luxurious materials, and high aesthetic appeal. Some notable forms include metalwork, textiles, carpets, manuscripts, and jewelry. These art forms were patronized by the Mughal emperors, who sought to surround themselves with beauty and luxury. 1. Metalwork: Mughal metalwork includes remarkable examples of vessels, weapons, and ornaments made from gold, silver, and copper alloys. The metalwork is often embellished with enameling, inlay work, and gemstones. 2. Textiles: The Mughal Empire produced some of the finest textiles in the Indian subcontinent, including the famed kani shawls and brocade work. Textiles were adorned with intricate patterns and motifs, curated from Persian, Chinese, and Indian sources. 3. Carpets: Mughal carpets were reputed for their high-quality craftsmanship and the intricate weaving techniques that gave them an opulent appearance. Carpets during Mughal rule typically featured geometric or floral patterns and were made with the finest silk, wool, and even metal-thread. 4. Manuscripts: The making and illustration of Persian and Indian manuscripts saw a golden age under Mughal rule. Calligraphers, painters, and bookbinders came together to create exquisite volumes showcasing the finest craftsmanship and artistic ingenuity. 5. Jewelry: Mughal jewelry was renowned for its intricate designs, lavish use of gemstones, and high-quality goldsmith work. This led to the creation of iconic pieces such as the Peacock Throne, the Timur Ruby, and the Shah Jahan Emerald. Conclusion: The Mughal Empire's art treasures are an ode to the rich history and cultural diversity of India. These profound artistic accomplishments display a keen eye for beauty and expertise in various mediums, blending native and foreign techniques to create a distinctive style. Today, they continue to enthrall us and stand as a testament to the mastery of Mughal artists and craftsmen."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

From this gas and dust, everything we now see was made. How were stars and planets created from just gas and dust? The answer is gravity. The same gravity that holds you down on Earth. The same force that causes your pencil to roll off your desk. The same force that causes it to fall to the floor. The invisible force of gravity caused dust and gas particles to be pulled together. This force is what formed all the objects in our solar system. This force formed the smallest moons. It also formed our Sun. This force caused more than just our solar system to form. It caused all the other solar systems to form. It caused the formation of all the galaxies of the universe.

Article: In this April 13, 2018 photo hobby archaeologist Rene Schoen and 13-year-old Luca Malaschnitschenko, right, search for coins after a medieval silver treasure had been found near Schaprode on the northern... (Associated Press) BERLIN (AP) — Hundreds of 1,000-year-old silver coins, rings, pearls and bracelets linked to the era of Danish King Harald Gormsson have been found on the eastern German island of Ruegen in the Baltic Sea. A single silver coin was first found in January by two amateur archaeologists, one of them a 13-year-old boy, in a field near the village of Schaprode. The state archaeology office then became involved and the entire treasure was uncovered by experts over the weekend, the Mecklenburg-West Pomerania state archaeology office said Monday. \\"It's the biggest trove of such coins in the southeastern Baltic region,\\" the statement said. The office said the two amateur archeologists were asked to keep quiet about their discovery to give professionals time to plan the dig and were then invited to participate in the recovery. \\"This was the (biggest) discovery of my life,\\" hobby archaeologist Rene Schoen told the German news agency dpa. Schoen said he and 13-year-old Luca Malaschnitschenko were using metal detectors on the field near Schaprode when Luca found a little piece that he initially thought was only aluminum garbage. But when they cleaned it, they understood it was more precious. Archaeologists said about 100 of the silver coins are probably from the reign of Harald Gormsson, better known as \\"Harald Bluetooth,\\" who lived in the 10th century and introduced Christianity to Denmark. He was one of the last Viking kings of what is now Denmark, northern Germany, southern Sweden and parts of Norway. His nickname came from the fact he had a dead tooth that looked bluish, but it's now best known for the wireless Bluetooth technology invented by Swedish telecom company Ericsson. The company named the technology, developed to wirelessly unite computers with cellular devices, after him for his ability to unite ancient Scandinavia. The technology logo carries the runic letters for his initials HB. ___ Jan M. Olsen contributed from Copenhagen, Denmark. ||||| Discovery by a 13-year-old and an amateur archaeologist leads to hoard linked to king who brought Christianity to Denmark A 13-year-old boy and an amateur archaeologist have unearthed a “significant” trove in Germany which may have belonged to the Danish king Harald Bluetooth who brought Christianity to Denmark. René Schön and his student Luca Malaschnitschenko were looking for treasure using metal detectors in January on northern Rügen island when they chanced upon what they initially thought was a worthless piece of aluminium. But upon closer inspection, they realised that it was a piece of silver, German media reported. Over the weekend, the regional archaeology service began a dig covering 400 sq metres (4,300 sq ft). It has found a hoard believed to be linked to the Danish king Harald Gormsson, better known as “Harry Bluetooth”, who reigned from around AD958 to 986. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Archaeologists working on the dig on Rügen island after the find by René Schön and Luca Malaschnitschenko. Photograph: Stefan Sauer/AFP/Getty Images Braided necklaces, pearls, brooches, a Thor’s hammer, rings and up to 600 chipped coins were found, including more than 100 that date back to Bluetooth’s era, when he ruled over what is now Denmark, northern Germany, southern Sweden and parts of Norway. “This trove is the biggest single discovery of Bluetooth coins in the southern Baltic Sea region and is therefore of great significance,” the lead archaeologist, Michael Schirren, told national news agency DPA. The oldest coin is a Damascus dirham dating to 714 while the most recent is a penny dating to 983. The find suggests that the treasure may have been buried in the late 980s – also the period when Bluetooth was known to have fled to Pomerania, where he died in 987. “We have here the rare case of a discovery that appears to corroborate historical sources,” said the archaeologist Detlef Jantzen. Bluetooth is credited with unifying Denmark. The Viking-born king also turned his back on old Norse religion and introduced Christianity to the Nordic country. But he was forced to flee to Pomerania after a rebellion led by his son Sven Gabelbart. Bluetooth’s lasting legacy is found today in smartphones and laptops – the wireless Bluetooth technology is named after him, and the symbol is composed of the two runes spelling out his initials HB. ||||| At the weekend archaeologists from the state of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania excavated an area of about 400 square metres in an open field near the Rügen village of Schaprode. To their surprise, they discovered Viking Age necklaces, rings, bracelets, beads, brooches, and 500 to 600 partially split coins - 100 of which are from a period in the late tenth century during King Harald's rule. \\"This is the largest single find of Bluetooth coins in the southern Baltic Sea region and is therefore of outstanding importance,\\" excavation director Michael Schirren said. With a weight of 0.3 grams, the silver coins bearing a Christian cross were among Denmark’s first independent coins. Photo: DPA Similar types of coins have so far only been found in the territory of the Danish empire, such as at Husby and Harndrup, according to the excavation director. Harald Bluetooth is regarded as the founder of the Danish empire in that he brought the previously fragmented country together, implemented reforms and introduced Christianity to Denmark. In 1872 and 1874, only a few kilometres away on the island of Hiddensee, gold jewellery also attributed to the king was discovered. It’s possible there is a connection between this find and the one at the weekend, according to Schirren. In January, hobby archaeologist René Schön and pupil Luca Malaschnitschenko had been searching for treasures with a metal detector on Rügen. Little did they know that the piece of aluminium they found would prompt a team of archaeologists to search the area and uncover more treasures from the late tenth century. \\"That was the find of my life,\\" Schön said.

Shortly after 1:30 pm on June 13, 2008, Russert collapsed at the offices of WRC-TV, which houses the Washington, D.C. bureau of NBC News where he was chief. He was recording voiceovers for the Sunday edition of Meet the Press. In a speech he gave at the Kennedy Center, Brian Williams said that Russert's last words were, \\"What's happening?\\" spoken as a greeting to NBC Washington bureau editing supervisor Candace Harrington as he passed her in the hallway. He then walked down the hallway to record voiceovers in the soundproof booth and collapsed. A co-worker began to perform CPR on him. The District of Columbia Fire and Rescue service received a call from NBC at 1:40 pm, and dispatched an EMS unit which arrived at 1:44 pm. Paramedics attempted to defibrillate Russert's heart three times, but he did not respond. Russert was then transported to Sibley Memorial Hospital, arriving at 2:23 pm, where he was pronounced dead. He was 58 years old. In accordance with American journalistic tradition, the public announcement of Russert's death was withheld by the wire services and his network's competitors, until Russert's family had been notified. Retired NBC Nightly News anchor Tom Brokaw then delivered, live on NBC, CNBC, and MSNBC, the news of his death. NBC Nightly News anchor Brian Williams was on assignment in Afghanistan and could not anchor the special report. CBS and ABC also interrupted programming to report Russert's death. Armen Keteyian reported the news for CBS and Charles Gibson reported for ABC. Russert had just returned from a family vacation in Rome, Italy, where he had celebrated his son's graduation from Boston College. While his wife and son remained in Rome, Russert had returned to prepare for his Sunday television show. Russert's longtime friend and physician, Dr. Michael Newman, said that his asymptomatic coronary artery disease had been controlled with medication (LDL-C was <70 mg/dL) and exercise, and that he had performed well on a stress test in late April. An autopsy performed on the day of his death determined that his history of coronary artery disease led to a myocardial infarction (heart attack) and ventricular fibrillation with the immediate cause being an occlusive coronary thrombosis in the left anterior descending artery resulting from a ruptured cholesterol plaque. Russert is buried at Rock Creek Cemetery. The Newseum in Washington, D.C., exhibited a re-creation of Russert's office with original elements such as his desks, bookshelves, folders, loose leaf papers and notebooks. In August 2014, the exhibit was disassembled at the Newseum and transported to the Buffalo History Museum. The exhibit entitled \\"Inside Tim Russert's Office: If it's Sunday It's Meet the Press\\", opened in October 2014 with Luke Russert and others giving opening remarks.

Wearing an oversized red cap to protect him from the scorching Philippine sun, Dante is doing work that should be reserved for men, not children. Earning 150 pesos (3.50) for a seven-hour day, Dante has been a child laborer in the Philippine region of Mindanao since he was seven years old. He says he does it to help his parents, but he is just one of many children who are part of an illegal economic system of child labor. The International Labor Organization (ILO) estimates 2.4 million child workers are in the Philippines. Many of them, according to the ILO, are in rural areas working in fields and mines. The organization estimates 60% work in hazardous conditions. Alongside Dante is 13-year-old Alvic James, who dropped out of school when he was in the first grade. Back then, he explained, his family didn't have enough money to eat. Alvic says he wants to learn to read and write but because he is needed in the fields he has no time to go to school. When the boys turn 15 or 16, they'll move on to the more hazardous job of cutting sugar cane. That's currently the job of 16-year-old Elmar Paran, who hasn't been to school since he was a young child, sentencing him to a future in the fields.

Is it possible to conclude that \\"A man throws a net off of a boat while children watch.\\" if \\"the man is fishing\\"?","completion":"It is possible to conclude that \\"A man throws a net off of a boat while children watch\\" if \\"the man is fishing,\\" but one must consider several factors and make certain assumptions to reach this conclusion. First, we must define \\"fishing.\\" Fishing is the activity of catching fish, either for food, recreation, or sport. This activity can be done in various environments, such as rivers, lakes, or oceans. It can also be carried out with different tools and techniques, such as with a line and hook, nets, or even with bare hands. Now, given that the man is fishing, we can assume that he is engaged in the activity of catching fish. However, since there are various techniques for fishing, concluding that the man is throwing a net requires the assumption that the man is using a net for fishing. Throwing a net is common in certain types of fishing, like cast net fishing, purse seine fishing, or other types of commercial or traditional fishing. Consequently, it is plausible but not guaranteed that he may be using a net for fishing. There is also the mention of the boat in the original statement. Since the man is fishing, it can be inferred that he is on a body of water. Boats are a typical mode of transportation used for fishing activities and allow access to deeper waters or places unreachable from the shore. So, the premise of the man fishing off of a boat is reasonable. Lastly, we must address the presence of children watching. It is not unusual for children to be around during various activities, including fishing. They might be observing the process, learning from adults, or simply enjoying the experience. However, their presence is not inherently connected to the act of fishing. Assuming that the children are at a location where they can observe the man fishing (e.g., on the boat or nearby), it is plausible that children could be present while the man is fishing. To conclude that \\"A man throws a net off of a boat while children watch\\" if \\"the man is fishing,\\" one would have to assume that: 1. The man is using a net as his fishing method. 2. The man is fishing from a boat. 3. Children are present and able to observe the man fishing. If these assumptions are accepted, it is possible to conclude that the sentence \\"A man throws a net off of a boat while children watch\\" can hold true if \\"the man is fishing.\\" Nevertheless, it is important to note that these are assumptions made to connect the two statements."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Michael Williams is a drifter living out of his car after being discharged from the Marine Corps. A job on an oilfield falls through due to his unwillingness to conceal a war injury on his job application, so Michael wanders into rural Red Rock, Wyoming, looking for other work. A local bar owner named Wayne mistakes him for a hit man, \\"Lyle from Dallas\\", whom Wayne has hired to kill his wife. Wayne offers him a stack of cash—\\"half now, half later\\"—and Michael plays along by taking the money. Michael visits Wayne's wife, Suzanne and attempts to warn her that her life is in danger instead of killing her. She offers him more money to kill Wayne. Michael tries to leave town but a car accident leads him to encounter the local sheriff, who turns out to be Wayne. Michael manages to escape from Wayne but runs into the real Lyle from Dallas. Lyle and Wayne quickly figure out what has transpired, while Michael desperately tries to warn Suzanne before Lyle finds her. The next morning, when Lyle comes to get money from Wayne, he kidnaps both Suzanne and Michael, who are trying to retrieve hidden cash from Wayne's office. Wayne and Suzanne are revealed to be wanted for embezzlement and Wayne is arrested by his own deputies. Lyle returns with Michael and Suzanne hostage and gets Wayne out of jail to retrieve their stash of money. At a remote graveyard, Wayne pulls a gun from the case of money and holds Lyle at gunpoint before Lyle throws a knife into Wayne's neck. Michael and Lyle fight, with Lyle ending up being impaled on a grave marker. When Lyle rises to attack Michael, Suzanne shoots him dead.

Given the question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who was taught how to play guitar by Roger Cremer? Taylor Alison Swift was born on December 13, 1989, in Reading, Pennsylvania. Her father, Scott Kingsley Swift, was a stockbroker for Merrill Lynch, and her mother, Andrea Gardner Swift (née Finlay), was a homemaker who had worked as a mutual fund marketing executive. Swift was named after the American singer-songwriter James Taylor. She has a younger brother named Austin, who is an actor. Swift spent the early years of her life on a Christmas tree farm which her father purchased from one of his clients. She attended preschool and kindergarten at the Alvernia Montessori School, run by Franciscan nuns, before transferring to The Wyndcroft School. The family then moved to a rented house in the suburban town of Wyomissing, Pennsylvania, where she attended Wyomissing Area Junior/Senior High School.At the age of nine, Swift became interested in musical theater and performed in four Berks Youth Theatre Academy productions. She also traveled regularly to New York City for vocal and acting lessons. Swift later shifted her focus toward country music inspired by Shania Twain's songs, which made her \\"want to just run around the block four times and daydream about everything\\". She spent her weekends performing at local festivals and events. After watching a documentary about Faith Hill, Swift felt sure that she needed to go to Nashville, Tennessee, to pursue a music career. At the age of eleven, she traveled with her mother to visit Nashville record labels and submitted a demo tape of Dolly Parton and Dixie Chicks karaoke covers. However, she was rejected since \\"everyone in that town wanted to do what I wanted to do. So, I kept thinking to myself, I need to figure out a way to be different\\".When Swift was about 12 years old, computer repairman and local musician Ronnie Cremer taught her how to play guitar and helped with her first efforts as a songwriter, leading to her writing \\"Lucky You\\". In 2003, Swift and her parents started working with New York-based music manager Dan Dymtrow. With his help, Swift modelled for...

They wanted everyone, including little kids like you, to understand why it's better to find other ways to make things work. You know that cars, buses, and factories use oil to run, right? Well, the more we depend on oil, the more it can cause problems. The friendly group wants us to know about three main dangers of using too much oil. 1. Dirty Air: When we burn oil to make machines go, it can cause dirty smoke to go into the air. This makes the air harder to breathe and it's not good for our lungs or our friends like the birds and squirrels. 2. Harm to Mother Earth: Oil can sometimes spill into the water or on land, making homes of fish, plants, and other animals dirty. It's like when you spill juice on the floor, but much harder to clean up. 3. Running Out of Oil: If we keep using a lot of oil, one day there may not be enough left for everyone. It's like when you eat all the cookies in the jar. Once they're gone, there are no more cookies! The nice group wants us to remember that we can use other things instead of oil, like wind that can move a pinwheel, or sun that can make your skin feel warm.

Davey Gillen, a new IRA prisoner, arrives; he is categorised as a \\"non-conforming prisoner\\" for his refusal to wear the prison uniform. He is sent to his cell naked with only a blanket. His cellmate, Gerry, has smeared the walls with faeces from floor to ceiling as part of the no wash protest. The two men get to know each other and we see them living within the cell. Gerry's girlfriend sneaks a radio in by wrapping it and keeping it in her vagina. Prison officers forcibly and violently remove the prisoners from their cells and beat them before pinning them down to cut their long hair and beards, grown as part of the no-wash protest. The prisoners resist, Sands spitting into Lohan's face, who responds by punching him in the face and then swings again, only to miss and punch the wall, causing his knuckles to bleed. He cuts Sands' hair and beard; the men throw Sands in the bathtub and scrub him clean before hauling him away again. Lohan is then seen smoking a cigarette, as in the opening scenes, his hand bloodied. Later, the prisoners are taken out of their cells and given second-hand civilian clothing. The guards are seen snickering as they are handed to the prisoners who respond, after Sands' initial action, by tearing up the clothes and wrecking their cells.

Summarize this article: Before wrapping in the opposite direction, press down on the yarn between the pegs with the side of the hand. This moves the loops down on the pegs and creates room to loop the yarn around each of the pegs again. There should be some resistance when pressing down on the yarn. This indicates good tension, which will result in a neat looking finished scarf. If the yarn feels loose or has already slid to the peg bottom on its own, then the pegs are not wrapped tightly enough. In this case, you may need to start over. Each peg (except for the last peg wrapped) will need to have two loops on it before working the loops off the loom. To make a second pass, bring the yarn down from the last peg wrapped and around it in the same direction as the yarn from the previous pass. Bring the yarn up to the next peg moving back towards the beginning of the loom. Keep wrapping the yarn around the pegs in the same direction as first round of loops until the last peg (the first peg wrapped on the first pass). Wrap this peg from the opposite direction. After wrapping the last peg, hold the yarn in place with fingers or wrap it around the anchor peg on this side of the loom. When each peg in the row is wrapped twice (except for last peg on upper end of the loom) begin working the bottom row of loops off the loom. Insert loom tool through the bottom loop on the last peg in lower row. Bring the loop up and over the other loop on the peg to knit it. After knitting the first loop on the lower row, repeat for the bottom loop on the upper row. Return to the lower row going back and forth to knit the loops until the end of the row. When finished working the first round of loops off the loom, only one stitch is on each of the pegs. Continue the process of wrapping the yarn around the pegs and working back and forth across rows to knit the loops. Continue until scarf is the length desired. After a few rows, knit material comes through the bottom of the loom. Measure the knitted material to determine where the scarf will end. Four rows creates 1” (2.5 cm) of knit material. For a scarf five feet long or 60” (152 cm), knit about 240 rows on the loom.","completion":"To create a neat-looking scarf using a loom, ensure proper tension by pressing down on the yarn between the pegs with the side of the hand.

Until a few hundred years ago, not many people were taught to read, so there was a lot more reading out loud by the few people who could. To help those reading out loud in the old days, sign known as \\"points\\" were added to pages of writing. Punctuation comes from the Latin word punctus, meaning \\"point\\". These points told readers when to pause or take a breath, and what to emphasize . In Europe from the early centuries AD, these points were widely used although not everybody used the same points for the same thing. When printing was invented, printers had to be made more clearly about what to put where, so that everyone was doing the same thing.

The sort we have in English today began to be widely used during the 18th century. Before that readers simply understood from the way a sentence was written that someone was speaking although sometimes spoken words were underlined. Comma , colon: period(full stop). All three of these sorts of punctuation marks were given their Greek names by Aristophanes, a librarian who lived in Byzantium in the 2nd century BC. They were marks on the page, each with a message to the reader. Comma meant a short pause. Colon meant a medium sized pause. Period meant a long pause. Exclamation mark! In the early days of punctuation, if you saw this sign, you were supposed to pause. Some people think the exclamation mark began as what the Greek word IO looked like if it was turned 90 degrees. This word means \\"Oh, gosh!\\" With the I on the top and the O under it, the sign as we know it today was developed. Question mark?

(CNN) -- Georgian authorities foiled an attempted army mutiny that they believe was designed to disrupt planned NATO exercises in the former Soviet republic, the country's interior ministry said Tuesday. Georgian troops take part in military exercises in January. They are to participate in NATO maneuvers this week. About 500 troops at a military base outside the capital, Tbilisi, were involved in the rebellion, said Interior Ministry spokesman Shota Utiashvili. He said it was quickly brought under control, and the government reported a few hours later that the base was calm. Initial investigations suggest that Russia, Georgia's northern neighbor and former ruler, may have had a hand in the mutiny, Utiashvili said.","completion":"(CNN) -- Georgian authorities averted an attempted army mutiny on Tuesday, which they suspect was planned to destabilize the upcoming NATO exercises in the former Soviet republic, according to the country's interior ministry. Georgian troops, who previously participated in military exercises in January, are scheduled to be part of NATO maneuvers this week. Interior Ministry spokesman Shota Utiashvili confirmed that approximately 500 troops stationed at a military base just outside the capital city of Tbilisi were implicated in the rebellion. Utiashvili stated that the swift intervention of Georgian authorities effectively brought the situation under control, preventing the mutiny from escalating further. The government released an update a few hours after the initial reports, indicating that the military base had returned to a state of normalcy and calm. The authorities are currently conducting a thorough investigation into the motives behind the mutiny and those involved in its planning and execution. Preliminary findings appear to point towards Russia, Georgia's northern neighbor and former ruler, as a possible orchestrator of the foiled mutiny, said Utiashvili. As tensions between Georgia and Russia have a history of volatility, with the two countries battling over disputed territories such as Abkhazia and South Ossetia, this attempted disruption of NATO exercises could be seen as Russia attempting to weaken Georgia's ties to the Western military alliance. However, Utiashvili reiterated that these suspicions remain unconfirmed, and the investigation is ongoing to determine the full extent of Russia's potential involvement. Considering the gravity of the situation, Georgian authorities are expected to collaborate with NATO and other partner countries to scrutinize the underlying machinations behind the mutiny and devise strategies to prevent future incidents. The thwarted mutiny and its possible link to Russia underscore the challenges countries like Georgia face while navigating complex international relationships in an increasingly volatile geopolitical landscape. The results of the ongoing investigation could impact existing diplomatic ties and military alliances in the region, and might place extra scrutiny on Russia's role in regional stability. In response to the incident, both NATO and Georgian officials have expressed their commitment to ensuring the planned NATO exercises in Georgia proceed as scheduled, as any disruptions could undermine the credibility of the Western military alliance. These collaborative exercises are seen as vital for maintaining regional stability and preparedness in the face of evolving security threats, while also showcasing Georgia's military capabilities and dedication to working with NATO forces."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In fact, finding out why is a fairly recent discovery. To find out why required new technology. It was the seismograph that made it possible to learn why the Earth acted like a magnet. Seismograph are used to study earthquakes. By studying earthquake waves they were able to learn about Earths interior. They discovered that Earth has an inner and outer core. The outer core consists of liquid metals, mainly iron and nickel. Scientists think that Earths magnetic field is generated here. It is caused by the motion of this liquid metal.

Which language is this?","completion":"The language used in the given sentence is Romanian. Translation: \\"In the case where European consumers would be offered slightly cheaper textiles, would this pose a problem?\\" Addressing the question, offering slightly cheaper textiles to European consumers could potentially have both advantages and disadvantages, depending on different factors such as production methods, overall quality, and impact on the local economy. Advantages: 1. Increased affordability: Cheaper textiles make clothing and other textile products more affordable for a larger portion of the population. This can particularly benefit low-income families by reducing their expenses on essential clothing items. 2. Increased demand for products: Lower prices might drive an increase in demand for textile products, which in turn, can incentivize manufacturers to boost or maintain production levels. Disadvantages: 1. Lower quality: There may be concerns that cheaper textiles could be of lower quality due to the cost-cutting measures taken during production. This might lead to shorter product lifespans and more frequent replacements, causing more waste and higher consumption of resources. 2. Impact on local businesses: Cheaper textiles, especially if they are imported, could negatively affect local textile manufacturers and small businesses, which could struggle to compete with the lower-priced competition. This may result in job losses, reduced investments in innovation, and long-term damage to the local economy. 3. Ethical and environmental concerns: Lower-priced textiles may be produced in countries with less stringent labor and environmental regulations, raising concerns about the exploitation of workers and negligence of environmental protections. European consumers may be contributing to these issues indirectly by purchasing cheaper textiles. Overall, providing slightly cheaper textiles to European consumers has both positive and negative implications. The actual impact depends on the balance between affordability and quality, as well as the potential consequences on local businesses and ethical/environmental considerations. It is essential for consumers, businesses, and regulators to be informed and make choices that promote sustainable and responsible consumption."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write highlights for this article: Peter Ball, formerly the Bishop of Gloucester and Bishop of Lewes, will be prosecuted for historic offences dating back to 1977 (file photo) A retired Church of England bishop and friend of Prince Charles has been charged with a series of sex offences. Peter Ball, who once described the Prince of Wales as a loyal friend after being given a place to live by him, is due to appear in court next month over sex offences and misconduct charges. The 82-year-old former Bishop of Gloucester, who was previously Bishop of Lewes in East Sussex, will be prosecuted for alleged historic offences dating back to 1977. Ball was enthroned as Bishop of Gloucester in 1992 at a ceremony attended by Prince Charles, and resigned in 1993. Shortly afterwards Charles invited him to live in Manor Lodge in the village of Aller, Somerset, a property owned by the Duchy of Cornwall. Ball said at the time: ‘He [Prince Charles] has been wonderfully kind and allowed me to have a Duchy house. The prince is a loyal friend. ‘I have immense admiration for him.

Cyber language is popular among Chinese netizens, who create English words to reflect novel phenomenon in society. \\"Gelivable\\", combining pinyin of Chinese characters Geili (giving strength) with the English suffix for adjectives, literally means \\"giving power\\" or \\"cool\\". Similarly, \\"Hengelivable\\" means \\"very cool\\", and \\"ungelivable\\" means \\"dull, not cool at al\\". \\"Antizen\\" referred to the group of college graduates who, earning a poor salary and living in small rented apartments, are like the tiny and laborious ants.

This three-character expression, which originally meant \\"you win\\" with the first character carrying the same pronunciation as garlic in Chinese, is used to satirize high garlic and food prices this winter. Chinese people use the character \\"bei\\" before a verb to show a passive voice, and it is used by netizens to show the helplessness in front of false conclusions and fake media reports. For instance, \\"zisha\\" means \\"suicide\\" while \\"beizisha\\" means \\"be officially presumed to have committed suicide\\", and xiaokang means \\"fairly comfortable life\\" while \\"beixiaokang\\" means \\"be said to be living a fairly comfortable life\\".

Question: What's Mimi's favorite food? Options: A: Eggs. B: Fish. C: Rice. D: Fruit Answer:","completion":"Based on the given article, Mimi has explicitly mentioned their favorite food. They said, \\"Do you know my favorite food? It is fish.\\" Therefore, the correct answer is B: Fish. The other options can be eliminated for the following reasons: A: Eggs - There is no mention of eggs in the article, so this cannot be considered as Mimi's favorite food. C: Rice - Again, there is no mention of rice in the article, and it is not connected to Mimi's preferences in any way. D: Fruit - In the article, we can see that Mimi specifically mentions not liking apples. Although apples are a type of fruit, we can still eliminate this option, as it is unlikely that her favorite food would belong to a category that consists of something she dislikes. The article gives us a clear idea of Mimi's preferences and characteristics. We know that Mimi is black and white, likes sitting on a chair in the sun during winter, climbs trees, and can \\"sing\\" by saying \\"miao, miao.\\" These clues also suggest that Mimi is a cat, as cats are known for their ability to climb trees and make \\"miao\\" sounds.

It features a fresh 1814 spin on legendary artists from Johnny Cash , Ring of fire to UB40 , Picture on the wall .","completion":"Although both sentences convey the idea of a collection or project that showcases the works of legendary artists like Johnny Cash and UB40, the structure and wording differ slightly, implying slightly different meanings or focusing on different aspects of the concept. Let's break down each sentence: 1. \\"It has a legendary 1814 shoot on fresh artists from Johnny Cash, Ring of Fire to UB40, picture on the wall.\\" This sentence seems to suggest that a legendary \\"shoot\\" (which might refer to a photography or videography session, or possibly a creative project) took place in 1814, focusing on \\"fresh artists\\" like Johnny Cash and UB40. The sentence further refers to specific works (Johnny Cash's \\"Ring of Fire\\" and UB40's \\"Picture on the Wall\\") as examples of the content in this shoot. Although the word '1814' seems out of place, as Johnny Cash and UB40 were not involved in music during that time, the focus seems to be on the legendary shoot or project. 2. \\"It features a fresh 1814 spin on legendary artists from Johnny Cash, Ring of Fire to UB40, Picture on the wall.\\" In this sentence, the project or collection is described as having a \\"fresh 1814 spin\\" on the works of legendary artists such as Johnny Cash and UB40. This suggests that the collection puts a new and modern twist on the works of these artists, which might involve reinterpretation, remixing, or reimagining of their music. Again, the number '1814' seems out of context but the focus of this sentence is more on presenting these classic works in a new and fresh manner. In conclusion, while both sentences revolve around the idea of a creative project that involves artists like Johnny Cash and UB40, the first sentence emphasizes the legendary shoot or project itself and the fresh artists involved, while the second sentence highlights the fresh spin or reinterpretation of the artists' works. Hence, they convey slightly different meanings or focus on different aspects of the project."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In ancient times, the Amazons, a proud and fierce race of warrior women, led by their Queen, Hippolyta, battled Ares, the god of war, and his army. During the battle, Hippolyta specifically targeted and beheaded her son Thrax, whom Ares forcibly conceived with her and who is fighting for his father. Hippolyta then defeated Ares, but Zeus stopped her from delivering the death strike. Instead, Hera bound his powers with magic bracers so that he was deprived of his ability to draw power from the psychic aura of violence and death he could instigate, and only another god could release him. In compensation, the Amazons were granted the island of Themyscira, where they would remain eternally youthful and isolated from Man in the course of their duty of holding Ares prisoner for all eternity. Later, Hippolyta was granted a daughter, Princess Diana, whom she shaped from the sand of the Themyscirian seashore and gave life with her own blood. Over a millennium later, an American fighter pilot, USAF Colonel Steve Trevor, is shot down in a dogfight and crash-lands his YF-23 on the island, where he soon runs afoul of the Amazon population, including the combative Artemis. Steve and Diana meet and fight, and Diana defeats him, taking him to the Amazons. After interrogating him with the use of the Amazons' golden lasso, Hippolyta decides he is not an enemy of the Amazons and as such, tradition dictates that an emissary be tasked to ensure his safe return to his own country. Diana volunteers, but is assigned to guard Ares's cell instead since her mother argues that she has not enough experience in dealing with the dangers of the outside world.

In the same year he accepted an invitation from the BBC to compose his first opera. He decided to base it on Chaucer's Troilus and Criseyde, but his preliminary work came to a halt in April 1948 when Alice Wimborne died. To take Walton's mind off his grief, the music publisher Leslie Boosey persuaded him to be a British delegate to a conference on copyright in Buenos Aires later that year. While there, Walton met Susana Gil Passo (1926–2010), daughter of an Argentine lawyer. At 22 she was 24 years younger than Walton (Alice Wimborne had been 22 years his senior), and at first she ridiculed his romantic interest in her. He persisted, and she eventually accepted his proposal of marriage. The wedding was held in Buenos Aires in December 1948. From the start of their marriage, the couple spent half the year on the Italian island of Ischia, and by the mid-1950s they lived there permanently.Walton's last work of the 1940s was his music for Olivier's film of Hamlet (1948). After that, he focused his attentions on his opera Troilus and Cressida. On the advice of the BBC, he invited Christopher Hassall to write the libretto. This did not help Walton's relations with the Sitwells, each of whom thought he or she should have been asked to be his librettist. Work continued slowly over the next few years, with many breaks while Walton turned to other things. In 1950 he and Heifetz recorded the Violin Concerto for EMI. In 1951 Walton was knighted. In the same year, he prepared an authorised version of Façade, which had undergone many revisions since its premiere. In 1953, following the accession of Elizabeth II he was again called on to write a coronation march, Orb and Sceptre; he was also commissioned to write a choral setting of the Te Deum for the occasion.Troilus and Cressida was presented at Covent Garden on 3 December 1954.

Among the factors that shaped modernism were the development of modern industrial societies and the rapid growth of cities, followed then by reactions of horror to World War I. Modernism also rejected the certainty of Enlightenment thinking, and many modernists rejected religious belief. - The Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, often referred to as The Guggenheim, is an art museum located at 1071 Fifth Avenue on the corner of East 89th Street in the Upper East Side neighborhood of Manhattan, New York City. It is the permanent home of a continuously expanding collection of Impressionist, Post-Impressionist, early Modern and contemporary art and also features special exhibitions throughout the year. The museum was established by the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation in 1939 as the Museum of Non-Objective Painting, under the guidance of its first director, the artist Hilla von Rebay. It adopted its current name after the death of its founder, Solomon R. Guggenheim, in 1952. - Abstract art uses a visual language of shape, form, color and line to create a composition which may exist with a degree of independence from visual references in the world. Western art had been, from the Renaissance up to the middle of the 19th century, underpinned by the logic of perspective and an attempt to reproduce an illusion of visible reality. The arts of cultures other than the European had become accessible and showed alternative ways of describing visual experience to the artist. By the end of the 19th century many artists felt a need to create a new kind of art which would encompass the fundamental changes taking place in technology, science and philosophy. The sources from which individual artists drew their theoretical arguments were diverse, and reflected the social and intellectual preoccupations in all areas of Western culture at that time. - Morris Louis , born Morris Louis Bernstein ( November 28 , 1912 -- September 7 , 1962 ) , was an American painter . During the 1950s he became one of the earliest exponents of Color Field painting . Living in Washington , D.C. Louis , along with Kenneth Noland and other Washington painters formed an art movement that is known today as the Washington Color School . - Abstract expressionism is a postWorld War II art movement in American painting, developed in New York in the 1940s. It was the first specifically American movement to achieve international influence and put New York City at the center of the western art world, a role formerly filled by Paris. Although the term \\"abstract expressionism\\" was first applied to American art in 1946 by the art critic Robert Coates, it had been first used in Germany in 1919 in the magazine \\"Der Sturm\\", regarding German Expressionism. In the United States, Alfred Barr was the first to use this term in 1929 in relation to works by Wassily Kandinsky. - The Walker Art Center is a multidisciplinary contemporary art center in the Lowry Hill neighborhood of Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States. The Walker is one of the most-visited modern and contemporary art museums in the United States and, together with the adjacent Minneapolis Sculpture Garden and the Cowles Conservatory, it has an annual attendance of around 700,000 visitors. The museum's permanent collection includes over 13,000 modern and contemporary art pieces including books, costumes, drawings, media works, paintings, photography, prints, and sculpture. - The Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden is an art museum beside the National Mall, in Washington, D.C., the United States. The museum was initially endowed during the 1960s with the permanent art collection of Joseph H. Hirshhorn. It was designed by architect Gordon Bunshaft and is part of the Smithsonian Institution. It was conceived as the United States' museum of contemporary and modern art and currently focuses its collection-building and exhibition-planning mainly on the postWorld War II period, with particular emphasis on art made during the last 50 years. - The Washington Gallery of Modern Art was a short-lived gallery promoting contemporary art near Dupont Circle in Washington, DC, United States, during the 1960s. Its collection of 153 works was purchased by the Oklahoma City Museum of Art in 1968 for 110,000. The collection included 20th-century artists, Ellsworth Kelly, Robert Indiana, Grace Hartigan and Marcel Duchamp. - Tate is an institution that houses the United Kingdom's national collection of British art, and international modern and contemporary art. It is a network of four art museums: Tate Britain, London (until 2000 known as the Tate Gallery, founded 1897), Tate Liverpool (founded 1988), Tate St Ives, Cornwall (founded 1993) and Tate Modern, London (founded 2000), with a complementary website, Tate Online (created 1998). Tate is not a government institution, but its main sponsor is the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. - Helen Frankenthaler (December 12, 1928 December 27, 2011) was an American abstract expressionist painter. She was a major contributor to the history of postwar American painting. Having exhibited her work for over six decades (early 1950s until 2011), she spanned several generations of abstract painters while continuing to produce vital and ever-changing new work. Frankenthaler began exhibiting her large-scale abstract expressionist paintings in contemporary museums and galleries in the early 1950s. She was included in the 1964 \\"Post-Painterly Abstraction\\" exhibition curated by Clement Greenberg that introduced a newer generation of abstract painting that came to be known as Color Field. Born in Manhattan, she was influenced by Greenberg, Hans Hofmann, and Jackson Pollock's paintings. Her work has been the subject of several retrospective exhibitions, including a 1989 retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, and been exhibited worldwide since the 1950s. In 2001, she was awarded the National Medal of Arts. - Kenneth Noland (April 10, 1924 January 5, 2010) was an American painter. He was one of the best-known American Color Field painters, although in the 1950s he was thought of as an abstract expressionist and in the early 1960s he was thought of as a minimalist painter. Noland helped establish the Washington Color School movement. In 1977, he was honored by a major retrospective at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York that then traveled to the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington, D.C. and Ohio's Toledo Museum of Art in 1978. In 2006, Noland's \\"Stripe Paintings\\" were exhibited at the Tate in London. - Color Field painting is a style of abstract painting that emerged in New York City during the 1940s and 1950s. It was inspired by European modernism and closely related to Abstract Expressionism, while many of its notable early proponents were among the pioneering Abstract Expressionists. Color Field is characterized primarily by large fields of flat, solid color spread across or stained into the canvas creating areas of unbroken surface and a flat picture plane. The movement places less emphasis on gesture, brushstrokes and action in favour of an overall consistency of form and process. In color field painting \\"color is freed from objective context and becomes the subject in itself.\\" - A visual-art movement of the late 1950s through the late-1960s centered in Washington, D.C., the Washington Color School describes a form of abstract art that developed from color field painting, itself a form of abstract art that explored ways to use large solid areas of paint, as exemplified by the work of Mark Rothko and Helen Frankenthaler. The Washington Color School originally consisted of a group of painters who showed works in an exhibit called the \\"Washington Color Painters\\" at the now-defunct Washington Gallery of Modern Art in Washington from June 25 to September 5, 1965. This exhibition, which subsequently traveled to several other venues in the United States, including the Walker Art Center, solidified Washington's place in the national movement and defined what is considered the city's signature art movement. The exhibition's organizer was Gerald \\"Gerry\\" Nordland and the painters included Gene Davis, Morris Louis, Kenneth Noland, Howard Mehring, Thomas \\"Tom\\" Downing, and Paul Reed.

At this time we knew the lease on the house was up at the end of the next month. There had been drama with my fiancé and my mom so everything lined up for us to move out. I told parents we’re going to move out since the lease is up and we want to be on our own. I paid 350 rent and nothing else. We buy our own food and I had given my parents 5000 to pay off debt so that’s my justification for not paying utilities. They told us they couldn’t afford the house if we moved out and that we never even pay utilities. I asked them why not get a smaller house since the lease was up?

To that end, he experimented with a cylinder of gas in three stages, stage A, stage B, and stage C. In stage A he kept the gas in room temperature. In stage B he heated the gas up. And in stage C he cooled the gas down. and a hint : Shown in the Figure below is a cylinder of gas on the left that is at room temperature (300 K). On the right, the cylinder has been heated until the Kelvin temperature has doubled to 600 K. The kinetic energy of the gas molecules increases, so collisions with the walls of the container are now more forceful than they were before. As a result, the pressure of the gas doubles. Decreasing the temperature would have the opposite effect, and the pressure of an enclosed gas would decrease. Please answer this question : Would stage B see increased of decreased pressure than stage C? Answer:","completion":"Stage B would see increased pressure compared to stage C. In the given situation, Rob experiments with a cylinder of gas in three stages (A, B, and C). During stage A, the gas is kept at room temperature (300 K). In stage B, the gas is heated, causing its temperature to increase. In stage C, the gas is cooled down, causing its temperature to decrease. Based on the hint provided, when the gas temperature doubles from 300 K (room temperature) to 600 K (heated), the kinetic energy of the gas molecules increases. This leads to more forceful collisions with the walls of the container, resulting in a doubling of the gas pressure. Conversely, when the gas temperature decreases (as it would in stage C, where the gas is cooled), the collisions between gas molecules and the container walls become less forceful, leading to a decrease in pressure.

She attends groups with her two friends, Alisha (Julia Garro) and Phil (Adam Wagner). One evening after giving a speech about the purity ring worn by members of the group, she is introduced to Tobey (Hale Appleman) and finds him attractive. The four begin going out as a group. Dawn has fantasies about marrying Tobey, although after acknowledging the attraction, they agree that they cannot spend time together. Soon after they give in and meet at a local swimming hole. After swimming together, they go into a cave to get warm and begin kissing. Dawn gets uncomfortable and tries to get them to go back. Tobey then attempts to rape Dawn, who panics and tries to push him off. Tobey becomes aggressive and shakes Dawn, resulting in her smacking her head on the ground. While she is dazed, Tobey takes the opportunity to begin raping her. Dawn fights back and inadvertently bites off his penis with her vagina. A horrified Dawn stumbles away and she flees the scene. After a Promise meeting, she meets her classmate Ryan (Ashley Springer) at a dance; they talk, and he drops her off at her home. Dawn drops her purity ring off a cliff and goes back to the swimming hole. She screams in horror when she sees a freshwater crab crawling on Tobey's penis.

More than one million motorists from around the world have exchanged their foreign licences for a British one in the last 15 years, it emerged today. According the figures obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, the number of licences exchanged per year. peaked at 96,935 in 2007, before falling to 79,187 in 2009. Over the. past three years, the number has risen steadily once again, reaching. 83,553 in 2011. Currently, the UK recognises the driving licences awarded to drivers by 50. other countries, meaning they. can be exchanged after 12 months of residency for a UK licence without. the holder needing to pass any UK test. Drivers from 50 countries can exchange their licence for a British one after 12 months without taking a test. Almost half of the licences swapped. since 1997 have been gained in a country where the driving test doesn't. include driving on the left. Robin Reames, chief claims officer at. swiftcover.com which uncovered the figures, said: 'These figures reflect Britain's. multi-cultural society demonstrating that we are welcoming an increasing. number of motorists to our shores who are choosing to live and drive. here. 'However, UK roads are very different to those overseas so it's. vital that new motorists learn as much as they can, which could include. taking a few lessons from an instructor if necessary.' Since 1997, drivers from South Africa and Australia accounted for the highest number of licences exchanged with 149,897 and. 103,053 respectively. However, as more countries entered the EU in 2004,. allowing licences to be exchanged from eastern European countries,. Polish (135,079 – average of 8,442 per year), Bulgarian (18,719) and. Hungarian (21,714) motorists are actively exchanging their licences. About 88,000 Polish drivers exchanged their licence for a UK version in the. five years between 2004 and 2008. The data goes on to show that on. average each year since 1997, 2,334 drivers exchanged Japanese licences for UK one. Figures also show. 2,895 drivers exchanged Hong Kong licences and 836 drivers exchanged. South Korean licences for full British permits. Research carried out by the BBC earlier this year highlighted a scam where drivers obtained a UK driving. licence by exploiting the arrangement that the UK has with Hong Kong –. which saw more than 6,000 exchanged every year for the past five years,. even though the average is much lower. Agreements also exist with some African. countries. Around 950 Zimbabwean licences were exchanged in 2011, down from. 1,282 in 2010 and a peak of 6,168 in 2002. Nearly half of the licences exchanged since 1997 are from countries where the test does not require driving on the left hand lane. The UK's agreement with Kenya. was suspended in 2002 then later reinstated, resulting in 242 Kenyan. licences being exchanged in the early part of 2012. Robin Reames added: 'While the fact. that the UK recognises licences issued in certain countries shows that. driving tests in those countries are likely to be of a high standard,. it's important to recognise that driving in the UK is unique in many. ways. 'As such, it's important for everyone planning to drive in the UK. to take the time to become familiar with UK road signs and speed limits,. as well as driver etiquette – exactly as British motorists should when. driving abroad.' Nick Perry, driving instructor at. Bristol-based Oasis Driving School, commented: 'People who learned to. drive abroad will often face difficulties driving in the UK. 'The obvious. differences include driving on a different side of the road and new. signs and speed limits, but there are also more subtle differences such. as etiquette on the road that seem obvious to us, but are extremely. important. 'I've taught a range of drivers who have originally learned. to drive outside the UK, some of whom have settled in with no problems. and others who've needed a little help. 'It's a good idea for anyone new. to UK roads to take a short lesson or two with an approved driving. instructor in order to be on the safe side.' What are the important parts of this article?","completion":"This article is saying that in the last 15 years, over one million people from other countries have traded their old driving licenses for British ones. The number of people doing this has gone up and down, but was the highest in 2007. People from 50 different countries can change their licenses after living in the UK for 12 months without needing to take a special UK driving test. A lot of the people trading their licenses are from countries where they don't learn to drive on the left side of the road like in the UK. Some experts think it's important for these new drivers to learn about UK road signs, speed limits, and how to be polite on the road. They suggest that new drivers might want to take a few driving lessons with a teacher in the UK, even if they already know how to drive in their own country."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: In recent weeks, the investigation into possible collusion between President Donald Trump’s presidential campaign and Russia has intensified, raising the prospect that the probe could become an issue in advance of the November midterm congressional elections. Former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort made another appearance in federal court in Washington Wednesday, where he pleaded not guilty to the latest round of charges brought by special counsel Robert Mueller. Last week, Rick Gates, Manafort’s former deputy, pleaded guilty to lying to prosecutors and is now cooperating with the investigation. In mid-February, 13 Russians were indicted in connection with election meddling, which deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein described as an effort to “promote discord in the United States and undermine public confidence in democracy. We must not allow them to succeed.” Congressional inquiries also continue. Hope Hicks, the White House communications director and a longtime Trump aide, was the latest figure to testify before a congressional committee on the Russia probe. Hicks declined to answer some questions before a closed session of the House Intelligence Committee, frustrating several Democrats. “This is not executive privilege. This is executive stonewalling,” said ranking committee Democrat Rep. Adam Schiff. But there was more pushback from the White House this week. President Trump fired off a series of tweets dismissing the probe as a “WITCH HUNT.” “They have had this phony cloud over this administration, over our government,” Trump told reporters at the White House last month. “And it has hurt our government, it does hurt our government. It is a Democrat hoax.” Democrats reject that view, including Sen. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee. “I continue to believe that this is the most important thing that I will work on in my whole public career, and getting the whole truth out is extraordinarily important,” he said.

Warner has been assertive in his efforts to get to the bottom of the issue, saying, \\"I continue to believe that this is the most important thing that I will work on in my whole public career, and getting the whole truth out is extraordinarily important.\\" Such a determined approach in conducting the investigation may have contributed to Trump's consternation regarding Warner, as the president has repeatedly dismissed the probe as a \\"WITCH HUNT\\" and a \\"Democrat hoax.\\" Furthermore, Trump has publicly expressed his dissatisfaction with the ongoing investigation as he believes it casts a \\"phony cloud\\" over his administration, hindering its performance and damaging its image. The strenuous relationship between Sen. Mark Warner and President Trump can be inferred from these circumstances, indicating that Trump is certainly frustrated with Warner's endeavors and considers them as attempts to besmirch his presidency. In conclusion, President Trump is unlikely to be indifferent or happy with Sen. Mark Warner's involvement in the investigation. Instead, Trump's sentiments lean more towards frustration, as Warner's persistence in uncovering the truth risks exposing potentially damaging information that could impact Trump's administration and legacy."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Namibia (i/nəˈmɪbiə/, /næˈ-/), officially the Republic of Namibia (German: Republik Namibia (help·info); Afrikaans: Republiek van Namibië) is a country in southern Africa whose western border is the Atlantic Ocean. It shares land borders with Zambia and Angola to the north, Botswana to the east and South Africa to the south and east. Although it does not border Zimbabwe, a part of less than 200 metres of the Zambezi River (essentially a small bulge in Botswana to achieve a Botswana/Zambia micro-border) separates it from that country. Namibia gained independence from South Africa on 21 March 1990, following the Namibian War of Independence. Its capital and largest city is Windhoek, and it is a member state of the United Nations (UN), the Southern African Development Community (SADC), the African Union (AU), and the Commonwealth of Nations. Try to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply \\"unanswerable\\"): How far away is Namibia to the Zambezi River?","completion":"Namibia is located in the southwestern part of Africa, and the Zambezi River, one of Africa's major river systems, forms part of the border between Namibia and its northeastern neighbor, Zambia. While Namibia does not share a direct border with Zimbabwe, a small section of the Zambezi River, less than 200 meters in length, separates the two countries. The distance between Namibia and the Zambezi River varies depending on which part of the country you are measuring from. In the northeastern corner of Namibia, the Caprivi Strip, the Zambezi River is only about 200 meters away from the border, as mentioned earlier. The Caprivi Strip is a narrow panhandle of Namibian territory extending eastwards from the main body of the country and provides Namibia with access to the Zambezi River. If measuring from central Namibia, such as the capital city of Windhoek, the distance to the Zambezi River would be greater. The approximate distance from Windhoek to the Zambezi River, in a straight line, is around 900 kilometers (559 miles). However, please note that this measure provides only an estimate of the distance, as the actual distance may vary due to geographical factors and the specific location of the river along the border between Namibia and Zambia."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

If I tell you that Friction causes a car to lose energy, and ask you the question \\"what causes a car to lose energy?\\", is the correct answer \\"temperature\\"? Answer:","completion":"No, the correct answer to the question \\"what causes a car to lose energy?\\" is not \\"temperature.\\" While temperature can play a role in affecting a car's performance, it is not the main factor that causes a car to lose energy. Instead, the primary cause of energy loss in a car, as you mentioned, is friction. Friction is a force that opposes the motion of two surfaces that are in contact with each other. In the context of a car, there are different sources of friction that contribute to energy loss: 1. Rolling resistance: This is the friction between the tires of the car and the road surface. Rolling resistance is affected by the materials and design of both the tires and the road surface, as well as the weight of the car. As the tires roll on the road, they deform and generate heat, causing energy to be lost in the form of heat. 2. Air resistance (drag): As a car moves, it has to push through the surrounding air, causing resistance. The faster the car moves, the greater the air resistance it has to overcome. The shape of a car and its frontal area determine how much air resistance it will experience. 3. Mechanical friction: All the moving parts of a car – like the engine, transmission, and wheels – have to overcome friction as they move and interact with each other. The energy lost as a result of this friction is typically dissipated in the form of heat. 4. Internal engine losses: Various factors within a combustion engine, such as pumping losses, heat generation, and drivetrain losses can cause a car to lose energy. 5. Braking: When brakes are applied, the kinetic energy of the moving car is converted into heat, leading to energy loss. While temperature doesn't directly cause a car to lose energy, it can affect the efficiency of various components and processes within the car, thereby influencing energy loss indirectly. For example, extreme cold may thicken engine oil, leading to increased friction and energy loss in the engine. Similarly, high temperatures can make some components, like tires and engine parts, behave differently, potentially increasing energy loss. In summary, friction is the primary cause of energy loss in a car, with rolling resistance, air resistance, mechanical friction, internal engine losses, and braking being contributors. Temperature is not the direct cause of energy loss; however, it can indirectly influence how various components and processes within the car contribute to energy loss."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The answer to this question is:","completion":"The review mentioned would likely decrease the chances of buying the product for several reasons. Firstly, the reviewer states that the slippers were too tight and pointed, which indicates that the product may be uncomfortable and not suitable for people with different foot shapes or sizes. This lack of adaptability in the product's design could lead to dissatisfaction and discomfort for potential buyers, especially those who have unique or particular preferences in terms of fit and comfort. Secondly, the reviewer describes the slippers as being slippery on wood floors, which raises concerns about safety. Anyone considering this product would likely prioritize the ability to walk securely on various surfaces, and slippery slippers could easily result in accidents and falls, especially for the elderly or those with mobility issues. This factor alone could be a significant deterrent for potential buyers, as it compromises on the fundamental aspect of safety that footwear should provide. Lastly, the reviewer specifically points out that these slippers are not appropriate for elderly individuals. This statement highlights that this product lacks an essential element of accessibility and usability for a certain demographic. Elderly people may have more specific needs when it comes to slippers, such as non-slip soles, a more comfortable fit, and ease of put on and take off. As the product seems to fail in meeting these needs, any potential buyer who has elderly family members or is considering their own aging process might be discouraged from purchasing this product. In summary, the negative review addressing various issues with the product, such as discomfort, lack of safety, and inappropriateness for elderly individuals, would likely decrease the chances of buying the product.

While in the cabin, Ash plays a tape of an archaeology Professor Knowby, the cabin's previous inhabitant, reciting passages from the Necronomicon Ex-Mortis (or Book of the Dead), which he has discovered during an archaeological dig. The recorded incantation unleashes an evil force that kills and later possesses Linda. Ash is then forced to decapitate his girlfriend with a shovel in self-defense, and buries her near the cabin. The film then picks up where the first film left off, where a spirit is seen hunting for Ash. Ash becomes briefly possessed by the demon, but when day breaks the spirit is gone, and Ash returns to normal. Ash finds little chance of safety, however, as the bridge leading to the cabin is destroyed. Linda's revived head attacks Ash by biting his hand. Ash brings Linda's severed head to the shed, where her headless body attacks him with a chainsaw. Ash gains the upper hand and slashes the relentless zombified Linda to death, killing her a second and final time. Later, Ash is forced to sever his bitten right hand, which has become possessed. While Ash deals with this force, the professor's daughter, Annie, and her research partner, Ed Getley, return from the dig with more pages of the Necronomicon in tow, only to find the destroyed bridge.

Question: \\"What was founded in the 28th year of the 17th century?\\" Context: \\"Consistent with Calvin's political ideas, Protestants created both the English and the American democracies. In seventeenth-century England, the most important persons and events in this process were the English Civil War, Oliver Cromwell, John Milton, John Locke, the Glorious Revolution, the English Bill of Rights, and the Act of Settlement. Later, the British took their democratic ideals to their colonies, e.g. Australia, New Zealand, and India. In North America, Plymouth Colony (Pilgrim Fathers; 1620) and Massachusetts Bay Colony (1628) practised democratic self-rule and separation of powers. These Congregationalists were convinced that the democratic form of government was the will of God. The Mayflower Compact was a social contract.\\" Answer:","completion":"In the 28th year of the 17th century, which corresponds to the year 1628, the Massachusetts Bay Colony was founded in North America. This event is quite significant in the historical context you provided on the development of democracy, particularly in relation to the Protestant religious beliefs associated with it. The Massachusetts Bay Colony was an English settlement established on the east coast of North America, in present-day Massachusetts. The colony was founded by a group of English Puritans, who were looking for a place where they could practice their religion freely, without the restrictions imposed by the Church of England. The Puritans were adherents of Calvinism, and they strongly believed in democratic self-rule and the separation of powers, as they thought that this form of government aligned with the will of God. The foundation of the Massachusetts Bay Colony played a significant role in the development of democratic ideals in the British colonies. Along with the Plymouth Colony, founded earlier in 1620 by the Pilgrim Fathers, these Congregationalist settlements practiced democratic governance based on a social contract among the settlers. This democratic approach, guided by religious principles, laid the groundwork for the future establishment of American democracy and the United States' political system. In summary, the Massachusetts Bay Colony, founded in 1628, marked an important step in the evolution of democracy in North America, driven by the Calvinist-inspired belief in self-rule and powered by English Puritans seeking religious freedom. This colony, together with the Plymouth Colony and other historical events and figures, laid the foundation for modern democratic systems, not only in the United States but also in other former British colonies."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It seems that department was holding one of our elderly residents who suffered from Alzheimer’s disease. Earlier in the day this gentlemen got the keys to his wife’s car and went for a ride. He quickly became confused and lost, so he just kept driving. The last 60 miles of his journey consisted of a low speed police chase. This poor man was scared to death and only pulled over when his vehicle ran out of gas. A request was made for us to send an officer to transport this gentleman the 200 miles back to his home. Because we were at minimum shift strength, the Sergeant determined that a family member would have to go and get him. I returned to work the following night and at nightly briefing, I asked if anyone had an update on the man’s transport. The sergeant said he hadn’t heard anything, which is when a junior patrolman spoke up. He said that man is from my neighborhood and after I got home from work this morning, I drove the 400 mile round trip and picked up my neighbor and returned him home to his wife. I just got back into town about an hour ago, so I changed into my uniform, and I’m here for my shift! I learned later that this patrolman had taken it upon himself to contact the man’s wife and the only vehicle they owned was out of gas 200 miles away. So this officer stayed up all day after a working the midnight shift and used his own car for the 400 mile trip. The officer said when he picked the man up at the station; he looked at the officer and smiled. He recognized his neighbor. This frail elderly man surely did not remember this selfless act of kindness. But it made a lasting impression on me, and on what it means to be a good cop.

When I first heard news of a remake of Robert Wise's 1963 film, \\"The Haunting\\", I had a fear that it would be ruined by an abundance of summer-movie sized visual effects. But, deep down, I had faith. Surely, with such a talented cast intact...De Bont and company will not ruin a film, who's original was a fantastic and frightening movie that understood the delicate art of subtlety. Well, subtlety, where are you now!!?? My fears have manifested...a promising movie has gone wrong. Yes, Eugenio Zannetti's production design is jaw-dropping; the movie is wonderfully photographed; and composer Jerry Goldsmith can never EVER do wrong. But, the script puts it's fine actors to the test..asking them to deliver the kind of stilted dialogue that is only spoken in movies. In the end, the always wonderful Lili Taylor is the only performer to escape with some dignity...and that's just barely. But, the crime of all crimes is that the horror is shown to us. We can no longer use our imaginations, feel that horrible dread of fear of the unknown. No, we get some visual effects to SHOW US what we're supposed to be afraid of...and you know what? As wonderfully realized as they are...the visual effects come off as sort of silly. And the climax is a phantasmogoric mess...but things had gone terribly wrong long before that.

Trump added that he believes Kim, half the age of the American president, “wants to do something great for his people.” But Trump cautioned that Kim “won’t have that opportunity again” if the talks do not go well -- describing this opportunity for diplomacy with the United States as a “one-time shot.” Trump and others in his government have said advancement has been made on obtaining a commitment from Kim to give up all his nuclear weapons and long-range ballistic missiles.

The guard, named Thomas, preferred his trusty blade over a gun for a few reasons. First, he had trained extensively in close-quarters combat, which sharpened his skills and instincts. Second, the silent nature of a blade allowed him to work covertly, without alerting nearby enemies. As the moonlight seeped through the cracks in the old walls of the abandoned warehouse, Thomas scanned the area with his keen eyes, searching for any signs of movement. He'd heard rumors of a new criminal organization taking root in this part of the city, and he was determined to quell this threat before it could grow any further. Step by step, he patrolled the perimeter of the warehouse, listening closely for any sounds out of place. The building groaned and creaked, betraying its age and years of neglect. The sound of footsteps would be muffled by the thick layer of dust that covered the floor, but Thomas' ears were exceptionally keen. He was confident he'd be able to hear even the slightest footfall if someone were to approach. As the night wore on, Thomas began to wonder whether the rumors were just that - rumors. He considered the possibility that these whispers were merely the panicked talk of frightened locals, desperate to blame their struggles on an external force. But as his thoughts meandered, a sudden noise jolted him back to reality. The sound of shattering glass echoed through the warehouse as a dark figure hurtled through one of the high windows. Despite the surprise, Thomas reacted with practiced calm, drawing his blade and taking a defensive posture. He cautiously made his way towards the source of the noise, his heart pounding in anticipation. As he neared the broken window, he spotted the figure, clad in black attire and a ski mask, trying to pick themselves up from the pile of shattered glass. With the ease of a seasoned warrior, Thomas closed the distance swiftly, positioning himself between the intruder and any possible escape routes. He raised his blade, never flinching, and spoke in a stern voice. \\"Who are you, and what business have you in this place?\\" The intruder hesitated, seemingly weighing their options. Thomas knew that it was in moments like this when one had to make a choice - to fight or flee. It became evident that this intruder was determined to face him head-on, as they reached into their coat and produced a weapon of their own. With a metallic click, Thomas recognized the unmistakable sound of a knife being drawn. It seemed this opponent was more evenly matched than he had anticipated.

Article:The report estimates that hepatitis infections and their complications led to 1.45m deaths in 2013 - despite the existence of vaccines and treatments. World Health Organization data shows there were 1.2m Aids-related deaths in 2014, while TB led to 1.5m deaths. The WHO has put forward a global strategy to tackle hepatitis. Researchers say these plans must be put into action urgently to tackle the crisis. Viral hepatitis refers to five different forms of virus (known as A, B, C, D, E) - some can be spread through contact with infected bodily fluids and others (A and E) through contaminated food or water. Most deaths worldwide are due to B and C, which can cause serious liver damage and predispose people to liver cancer. But because people don't always feel the symptoms of the initial infection, they can be unaware of the long-term damage until it is too late. Scientists from Imperial College London and the University of Washington examined data from 183 countries, collected between 1990 and 2013. They found the the number of deaths linked to viral hepatitis rose by more than 60% over two decades - partly due to a growing population. Deaths from diseases such as TB and malaria have dropped. Dr Graham Cooke of Imperial College London described the findings as startling. He said: \\"Although there are effective treatments and vaccines for viral hepatitis, there is very little money invested in getting these to patients - especially compared to malaria, HIV/AIDS and TB. \\"We have tools at our disposal to treat this disease - we have vaccines to treat hepatitis A and B and we have new treatments for C. \\"However the price of new medicines is beyond the reach of any country - rich or poor.\\" The study suggests the problem is biggest in East Asia. But unlike many other diseases, deaths from viral hepatitis were higher in high and middle income countries than in lower income nations. The WHO hepatitis strategy, which was put forward in May 2016, includes targets to reduce new cases of hepatitis B and C by 30% by 2020, alongside a 10% reduction in mortality. The WHO says countries and organisations will need to expand vaccination programmes, focus on preventing mother-to-child transmission of hepatitis B and increase access to treatment for hepatitis B and C, to help ensure these targets are met.

Question: Which of the following traits was not valued in classical Greek art: calm, perfected, or erotic? Context: Hellenistic art saw a turn from the idealistic, perfected, calm and composed figures of classical Greek art to a style dominated by realism and the depiction of emotion (pathos) and character (ethos). The motif of deceptively realistic naturalism in art (aletheia) is reflected in stories such as that of the painter Zeuxis, who was said to have painted grapes that seemed so real that birds came and pecked at them. The female nude also became more popular as epitomized by the Aphrodite of Cnidos of Praxiteles and art in general became more erotic (e.g. Leda and the Swan and Scopa's Pothos).

Article: The Armenian Genocide caused widespread emigration that led to the settlement of Armenians in various countries in the world. Armenians kept to their traditions and certain diasporans rose to fame with their music. In the post-Genocide Armenian community of the United States, the so-called \\"kef\\" style Armenian dance music, using Armenian and Middle Eastern folk instruments (often electrified/amplified) and some western instruments, was popular. This style preserved the folk songs and dances of Western Armenia, and many artists also played the contemporary popular songs of Turkey and other Middle Eastern countries from which the Armenians emigrated. Richard Hagopian is perhaps the most famous artist of the traditional \\"kef\\" style and the Vosbikian Band was notable in the 40s and 50s for developing their own style of \\"kef music\\" heavily influenced by the popular American Big Band Jazz of the time. Later, stemming from the Middle Eastern Armenian diaspora and influenced by Continental European (especially French) pop music, the Armenian pop music genre grew to fame in the 60s and 70s with artists such as Adiss Harmandian and Harout Pamboukjian performing to the Armenian diaspora and Armenia. Also with artists such as Sirusho, performing pop music combined with Armenian folk music in today's entertainment industry. Other Armenian diasporans that rose to fame in classical or international music circles are world-renowned French-Armenian singer and composer Charles Aznavour, pianist Sahan Arzruni, prominent opera sopranos such as Hasmik Papian and more recently Isabel Bayrakdarian and Anna Kasyan. Certain Armenians settled to sing non-Armenian tunes such as the heavy metal band System of a Down (which nonetheless often incorporates traditional Armenian instrumentals and styling into their songs) or pop star Cher. Ruben Hakobyan (Ruben Sasuntsi) is a well recognized Armenian ethnographic and patriotic folk singer who has achieved widespread national recognition due to his devotion to Armenian folk music and exceptional talent.

Notwithstanding that it was part of an administrative union, the Territory of New Guinea at all times retained a distinct legal status and identity until the advent of the Independent State of Papua New Guinea. - Rabaul is a township in East New Britain province, on the island of New Britain, in the country of Papua New Guinea. New Britain is an island about 60 kilometres to the east of the island of New Guinea. Rabaul was the provincial capital and most important settlement in the province until it was destroyed in 1994 by falling ash of a volcanic eruption. - New Britain, is the largest island in the Bismarck Archipelago (named after Otto von Bismarck) of Papua New Guinea. It is separated from the island of New Guinea by the Dampier and Vitiaz Straits and from New Ireland by St. George's Channel. The main towns of New Britain are Rabaul/Kokopo and Kimbe. The island is roughly the size of Taiwan. While the island was part of German New Guinea, it was named Neupommern (\\"New Pomerania\\"). - Kimbe is the capital of the province of West New Britain in Papua New Guinea. It is a port town on the great Kimbe Bay which boasts more than 60 percent of the coral species of the entire Indo-Pacific. The bustling town of Kimbe is the third largest port in Papua New Guinea and is the fastest growing city in the South Pacific. Accommodation in Kimbe is readily available in many high-class resorts and hotels, as well as many budget guesthouses and motels dribbled along the province. The town of Kimbe is served by Hoskins Airport. - Vitiaz Strait is a strait between New Britain and the Huon Peninsula, northern New Guinea. - During World War II, the American atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki made Nagasaki the second and, to date, last city in the world to experience a nuclear attack. - German New Guinea was the first part of the German colonial empire. It was a protectorate from 1884 until 1914 when it fell to Australian forces following the outbreak of the First World War. It consisted of the northeastern part of New Guinea and several nearby island groups. The mainland part of German New Guinea and the nearby islands of the Bismarck Archipelago and the North Solomon Islands are now part of Papua New Guinea. The Micronesian islands of German New Guinea are now governed as the Federated States of Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, Nauru, the Northern Mariana Islands and Palau. - Operation Cartwheel (19431944) was a major military strategy for the Allies in the Pacific theater of World War II. Cartwheel was a twin-axis of advance operation, aimed at militarily neutralizing the major Japanese base at Rabaul. The operation was directed by the Supreme Allied Commander in the South West Pacific Area (SWPA)General Douglas MacArthurwhose forces advanced along the northeast coast of New Guinea and occupied nearby islands. Allied forces from the Pacific Ocean Areas commandunder Admiral Chester W. Nimitzadvanced through the Solomon Islands toward Bougainville. The Allied forces involved were from Australia, the Netherlands, New Zealand, the US and various Pacific Islands. - The United States dropped nuclear weapons on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on August 6 and 9, 1945, respectively, during the final stage of World War II. The United States had dropped the bombs with the consent of the United Kingdom as outlined in the Quebec Agreement. The two bombings, which killed at least 129,000 people, remain the only use of nuclear weapons for warfare in history. - Cape Gloucester (also known as Tuluvu) is a headland on the northern side of the far west of the island of New Britain, Papua New Guinea. During World War II, the Japanese captured New Britain, and had driven most of Cape Gloucester's native population out to construct two airfields. During the New Britain Campaign, American forces had decided to capture Cape Gloucester for its two airfields, to assist planned attacks on the garrison on Rabaul, an important area in New Britain. It became the site of the Battle of Cape Gloucester, part of Operation Cartwheel, in 1943. After long fighting through rain, and Japanese, the United States 1st Marine Division had it declared secured. After the war, the headland was given back to the natives. - Papua New Guinea (PNG Hiri Motu: \\"Papua Niu Gini\\"), officially the Independent State of Papua New Guinea, is an Oceanian country that occupies the eastern half of the island of New Guinea and its offshore islands in Melanesia, a region of the southwestern Pacific Ocean north of Australia. Its capital, located along its southeastern coast, is Port Moresby. The western half of New Guinea forms the Indonesian provinces of Papua and West Papua. - Hiroshima is perhaps best known as the first city in history to be targeted by a nuclear weapon when the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) dropped an atomic bomb on the city (and later on Nagasaki) at 8:15 a.m. on August 6, 1945, near the end of World War II. - An island or isle is any piece of sub-continental land that is surrounded by water. Very small islands such as emergent land features on atolls can be called islets, skerries, cays or keys. An island in a river or a lake island may be called an eyot or ait, and a small island off the coast may be called a holm. A grouping of geographically or geologically related islands is called an archipelago, e.g. the Philippines. - World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier. It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history. - The Holocaust (from the Greek ': \\"hólos\\", \\"whole\\" and \\"kaustós\\", \\"burnt\\"), also referred to as the Shoah\\"' (Hebrew: , \\"HaShoah\\", \\"the catastrophe\\"), was a genocide in which Adolf Hitler's Nazi Germany and its collaborators killed about six million Jews. The victims included 1.5 million children and represented about two-thirds of the nine million Jews who had resided in Europe. Some definitions of the Holocaust include the additional five million non-Jewish victims of Nazi mass murders, bringing the total to about 11 million. Killings took place throughout Nazi Germany, German-occupied territories, and territories held by allies of Nazi Germany. - Otto Eduard Leopold, Prince of Bismarck, Duke of Lauenburg (1 April 1815 30 July 1898), known as Otto von Bismarck, was a conservative Prussian statesman who dominated German and European affairs from the 1860s until 1890. In the 1860s, he engineered a series of wars that unified the German states, significantly and deliberately excluding Austria, into a powerful German Empire under Prussian leadership. With that accomplished by 1871, he skillfully used balance of power diplomacy to maintain Germany's position in a Europe which, despite many disputes and war scares, remained at peace. For historian Eric Hobsbawm, it was Bismarck who \\"remained undisputed world champion at the game of multilateral diplomatic chess for almost twenty years after 1871, [and] devoted himself exclusively, and successfully, to maintaining peace between the powers.\\" - The Bismarck Archipelago is a group of islands off the northeastern coast of New Guinea in the western Pacific Ocean and is part of the Islands Region of Papua New Guinea. Its area is about 50,000 square km. - Kokopo is the capital of East New Britain in Papua New Guinea. The capital was moved from Rabaul in 1994 when the volcanoes Tavurvur and Vulcan erupted. As a result, the population of the town increased more than sixfold from 3,150 in 1990 to 20,262 in 2000. - Taiwan, officially the Republic of China (ROC), is a state in East Asia. Neighbors include China (officially the People's Republic of China, abbreviated as PRC) to the west, Japan to the northeast, and the Philippines to the south. Taiwan is the most populous state that is not a member of the United Nations, and the one with the largest economy. - New Guinea (or, historically, \\"\\") is a large Island in the South West Pacific region. - The Territory of Papua comprised the southeastern quarter of the island of New Guinea from 1883 to 1975. In 1883, the Government of Queensland annexed this territory for the British Empire. The United Kingdom Government refused to ratify the annexation but in 1884 a Protectorate was proclaimed over the territory, then called \\"British New Guinea\\". There is a certain ambiguity about the exact date on which the entire territory was annexed by the British. The Papua Act 1905 recites that this happened \\"on or about\\" 4 September 1888. On 18 March 1902, the Territory was placed under the authority of the Commonwealth of Australia. Resolutions of acceptance were passed by the Commonwealth Parliament, who accepted the territory under the name of Papua.

Jack William Nicklaus (born January 21, 1940), nicknamed The Golden Bear, is an American retired professional golfer. He is widely regarded as the greatest golfer of all time, winning a record 18 career major championships, while producing 19 second-place and 9 third-place finishes, over a span of 25 years. Nicklaus focused on the major championships--Masters Tournament, U.S. Open, Open Championship and PGA Championship--and played a selective schedule of regular PGA Tour events, yet still finished with 73 victories, third on the all-time list behind Sam Snead (82) and Tiger Woods (79). In 1980, Nicklaus recorded only four top-10 finishes in 14 events, but two of these were record-setting victories in majors (the U.S. Open and the PGA Championship); the other two were a tie for fourth in The Open Championship and a runner-up finish in the Doral-Eastern Open to Raymond Floyd via his chip-in birdie on the second hole of a sudden-death playoff. These victories and placements more than justified the work Nicklaus put in toward his game during the off-season. Nicklaus set a new scoring record for the 1980 U.S. Open with an aggregate of 272, eclipsing his earlier record of 275 from 1967 over the same golf course. That record, while since having been tied by three other players, stood until Rory McIlroy's 268 in winning the 2011 US Open. This was Nicklaus's second major win at Baltusrol Golf Club. Nicklaus opened with a record-tying 63 in round one and fought off his playing partner of all four rounds, 1978 Colgate World Match Play Championship winner, Isao Aoki. Entering the final round, Aoki had caught Nicklaus after three consecutive rounds of 68, but over the course of the last day, Nicklaus pulled away by two shots. Each player birdied the final two holes for a dramatic finish. Aoki's aggregate of 274 was the lowest score for a U.S. Open runner-up. Nicklaus' win was his fourth and final victory in the championship, tying him with Willie Anderson, Bobby Jones, and Ben Hogan. Nicklaus referred to this win as \\"by far the most emotional and warmest reaction to any of my wins in my own country\\". In the 1980 PGA Championship, Nicklaus set another record in winning the championship by seven shots over Andy Bean at the Oak Hill Country Club, largely due to exceptional putting. Nicklaus shot an even-par 70 in the first round followed by three successive rounds in the 60s over the difficult course, and was the only player to break par for the 72 holes. For the week, the field averaged 74.60 strokes while Nicklaus averaged 68.50. This was Nicklaus' fifth and final victory in the PGA Championship, which elevated him to record-holder for the most wins in the stroke-play era, and which tied him with Walter Hagen for the most wins overall, since Hagen's victories were all during the match-play era. Nicklaus' seven-shot winning margin remained the largest for the stroke-play version of the championship until Rory's McIroy's 2012 victory. This victory also made Nicklaus the only player since Gene Sarazen in 1922 and Ben Hogan in 1948 to win the U.S. Open and PGA Championship the same year (subsequently equaled by Tiger Woods in 2000).

First question: How do you find the owner of a vehicle? Second question: How can I find the owner of a vehicle? Are these two questions asking the same thing?","completion":"Yes, both questions are essentially asking the same thing but they may be interpreted as representing two slightly different contexts. They are both seeking guidance on how to determine the ownership of a vehicle. The difference exists in point of view of the asker: 1. \\"How do you find the owner of a vehicle?\\" - This question can be seen as asking a general question to the public or an expert on how one would go about determining vehicle ownership. 2. \\"How can I find the owner of a vehicle?\\" - This is a more direct question, indicating that the person asking the question specifically wants to know how they, personally, could find out who owns a particular vehicle. Next, let's address how to find the owner of a vehicle. Finding the owner of a vehicle can be a complex process as privacy laws and regulations protect such information to safeguard the privacy of individuals. However, there are several official ways you can attempt to find this information: 1. **License Plate Lookup** – If you have the license plate number of the vehicle, you can use it to search for ownership information. However, many online license plate lookup services do not provide owner information due to privacy laws unless you're a law enforcement officer or have a valid legal reason. 2. **VIN (Vehicle Identification Number) Check** – A vehicle's unique VIN can be used to find specific information about the vehicle, but not the owner. While this method won’t directly disclose the owner, it can give you insight into the vehicle's history. 3. **Contact Law Enforcement** – Law enforcement might assist with the owner's information under circumstances related to law enforcement purposes. 4. **Request Information from DMV** – The Department of Motor Vehicles in your local area may have records of vehicle ownership. However, you usually need a valid reason related to lawsuits or potential vehicle purchase or transfers. 5. **Private Investigator** – If the situation is serious enough (like a hit-and-run or theft case), it may be worth hiring a licensed private investigator. They have more power to access private information due to their license. 6. **Neighborhood Canvas** – If the need arises from a local issue, such as a vehicle blocking your driveway, you can knock on neighbors' doors to find out who owns the car. Remember, while finding details about a vehicle's owner, it’s essential to respect people's privacy and abide by all relevant laws and regulations. If it's for a purpose that directly impacts your wellbeing, it's recommended that you contact law enforcement or legal professionals to take up the matter."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: You are given a new situation: Jimbo and Jedd are both farmers who have lakes and water wells downstream from their farms. Jimbo's products have been in high demand recently, so he has started to use very high amounts of fertilizers on his farms. Jedd has recently decreased the amount of fertilizer he uses because his products aren't wanted as much by the people in his town. and a hint : Huge amounts of chemicals, such as fertilizers and pesticides, are applied to farm fields (see Figure below ). Some of the chemicals are picked up by rainwater. Runoff then carries the chemicals to nearby rivers or lakes. Dissolved fertilizer causes too much growth of water plants and algae. This can lead to dead zones where nothing can live in lakes and at the mouths of rivers. Some of the chemicals can infiltrate into groundwater. The contaminated water comes up in water wells. If people drink the polluted water, they may get sick. Please answer this question : Who will be more likely to cause excess growth of algae in their respective lakes? Answer:","completion":"Jimbo will be more likely to cause excess growth of algae in his respective lake due to his increased use of fertilizers on his farm. In the given situation, Jimbo has been experiencing high demand for his products, causing him to use very high amounts of fertilizers on his farm. On the other hand, Jedd has recently decreased the amount of fertilizer he uses because his products are not as popular among the people in his town. The hint provided explains that large quantities of chemicals, such as fertilizers and pesticides, are applied to farm fields. When it rains, some of these chemicals are picked up by the rainwater and carried away as runoff to nearby rivers or lakes. In these bodies of water, the dissolved fertilizer can cause an overgrowth of water plants and algae, which in turn can lead to the formation of dead zones where nothing can live. Based on this information, it can be inferred that Jimbo, who is using high amounts of fertilizers, has a greater likelihood of causing excess growth of algae in his lake. The runoff from his farm could carry substantial amounts of dissolved fertilizer to the lake, promoting the proliferation of algae and potentially resulting in the creation of a dead zone. This could have severe consequences not only for the ecosystem of the lake but also for the local community, who may rely on the lake as a water source or food supply. In contrast, Jedd's decision to reduce the use of fertilizers on his farm due to decreased demand lessens the risk of his actions contributing to an overgrowth of algae in his respective lake. By reducing the application of chemicals, there is a lower probability that runoff from Jedd's farm will contain significant amounts of dissolved fertilizer, which would potentially encourage excessive growth of water plants and algae. As a result, Jedd's lake is less likely to experience the detrimental ecological effects associated with fertilizer-induced algal blooms. In conclusion, Jimbo is more likely to cause excess growth of algae in his respective lake due to his increased use of fertilizers on his farm. It would be beneficial for Jimbo to consider adopting more sustainable farming practices, such as reducing the quantity of fertilizers used or implementing integrated pest management strategies, in order to minimize the impact of his actions on the local environment and water resources."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the above question based on the context below: In 1970, Lennon and Ono went through primal therapy with Arthur Janov in Los Angeles, California. Designed to release emotional pain from early childhood, the therapy entailed two half-days a week with Janov for four months; he had wanted to treat the couple for longer, but they felt no need to continue and returned to London. Lennon's debut solo album, John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band (1970), was received with praise by many music critics, but its highly personal lyrics and stark sound limited its commercial performance. Critic Greil Marcus remarked, \\"John's singing in the last verse of 'God' may be the finest in all of rock.\\" The album featured the song \\"Mother\\", in which Lennon confronted his feelings of childhood rejection, and the Dylanesque \\"Working Class Hero\\", a bitter attack against the bourgeois social system which, due to the lyric \\"you're still fucking peasants\\", fell foul of broadcasters. In January 1971, Tariq Ali expressed his revolutionary political views when he interviewed Lennon, who immediately responded by writing \\"Power to the People\\". In his lyrics to the song, Lennon reversed the non-confrontational approach he had espoused in \\"Revolution\\", although he later disowned the message, saying that it was borne out of guilt and a desire for approval from radicals such as Ali. Lennon became involved with Ali in a protest against the prosecution of Oz magazine for alleged obscenity. Lennon denounced the proceedings as \\"disgusting fascism\\", and he and Ono (as Elastic Oz Band) released the single \\"God Save Us/Do the Oz\\" and joined marches in support of the magazine. Eager for a major commercial success, Lennon adopted a more accessible sound for his next album, Imagine (1971). Rolling Stone reported that \\"it contains a substantial portion of good music\\" but warned of the possibility that \\"his posturings will soon seem not merely dull but irrelevant\\". The album's title track later became an anthem for anti-war movements, while the song \\"How Do You Sleep?\\" was a musical attack on McCartney in response...

The reviewer states that they read the material years ago, which indicates that the information was memorable and useful even after a considerable amount of time. Additionally, they attribute their success in a psychological evaluation and custody battle, to a large extent, to the knowledge they gained from this product. This suggests that the product had a significant positive impact on their life, and they appreciated the benefits they derived from it. On the negative side, the reviewer comments on the circumstances in which they needed to use the product, which includes a court-ordered psychological evaluation and a conflict with their \\"insane ex-spouse.\\" This injects a sense of negativity or frustration into the review since the circumstances surrounding the usefulness of the product were challenging and undesirable. The mention of an ex-spouse being \\"great\\" uses sarcasm, which also adds to the negative tone. Moreover, the review itself contains language that is informal and somewhat unpolished, such as the use of \\"sort of\\" and the uncertainty about the spelling of \\"Rorschardt\\" (the correct spelling is Rorschach). The use of asterisks for emphasis and casual expressions like \\"BTW\\" (by the way) further contribute to a less formal tone. While this informal language does not necessarily indicate a negative tone, it can give a more casual or conversational feel to the review, which may not leave as strong of a positive impression as a more polished and professional review might.
