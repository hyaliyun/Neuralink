Think like you are answering to a five year old. The Glory of Melaka: In the early days, if you were not a pirate or a mosquito, Melaka was not much of a place to live. The land was infertile, just a swampy plain, the river small and sluggish. But it had a sheltered harbor, protected from the monsoons by neighboring Sumatra. Later, the strategic location and deep-water channel close to the coast brought in the bigger vessels of the trade-wind traffic crossing the Indian Ocean. The first to realize the larger commercial potential, as so often throughout the country's subsequent history, were the Chinese. In 1409, under a new directive from Emperor Chu Ti to pursue trade in the South Seas and the Indian Ocean, a Chinese fleet of 50 ships headed by Admiral Cheng Ho called in at Melaka. They made Parameswara an offer he could not refuse: port facilities and an annual financial tribute in exchange for Chinese protection against the marauding Thais. In 1411, Parameswara took the money to Beijing himself, and the emperor gratefully made him a vassal king. Twenty years later, the Chinese withdrew again from the South Seas trade. The new ruler of Melaka, Sri Maharajah, switched his allegiance to the Muslim trading fraternity by marrying into the Muslim faith, wedding the daughter of a sultan in Sumatra. Islam won its place in Malaya not by conquest — as had been the case in North Africa and Europe — but by trade, dynastic alliances, and peaceful preaching. Bengali peddlers had already brought the faith to the east coast. In Melaka and throughout the peninsula, Islam thrived as a strong, male-dominated religion of individuality, offering dynamic leadership and preaching brotherhood and self-reliance — all qualities ideally suited to the coastal trade. At the same time, Sufi mystics synthesized Islamic teaching with local Malay traditions of animistic magic and charisma, though Islam did not become the state religion until Muzaffar Shah became sultan of Melaka (1446–1459). But the key figure in the sultanate was Tun Perak, bendahara (prime minister) and military commander. He expanded Melaka's power along the west coast and down to Singapore and the neighboring Bintan islands. He also had orang laut pirates patrolling the seas to extort tribute from passing ships. After Ailied district chiefs had repelled assaults from Thai-controlled armies from Pahang, Tun Perak personally led a famous victory over a Thai fleet off Batu Pahat in 1456. Question: \\"Why did Parameswara take money to Beijing in 1411?\\" Answer: \\"To become a vessel king\\" Is this answer to the question correct?","completion":"Yes, the answer is correct. Parameswara took money to Beijing in 1411 because the Chinese emperor offered him protection and made him a vassal king in exchange for the financial tribute and port facilities."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Is \\"This term has gradually fallen out of favor because in some parts of the world the Chalcolithic and Neolithic are coterminous at both ends.\\" a good answer to the question \\"What are the first datings of Bronze artifacts from the Vinca culture?\\"","completion":"While the statement provided does give context to the complexities of understanding early metalworking cultures and their transition from the Stone Age to the Bronze Age, it does not specifically address the first datings of bronze artifacts from the Vinca culture. A more appropriate and detailed answer to the question would be: The Vinca culture, also known as the Turdaș-Vinča culture or Vinča-Turdaș culture, was a Neolithic and early Chalcolithic civilization that occupied present-day Serbia, Romania, Bulgaria, and Macedonia during the period from approximately 5700 - 4500 BCE. This culture was largely characterized by its sophisticated pottery and widespread metallurgical activities. Regarding the first datings of bronze artifacts from the Vinca culture, it is important to note that bronze as an alloy was not present or used in the Vinca culture as it was predated by a few millennia. The Vinca culture belongs to the Copper Age or the Chalcolithic period, where copper was the primary metal being used. It is in the subsequent Bronze Age that the utilization of bronze (an alloy of copper and tin) became widespread. Although the Vinca culture predominantly used copper for producing artifacts such as tools, ornaments, and figurines, the identification of specific datings for these artifacts is not a straightforward process. This is due to several factors, including variations in the chronology and development of the culture in diverse regions, as well as archaeological research inconsistencies. One of the earliest datings for copper artifacts from the Vinca culture can be traced back to settlements in the Balkans, such as the site at Pločnik, Serbia. Here, copper axes, hammers, and chisels, along with clay kilns, molds, crucibles, and slag, were discovered, establishing that the Vinca inhabitants were experimenting with copper metalworking as early as around 5000 BCE. It is important to note that these copper artifacts predate the widespread use of bronze. In conclusion, it is crucial to understand that the question seeks information about bronze artifacts from the Vinca culture; however, the Vinca culture precedes the Bronze Age and primarily dealt with copper metalworking. Therefore, it would be more accurate to focus on the datings and developments regarding copper artifacts within the Vinca culture instead of exploring any potential existence of bronze artifacts. One such example is the early technology in metalworking that has been identified in settlements like Pločnik, Serbia, dating back to around 5000 BCE."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In 2012, Americans reported receiving 12 days of vacation, compared with 14 days last year. Of those 12, they're expected to take only 10 this year, according to Expedia's annual Vacation Deprivation study. Even so, American workers still take more vacation than their Asian counterparts, the study shows. The Japanese are expected to take only five of 13 allotted days. South Koreans will likely take seven out of 10. Asian workers also work the longest weeks, about 44 hours, according to the study.

In France and Spain, workers tend to take the full 30 days, while Germans take 28 of their 30 days. British, Swedish and Norwegian workers don't waste a single day, taking all 25 of their vacation days. \\"Studies consistently show that an ideal work-life balance leads to happier and more productive employees,\\" John Morrey, general manager of Expedia.com, said in a statement. \\"Your vacation days are not a gift, not a luxury. They're yours to use.\\" Overall, workers cited difficulty coordinating time off with family and friends and the possibility of rolling the days over into the next year as the biggest reasons they don't take their days. Workers in the U.S., U.K., Canada, Japan and Ireland cited money concerns as the biggest hurdle to taking their vacation time.

Kesey's most famous novel, \\"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,\\" was published in 1962. The novel critiqued the oppressive nature of institutions, particularly within the mental health care system of the time. Set in an Oregon psychiatric hospital, the book explores themes of individualism, power dynamics, and societal norms through the interactions between the main character, Randle Patrick McMurphy, and the staff of the hospital. The novel is narrated by a patient named Chief Bromden, who adds a unique perspective on the events that unfold. \\"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\\" quickly gained popularity and became a staple of 1960s countercultural literature, representing a backlash against conformity and conventional views of mental illness. Kesey's portrayal of the abuse of power within the psychiatric system fueled discussions around psychiatric patients' rights and mental health care reform. The book was later adapted into a successful stage play in 1963 by Dale Wasserman, and a critically acclaimed film in 1975, directed by Miloš Forman. The film adaptation starred Jack Nicholson as McMurphy and Louise Fletcher as Nurse Ratched, the authoritarian head nurse. The movie received several Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor (Jack Nicholson), Best Actress (Louise Fletcher), and Best Adapted Screenplay. Kesey also authored other novels, such as \\"Sometimes a Great Notion\\" (1964), \\"Kesey's Garage Sale\\" (1973), and \\"Sailor Song\\" (1992). Additionally, he was involved in the countercultural movement through his group, the Merry Pranksters, which participated in a famous cross-country road trip in a bus called \\"Further.\\" This trip and Kesey's experiences with the Merry Pranksters were captured in Tom Wolfe's book, \\"The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test\\" (1968). Ken Kesey passed away on November 10, 2001, in Eugene, Oregon, leaving behind a legacy of countercultural literature and advocacy for mental health care reform. His works continue to be widely studied and appreciated for their evocative portrayal of society’s constraints and the human spirit's potential for rebellion and transcendence."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Can you tell me the answer to what are two types of vascular tissue found in most plants??","completion":"Of course, little buddy! In most plants, there are two types of vascular tissue that help them grow big and strong. These special tissues are called xylem and phloem. Xylem is like a straw that sucks up water and nutrients from the roots of the plant and sends them to the leaves so they can grow. It also helps the plant to stand tall. Phloem, on the other hand, works like a food delivery system. It takes the sugars, which are yummy plant food, made in the leaves and carries them to other parts of the plant that need the energy to grow. So, xylem and phloem are the super-important helpers that make sure plants get the water, nutrients, and food they need!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis suggests that increased environmental pollution may affect male and female birds mating. This could have direct and indirect effects on the process. Direct effects of increased pollution on bird mating: Environmental pollution can cause habitat degradation, making it difficult for birds to find suitable locations to mate. Pollution can also lead to contamination of food sources, which may weaken the health of birds and make them less able to mate successfully. Additionally, exposure to pollutants can cause developmental or physiological problems in birds, potentially affecting their ability to reproduce. Indirect effects of increased pollution on bird mating: Pollution can also have indirect effects on bird populations by affecting their food sources, changing the balance of predator-prey relationships, and causing shifts in their natural range due to changes in the ecosystem. These indirect effects can influence the mating process by impacting the availability of suitable mates, altering reproductive behaviors, and affecting the overall mating success of bird populations. In summary, the perturbation hypothesis suggests that increased environmental pollution can have both direct and indirect effects on male and female birds mating. These effects may result in changes to the reproductive success and population dynamics of bird species, potentially leading to declines in bird populations and disruptions to the ecosystem."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

John William Carson (October 23, 1925 - January 23, 2005) was an American television host, comedian, writer, and producer. He is best known as the host of The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson (1962-1992). Carson received six Emmy Awards, the Television Academy's 1980 Governor's Award, and a 1985 Peabody Award. He was inducted into the Television Academy Hall of Fame in 1987. On May 1, 1972, the show was moved from Thirty Rockefeller Plaza, New York, to Burbank, California, because of the studio's proximity to the celebrities. Carson often joked about \\"beautiful downtown Burbank\\" and referred to \\"beautiful downtown Bakersfield\\", which prompted Bakersfield Mayor Mary K. Shell to chide Carson and invite him to her city to see improvements made during the early 1980s. From July 1971, Carson stopped hosting five shows per week. Instead, Mondays featured a guest host, leaving Carson to host the other four weeknights. Shows were videotaped in Burbank at 5:30 pm, fed from there to the Central and Eastern time zone stations via cross-country television line at 8:30 pm Pacific time (11:30 pm Eastern time), and later sent from Burbank to the Pacific time zone stations at 11:30 pm Pacific time. Since only two feeds originated from Burbank, Central time zone stations received the Eastern feed one hour earlier at 10:30 pm local time, and Mountain time stations received the Pacific time zone feed one hour later at 12:30 am local time. In 1980, at Carson's request, the show cut its 90-minute format to 60 minutes on September 16; Tom Snyder's Tomorrow added a half-hour to fill the vacant time. Joan Rivers became the \\"permanent\\" guest host from September 1983 until 1986. The Tonight Show returned to using rotating guest hosts, including comic George Carlin. Jay Leno then became the exclusive guest host in fall 1987. Leno joked that although other guest hosts had upped their fees, he had kept his low, assuring himself more bookings. Eventually, Monday night was for Leno, Tuesday for The Best of Carson--rebroadcasts usually dating from a year earlier, but occasionally from the 1970s. Although Carson's work schedule became more attenuated, Tonight remained so successful that his compensation from NBC continued to rise; by the mid-1970s, he had become the highest-paid personality on television, earning about 4 million a year (15,008,000 today), not including nightclub appearances and his other businesses. He refused many offers to appear in films, including title roles in The Thomas Crown Affair and Gene Wilder's role in Blazing Saddles. He also declined director Martin Scorsese's offer to co-star with Robert De Niro in the 1983 film The King of Comedy, the role of a TV talk-show host then going to Jerry Lewis. In recognition of his 25th anniversary on The Tonight Show, Carson received a personal Peabody Award, the board saying he had \\"become an American institution, a household word, [and] the most widely quoted American.\\" They also said they \\"felt the time had come to recognize the contributions that Johnny has made to television, to humor, and to America.\\" Entity:","completion":"The entity this text is about is John William Carson, also known as Johnny Carson."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Expand this summary.","completion":"Three individuals at a northern Virginia military base, Joint Base Myer-Henderson Hall, have been transported to a medical facility and are currently in stable condition after an incident involving a suspicious piece of mail. Upon opening the mail, almost a dozen individuals experienced health issues, prompting immediate medical attention and further investigation. The Associated Press reported this incident as officials look to determine the cause of the sudden ailments. Located on the Marine Corps side of Joint Base Myer-Henderson Hall, the incident took place in an office where the mail was received. According to a base spokeswoman, Leah Rubalcaba, those who came into contact with the mail immediately started feeling unwell, with symptoms including sore throats, a burning sensation in their hands and faces, and, in one case, a nosebleed. A total of 11 individuals were initially assessed, and three of them were transported to a medical facility for further treatment. In a statement released on Twitter, the Arlington County Fire Department confirmed the stable condition of the three individuals receiving medical care and mentioned that the investigation is still ongoing. The Marine Corps also stated that the building had been evacuated, ensuring the safety of the personnel inside, while several Marines were also receiving proper medical care. Joint Base Myer-Henderson Hall, a military base with a rich history and importance in national security, plays a vital role for the United States. With this suspicious event occurring within their premises, it's crucial for authorities to determine the cause quickly and take necessary measures to protect the personnel working at the base. As the authorities continue to investigate the incident, it's crucial to determine whether this was an isolated occurrence or part of a broader scheme targeted at military bases. Security protocols will likely be updated and reinforced to ensure that situations like this do not happen again, and that the personnel at Joint Base Myer-Henderson Hall and other military installations across the nation are safe. While the three individuals who were significantly affected by the suspicious piece of mail are now receiving adequate medical care and in stable condition, it's important to monitor their progress and ensure they receive continued support throughout their recovery process. In conclusion, the suspicious mail incident at Joint Base Myer-Henderson Hall has raised concerns for the safety and well-being of military personnel. This event highlights the importance of strict security measures to protect individuals working at military installations and conducting vital tasks for the nation. As the investigation proceeds, it's crucial for military bases to remain vigilant and prepared for any potential threats, while ensuring the health and safety of all personnel."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Sentence 2: He must have the report by now--means Sather Karf must believe we killed you Possible answers: [i] yes. [ii] it is not possible to tell. [iii] no. Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","completion":"To provide a detailed and long answer, let us first analyze both sentences. Sentence 1: Means the Sather Karf must believe we killed you--he must have the report by now. This sentence suggests that Sather Karf has received the report and, assuming that the contents of the report indicate that the individual in question has been killed, he believes that the person has been killed. Sentence 2: He must have the report by now--means Sather Karf must believe we killed you This sentence establishes a cause-and-effect relationship. It states that if Sather Karf has received the report, then he must believe that the person has been killed. Now, let's examine the possible answers and evaluate if the second sentence is entailed by the first one. [i] Yes. This answer would imply that the second sentence is a direct result or consequence of the first sentence. Looking at the sentences' structure and meaning, we can see that there is a cause-and-effect relationship as mentioned earlier. If Sather Karf has the report, which is established in the first sentence, then he must believe that the person was killed, as described in the second sentence. Therefore, it can be argued that the second sentence is entailed by the first sentence. [ii] It is not possible to tell. This answer would suggest that there is not enough information available to determine whether the second sentence is entailed by the first sentence. However, given the context and the cause-and-effect relationship mentioned earlier, there seems to be sufficient information to establish that the second sentence is, indeed, entailed by the first sentence. [iii] No. This answer would imply that the second sentence is not a consequence or direct result of the first sentence. However, as mentioned earlier, there is a clear cause-and-effect relationship between the two sentences, suggesting that the second sentence is entailed by the first one. In conclusion, based on the analysis of both sentences and the established cause-and-effect relationship between them, the correct answer is [i] yes. The second sentence, \\"He must have the report by now--means Sather Karf must believe we killed you,\\" is indeed entailed by the first sentence, \\"Means the Sather Karf must believe we killed you--he must have the report by now.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

(CNN) -- A man who has been fighting for permanent custody of his daughter under Native American tribal law can continue to raise her for the moment in Oklahoma, a new twist in a high-profile legal case already decided by the Supreme Court. The Oklahoma Supreme Court issued an emergency stay on Friday to temporarily delay the transfer of Dusten Brown's daughter, Veronica, 4, to her adoptive parents in South Carolina. The order was made public on Tuesday. Attorneys for Brown and the adoptive couple, Matt and Melanie Capobianco of North Charleston, planned to attend a closed-door hearing at the Oklahoma Supreme Court later on Tuesday. The case raises issues about the scope of a special federal law aimed at keeping","completion":"Native American children with Native American families. The Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA) was passed in 1978 in response to the high number of Native American children being removed from their homes and placed with non-Native American families. Brown, who is a member of the Cherokee Nation, has been arguing that the ICWA should apply in this case, allowing him to maintain custody over his daughter. After months of legal proceedings, the Oklahoma Supreme Court carefully considered the merits of the case and gathered input from various stakeholders, including the Cherokee Nation, the child's birth mother, and the adoptive parents. In order to fully comprehend the impact of the ICWA on this case, the court examined multiple factors, including the best interests of the child, the cultural connection of the child to the tribe, and the preservation of Native American families. In a landmark decision for Native American rights and family law, the Oklahoma Supreme Court ruled in favor of Dusten Brown, granting him permanent custody of his daughter Veronica under the provisions of the ICWA. The decision held that the ICWA is a valid and necessary law for the protection of Native American children and families, and that its application in this case was essential to ensuring the best interests of Veronica. This ruling sparked an intense nation-wide debate on the role of tribal sovereignty in modern-day child custody and adoption cases involving Native American children. Advocates for Native American rights hailed the decision as a critical victory for the preservation of Native American culture and the recognition of tribal sovereignty in American family law. Conversely, opponents of the decision argued that the utilization of the ICWA in this case unfairly prioritized cultural considerations over the best interests of the child, potentially undermining the adoption process for countless American families. Following the verdict, Matt and Melanie Capobianco expressed disappointment and heartache but ultimately respected the court's decision and wished Dusten Brown and Veronica the best. Brown expressed his gratitude to the Oklahoma Supreme Court for the ruling and pledged to continue advocating for the rights of Native American children and families in courtrooms across the United States. The outcome of this case subsequently led to a renewed focus on the ICWA and its role in the American legal system. Lawmakers, child welfare advocates, and Native American organizations convened to discuss the law's impact on tribes and families, and explore possibilities for reform or clarification. The goal of these discussions was to ensure that the ICWA maintains its original intent to protect Native American children while striking a fair balance for all involved parties in cases of adoption and child custody. In the following years, the Dusten Brown case served as a cornerstone for Native American rights and child welfare reform. With an increased awareness of the ICWA's significance and a commitment to fair, balanced legislation, efforts were made to improve the law to better serve the interests of children, families, and Native American tribes across the country."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Eric taught Leslie about the different types of glue suited for the project, such as white glue for paper and photos, and a stronger adhesive for attaching heavier materials like buttons or wood. Leslie soaked in the knowledge and appreciated Eric's practical tips and insights. Together, they carefully chose and arranged pictures, local newspaper clippings, and other meaningful items to create a beautiful collage. Eric's knowledge about glue played a significant role in making their project a stunning, long-lasting piece of art. In the end, their work was well-appreciated at the charity event, and they also formed a great bond of friendship. They came to recognize that despite their differing skill sets, they had much to offer each other in terms of knowledge and expertise."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Context: ROLAND NARROWED HIS EYES AND STARED UPWARD INTO THE DARKNESS, across the top of Mont Segur toward the Cathar fortress. Standing on a high walkway of planks behind the palisade of the crusaders' small wooden fort, he heard faraway voices and saw torches moving on the Cathar rampart. The two men on watch with him that night, a sergeant from Champagne and a young man-at-arms from Brittany, were talking in low tones about the women to be had far below, at the foot of the mountain. They seemed not to see the activity about the Cathar stronghold on the upper peak of the mountaintop opposite their own fort. But Roland, knowing Diane was in the besieged fortress, could not take his eyes from it. He knew he had to act soon. Each day the crusaders grew stronger and the Cathars weaker. Once the Cathar stronghold fell, the crusaders would slaughter all within, including Diane. The sergeant, chuckling, was offering his young companion a wineskin. The Breton never received it. From behind the Cathar wall came the sound of a huge thump, as if a giant's fist had pounded Mont Segur. Roland recognized the sound, and fought panic as he thrust his arms out, trying to push the other two men toward the ladder. But there was no time for them to climb down to safety. The thump was the counter-weight of a stone-caster, and the whistling noise that followed fast upon it was the rock it had thrown. A shape as big as a wine barrel blotted out the stars. The stone hit the parapet beside Roland, and the whole palisade shuddered. Roland caught a glimpse of the sergeant's horrified face and heard his scream as the boulder struck him, crushing him to the ground. Question: What are the two men on watch with Roland talking about?

Make this lower case","completion":"his power to change and fix things is far beyond our understanding. When we consider a figure with \\"power to change and fix things far beyond our understanding,\\" it evokes thoughts of a supernatural or divine being. This could refer to a deity or an entity with immense capabilities that can have a significant impact on our world or reality. It implies that this being's abilities far surpass human comprehension, making it difficult for us to grasp the extent of their influence fully. The phrase conveys the idea that the being in question is capable of enacting profound changes and fixing problems that would be impossible for humans to address. This could include the power to alter the course of history, rectify societal issues, or even manipulate the nature of our reality. Such a being's actions would likely have substantial, lasting effects on our world. It is essential to understand that a being with such power could utilize it in various ways. Some might choose to use their abilities for the greater good, working to improve humanity's overall well-being and ensure a brighter future. Others might use their power for nefarious purposes, seeking personal gain or destructive ends. In any case, acknowledging that there exists a power greater than ourselves and our understanding often invokes a sense of humility, wonder, and even fear. This recognition can inspire a desire to learn more about such an entity and ponder the nature of its existence. It may encourage exploration of one's spirituality, faith, or philosophy to better comprehend the implications of a supreme being's presence. It is worth noting that many cultures and belief systems throughout history have developed their own interpretations of a being with divine or extraordinary power. These figures play an essential role in shaping the cultural and spiritual identities of the societies they originate from and may serve as a source of comfort and inspiration to countless individuals. Ultimately, the concept of a being with the power to change and fix things far beyond our understanding is a testament to humanity's curiosity and the quest to comprehend the often inexplicable nature of our existence. By contemplating the abilities and nature of such a being, we engage in an ongoing exploration of the limits of our knowledge, capacities, and potential."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

At what university did professor Lee Smolin popularize the theory of casual dynamical triangulation (CDT)? A:","completion":"Professor Lee Smolin is a theoretical physicist who has contributed substantially to the field of quantum gravity and is well-known for his work on loop quantum gravity. However, it is important to note that Casual Dynamical Triangulation (CDT) is a separate approach to quantum gravity, primarily developed by Renate Loll, Jan Ambjorn, and Jerzy Jurkiewicz.

Smolin has held faculty positions at several institutions, most notably at the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics in Canada, where he's served since the institute's founding in 1999. Before that, he was at Penn State University. But it would be inaccurate to say he popularized CDT in any of these universities, as this is a concept developed and advanced predominantly by other researchers.

He rushed into the classical music scene at the age of 12 after Itzhak Perlman, the famed violinist, heard him play. But nothing in his family history explains where Haimovitz got his extraordinary talent. And that's typical, Ellen Winner, a professor says. \\"People are fascinated by these children because they don't understand where their talent came from. You will see parents who say, 'I wasn't like this, and my husband wasn't like this.' It seems to sometimes just come out of the blue,\\" Winner says. It's not clear whether a prodigy's brain is any different from the brains of other children, in part because there have been no study comparing the brains of prodigies to those of average people. \\"But I believe that anything that shows up so early, without training, has got to be either a genetic or some other biological basis,\\" Winner says. \\"If a child suddenly at the age of 3 goes to the piano and picks out a tune and does it beautifully, that has to be because that child has a different brain.\\" Children who are extremely gifted tend to be socially different, too, Winner says. \\"They feel like they can't find other kids like themselves, so they feel strange, maybe even like a freak, and feel like they don't have anybody to connect with.

Lieutenant Rorke (Rorke Denver) confides to Chief Dave that his wife is pregnant and has the entire team spend time together with their families until their next deployment. A squad from the platoon consisting of Rorke, Dave, Wiemy, Mikey, Ray, Sonny, and Ajay, is then deployed to Costa Rica to exfiltrate Morales. The seven Navy SEALs insert into the jungle via HALO and hold position outside the compound all night. At dawn, they approach the compound, hear Morales being tortured, and decide to enter the compound early. Rorke and Weimy, the team sniper, provide cover for the other five, led by Dave, who conduct room-clearing, engaging several enemy guards. SEAL operative Mikey is shot in the eye, blinding him and knocking him unconscious, though he survives. The SEALs extract Morales, escaping with her and recovering a cellphone full of the information she had gathered. However, the gunfight alerts the enemy quick reaction force down the road, who drive toward the camp. The SEALs commandeer an enemy truck and exfiltrate. The hot pursuit forces them to revert to a tertiary extraction point where the SOC-R boats extract the team and neutralize the enemy pursuit with miniguns.

I end this small run of blog posts with the question posed by Professor Brian Boyd at the beginning of our evening: Do we want to close the achievement gap? We know we can close the gap. It’s been done or almost been done before in Scottish education, but the answers have been ignored as they pass us by. The simple clue is this: poverty is single biggest predictor of achievement, and according to research (Hammonds sic, reference required), aged 10, a child living in poverty is 60% less likely to get to university. Boyd borrowed from his own mother’s report card to ask us what kind of education we desire. Is it the academic success at all costs route, or is there another option we need to value as much, if not more? His mother’s report card, one that prevented her from becoming a secondary school pupil in Glasgow, is filled with G and FG, until the last point: Character and conduct - excellent. What kind of pupils do we want to develop in Scotland? What do we value in our assessment system? Opening up opportunity for all is a tough game to play when the examination system rewards only certain types of behaviour, few of them related to what the Curriculum for Excellence says we stand for. In his own small community in East Kilbride, three secondary schools enter a period of meltdown as the local rag sets about creating its own local league table of performance, with those three ‘teams’ in competition for the top spot (or at least not the bottom one). Therefore, we must stop basing “the gap” largely on attainment. First of all, Boyd would like us to remove the traditional, and non-sensical academic/vocational divide. Is the law or medicine degree we value not vocational? (Are all General Practitioners not Plumbers, as Dr Murray on the panel suggests?)

Title: Thieves Like Us Movie plot: Bowie, a youthful convicted murderer and bank robbers Chicamaw and T-Dub escape from a Mississippi chain gang in the 1930s. They hole up with a series of colorful associates and continue robbing banks. While hiding out at the home of Mattie and her two children, Bowie unwittingly insults Mattie by comparing her with his mother during an exchange that initially sounds like a pick-up. The insult, combined with the lascivious attention of the much older T-Dub toward Mattie's daughter Lula, and Bowie's later return with the young Keechie (now pregnant with Bowie's child) in tow inspires Mattie's revenge against Bowie. Bowie is injured in an auto accident and takes refuge with the daughter of the gas station attendant, Keechie. They become romantically involved but their relationship is strained by Bowie's refusal to turn his back on crime. Chicamaw is eventually recaptured and T-Dub is killed while waiting in his car for his wife. Bowie poses as a sheriff's deputy to spring Chickamaw from jail but he quickly becomes disgusted with the violent, raving Chicamaw and abandons him on the side of the road.

Write an article based on this summary: Understand what market share can demonstrate about a business. Comprehend the limitations of the market share indicator. Think about how market share should shape your investment strategy.","completion":"Title: Market Share: A Critical Tool for Investors Introduction Market share is a critical metric used by investors to assess a company's success in a competitive industry. Understanding the underlying dynamics of market share provides valuable insights into a business's overall performance and growth prospects. However, market share alone should not be the sole determinant of an investment strategy, as several limitations affect its reliability. This article explores the importance of market share, its limitations, and how it should influence your investment strategy. Market Share: A Reflection of Business Success Market share is calculated by dividing a firm's sales revenue by the total sales revenue of all companies in a specific market or industry. A higher market share could indicate the following attributes about a business: 1. Market dominance: A company with substantial market share often holds a significant advantage over its rivals due to economies of scale, brand value, and a competitive position. This advantage translates into higher profitability and revenue growth. 2. Customer loyalty: A higher market share indicates a strong customer base, with satisfied clients being more likely to continue patronizing the business and recommend it to others. This loyalty can enhance a firm's growth prospects and its capacity to withstand market fluctuations. 3. Innovation and product development: Successful businesses often invest a portion of their profits into research and development, allowing them to improve their products or services. As a result, a company with a solid market share may have a better product offering that sets it apart from competitors and attracts more customers. Limitations of Market Share as an Investment Indicator Despite its significance, several drawbacks to relying solely on market share as an investment indicator should be considered. These limitations include: 1. Market share doesn't provide insight into profitability: A company with high market share might still undergo a financial crisis due to slim profit margins, poor management, or intense competition. 2. Market saturation: A company with a high market share in a saturated market might face challenges in finding new growth opportunities. 3. Market share doesn't always account for external factors: Market share might not consider the impact of government regulations, changing consumer preferences, or technological advancements that could potentially disrupt the industry landscape. 4. Misleading market segmentation: Market share calculations heavily rely on the market segment's definition, which could be inaccurate or misleading. If a company's products or services are wrongly or narrowly categorized, its market share may appear misleadingly high or low. Incorporating Market Share into Investment Strategy Given the advantages and limitations mentioned above, investors should employ a balanced approach when incorporating market share into their investment strategy: 1. Consider market share as one of several key performance indicators: While it offers valuable insights into a company's competitive position, investors should also consider profitability, revenue growth, and other financial ratios when analyzing an investment opportunity. 2. Assess industry dynamics: Investors should evaluate the industry's overall performance and competitive landscape to gain a holistic understanding of a company's market position. This will enable them to make better-informed investment decisions. 3. Monitor market trends: Regularly analyzing trends in consumer preferences, competition, and technology enables investors to predict potential market shifts, thereby staying prepared to adapt their investment strategy accordingly. Conclusion Market share serves as an essential tool that offers critical insights into a company's performance and position within its industry. However, investors should recognize its limitations and employ a comprehensive approach that considers multiple factors when shaping their investment strategies. By doing so, they can maximize their success in identifying businesses with strong growth potential and favorable investment prospects."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher. Given a task, you explain in simple steps what the task is asking, any guidelines it provides and how to use those guidelines to find the answer.

Your job is to determine if the two sentences clearly agree/disagree with each other, or if this can't be determined. Indicate your answer as yes or no respectively. Q: Sentence 1: How many came? Sentence 2: I wonder if more than 500 people showed up? A:","completion":"Task explanation: You are given two sentences and you need to identify if they clearly agree or disagree with each other, or if it's not possible to determine their agreement. You will answer with 'yes' if they agree/disagree, and 'no' if the relationship between the sentences cannot be determined. Guidelines: 1. Carefully read both sentences provided. 2. Analyze if the information presented in the sentences is clearly agreeing or disagreeing with each other. 3. If the information is partial or unclear, consider if it's possible to determine any relationship between the two sentences. 4.

Let's use the given example to apply these guidelines: Sentence 1: How many came? Sentence 2: I wonder if more than 500 people showed up? Answer: After reading the sentences and analyzing the information, we find that there isn't enough information to determine if the sentences agree or disagree with each other. Sentence 1 asks a question about the number of attendees, and Sentence 2 expresses uncertainty about a specific amount. Therefore, based on the guidelines, our answer is 'no' since the relationship between the two sentences cannot be determined."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Given the question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: Whose history paintings had primarily been of themes of classical mythology? The painting shows the moment from Summer in which Musidora, having removed the last of her clothes, steps into \\"the lucid coolness of the flood\\" to \\"bathe her fervent limbs in the refreshing stream\\". Damon is not shown; instead, Etty illustrates the scene from Damon's viewpoint. By placing the audience in Damon's position, Etty aimed to induce the same reactions in the viewer as Damon's dilemma as described by Thomson; that of whether to enjoy the spectacle despite knowing it to be inappropriate, or to follow the accepted morality of the time and look away, in what art historian Sarah Burnage has described as \\"a titillating moral test for spectators to both enjoy and overcome\\".The pose of Musidora is based on that of the Aphrodite of Cnidus and the Venus de' Medici. It is possible that Etty was also familiar with Thomas Gainsborough's Musidora, which shares similar elements. Gainsborough's Musidora, his only large nude, was never exhibited in his lifetime and remained in private hands until 1847, but Etty was familiar with its then-owner Robert Vernon and may have seen it in his collection. The setting for the painting is a pool in the grounds of The Plantation, a house in the village of Acomb, near York. The Plantation was the home of his close friend and patron the Reverend Isaac Spencer, vicar of Acomb, and its grounds were a scene Etty had previously painted. In 1846 Etty bought a house in York for his retirement; Burnage speculates that Etty chose Acomb on the grounds that a view of York was quintessentially English.Although Etty had traditionally worked in the Venetian style of painting, with rich colours and detail, for Musidora he adopted a much softer and earthier palette, although his use of reflected light on flesh is derived from Venetian styles. He moved away from Rubens, who up to this time had been his greatest influence, and closer to the style of Titian. This is likely owing to the nature of the subject matter. Until then his history paintings had primarily been of themes of classical...

Answer the above question based on the context below: Frank Chambers a drifter, stops at a depression-era rural California diner for a meal and ends up working there. The diner is operated by a young, beautiful woman, Cora Smith, and her much older husband, Nick Papadakis, a hardworking but unimaginative immigrant from Greece. Frank and Cora start to have an affair soon after they meet. Cora is tired of her situation, married to an older man she does not love, and working at a diner that she wishes to own and improve. She and Frank scheme to murder Nick to start a new life together without her losing the diner. Their first attempt at the murder is a failure, but Nick is not even aware they tried to kill him, so goes about living his life as usual. Frank and Cora succeed with their next attempt. The local prosecutor suspects what has actually occurred but does not have enough evidence to prove it. As a tactic intended to get Cora and Frank to turn on one another, he tries only Cora for the crime. Although they turn against each other, a clever ploy from Cora's lawyer, Katz, prevents Cora's full confession from coming into the hands of the prosecutor. With the tactic having failed to generate any new evidence for the prosecution, Cora benefits from a deal in which she pleads guilty to manslaughter and is sentenced to probation. Months later, Frank has an affair with Madge Gorland while Cora is out of town. When Cora returns, she tells Frank she is pregnant. That night, Katz's assistant, Kennedy, appears at their door and threatens to expose them unless they give him 10,000. Enraged, Frank beats Kennedy up and strong-arms him into giving up the evidence against them.

Two rival groups of Acromyrmex heyeri ants, group A and group B, are battling each other to gain territory. The goal is to attack the rival group when they have more openings in their nest thatch. In battle day one group A territory had 5 °C temperature. In battle day two group A territory had 22 °C temperature. In battle day three group A territory had low air humidity. In battle day four group A territory had high air humidity. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: In battle day two would group A have less openings or more openings in their nest thatch? Hint: Acromyrmex heyeri is a species of leaf-cutter ant, a New World ant of the subfamily Myrmicinae of the genus Acromyrmex. Acromyrmex heyeri workers construct the colonies nest by thatching together cut grass. At temperatures ranging from 20–30 °C, workers created more openings in the nest thatch as the internal nest temperature goes up as a method of temperature regulation for the colony. The workers will close openings in the nest thatch as the air humidity surrounding the nest decreases to reduce water loss for the colony. The answer to this question is:","completion":"In battle day two, group A would have more openings in their nest thatch. This is because the temperature on day two is 22 °C, which is within the range of 20-30 °C where Acromyrmex heyeri ants create more openings in the nest thatch for temperature regulation. The ants do this to manage the internal nest temperature as it goes up, allowing for a more comfortable environment for the colony."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

It was the first composed for a feast day, Pentecost Sunday (Whit Sunday), Pentecost being a high holiday along with Christmas and Easter. The prescribed readings for the feast day are taken from the Acts of the Apostles, on the Holy Spirit (Acts 2:1–13), and from the Gospel of John, in which Jesus announces the Spirit who will teach, in his Farewell discourse (John 14:23–31). As in many Bach cantatas, the libretto is compiled from Bible text, contemporary poetry and chorale. The poetry is attributed to Salomon Franck, although the verses are not included in his printed editions. Several of Bach's early stylistic mannerisms appear here, such as a biblical quotation in a recitative second movement rather than in a first choral movement, arias following each other without a recitative in between, and dialogue in a duet.Franck's text shows elements of early Pietism: the expression of extreme feelings, for example \\"O seligste Zeiten!\\" (O most blessed times) in the opening chorus, and a \\"mystical demeanour\\", for example in the duet of the Soul and the Spirit united. In the middle section of the first movement, Franck paraphrases the Gospel text, which says in verse 23 that God wants to dwell with man, to \\"Gott will sich die Seelen zu Tempeln bereiten\\" (God Himself shall prepare our souls for His temple, more literally: \\"God wants to prepare [our] souls to become his temples\\"). The words for the recitative are the quotation of verse 23 from the Gospel of John, \\"Wer mich liebet, der wird mein Wort halten\\" (Whoever loves Me will keep My Word, and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make Our dwelling with him). Movement 3 addresses the Trinity and movement 4 the Spirit that was present at the Creation. Movement 5 is a duet of the Soul and the Spirit, underlined by an instrumental quote from Martin Luther's Pentecost hymn \\"Komm, Heiliger Geist, Herre Gott\\", which is based on the Latin hymn \\"Veni Sancte Spiritus, reple tuorum corda fidelium\\"....

(The Washington Post) A Russian jet was shot down by Turkish warplanes on Nov. 24, 2015, the first time since 1952 that a NATO jet shot down a Russian jet. (The Washington Post) The downing of a Russian warplane by Turkish F-16s over the Syrian border has split two obstinate strongmen deeply involved in Syria’s increasingly crowded civil war: Russian President Vladimir Putin and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Officials from both countries on Wednesday discounted the possibility of direct conflict over the downing. “We are not going to wage a war on Turkey,” Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told reporters, although he said Moscow viewed the attack as a “planned provocation.” The Turkish government offered its condolences for the deaths of a Russian pilot and a marine in the downing of the plane and an attempted rescue of its crew, Russia’s first combat fatalities in the country’s two-month-old airstrike campaign in Syria. But the incident has revealed the potential for conflict between foreign powers supporting and opposing Syrian President Bashar al-Assad despite a shared opposition to the Islamic State. In particular, Russian airstrikes against Turkish-backed rebel groups have fomented deep frustration in Ankara. “There is a clear message from the Turks with this downing of a Russian jet,” said Mustafa Alani, a Middle East expert at the Geneva-based Gulf Research Center. “It is a check on Russia’s policy in the region. Russia can’t do whatever it wants.” Russia says its Su-24 bomber did not violate Turkish airspace, but Turkish officials say it did. Putin hypothesized Tuesday that even if the plane did briefly enter Turkish airspace, it was not a threat. [This is the Russian plane that Turkey just shot down] In Moscow at least, the event is being seen as something larger than an attack on an errant jet. “The conflict happened because Russia was attacking rebel groups allied with Turkey,” said Alexander Baunov, an analyst at the Moscow Carnegie Center, when asked about the possibility of an accidental clash. “It’s wrong to say that this happened because of anything like crowded skies.” The Russian Defense Ministry announced in a statement Wednesday that Russian fighter jets will now escort the bombers, and Moscow will move into Syria powerful new ground-to-air missiles that can reach across the country and far into Turkey from the Russian air base in the province of Latakia on Syria’s Mediterranean coast. Additionally, analysts say, Russia will choose from a menu of asymmetric responses in retaliation against Turkey, including informal economic sanctions and providing military aid to Turkey’s enemies, including the Kurds. “Of course, Russia is going to intensify strikes on that part of Syria and on those groups that are affiliated with Turkey,” said Fyodor Lukyanov, a prominent Russian political analyst. He added that Russia probably would not scale back its deployment in Syria because of the incident. 1 of 7 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × The moment when a Russian warplane is shot down by Turkey View Photos Russia confirmed its plane had been downed but denied it had violated Turkish airspace during a bombing campaign in Syria.

Nov. 24, 2015 A still image from video footage shows the burning trail of a Russian fighter jet after being shot down near the Turkish-Syrian border. The jet was reportedly downed by Turkish forces, Turkish state news agency Anadolu reported, citing sources in the presidency. Haberturk TV Channel/via European Pressphoto Agency Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. On Wednesday evening, Turkey’s state-run news agency, Anadolu, reported that Russian airstrikes targeted Turkish aid vehicles in the Syrian border town of Azzaz, killing at least seven drivers. The town is a hub for supplies being delivered from Turkey to Syrian rebels fighting government forces in the nearby city of Aleppo. The details of the incident could not be assessed independently. Shady al-Ouaineh, a media ­representative for Determined Storm, a rebel group associated with the Free Syrian Army, said in a telephone interview that Russia had dramatically intensified air raids in rebel-held areas of Latakia province. Syrian government forces and allied Shiite militiamen from Iraq, backed by Russian air cover, have been trying to advance on some of the last opposition holdouts in the province, said Ouaineh, close to where the Russian jet was shot down. “It is clear Russia is taking out its revenge on us here,” he said. [NATO faces new Mideast crisis after downing of Russian jet by Turkey] Russian attitudes toward Turkey, which were reasonably friendly a year ago, have turned cold with alarming speed. Most Russian tour operators stopped selling travel packages to Turkey on Wednesday. Protesters in Moscow pelted the Turkish Embassy with eggs and rocks, shattering windows. Russian lawmakers introduced a bill that would criminalize denying that the mass killings of Armenians in 1915 by the Ottoman Empire was a “genocide.” The issue remains highly sensitive: Turkey acknowledges that atrocities occurred but has long denied that what took place constituted a genocide. Last December, Russia diverted a planned gas line away from Europe to Turkey in order to spurn the West. That project’s fate is also now in doubt. “The consequences are going to be significant,” Lukyanov said. Russia will seek retribution against Turkey but wants to avoid antagonizing the West, Baunov said. “If this becomes a fight between Russia and the West, then that goes against the goals of the intervention in the first place: to escape international isolation connected to sanctions,” he said. Those sanctions were imposed after Russia annexed the Crimean Peninsula and backed separatist rebels in Ukraine’s southeast. President Obama, meeting with French President François Hollande in Washington on Tuesday, said that Turkey had a right to defend its airspace and accused Russia of attacking moderate opposition groups as opposed to the Islamic State. Russia has said it carries out airstrikes only against terrorist organizations. “They are operating very close to a Turkish border and they are going after a moderate opposition that are supported by not only Turkey but a wide range of countries,” Obama said. At the same time he discouraged “any kind of escalation.” [U.S., France to press allies for more assets in fight against the Islamic State] The frantic Russian search for the missing bomber crew was marred by the death of a marine on an Mi-8 helicopter hit by an antitank missile. “One on board was wounded when he parachuted down and killed in a savage way on the ground by the jihadists,” Alexander Orlov, the Russian ambassador to France, told Europe 1 radio. “The other managed to escape and, according to the latest information, has been picked up by the Syrian army and should be going back to the Russian air force base.” Putin has promised the Russian public a limited engagement in Syria, with no ground forces, to limit casualties. Although the Syrian army has managed to halt a rebel offensive, Russian air power has not yet led to a significant turn of the tide in the war. “Turkey dealt a major blow to Putin, and now he’s been placed between a rock and a hard place,” said Fawaz A. Gerges, a professor of international relations at the London School of Economics. “There could be mission creep where Russia will get entangled in an unwinnable war.” Naylor reported from Beirut.

In response to the attack, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov stated that Russia would not \\"wage a war on Turkey,\\" but viewed the attack as a \\"planned provocation.\\" While Russia claimed that its Su-24 bomber did not violate Turkish airspace, Turkish officials disagreed, leading some analysts to believe that the incident was a display of Turkey's frustration with Russia's airstrikes against Turkish-backed rebel groups in Syria. The Russian Defense Ministry announced that Russian fighter jets would now escort bombers and that Moscow would move powerful new ground-to-air missiles into Syria. Tensions between Russia and Turkey escalated quickly, with Russian tour operators stopping sales of travel packages to Turkey, while protesters in Moscow attacked the Turkish Embassy. Experts suggest that Russia will likely seek retribution against Turkey but will want to avoid antagonizing the West."},{"prompt":"Q:You are given a new situation: David was working in his chemistry lab. He selected two isotopes, sample A and sample B. Sample A had longer half-life, but sample B had shorter half-life. After some time he checked sample A when its one half-life had passed. He noted it as sample A1. Then he came back to see it again when two half-lives had passed. He noted it as sample A2. and a hint : Each radioactive isotope has a characteristic decay time period—the half-life—that is determined by the amount of time needed for half of a sample to decay. This is an exponential decay process that steadily decreases the proportion of the remaining isotope by 50% every half-life. Hence after two half-lives have passed only 25% of the isotope is present, and so forth. Please answer this question : Which sample would have more isotopes, sample A or sample A1?

However, in John 19:14 Jesus is still before Pilate at the sixth hour. Scholars have presented a number of arguments to deal with the issue, some suggesting a reconciliation, e.g., based on the use of Roman timekeeping in John but not in Mark, yet others have rejected the arguments. Several notable scholars have argued that the modern precision of marking the time of day should not be read back into the gospel accounts, written at a time when no standardization of timepieces, or exact recording of hours and minutes was available, and time was often approximated to the closest three-hour period.

Sailor Jack and Bingo are the mascots for what prize awarding snack food, now produced by Frito Lay????","completion":"Sailor Jack and Bingo are the iconic mascots for Cracker Jack, a snack food now produced by Frito-Lay, a subsidiary of PepsiCo. Cracker Jack is a time-honored confection that consists of molasses-flavored, caramel-coated popcorn, and peanuts. Sailor Jack, depicted as a young boy wearing a sailor's outfit, and his dog companion, Bingo, have been the official mascots of this beloved snack since the early 20th century. The history of Cracker Jack dates back to 1893 when the introduction of this tasty treat took place during the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago. Two brothers, Frederick and Louis Rueckheim, concocted the combination of popcorn, peanuts, and molasses that would eventually become Cracker Jack. It was initially named \\"Candied Popcorn and Peanuts,\\" but its name was changed to Cracker Jack in 1896 when a salesman reportedly exclaimed, \\"That's a crackerjack!\\" referring to the snack's excellent taste and quality. The Prize Inside, or \\"Toy Surprise,\\" is one of Cracker Jack's signature features. This has been a part of the snack since 1912 and is the main reason behind its enduring popularity. The Prize Inside has evolved over the years, starting with small toys and trinkets, moving to paper-based items, and eventually transitioning to codes for digital games and experiences. In 1916, Sailor Jack and Bingo made their debut as the Cracker Jack mascots. The boy depicted as Sailor Jack was based on Robert Rueckheim, Frederick Rueckheim's grandson. Sadly, Robert passed away at a young age, but his image lives on as the iconic mascot. The connection between the sailor imagery and the snack's name is thought to be inspired by the phrase \\"cracker jack,\\" which was a slang term for a sailor in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The image of Sailor Jack saluting with Bingo by his side has been part of the Cracker Jack brand ever since, although their appearances have been slightly updated over the years to align with modern tastes and design trends. Cracker Jack was acquired by Borden in 1964, and 30 years later, in 1994, it was bought by Frito-Lay, a subsidiary of PepsiCo. Frito-Lay has maintained the tradition of the Prize Inside, Sailor Jack and Bingo while continuing to produce the classic snack for generations to enjoy. During its long history, Cracker Jack has become synonymous with American nostalgia, baseball games, and family fun, making it a timeless and much-loved snack."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Here's a question: He was stabbing to death his wife when he was caught, at trial he still denied the what?

Jordan is bordered by Saudi Arabia to the east and south; Iraq to the north-east; Syria to the north; Israel, Palestine and the Dead Sea to the west; and the Red Sea in its extreme south-west. Jordan is strategically located at the crossroads of Asia, Africa and Europe. The capital, Amman, is Jordan's most populous city as well as the country's economic, political and cultural centre. What is now Jordan has been inhabited by humans since the Paleolithic period. Three stable kingdoms emerged there at the end of the Bronze Age: Ammon, Moab and Edom. Later rulers include the Nabataean Kingdom, the Roman Empire, and the Ottoman Empire. After the Great Arab Revolt against the Ottomans in 1916 during World War I, the Ottoman Empire was partitioned by Britain and France. The Emirate of Transjordan was established in 1921 by the then Emir Abdullah I and it became a British protectorate. In 1946, Jordan became an independent state officially known as \\"The Hashemite Kingdom of Transjordan\\". Jordan captured the West Bank during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, which it later lost in 1967, and the name of the state was changed to \\"The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan\\" in 1949.

I read this background article the other day: A) In a straight-chain molecule, all the carbon atoms are lined up in a row like cars of a train. The carbon atoms form the “backbone” of the molecule. B) In a branched-chain molecule, at least one of the carbon atoms branches off from the backbone. C) In a cyclic molecule, the chain of carbon atoms is joined at the two ends to form a ring. Each ring usually contains just five or six carbon atoms, but rings can join together to form larger molecules. A cyclic molecule generally has higher boiling and melting points than straight-chain and branched-chain molecules. I am facing a new situation today: Mark works as a scientist for a molecular research institute. Today, he has three samples of molecule in front of him, sample A, sample B, and sample C. Sample A is a straight-chain molecule; sample B is a branched-chain molecule; and sample C is a cyclic molecule. Mark's job is to determine the characteristics of each sample. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which sample would have lower boiling point, sample A or sample C? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Sample A would have a lower boiling point compared to Sample C. This conclusion is based on the information provided in the background article, which states that cyclic molecules generally have higher boiling and melting points than straight-chain and branched-chain molecules. Since Sample A is a straight-chain molecule and Sample C is a cyclic molecule, Sample A would likely have a lower boiling point. The reason for this difference in boiling points can be attributed to the strength of intermolecular forces within the molecules. In cyclic molecules, the structure often leads to stronger intermolecular forces, such as van der Waals forces or potential H-bonding, that require more energy to overcome and cause the substance to change its state. On the other hand, straight-chain molecules have comparatively weaker intermolecular forces, making it easier for them to transition from one state to another, and thus a lower boiling point can be expected."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

They identify many of the weapons and several of the buyers.Over M's protests, the officers agree to launch a guided missile into the area believing that they will eliminate half of the world's most dangerous criminals. The missile is launched from a British frigate and speeds toward the target just as the command center receives a radio call from their agent on the scene. Among the camera images is a plane holding two powerful soviet nuclear weapons which may be triggered by the guided missile. An attempt to abort the missile attack fails and the agent, who is revealed to be James Bond, rushes into the area to steal the plane and the bombs. The attack causes most of the terrorists to flee the area.Bond reaches the plane and knocks the pilot in it unconscious. He successfully escapes the valley before the missile hits but is pursued by another of the surviving terrorists in a plane identical to his. He evades the 2nd plane, however, the pilot he knocked out awakes and throws a heavy cord around Bond's neck. Bond keeps control of the plane, flying under the second one and activates the rear ejection seat of his own plane, throwing the man up into the other plane, causing it to explode.

The attack on three other people, his girlfriend and his parents, who were injured in the fire is being treated as attempted murder. The emergency services were called to the fire at about 07:25 on New Year's Day. A 24-year-old woman was seriously injured in the fire and was taken to Queen Elizabeth University Hospital for treatment. Two other people, a man and woman who are both 54, have been treated for smoke inhalation. They are believed to be Cameron's parents David and Cathy Logan. Police and fire service investigators later established the fire was started deliberately. Det Ch Insp Bob Frew said: \\"Cameron had been out with his girlfriend celebrating Hogmanay and both had returned to his home in the early hours of the morning. \\"Later that morning, a fire was set deliberately at the house.

The firefighters and police found out that this fire was not an accident, someone made it happen on purpose. Cameron's parents and his girlfriend were in the house during the fire too. They got hurt but they were rescued. His girlfriend got very, very hurt and the doctors at Queen Elizabeth University Hospital are working hard to make her feel better.

How often do porn stars actually have an orgasm on camera? Options: [-] no [-] yes The answer is:","completion":"no These two questions are not the same. The first question, \\"Why do many female porn stars have long fingernails?\\", addresses the aesthetics and presentation of female porn actresses within the industry. This question is focused on the visual aspect and the reasoning behind a specific style choice. There could be several reasons for this trend, including that long fingernails are seen as an attractive or alluring feature by some audiences, enhancing the femininity and overall attractiveness of female performers. Additionally, long fingernails may be used as a personal style choice by the performers themselves, or as a branding element to create unique and memorable personas. On the other hand, the second question, \\"How often do porn stars actually have an orgasm on camera?\\", inquires about the authenticity of the sexual pleasure experienced by the performers while filming adult content. This question delves into the behind-the-scenes reality of the adult film industry and the experiences of porn star performers, possibly addressing concerns regarding the morality and ethics of the industry. The answer to this question can vary depending on the type of adult film and the specific performers involved. Some porn stars may genuinely experience orgasms on camera, while others may simulate them for the sake of the production. The frequency of genuine orgasms could depend on factors such as the level of comfort between performers, mental and physical wellbeing, and individual sexual responses. Ultimately, this question is focused on the internal experiences of the performers, as opposed to their outward appearance. In summary, the answer is \\"no,\\" the two questions are not the same, as they address different aspects of the adult film industry—one focusing on style choices and aesthetics of female performers, and the other exploring the authenticity of their sexual experiences on camera."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: Question: Who has been captured by a German military expedition? If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: King Solomon's Mines Context: Jesse Huston (Sharon Stone) hires Allan Quatermain to find her father, believed lost on an expedition to find the fabled King Solomon's Mines. Together with his companion, the mysterious Umbopo, they penetrate unknown country, following a map believed to be genuine. It transpires that Professor Huston has been captured by a German military expedition on the same quest, led by Bockner (Herbert Lom), a single-minded knackwurst-munching, bald-headed Colonel and a ruthless Turkish slave-trader and adventurer, Dogati (John Rhys-Davies). Huston is being forced to interpret another map, also believed to be genuine. The two rival expeditions shadow each other, clashing on several occasions, and finally enter the tribal lands of the Kukuana who capture them. The tribe is under the control of the evil priestess, Gagoola, who has Quatermain hung upside down over a pond full of crocodiles. Just when all seems lost, Umbopo arrives and after defeating Gagoola's warriors in combat, reveals his identity as an exiled tribal chief and the rightful ruler of the Kukuanas. As the tribesmen submit to him, Gagoola captures Jesse and flees into caves in the depths of the Breasts of Sheba, the twin mountain peaks where the mines are located. They are pursued by Bockner and Dogati, who attack the village in full force. They follow Quatermain and Umbopo to the entrance to the mines, but are hampered by a moat of quicksand. Bockner orders his men forward into the moat, but they have trouble crossing it. Dogati then kills all of Bockner's soldiers, as well as most of his own men, and uses their bodies as stepping stones to cross the moat safely. As they approach the entrance, Bockner shoots Dogati and takes command of what little remains of the party. Inside the mines, Quatermain and Umbopo rescue Jesse and find the resting place of all the former tribal queens, including the Queen of Sheba herself, encased in crystal. Umbopo explains that Gagoola had attempted to sacrifice Jesse in order to keep her power as the Kukuanas' ruler because...

My girlfriend and I are always on the search for good and truly spicy food, and when we saw the living social coupon for Jalapeu00f1o Inferno, we were pretty intrigued. Unfortunately our experience was very underwhelming. After a long wait before seeing a waitress, we ordered a couple of their \\"premium\\" margaritas, which we both thought were just okay, a little on the sour side, and overall, lacked balance. We ordered the smoked pork quesadilla and the Texas style enchiladas to split for dinner. It always bugs us a bit when something is listed as \\"not for the faint of heart\\" due to it's spiciness, and it comes out medium spicy at best. The management is super nice, and offered to buy us an app for our initial wait. One of the managers also recommended a puru00e9ed hatch child sauce which made things much better, and had a nice kick, but we felt this should have been somehow infused in the dishes. Ambiance was kind of all over the place, and we would have liked to have had some more traditional Mexican type of music as opposed to the pop channel they had on. Service seemed to be good around us, but I think that our server was just over sat, and forgot about us after our food came out. Over all, we wouldn't recommend this for spicy food enthusiasts or authentic Mexican food connoisseurs, but we think that it'd probably be a good place for families.","completion":"The review is negative.

He always keeps a closed container of nitrogen gas in his freezer, where the temperature is very low. Nicholas's neighbor, Justin, likes to grill in his backyard. Justin, therefore, always keeps a closed container of propane gas outside, where the temperature is high. But I can use this background: Shown in the Figure below is a cylinder of gas on the left that is at room temperature (300 K). On the right, the cylinder has been heated until the Kelvin temperature has doubled to 600 K. The kinetic energy of the gas molecules increases, so collisions with the walls of the container are now more forceful than they were before. As a result, the pressure of the gas doubles. Decreasing the temperature would have the opposite effect, and the pressure of an enclosed gas would decrease. What is an answer for this question: The container of which gas will have lower pressure inside it? A:","completion":"The container with the lower pressure inside it would be the container of nitrogen gas that Nicholas keeps in his freezer. Since the temperature in the freezer is very low, the gas molecules will have a lower kinetic energy and thus collide less forcefully with the walls of the container, resulting in lower pressure inside the container.

Answer based on context: Following their third loss of the season, the Indianapolis Colts entered their home game against the Cincinnati Bengals with a chance to regain the lead in the AFC South. Indianapolis came out energized in the first quarter where the Colts picked up a field goal with three minutes remaining in the quarter, and a Kelvin Hayden interception returned for a touchdown. The second quarter continued to see Colts dominance with a Javarris James touchdown run, extending the Colts lead to 17-0. However, as the quarter wore on the defense began to allow larger gains and the Bengals were able to score a touchdown and a field goal in the last ten minutes of the half. However, an Adam Vinatieri field goal gave the Colts a 20-10 lead going into halftime. The Colts came out in the third quarter sluggish and both teams exchanged the ball throughout the rest of the quarter. Another Vinatieri field goal gave the Colts a 23-10 lead. With everything seeming secure, the Bengals were able to pick up a touchdown on a 19-yard pass from Carson Palmer making it a six-point game. The Bengals onside kick attempt was successful with a late penalty by the Colts, giving the Bengals the ball at the Colts 40-yard line. A fumble, the fifth turnover by the Bengals on the day, gave the Colts the ability to hold on to the lead and win the game 23-17, going to 6-3 on the season and taking first place in the AFC South by one game. How many points were scored total in the game?","completion":"The total points scored in the game is 40. Here's how we calculate it: We add the points scored by both teams together. The Indianapolis Colts scored 23 points and the Cincinnati Bengals scored 17 points. So when we add those together - that's 23 points (for the Colts) plus 17 points (for the Bengals), we get 40 points in the entire game. Simply put, just like you add apples or toys together, you add the points each team scored, and that gives the total points."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

If you don’t have a thermometer, aim to use water that is around room temperature to keep your pet as comfortable as possible. This method is particularly useful for cats, rabbits, or any other animals that generally don’t like being given baths. If you don’t have a spray bottle, you can also simply mix warm water with some dish soap and use a flea comb dipped in this mixture to keep your pet’s fleas. However, this won’t be as effective as using a spray bottle to apply the mix. You can either wrap your pet in a towel to keep it from moving or gently hold it down by its neck. Be very gentle when holding your pet down; remember that this might be very stressful for them! Make sure your pet’s fur is completely soaked through before moving on to the next step. Be sure to avoid getting water in your pet’s eyes or ears, since this will irritate them. Use around 2 to 3 teaspoons (9.9 to 14.8 mL) of dish soap to begin with and add more as needed. Start applying the soap at the neck and work your way down towards the tail. Make sure to rub the soap deep enough into the fur so that it reaches your pet’s skin. Fleas typically live and lay their eggs close to an animal’s skin, so it’s important that you make sure the dish soap reaches all the way down to your pet’s skin to kill all of the fleas. If your pet has really thick fur, you may need to apply a bit more dish soap to make sure you’re reaching down to the skin. Start from the top of your pet’s body and work your way down toward the tail. For best results, use a flea comb to brush your furry friend’s hair as you rinse off the soap to make sure you’re removing as many fleas as possible. Note that you may need to spray a lot of water on a single area in order to get all the soap off. Your pet may be especially tense after this process, especially if it’s a cat. It may even run away from you after you release it. Be careful as you release your pet to avoid being scratched or otherwise injured. Don’t take this behavior personally; your furry friend will be back to normal soon, especially when the food gets put out!

On a clear day, you might see a grain silo 20 miles away. You might think to yourself, it sure is flat around here. If you drive one hundred miles to the south, the landscape changes. In southern Illinois, there are rolling hills. Why do you think this is? What could have caused these features? There are no big rivers that may have eroded and deposited this material. The ground is capable of supporting grass and trees, so wind erosion would not explain it. To answer the question, you need to go back 12,000 years. Around 12,000 years ago, a giant ice sheet covered much of the Midwest United States. Springfield, Illinois, was covered by over a mile of ice. Its hard to imagine a mile thick sheet of ice. The massive ice sheet, called a glacier, caused the features on the land you see today. Where did glaciers go? Where can you see them today? Glaciers are masses of flowing ice. According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"What couldn't the erosion have been caused by?\\" is \\"The erosion couldn't have been from wind or rivers\\"?","completion":"Yes, according to the information provided, the erosion couldn't have been caused by wind or rivers. The differences in landscape - flat terrain in central Illinois and rolling hills in southern Illinois - are attributed to the impact of the glaciers that covered much of the Midwest United States around 12,000 years ago. Glaciers are large, slow-moving masses of ice that can drastically change the landscape and topography of an area over long periods of time. During the last Ice Age, glaciers covered vast portions of North America. As the glaciers moved, they eroded the land underneath, scraping away soil and rock and leaving a flat surface in their wake. This process likely contributed to the creation of the flat terrain in central Illinois. In areas where the glaciers retreated or stopped, the ice could have deposited debris left behind, resulting in the formation of rolling hills like those found in southern Illinois. This process, called glacial deposition, occurs when a glacier melts, releasing the accumulated sediment it was carrying. Consequently, the terrain becomes more uneven and characterized by hills and valleys. As for the last part of the question, glaciers still exist today, although they have retreated significantly since the height of the Ice Age. Presently, you can find glaciers in polar regions like Antarctica and the Arctic, as well as in mountainous areas such as the Andes, the Alps, the Rockies, and the Himalayas. Many of these glaciers are melting at an accelerated rate due to climate change, which poses numerous environmental and societal challenges."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Dan is in his physics lab. He is experimenting with colliding particles. He has two samples of particles, sample A and sample B. Sample A contains gas particles, but sample B does not contain gas particles. Hint: Another thing we can see in this animation is that particles are constantly colliding with one another. One assumption that we make when talking about collisions between gas particles is that they are completely elastic collisions. In an elastic collision , momentum is conserved, which means that none of the kinetic energy of the colliding particles is lost in some other form (such as the emission of light). This makes sense, because if energy were lost in collisions, the speeds of the particles would gradually decrease over time, and eventually everything would condense down into a solid form.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What was built to reinforce a weak point in the defences of the castle? The current entrance in the north-east occupies the approximate location of the main gatehouse constructed by Gundulf and then rebuilt during 1249–1250. It was pulled down in the 1870s when the enclosure was converted into a municipal garden. An engraving from 1735 by the Buck brothers gives some indication of the gatehouse's form: the gate was an archway between two towers projecting from the curtain wall. It was reached by a stone causeway across a ditch, rather than a drawbridge. A tower containing a postern gate was located in the north-west corner of the enclosure, built at the close of the 14th century to guard the bridge over the Medway. The tower and postern no longer stands, but 19th-century antiquary and engineer G. T. Clark made some notes on the structure while it was still standing and commented that it had mechanisms to lift supplies for the castle from the river. The western part of the stone outer wall, a stretch facing the river, dates from when Gundulf built the first wall enclosing the castle. In the 19th century a revetment was added to strengthen the decaying wall. Like the keep, it was constructed using Kentish Ragstone. This part of Gundulf's wall was 4.5 feet (1.4 m) thick at the base, narrowing to 2 feet (0.61 m) at the top; it rose to a height of around 22 feet (6.7 m). Four embrasures were added to this part of the wall in the 13th century, although the builders imitated Norman design. At the northern end of the 12th-century stretch of western wall are the remains of a building, probably a hall, dating from the 13th century. Although no longer standing, it is known it had a vaulted undercroft.In the south Gundulf's wall survived into the modern period, although has now been dismantled. The current wall is a 19th-century replacement. At the eastern end of this wall, near the southern corner of the castle, is a two-storey rounded tower 30 feet (9.1 m) in diameter dating from the early 13th century. It was built to fill the breach in the curtain wall caused when John's army besieged...

One assumption that we make when talking about collisions between gas particles is that they are completely elastic collisions. In an elastic collision , momentum is conserved, which means that none of the kinetic energy of the colliding particles is lost in some other form (such as the emission of light). This makes sense, because if energy were lost in collisions, the speeds of the particles would gradually decrease over time, and eventually everything would condense down into a solid form.

The band has gone through several phases; its strongest commercial success occurred between 1978 and 1987. During that period, the band released a series of hit songs, including \\"Don't Stop Believin'\\" (1981), which in 2009 became the top-selling track in iTunes history among songs not released in the 21st century. Its parent studio album, Escape, the band's eighth and most successful, reached No. 1 on the Billboard 200 and yielded another of their most popular singles, \\"Open Arms\\". With Cain on board, the band began writing material that would eventually lead up to Journey's biggest studio album, \\"Escape\\". Recording sessions began in April 1981, and lasted until the middle of June. Escape was released on July 31, 1981, and immediately the album became a mainstream success. The album, which has thus far sold nine times platinum, went to number one on the album charts later that year, and included three top-ten hits: \\"Who's Cryin' Now\\", \\"Don't Stop Believin'\\" and \\"Open Arms\\". The last is Journey's highest-charting single to date, staying at No. 2 for six consecutive weeks and ranking at No.34 on Billboard's 1982 year-end Hot 100. MTV videotaped one of their two sold-out shows in Houston on November 6, 1981, in front of over 20,000 fans. Capitalizing on their success, the band recorded radio commercials for Budweiser and sold rights to their likenesses and music for use in two video games: the Journey arcade game by Bally/Midway and Journey Escape by Data Age for the Atari 2600. This success was met with criticism. The 1983 Rolling Stone Record Guide gave each of the band's albums only one star, with Dave Marsh writing that \\"Journey was a dead end for San Francisco area rock.\\" Marsh later would anoint Escape as one of the worst number-one albums of all time. Journey's next album, Frontiers (1983), continued their commercial success, reaching No. 2 on the album charts, selling nearly six million copies. The album generated four Top 40 hits, \\"Separate Ways (Worlds Apart)\\", which reached No. 8, \\"Faithfully\\", which reached No. 12, \\"Send Her My Love\\" and \\"After the Fall\\", both of which reached No. 23. By this time, Journey had become one of the top touring and recording bands in the world. During the subsequent stadium tour, the band contracted with NFL Films to record a video documentary of their life on the road, Frontiers and Beyond. Scenes from the documentary were shot at JFK Stadium in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania with more than 80,000 fans in attendance.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: The Shadow is the name of a collection of serialized dramas, originally in 1930s pulp novels, and then in a wide variety of media, and it is also used to refer to the character featured in The Shadow media. One of the most famous adventure heroes of the 20th century United States, the Shadow has been featured on the radio, in a long-running pulp magazine series, in American comic books, comic strips, television, serials, video games, and at least five films. The radio drama included episodes voiced by Orson Welles. Originally simply a mysterious radio narrator who hosted a program designed to promote magazine sales for Street and Smith Publications, The Shadow was developed into a distinctive literary character, later to become a pop culture icon, by writer Walter B. Gibson in 1931. In print, The Shadow's real name is Kent Allard, and he was a famed aviator who fought for the French during World War I. He became known by the alias the Black Eagle, according to The Shadow's Shadow (1933), although later stories revised this alias as the Dark Eagle, beginning with The Shadow Unmasks (1937). After the war, Allard finds a new challenge in waging war on criminals. Allard falsifies his death in the South American jungles, then returns to the United States. Arriving in New York City, he adopts numerous identities to conceal his existence. One of the identities Allard assumes--indeed, the best known--is that of Lamont Cranston, a \\"wealthy young man-about-town.\\" In the pulps, Cranston is a separate character; Allard frequently disguises himself as Cranston and adopts his identity (The Shadow Laughs, 1931). While Cranston travels the world, Allard assumes his identity in New York. In their first meeting, Allard, as The Shadow, threatens Cranston, saying he has arranged to switch signatures on various documents and other means that will allow him to take over the Lamont Cranston identity entirely unless Cranston agrees to allow Allard to impersonate him when he is abroad. Although alarmed at first, Cranston is amused by the irony of the situation and agrees. The two men sometimes meet in order to impersonate each other (Crime over Miami, 1940). The disguise works well because Allard and Cranston resemble each other (Dictator of Crime, 1941). His other disguises include businessman Henry Arnaud, who first appeared in The Black Master (March 1, 1932), which revealed that like Cranston, there is a real Henry Arnaud; elderly Isaac Twambley, who first appeared in No Time For Murder; and Fritz, who first appeared in The Living Shadow (April 1931); in this last disguise, he sometimes takes the place of the doddering old slow-witted, uncommunicative janitor who works at Police Headquarters in order to listen in on conversations and to look at evidence. For the first half of The Shadow's tenure in the pulps, his past and identity are ambiguous. In The Living Shadow, a thug claims to have seen the Shadow's face, and thought he saw \\"a piece of white that looked like a bandage.\\" In The Black Master and The Shadow's Shadow, the villains both see The Shadow's true face and remark that The Shadow is a man of many faces with no face of his own. It was not until the August 1937 issue, The Shadow Unmasks, that The Shadow's real name is revealed. In the radio drama, the Allard secret identity was dropped for simplicity's sake. On the radio, The Shadow was only Lamont Cranston; he had no other aliases or disguises. Is Cranston a villian?","completion":"Based on the quote from the article: \\"In the pulps, Cranston is a separate character; Allard frequently disguises himself as Cranston and adopts his identity (The Shadow Laughs, 1931).\\" Lamont Cranston is not a villain; he is a separate character whose identity is adopted by Kent Allard, aka The Shadow, when Cranston is away."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article that answers the following question: How many yards shorter was the only field goal than the game's opening kickoff?","completion":"Title: The Difference in Distance: Comparing a Field Goal and the Opening Kickoff Hey there, little friends! Today, we're going to learn about football and compare two exciting moments in a game – a field goal and an opening kickoff. We will find out how many yards shorter the only field goal in the game was than the game's opening kickoff. First, let's learn about these two moments: 1. Opening Kickoff: This is how a football game begins. One team kicks the ball to the other team, who tries to catch it and run as far as they can. The opening kickoff is usually a pretty long kick – around 60 to 70 yards. 2. Field Goal: This is a way to score points. A team will try to kick the football through a big \\"H\\" called the goalposts. Field goals are usually shorter than kickoffs, and they can be from 20 to 50 yards, depending on where the team is on the field. Now, to find out how many yards shorter the only field goal was than the game's opening kickoff, we need two pieces of information: A. The distance of the opening kickoff in yards B. The distance of the only field goal in yards Once we have these numbers, solving our mystery is simple: subtract the field goal's distance from the opening kickoff's distance like this: Opening Kickoff Distance (A) - Field Goal Distance (B) = Difference in Yards For example, if our opening kickoff was 65 yards and our field goal was 35 yards, we would find the difference like this: 65 (A) - 35 (B) = 30 yards shorter That means the field goal was 30 yards shorter than the opening kickoff! And there you have it, little friends! We've learned how to find the difference between the opening kickoff and the only field goal in a football game. Remember, when comparing distances, all you need is to know the lengths, and then subtract one from the other – it's as easy as 1, 2, 3!

Hayao Miyazaki name became prominent with Spitied Away, however what is often overlooked are director's first film efforts. Who remembers that Spielberg directed Duel or George Lucas directed THX 1138? I remember seeing fragments of this movie - almost certainly the last 45 minutes in late 80s and what stuck with me was the visual lushness of the design and animation. So when I found a copy in a well known store for £9 I couldn't resist but buy it. The odd thing is that the last 45 minutes of the movie do not tally with my memory of it (memory is funny that way). Viewing this movie now with all the gained knowledge of artists portfolios is how very like Jean 'Moebius' Giraud some of the artwork is. I can only assume some influence here. When Pazu catches a falling girl (Sheeta) his adventure really begins - the quest for Laputa - a reference to Jonathan Swift's overlooked portion of Gulliver's Travels. With healthy references to Jules Verne it's a basic good vs. bad chase movie with the final portion having the heroes end up on Laputa. This is the portion that is strongest in my memory - the 'pastoral' ecological aspect of Laputa returned to nature - the multitude of robots covered in moss beneath the giant tree. This is, in my opinion, the highlight of the movie - the views of the surface of Laputa, as opposed to the mechanised underground. Although this is the dichotomy of this movie - to show that even technology cannot overcome nature - the irony of the last robot tending the garden and animals. The ending of the movie Silent Running is almost exactly the same. It is incredibly stylish, I would not say 'slick' - very beautiful and organic and a tremendous amount of detail in the buildings, airships and the design and look of just about everything. Myazaki is a true master of this kind of Japnanese anime. Buy this movie and treasure it. Is the sentiment of this review positive or negative?","completion":"The sentiment of this review is positive. The reviewer appreciates the visual lushness, the influence of Moebius, and the references to classic literature.

Brian, who had traveled the world, met interesting people, and read countless books, could effortlessly launch into discussions on politics, culture, science, and more. Step 1: Introduce the reason for Samuel's limited conversational skills In this step, we establish that Samuel's lack of diverse experiences has hindered his ability to engage in various conversation topics in comparison to Brian. Step 2: Provide examples of Brian's experiences Here, we give specific instances – travelling, meeting people, and reading books – which contribute to Brian's extensive knowledge and ability to discuss a wide range of subjects. In an attempt to broaden his scope of knowledge, Samuel decided to follow a structured approach to learning. He would choose a subject each month, exhaustively read books and articles, watch documentaries, and engage with experts on that topic. Step 3: Detail Samuel's plan to improve his conversational skills This step describes the strategy that Samuel implements to expand his understanding of various subjects, ensuring he becomes more well-rounded and able to engage in different conversations. Throughout the following months, Samuel made substantial progress in gaining knowledge across diverse subjects. Slowly but surely, his confidence grew as he found himself able to contribute to discussions on topics ranging from history and philosophy to technology and environmental issues. Step 4: Show the progress and results of Samuel's dedication Here, we showcase Samuel's growth through his commitment to learning, highlighting how he's now able to be part of conversations he once found inaccessible.

Options: - tuna - eaten - rooster - cow - chopped The answer is \\"rooster\\" because The answer is:","completion":"\\"rooster\\" Step-by-step justification: 1. Firstly, let's understand the context of the question. The amateur is dealing with something related to chickens laying eggs. 2. Now, let's examine each of the options: a. Tuna: Tuna is a fish, and there is no direct correlation between a chicken laying eggs and the presence of a fish. b. Eaten: In the context of this question, 'eaten' doesn't make sense. Chickens don't lay eggs because they are eaten. c. Rooster: A rooster is a male chicken. While roosters don't impel hens to lay more eggs, they do play a role in fertilizing eggs and controlling the flock's social order. Therefore, a rooster is indirectly connected with the egg-laying process, and it seems to be the most fitting choice among the given options. d. Cow: Cows are unrelated to the egg-laying process of chickens, making this option invalid. e. Chopped: 'Chopped' is also unrelated to the context of the question and doesn't make sense as an answer. 3.

Yes Both sentences convey the same meaning, which is that Handspring shareholders will receive 0.09 shares of Palm, Inc. for each share of Handspring common stock they own. Despite slight differences in the wording, the core message remains consistent in each sentence. In the first sentence, it states that \\"Handspring shareholders will get 0.09 shares of the parent company, Palm, Inc., for each share of Handspring common stock they currently own.\\" Here, the parent company Palm, Inc. is mentioned explicitly, and the concept of \\"getting\\" the shares is used to describe the transaction. In the second sentence, it says that \\"Handspring's shareholders will receive 0.09 Palm shares (and no shares of PalmSource) for each share of Handspring common stock they own.\\" In this case, the focus is more on Palm shares rather than Palm, Inc. as a company, and it also clarifies that no shares of PalmSource will be given. However, the idea of \\"receiving\\" shares instead of \\"getting\\" shares is still essentially the same.

How to identify and care for lionhead goldfish<br>Check the fish you are preparing to buy, or if it is already in your tank, observe it. Lionhead goldfish have the following as physical traits : [substeps] Lionhead goldfish completely lack a stabilizing dorsal fin. If your fish has a dorsal fin, it is most certainly not a lionhead. Can we draw the following conclusion? Lionhead fish do not possess dorsal fins Choose from: (I). Yes; (II). It's impossible to say; (III). No;","completion":"I. Yes, we can draw the conclusion that lionhead fish do not possess dorsal fins based on the provided information. To provide more details on identifying and caring for lionhead goldfish, please see the guide below. 1. Identifying Lionhead Goldfish: Lionhead goldfish are relatively easy to identify because of their unique features. Here are some key characteristics to look for: a. As mentioned earlier, lionhead goldfish completely lack a stabilizing dorsal fin. b. They have a distinctive \\"hood\\" or \\"wen\\" that covers their head, giving them a lion-like appearance. This hood can vary in size and shape, but it appears as a fleshy growth and usually starts developing when the fish is around 3-4 months old. c. Their body shape is short, chubby, and deep, with a slightly arched back. d. They have a double caudal (tail) fin, which is large and flowing. 2. Caring for Your Lionhead Goldfish: Lionhead goldfish require proper care and a suitable environment to thrive. Follow these recommendations to ensure their well-being: a. Tank size: Lionhead goldfish grow relatively large (about 6 inches or 15 cm), and they produce a significant amount of waste. Therefore, it's essential to provide a spacious tank – at least 20-30 gallons for the first fish and 10 gallons for each additional lionhead goldfish. b. Filtration and water quality: Lionhead goldfish need clean water and an efficient filtration system. Ensure that your aquarium filter can process all the tank's water at least four times per hour. Maintain appropriate water parameters, including pH (6.0-8.0), temperature (65-75°F or 18-24°C), and avoid ammonia and nitrite spikes. c. Aeration: While goldfish can be somewhat adaptable to lower oxygen levels, it is essential to provide proper aeration in the tank. Use an air stone or an aquarium bubbler to ensure adequate oxygen exchange. d. Décor and substrate: Lionhead goldfish are generally poor swimmers because of their missing dorsal fin and rounded body shape. Keep the tank décor minimal, with plenty of open swimming spaces. Opt for a smooth substrate like sand or smooth gravel to prevent injury. e. Feeding: Feed your lionhead goldfish a balanced diet with specialized pellets and flakes specifically designed for goldfish. Occasionally offer them live or frozen foods like brine shrimp, daphnia, or bloodworms. Provide vegetables such as spinach, peas, or lettuce for extra nutrients. f. Tankmates: Choose tankmates carefully as lionhead goldfish are slow swimmers and can't compete for food with fast or aggressive fish. Suitable tankmates include other goldfish varieties like ranchu or bubble-eye goldfish. Avoid invertebrates, as the goldfish might prey on them. g. Regular maintenance: Clean the tank and perform 25-30% water changes at least every two weeks to maintain water quality. Periodically check and clean the filter as well. h. Monitoring health: Regularly observe your lionhead goldfish for signs of illness or injury, such as lethargy, loss of appetite, or abnormal behavior. Consult a veterinarian or aquatic specialist if you notice any symptoms. By following these guidelines, you'll optimize the health and happiness of your lionhead goldfish."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

A: The answer is:","completion":"A process that employs microorganisms to consume a pollutant is called \\"bioremediation.\\" Bioremediation is a natural, environmentally-friendly, and cost-effective method of mitigating and degrading various pollutants and waste materials present in the environment, such as soil, water, or air. The method harnesses the natural abilities of certain microorganisms to break down and convert pollutants into less harmful or non-toxic substances. Microorganisms such as bacteria, fungi, algae, and certain plants can degrade pollutants like heavy metals, pesticides, petroleum hydrocarbons, and other organic compounds. These microorganisms utilise the pollutants as a source of nutrients or energy, metabolizing them into simpler forms that are less hazardous to the environment and human health. Bioremediation can be classified into two main categories: 1. In-situ bioremediation: This method involves treating the contaminated site directly, without removing the pollutants or the contaminated materials. By employing techniques such as stimulating the growth of microorganisms in the polluted area, through the addition of nutrients or oxygen, or by introducing specific pollutant-degrading microorganisms, in-situ bioremediation can accelerate the natural degradation process. This approach has some advantages, such as minimal soil disruption, lower costs, and reduced risk for secondary pollution. 2. Ex-situ bioremediation: In this method, contaminated materials are physically removed and treated separately from the environment. Ex-situ bioremediation can be further classified into two subcategories: solid phase (e.g., landfarming, biopiles, and composting) and slurry phase (e.g., bioreactors and soil washing). Some of these techniques involve mechanically turning and aerating the contaminated soils, while others focus on treating the soil in a controlled system, such as a bioreactor, where optimal conditions for pollutant degradation can be maintained. Bioremediation has several advantages over other conventional remediation techniques, such as chemical treatments and physical removal, including: - Sustainability: Since bioremediation utilises naturally occurring processes, it has minimal negative impacts on the environment and typically results in more sustainable site rehabilitation. - Cost-effectiveness: Many bioremediation methods have lower operational and disposability costs compared to traditional remediation techniques. - Selectivity: Bioremediation can be tailored to target specific pollutants by choosing microorganisms with the appropriate metabolic capabilities, thus increasing the efficiency of pollution management. However, bioremediation is not without its challenges. Some factors, such as environmental conditions, pollutant type and concentration, and the presence of other toxic compounds, can limit the effectiveness of the bioremediation process. Additionally, it is not always feasible to eliminate all pollutants from the contaminated site completely. Despite these challenges, bioremediation remains an important tool in the fight against pollution and the restoration of polluted sites to a healthy, functional state."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Given the question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the last name of the band member that designed the cover of the 1983 album?, using the article: In 1982, Waters suggested a new musical project with the working title Spare Bricks, originally conceived as the soundtrack album for Pink Floyd – The Wall. With the onset of the Falklands War, Waters changed direction and began writing new material. He saw Margaret Thatcher's response to the invasion of the Falklands as jingoistic and unnecessary, and dedicated the album to his late father. Immediately arguments arose between Waters and Gilmour, who felt that the album should include all new material, rather than recycle songs passed over for The Wall. Waters felt that Gilmour had contributed little to the band's lyrical repertoire. Michael Kamen, a contributor to the orchestral arrangements of The Wall, mediated between the two, also performing the role traditionally occupied by the then-absent Wright. The tension within the band grew. Waters and Gilmour worked independently; however, Gilmour began to feel the strain, sometimes barely maintaining his composure. After a final confrontation, Gilmour's name disappeared from the credit list, reflecting what Waters felt was his lack of songwriting contributions.Though Mason's musical contributions were minimal, he stayed busy recording sound effects for an experimental Holophonic system to be used on the album. With marital problems of his own, he remained a distant figure. Pink Floyd did not use Thorgerson for the cover design, Waters choosing to design the cover himself. Released in March 1983, The Final Cut went straight to number one in the UK and number six in the US. Waters wrote all the lyrics, as well as all the music on the album. Gilmour did not have any material ready for the album and asked Waters to delay the recording until he could write some songs, but Waters refused. Gilmour later commented: \\"I'm certainly guilty at times of being lazy ... but he wasn't right about wanting to put some duff tracks on The Final Cut.\\" Rolling Stone magazine gave the album five stars, with Kurt Loder calling it \\"a superlative achievement ... art rock's crowning..., what would be the answer ?

It was recorded as Catemosse in 1277 and Chatmos in 1322. Moss is the local name for a peat bog.Daniel Defoe visited the area in 1724, on his way from Warrington to Manchester: From hence (Warrington), on the road to Manchester, we pass'd the great bog or waste call'd Chatmos, the first of that kind that we see in England ... The surface, at a distance, looks black and dirty, and is indeed frightful to think of, for it will bear neither horse or man, unless in an exceeding dry season, and then not so as to be passable, or that any one should travel over them ... What nature meant by such a useless production, 'tis hard to imagine; but the land is entirely waste, excep ... for the poor cottagers fuel, and the quantity used for that is very small. Peat bogs sometimes burst their boundaries, particularly after being subjected to heavy rainfall, and this seems to have happened with Chat Moss in the 16th century. John Leland, writing during the reign of King Henry VIII, described one such event: Chat Moss brast up within a mile of Mosley Haul, and destroied much grounde with mosse thereabout, and destroyed much fresh-water fishche thereabout, first corrupting with stinkinge water Glasebrooke, and so Glasebrooke carried stinkinge water and mosse into Mersey water, and Mersey corrupted carried the roulling mosse, part to the shores of Wales, part to the isle of Man, and some unto Ireland. Chat Moss presented a significant challenge to the engineers constructing the Liverpool and Manchester Railway in 1826 because of the difficulty in providing a solid base...

What is the answer to this question? when did the tomb of the unknown soldier start?","completion":"The Tomb of the Unknown Soldier refers to a monument dedicated to the unidentified servicemen who perished in the line of duty during wars. While there are several tombs of unknown soldiers worldwide, I shall focus on two of the most notable ones: the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in the United States and the Tomb of the Unknown Warrior in the United Kingdom. 1. Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, United States: Located in Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia, the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in the United States was established on November 11, 1921. The idea of honoring unidentified soldiers gained momentum in the aftermath of World War I, when a profound sense of grief and recognition of the sacrifice made by so many led to calls for a national memorial. In response to these sentiments, on March 4, 1921, the U.S. Congress approved the burial of an unidentified American soldier from World War I in the plaza of Arlington National Cemetery's new Memorial Amphitheater. An elaborate selection process was created to ensure that the chosen remains genuinely belonged to an unidentified soldier. The selected remains were transported to the United States aboard the USS Olympia, with the interment ceremony taking place on November 11, 1921, also known as Armistice Day (now observed as Veterans Day). Over time, the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier has come to represent the sacrifice of not only World War I unknowns but also unidentified soldiers from subsequent wars. Unknown soldiers from World War II and the Korean War were interred in the tomb on May 30, 1958. In 1984, the remains of an unknown soldier from the Vietnam War were also interred; however, in 1998, these remains were exhumed, identified through DNA testing as Air Force 1st Lt. Michael Joseph Blassie, and then reinterred in a cemetery in St. Louis, Missouri. Since then, the Vietnam crypt has remained empty as a symbol of those who were never identified. Since 1937, the tomb has been guarded around the clock by the tomb guards of the 3rd U.S. Infantry Regiment, also known as \\"The Old Guard.\\" 2. Tomb of the Unknown Warrior, United Kingdom: In the United Kingdom, the Tomb of the Unknown Warrior is located in Westminster Abbey, London. Inspired by Reverend David Railton, an army chaplain who saw a grave marked by a rough wooden cross bearing the inscription \\"An Unknown British Soldier,\\" the concept gained approval, and work began on selecting the unknown warrior. Similar to the process in the United States, the British military ensured the chosen remains were genuinely unidentified. On November 7, 1920, the remains were brought to England from France and interred on November 11, 1920, inside Westminster Abbey. The tomb has since become a revered symbol of remembrance and gratitude for the sacrifices made by all unidentified soldiers who fought in World War I and later conflicts. Since its establishment, several other Commonwealth nations have created similar monuments, making the Tomb of the Unknown Warrior a ubiquitous symbol of honor and appreciation. In summary, the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in the United States was established on November 11, 1921, while the Tomb of the Unknown Warrior in the United Kingdom was created slightly earlier on November 11, 1920. These monuments serve as solemn reminders of the sacrifices made by countless unidentified soldiers who fought and died for their nations during times of war."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

(CNN) -- The parents of a missing Missouri girl have refused to be interviewed separately by authorities, Kansas City police said Wednesday. But the attorney representing Jeremy Irwin and Deborah Bradley, parents of 11-month-old Lisa Irwin, said the couple is not opposed to separate interviews, but do not want what police requested -- an unrestricted interview with no attorneys present. \\"Being questioned separately is not the issue,\\" said attorney Cyndy Short. She said the couple has been cooperative and has previously been interviewed separately as well as together. They don't mind being interviewed separately as long as the detectives are fair, open-minded and non-accusatory, she said. Lisa was reported missing about 4 a.m. October 4, after her father, Jeremy Irwin, arrived home from work to find the door unlocked, the lights on and a window that had been tampered with. The girl's mother, Deborah Bradley, said she last saw Lisa at 6:40 p.m. the night before. Kansas City police Capt. Steve Young said Tuesday investigators had planned to conduct the separate parent interviews, but said Wednesday the couple had declined. Young said he did not dispute reports that the family had cooperated and answered questions, but the police department detectives still had unanswered questions. Meanwhile, Lisa's half-brothers, who were in the family's home the night she disappeared, will be re-interviewed by authorities on Friday, Kansas City police said Wednesday. The boys will be interviewed by a \\"child services specialist trained to interview kids,\\" Young said.

Here's a question: The car had its turn signal one, where was it stopped? Here are possible answers to this question: - neighbor's house - in phoenix - repair shop - sidewalk - street corner I believe the correct choice is \\"street corner\\", here's why:","completion":"The task involves determining the most likely place a car with its turn signal on would be stopped from the provided options: neighbor's house, in Phoenix, repair shop, sidewalk, and street corner. Let's analyze each option carefully. 1. Neighbor's House: While a car could potentially turn into a neighbor's driveway, the statement doesn't provide enough information to confirm that it was indeed stopped at a neighbor's house. 2. In Phoenix: This option provides a location but doesn't specify a spot where the car could be stopped. Generally, a city or town isn't specific enough to determine the stoppage position of a car with its turn signal on. 3. Repair Shop: The car might need to turn into a repair shop; however, again, the information doesn't directly suggest this is the case. 4. Sidewalk: Cars generally do not stop on sidewalks as it is not a legal or safe place for cars to be. It is designed for pedestrians. Therefore, this seems highly unlikely. 5. Street Corner: Comparatively, a car with its turn signal on is often either about to take a turn or already stopped at a turn. Street corners are common places for cars to be stopped, especially with turn signals on. This can be for reasons like waiting to safely enter into traffic, waiting for pedestrians to cross, or preparing to park. Therefore, given all the available options and the context of the question, the most plausible answer is indeed \\"street corner\\".

The convoys had apparently been spotted by U.S. satellites, traversing 3 of the mountain passes leading from the USSR. The story goes on to say the Soviet foreign minister had defiantly defended the invasion, and it soon becomes obvious that the Soviets are hoping to convert Iran to yet another Soviet satellite state. During this time frame Ruth also reveals to Jimmy she is pregnant, and wants to keep the baby. When Jimmy informs his parents his father reacts somewhat harshly; his mother tries to point out all the options available to them. Jimmy informs his parents that he & Ruth plan to get married and have the child. Jimmy works for a carpentry firm; it is not clear what Ruth works as. Michael, Jimmy's annoying younger brother, humiliates him in front of his sister Alison by mentioning the upcoming pregnancy, which provokes an angry reaction from both Jimmy and his mother.Soon after, the U.S. states it will send troops to Iran if the USSR doesn't cease its invasion. The Soviets apparently ignore the warning, and soon after U.S. paratroops go in near the Soviet base at Moshad in northern Iran. Hoping the USSR will back off, the British prime minister issues a statement of support for the U.S. action. Unfortunately the USSR ignores the international condemnation, and as Ruth & Jimmy's...

Question: Information: - The Nordic combined events have been contested at the Winter Olympic Games since 1924. The first competition involved 18 km cross-country skiing, followed by ski jumping. Whoever earned the most points from both competitions won the event. At the 1952 Winter Olympics, the ski jumping was held first, followed by 18 km cross-country skiing. The cross-country skiing portion was reduced to 15 km at the 1956 Winter Olympics. The ski jumping styles would change over the years as well, from the Kongsberger technique after World War I to the Daescher technique in the 1950s to the current V-style from 1985 onwards. The cross-country skiing technique would switch from classical to freestyle for all competitions beginning in 1985, but the biggest change would occur at the 1988 Winter Olympics in the scoring with the Gundersen method, meaning the 15 km cross country portion would go from an interval start race to a pursuit race, so that whoever crossed the finish line first won the event. The team event with a 3 x 10 km cross country relay started at the 1988 Winter Olympics, changing to the current 4 x 5 km cross-country relay at the 1998 Winter Olympics. The 7.5 km sprint event was added at the 2002 Winter Olympics. Nordic combined remains a men's only event as of the 2010 Winter Olympics. For the 2010 Winter Games, the 15 km Individual Gundersen which consisted of 2 jumps from the normal hill followed by 15 km cross country will be replaced by a 10 km individual normal hill event which will consist of one jump from the individual normal hill following by 10 km of cross country using the Gundersen system while the 7.5 km sprint will be replaced by the 10 km individual large hill event. - Geir Andersen ( born February 12 , 1964 ) is a Norwegian nordic combined skier who competed from 1983 to 1989 . He won three medals at the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships with one gold ( 1984 : 3 x 10 km team ) and two silvers ( 1985 : 15 km individual , 3 x 10 km team ) . Andersen also finished 10th in the individual event at the 1984 Winter Olympics in Sarajevo . He had six individual victories in his career from 1984 to 1985 . - Nordic combined is a winter sport in which athletes compete in cross-country skiing and ski jumping. Nordic combined at the Winter Olympics and the FIS Nordic Combined World Cup are ongoing. - The FIS Nordic Combined World Cup is a Nordic combined competition organized yearly by FIS, representing the highest level in international competition for this sport. It was first arranged for the 1983/84 season. Team event was first time held in 1999/00 season. The FIS race director is a Norwegian ex ski jumper and ex world record holder Lasse Ottesen. - A winter sport or winter activity is a recreational activity or sport which is played during cold weather months. Most such sports are variations of skiing, ice skating and sledding. Traditionally such sports were only played in cold areas during winter, but artificial snow and artificial ice allow more flexibility. Artificial ice can be used to provide ice rinks for ice skating, ice hockey and bandy in a milder climate. - The FIS Nordic World Ski Championships have been held in various numbers and types of events since 1925 for men and since 1954 for women. Championship events include nordic skiing's three disciplines: cross-country skiing, ski jumping, and nordic combined (the latter being a combination sport consisting of both cross-country and ski jumping). From 1924 to 1939, the World Championships were held every year, including the Winter Olympics. After World War II, the World Championships were held every four years from 1950 to 1982. Since 1985, the World Championships have been held in odd-numbered years. - Nordic skiing pertains to skiing disciplines that use equipment where the toe of the ski boot is fixed to the binding in a manner that allows the heel to rise off the ski, unlike Alpine skiing, where the boot is attached to the ski from toe to heel. Recreational disciplines include cross-country skiing and Telemark skiing. - Ski jumping is a form of Nordic skiing in which athletes descend a specially constructed takeoff ramp (known as the \\"inrun\\"), jump from the end of it (the \\"table\\") with as much power as they can generate, and \\"fly\\" as far as possible down a steeply sloped hill. Points are awarded for distance and style by five judges, with competition sanctioned by the International Ski Federation (FIS). To enable the athletes (who are known as \\"ski jumpers\\") to effectively glide such long distances and land safely, the skis they use are considerably wider and longer than their cross-country and alpine skiing counterparts. Ski jumping is predominantly a winter sport and has been part of the Winter Olympic Games since its inception in 1924 for men and since 2014 for women. Since 1954 it is possible to ski jump in summer on artificial surfaces made from plastic. Along with cross-country skiing, ski jumping is one of two sports which form the Nordic combined discipline. Holmenkollbakken in Oslo is the holy place of this sport, which is most popular in Austria, Germany, Finland, Japan, Norway, Poland and Slovenia.

The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) closely resembled severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in disease manifestation as rapidly progressive acute pneumonia with multi-organ dysfunction. Using monocyte-derived-dendritic cells (Mo-DCs), we discovered fundamental discrepancies in the outcome of MERS-CoV-and SARS-CoV-infection. First, MERS-CoV productively infected Mo-DCs while SARS-CoV-infection was abortive. Second, MERS-CoV induced significantly higher levels of IFN-γ, IP-10, IL-12, and RANTES expression than SARS-CoV. Third, MERS-CoV-infection induced higher surface expression of MHC class II (HLA-DR) and the co-stimulatory molecule CD86 than SARS-CoV-infection. Overall, our data suggests that the dendritic cell can serve as an important target of viral replication and a vehicle for dissemination.

(CNN) -- A Christian evangelical group said Thursday that a Bible school -- backed by American evangelist Franklin Graham -- was destroyed in the latest bombing raid to hit South Kordofan, an oil-rich Sudanese province that borders the newly created independent country of South Sudan. At least eight bombs were dropped in the area Wednesday during the school's first day of classes, according to a statement by Samaritan's Purse, Graham's Christian humanitarian group, which supports the school. Two bombs landed inside the compound -- located in the region's Nuba Mountains -- destroying two Heiban Bible College buildings and igniting grass fires across the area, the group said in a statement No injuries were reported. \\"It was a miracle that no one was injured,\\" the statement added. Graham, who has called on the international community to take out Sudan's air assets and establish a no-fly zone in the region, said in a statement Thursday that he blamed Sudan's air force for the strike. At least four churches have been destroyed since August, the group said. \\"We are deeply concerned for the welfare and lives of the people of South Kordofan and we condemn the bombing of churches and Christian facilities,\\" added Graham, son of the famed Rev. Billy Graham. More than 78,000 people have fled South Kordofan and Blue Nile states since August of last year after an armed rebellion took root, the United Nations reported. The Sudanese government is thought to have responded to the rebellion by conducting sustained air raids with the use of Russian-made Antonov bombers, which have raised concerns over civilian casualties.

Summarize this article: If you purchase a breastfeeding pillow before your baby arrives you can use it to provide relief from pains and discomforts during pregnancy. Tucking the breastfeeding pillow between bent knees during sleep offers lower back support. You can also tuck the pillow behind your back to help you stay on your side while sleeping. If you have pregnancy related heartburn, you can use an extra pillow to raise your head while sleeping. Tummy time is a routine in which a baby is placed on his tummy for a little bit each day. The purpose of tummy time is to strengthen a baby's neck muscles and teach him how to push, roll over, crawl, and stand. Breastfeeding pillows can be used to enhance tummy time. Most baby's sleep on their backs, in accordance to standards laid out by the American Academy of Pediatricians in 1992. This is to prevent sudden infant death syndrome. As babies spend so much time on their backs rather than their stomachs, tummy time can be stressful. Babies might resist being forced on their stomach. A breastfeeding pillow can help ease your baby into tummy time. Propping a baby up on a pillow can give him a new perspective and allow him to see more of a room. This can distract him from the discomfort of being on his belly, and prevent crying and distress during tummy time. Make sure you don't prop your baby up using a breastfeeding pillow before 3 or 4 months, as his neck muscles might not be strong enough for this to be safe until then. Breastfeeding pillows can be a great tool, but they do not work for every mother. Sometimes, a breastfeeding pillow can result in your baby having difficulty latching. Some babies do not take to breastfeeding and prefer to be held, resulting in them becoming fussy or difficult to nurse when using the pillow. Nursing pillows are bulky and can be difficult to take from place to place. Some others also report having to lean over the pillows and experiencing back aches because of this. Remember, a nursing pillow is designed to provide you added comfort. Some women find the pillow to be helpful to them and their babies, but if a breastfeeding pillow causes you discomfort it's not a necessity. Old fashioned breastfeeding is fine if you don't feel comfortable with a breastfeeding pillow. Summary:","completion":"Breastfeeding pillows can serve multiple purposes before and after your baby's birth. They can provide relief for pregnancy-related pains and discomfort, such as lower back support when sleeping, and can also be used for tummy time to strengthen a baby's neck muscles. However, the baby should only be propped on the pillow after 3-4 months. While the pillows can be convenient, they may not suit everyone, sometimes causing difficulties in baby latching and causing discomfort due to their bulkiness. Ultimately, using a breastfeeding pillow is not a necessity if it causes discomfort, and traditional breastfeeding methods can also be used."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The social networking firm is now targeting a time frame of April to June 2012 for an initial public offering, said people familiar with the matter. The company is exploring raising 10 billion in its IPO—what would be one of the largest offerings ever—in a deal that might assign Facebook a 100 billion valuation, a number greater than twice that of such stalwarts as Hewlett-Packard Co. and 3M Co. How much will Facebook be worth once it files for its anticipated-IPO? Facebook is exploring raising 10 billion in an IPO that could value Facebook at more than 100 billion, Spencer Ante reports on Markets Hub. Photo: Reuters. A Facebook IPO has been hotly anticipated for several years, and viewed as a defining moment for the latest Web investing boom. The company has been vague about whether it would even make such an offering and silent on timing of an IPO. \\"We're not going to participate in speculation about an IPO,\\" said Facebook spokesman Larry Yu. The company now appears poised to go ahead with a deal. But it will likely come to market at a time when investors are beginning to question the value of some newer Internet businesses. The most recent IPO, an 805 million float of discount-deal service Groupon Inc. on Nov. 3, has plummeted 42% in price in the past five trading days after surging in its first day of trading. Business-networking service LinkedIn Corp., whose stock more than doubled from its IPO price on its first day of trading May 19, has since fallen 36%, but remains 33% above its IPO. Enlarge Image Close Reuters CEO Mark Zuckerberg is said to be warming to the idea of an IPO. IPO: Go, No-Go? Initial public offerings aren't always good investments. Here's a look at some of the high-fliers and flame-outs of the Internet era View Interactive More photos and interactive graphics Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg has in the past publicly expressed reluctance to do an IPO. And he has opted to keep Facebook private longer than many suspected he would. But he is warming to the idea. Facebook is now in internal discussions over the timing of its filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and is considering filing dates as early as this year, said these people. Mr. Zuckerberg hasn't made any final decisions, these people cautioned. Facebook remains aloof from Wall Street and shows signs of wanting to play by its own rules. Companies often explore an IPO once they have 100 million in revenue. Facebook is expected to debut with more than 4 billion in revenue, making it bigger than Web veteran Yahoo Inc. Facebook has gone so far as to craft its own prospectus, said the people familiar with the matter. A prospectus document—which is filed with the SEC outlining the company's business—is typically prepared by bankers and lawyers hired by a company. Facebook Chief Financial Officer David Ebersman has been leading the company's talks with Silicon Valley bankers about an IPO, said people familiar with the matter. Bankers are aggressively pursuing the company, but Facebook remains elusive about a commitment to specific banks, even though an IPO looms. Mr. Ebersman told some bankers that he is skeptical over what contribution investment banks could make to a Facebook IPO, since the company is so highly sought after by major investors, said people familiar with the matter. The social network, which was started by Mr. Zuckerberg in 2004 out of his Harvard University dorm room, has led the way in reshaping how people share information and interact with others on the Web. It now counts 800 million users, with 500 million users logging into the site daily. Facebook will be required to make its financial information public by April, because the company will cross the 500-shareholder limit by the end of this year. The SEC requires companies with more than 500 shareholders to publicly disclose its financial information. Facebook's Growing Ambitions See key dates in the history of the social network. View Interactive Facebook could publish its financial information come April without an IPO, but board members and top executives have privately acknowledged that it would leave the company at a severe disadvantage, since they would have most of the liability that comes with being a public company, but lose out on the fundraising benefits of a public offering, said these people. Only 13 IPOs have ever been completed with a value greater than 10 billion, and just three of those have been for U.S. companies, according to Dealogic, which tracks new securities issues. The only U.S. issuers at that size level have been Visa Inc. at 19.7 billion in 2008; General Motors Co. at 18.1 billion in 2010; and AT&T Wireless Services Inc. at 10.6 billion in 2000. The most valuable company ever to go public was Industrial & Commercial Bank of China, which sold 21.9 billion of stock in October 2006 and finished its first day of trading with a market value of 148 billion, Dealogic said. A Facebook offering of 10 billion would be the largest IPO by any technology or Internet company. The largest U.S. Internet IPO, the 1.9 billion sale in 2004 by Google Inc. which valued Google at 23 billion, ranks No. 3 among global Internet IPOs. Facebook's revenue is driven by its online advertising business, as big brands rush to the site to interact with consumers through display ads and fan pages. Facebook's world-wide ad revenue is expected to hit 3.8 billion this year, up from 1.86 billion a year earlier, according to data compiled by eMarketer. Facebook's share of display ad revenue in the US is expected to grow to 16.3% in 2011 and 19.5% in 2012, eMarketer found. —Randall Smith contributed to this article.

The stock closed Monday at 15.24, far below the 20 price at which it sold shares to investors earlier this month. Earlier this month, Facebook co-Founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg said on a PBS interview with Charlie Rose that indeed, his company was planning an IPO, but that the company hadn't yet decided when. Zuckerberg also said that an IPO isn't something he spent \\"a lot of time on a day-to-day basis thinking about.\\" \\"We've made this implicit promise to our investors and to our employees that by compensating them with equity and by giving them equity, that at some point we're going to make that equity worth something publicly and liquidly, in a liquid way,\\" he said. \\"Now, the promise isn't that we're going to do it on any kind of short-term time horizon. The promise is that we're going to build this company so that it's great over the long term, right. And that we're always making these decisions for the long term, but at some point we'll do that.\\" RELATED: Facebook close to privacy settlement with FTC Mark Zuckerberg says Steve Jobs advised him on Facebook Zuckerberg: If I started Facebook today, I would stay in Boston -- Nathan Olivarez-Giles Twitter.com/nateog Photo: Facebook co-founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg walks around Harvard University in Cambridge on Nov. 7, 2011.

This decision was made after carefully considering the effectiveness, efficiency, and practicality of both methods. The sift, which is a simple tool consisting of a mesh screen supported by a frame, was chosen for its ability to provide a more precise and hands-on approach to filtering the sand. Additionally, using the sift allowed for better control over the process, enabling the filtering to be done more gently and preserving the sand's natural qualities. On the other hand, the complexity and bulkiness of the machine made it difficult to operate and maneuver in the specific location where the sand needed to be filtered. The machine's unwieldiness also increased the risk of damaging the surrounding environment, which was an essential factor to consider in this particular sand-filtering mission. Furthermore, the sift's lower cost and maintenance requirements were highly appealing when compared to the more expensive and sophisticated machine. The sift's simplicity also meant that it could be more easily transported to the sand-filtering site and stored when not in use, making it a more convenient tool for the task at hand. However, it's worth mentioning that there are specific situations where the machine might be the better choice for sand filtering. For instance, in large-scale operations requiring the rapid filtering of vast amounts of sand, the increased speed and efficiency of the machine might outweigh its unwieldy nature. Additionally, the machine might be better suited to locations with limited access to manual labor or where the sand's natural qualities aren't a priority. In conclusion, the sand was filtered using the sift instead of the machine because of its simplicity, cost-effectiveness, and superiority in preserving the sand's natural qualities. It also provided better control over the process and reduced the risk of environmental damage. While the machine does have its benefits in certain scenarios, its unwieldy nature ultimately made it a less practical choice in this case."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Something I could tell my friends about. What I didn't know was how moved I would be by the whole experience,” Timberlake wrote on his official site yesterday. He describes his date, Corporal Kelsey DeSantis, as “so humble and honest... Very cool.\\" \\"She also simultaneously seemed like she was nervous about the whole evening and if I was going to enjoy myself,\\" he continues. \\"I have to tell you, it's not every day that I meet a 23 year old girl and she's more worried about if I'm having fun or if I'm comfortable! It hit me all of a sudden that these were the type of people that look after us and our freedom... Humble, concerned for others before themselves.” The whole entry is worth a read. As for DeSantis’ reaction? Fox News reports that she tweeted, “The ball was epic! Had a wonderful time.” (For those of you concerned Mila Kunis was going to skip out on her own ball date, New York reports she's attending hers on Friday.) Expand this summary.","completion":"Pop singer and actor Justin Timberlake not only had the honor of attending the Marine Corps Ball, but he was also moved by the experience to such an extent that he shared a heartfelt tribute on his official website. Known for his chart-topping music and impressive acting abilities, Timberlake added another dimension to his public persona by displaying sincere appreciation for the US Marines and the values they embody. The event took place on Saturday night and was highlighted by Timberlake's heartfelt tribute that, surprisingly, even touched the notoriously cynical editors at Gawker. As he attended the gala, Timberlake found himself deeply moved by the whole event. Despite expecting it to be an evening he wouldn't soon forget, the magnitude of the impact took him by surprise. He had anticipated having a wonderful time and accumulating some great stories to tell his friends. However, it turned out to be far more profound than that. Timberlake, in his detailed account, gave particular emphasis to his date, Corporal Kelsey DeSantis. The young Marine struck him as being incredibly humble and honest, traits he highly appreciated. He described her as being 'very cool', but also noted her apprehension about the night. Intriguingly, despite being in the company of a mega celebrity, she was more concerned about whether Timberlake was enjoying himself and feeling comfortable. Observing this care and selflessness, the singer was struck by the realization that these were the same sort of individuals who safeguard American freedom. He was touched by their humility and their propensity to place the welfare of others above their own. Timberlake encouraged his fans and followers to read the entire account, citing its emotional depth and inspirational value. Corporal DeSantis responded to Timberlake's tribute by expressing her delight about the night. Fox News reported that she took to Twitter to state, “The ball was epic! Had a wonderful time.” In a relate update, fans were also concerned about actress Mila Kunis' promise of attending her own Marine Corps Ball date. New York confirmed that she had plans to attend hers the following Friday. The news considerably allayed fans who were worried she might not be able to make it. In conclusion, the star-studded event not only served as a memorable night for the attendees but also shed light on the humility and selflessness of the marines. Timberlake's tribute painted a profound picture of these brave individuals, offering the public a different perspective on these often-underappreciated heroes. Through this, the singer used his platform to foster greater understanding and appreciation for the people who devote their lives to safeguarding the freedoms we often take for granted."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Sara's mother died when she was very young, and she has to leave her beloved childhood home and friends when her father volunteers to fight for the British as an officer in World War I. He enrolls her at a girls' boarding school in New York, and instructs the headmistress Miss Minchin (Eleanor Bron) to spare no expense making sure his daughter will be comfortable while he is away. He has reserved her the school's largest suite, and gives Sara a specially-made French doll named Emily telling her that if she wants to talk to him, just speak to Emily and he will hear it. Though she finds the strict rules and Miss Minchin's harsh attitude stifling, Sara becomes popular among the girls, including the scullery maid Becky (Vanessa Lee Chester), for her kindness and strong sense of imagination. She writes constant letters to her father, which are a great source of happiness for him on the battlefields of Europe. Due to a body being misidentified, Captain Crewe is declared dead when he is actually seriously injured and suffering from amnesia, and the British government seizes his company and assets. When Miss Minchin hears the news, she is in the middle of throwing a lavish party for Sara, hoping to extort more money from her father.

However, there were overseers and other individuals who assisted in the management of the plantation throughout Jefferson's life. One of the most notable overseers was Edmund Bacon, who worked at Monticello from 1806 to 1822. Jefferson was a hands-on owner and paid close attention to the plantation's operations, which included growing various crops, maintaining the estate, and overseeing his many enslaved workers. These enslaved workers contributed significantly to the management and maintenance of the estate, working in the fields, tending to animals, and performing various skilled labor tasks such as blacksmithing and woodworking. Enslaved individuals who held positions of responsibility on the plantation include Ishmael, who oversaw agricultural activities, and head gardener Wormley Hughes.

I suppose it's one of those films that is intensely intelligent...so intelligent that I think you need to be well versed in the oil industry and a politically brilliant mind. I don't consider myself unintelligent, I've been studying politics since my early teens and I enjoy an intelligent film but for the most part unless it's a documentary films are meant to be primarily entertaining as well as have a message. Syriana tried to be strictly intelligent and it does turn some people away. I would even go so far as to say that those who rave about it and insist it's a 10/10 are lying because they think they look better. This film was the most confusing, senseless, mindless dribble I have seen in awhile...Especially considering the critical acclaim, the Oscar nods, and the cast. Screenplay writer Stephen Gaghan has disappointed me yet again. His horribly written Havoc preceded this film and I think he's just trying way too hard. I can't believe he was offered the opportunity to write the Da Vinci Code screenplay. On top of that Gaghan directed the film which made it an absolute mess. I had no idea who anyone was, why things were happening, who was who and what was what. It was a disaster. Because I don't really know who anyone was I can only mention the actors and what I thought of their performances because despite the horrendously complicated script the actors did alright. George Clooney plays C.I.A. field agent and assassin I think?? Bob Barnes. Clooney has never been a favorite of mine but lately he's managed to churn out some decent performances and this seemed to be a pretty good performance on his part. Barnes was a complex character with a sordid history and if I knew what was going on with him I would have really enjoyed his character. Matt Damon plays Bryan Woodman and he is rather bland and always looks like a deer in the headlights which I can understand his confusion after reading this script and then trying to perform it. Amanda Peet plays his wife and she does well in the few scenes she is given. Christopher Plummer makes a cameo appearance as someone doing something. I like Plummer and love seeing him show up even if he doesn't get top billing anymore. The cast is intense if only the story made sense. I'd like to exact quote the description of plot on IMDb. \\"A missile disappears in Iran, but the CIA has other problems: the heir to an Emirate gives an oil contract to China, cutting out a US company that promptly fires its immigrant workers and merges with a small firm that has landed a Kazakhstani oil contract.

The victory at Gleneagles, where Europe won 16 1/2 to 11 1/2, marked their eighth triumph in the past ten attempts. Despite this recent success, in the grand scheme of the Ryder Cup history, the United States holds the overall lead. Europe trails with 12 victories compared to America's 25, highlighting that there is still much work to be done for Europe to close this gap. In fact, it was this very divide that captain Paul McGinley employed as a motivating factor for his team during the week. He presented a graphic that showed the stark contrast between the number of victories for each side. Through this, McGinley sought to inspire his team to not let their guard down, and to keep pushing further to equalize the records and eradicate the disparity. As Rory McIlroy played a significant role in Europe's spectacular win at the Ryder Cup, he remains adamant that this golfing event will continue to be a major sporting spectacle between two very competitive teams. It's this intense competition and rivalry that fuels the desire of both sides to perform at their best. The Northern Irishman acknowledges that Europe has had the upper hand over the United States in the past few years; however, this doesn't mean that the US won't stage a strong comeback and secure a few victories over the next five to six years. The Ryder Cup is an incredible showcase of talent, skill, and sportsmanship between two powerhouse teams: Europe and the United States. Although Europe has seen more success recently, the US should not be underestimated as they strive to regain their position atop golf's most celebrated team event.

Retreating to the farmyard, the mouse declared the warning, \\"There is a mouse trap in the house, there is a mouse trap in the house.\\" The chicken clucked and scratched, raised her head and said, \\"Mr Mouse, I can tell you this is a grave concern to you, but it is of no consequence to me, I cannot be bothered by it.\\" The mouse turned to the pig and told him, \\"There is a mouse trap in the house.\\" \\"I am so sorry, Mr Mouse,\\" sympathized the pig, \\"but there is nothing I can do about it but pray; be assured that you are in my prayers.\\" The mouse turned to the cow, who replied, \\"A mouse trap, am I in grave danger, huh?\\" So the mouse returned to the house, head down and depressed to face the farmer's mouse trap alone. That very night a sound was heard throughout the house, like the sound of a mouse trap catching its prey. The farmer's wife rushed to see what was caught. In the darkness, she did not see that it was an evil snake whose tail the trap had caught. The snake bit the farmer's wife. The farmer rushed her to the hospital. She returned home with a fever. Now everyone knew to treat a fever with fresh chicken soup, so the farmer took his hatchet to the farmyard for the soup's main _ . His wife's sickness continued so that friends and neighbors came to sit with her around the clock. To feed them, the farmer butchered the pig. The farmer's wife did not get well, in fact, she died, and so many people came for her funeral. The farmer had the cow slaughtered to provide meat for all of them to eat.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. You've been told a trillion times not to buy produce out of season. But that doesn't mean you have to skip the fruits you love this time of year. It's just a matter of knowing which version is the healthiest and tastiest. \\"In the winter, frozen or dried options may have a leg up over fresh when it comes to flavor and nutrition,\\" says Elizabeth Somer, R.D., author of \\"Eat Your Way Sexy\\". In other cases, fresh is still the way to go. Here's your guide to making the best picks now. Blueberries. Buy 'em: Frozen. Frozen blueberries are typically the petite wild version, which have been found by scientists to contain more disease-thwarting antioxidants than their traditionally cultivated counterparts (the type you're most likely to find fresh right now). Also, fresh blueberries are pricey in winter and, if trucked in from afar, can go moldy fast. Health.com: The best superfoods for weight loss. Apples. Buy 'em: Fresh. Apples are a top-notch source of quercetin, an antioxidant shown to slash the risk for certain cancers. And quercetin levels in a fresh apple hold up even if it was picked months ago and put into cold storage until the winter, a \\"Nutrition Journal\\" study suggests. Nearly all of the fruit's quercetin and half its fiber is found in the peel -- which you'll get with fresh apples but usually not with dried. (Opt for certified organic, if possible, to avoid pesticides on the fruit's exterior.) Health.com: 10 healthy apple pie and cake recipes. Peaches. Buy 'em: Frozen. When it comes to juicy goodness, winter peaches from South America are mere shadows of the fresh, locally sourced summer version. They're also about twice the price. They're not as good for you, either: \\"Peaches can lose a considerable amount of their nutrients, including potassium, during multi-country shipping,\\" says Cynthia Sass, R.D., author of \\"Cinch! Conquer Cravings, Drop Pounds and Lose Inches\\". Frozen peaches, on the other hand, are harvested at peak ripeness and quickly flash-frozen to lock in vitamins, antioxidants, and flavor. Health.com: Vitamins: what to take, what to skip. Strawberries. Buy 'em: Fresh. Fresh or frozen, strawberries are a leading source of vitamin C, but let's face it: The texture of frozen strawberries leaves something to be desired. What's more, compared to other berries, fresh strawberries remain reasonably priced throughout the winter. Consider splurging on organic, though, since conventionally grown strawberries contain some of the highest pesticide levels of any fruit, according to the Environmental Working Group. Health.com: 11 things it's best to buy organic. Plums. Buy 'em: Dried. By the time winter plums find their way to the U.S. (from as far away as South America) and potentially sit on store shelves for days, they often have yucky soft spots. Meanwhile, ounce for ounce, dried plums (you know them as prunes) pack five times the fiber and vitamin K -- a nutrient necessary for proper blood clotting -- as the fresh kind. Eating prunes can also bolster bone strength, researchers at Florida State University have found. Health.com: Foods for healthy bones. Cherries. Buy 'em: Dried. Sweet Bing cherries are highly susceptible to bruising during international winter shipping, and your wallet may be bruised by their high winter price. They also lag behind tart cherries -- the version most often found dried -- in levels of vitamin C and beta-carotene. \\"Beta-carotene is a building block for vitamin A, so it helps maintain healthy skin, bones, and immunity,\\" Somer says. Removing the moisture also makes dried tart cherries particularly concentrated in anthocyanins, which are potent antioxidants, she adds.

Article: The state Supreme Court ruled Tuesday that documents and journals belonging to Sandy Hook Elementary School shooter Adam Lanza will be released to the public, a key victory in the Hartford Courant’s five-year battle to obtain the information. The Courant requested access to the documents that state police removed from the Yogananda Street home in Newtown where Lanza killed his mother Nancy Lanza before driving to the school and killing 26 people, including 20 first graders, before killing himself. In a unanimous decision, the court ordered a lower court judge to reverse himself and deny the state’s appeal of a Freedom of Information Commission decision that ordered the items released. “Since the day of the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School, the Courant has worked to advance the understanding of how so heinous a tragedy could happen and we applaud today’s decision as we feel these documents are necessary for us to tell a complete story in our reporting,” said Andrew Julien, the Courant’s publisher and editor-in-chief. “Understanding what a mass killer was thinking not only paints a clearer picture of the individual, it helps us identify and understand red flags that could be part of a prevention formula for future mass shootings.” The state attorney general’s office declined comment Tuesday. The state could ask the Connecticut Supreme Court to reconsider or ask the U.S. Supreme Court to hear the case. The court rejected several arguments the attorney general’s office made to keep the records sealed, including that the documents seized were the property of the judicial department, were the private property of Nancy and Adam Lanza and shouldn’t be considered public documents because they were seized through a search warrant and never used as evidence in a criminal case. Among the documents to which the newspaper sought access were a spreadsheet that Lanza kept on his computer of other mass killers going back to at least the 1970s, journals that he wrote, and other items removed from his bedroom during a second search of the house in the days following the Dec, 14, 2012, massacre. Supreme Court Justices Grill Attorneys In Sandy Hook Records Case » The records were described in a state police report released a year after the school shooting. The Courant requested access to the records under the state's Freedom of Information Act, but police declined to release them. The newspaper filed a complaint with the Freedom of Information Commission and won, but the state police appealed to Superior Court, where Judge Carl J. Schuman overruled the commission, setting up the Supreme Court battle. Gunman Kills 26 At Sandy Hook School In Newtown » In oral arguments before the court last March, an assistant attorney general representing the state police urged the court to keep the records secret, asking the justices to uphold the ruling of a Superior Court judge who declared the material was private property exempt from the disclosure mandates of Connecticut's public-records laws. Assistant Attorney General Steven Barry told the justices that state laws governing seized evidence establish strict protocols for handling property taken involuntarily by search warrant, and said the legislature could not have intended the public to have \\"unfettered access\\" to the property, even when not used in a criminal action. In addition to the spreadsheet and booklet, police seized hand-drawn comics, school records and a screenplay featuring a relationship between a 10-year-old boy and a 30-year-old man. Lanza Had Arsenal Of Guns, Ammunition, Swords, Knives » The legal question for the justices turned on whether the state's search-and-seizure laws supersede the Freedom of Information Act. But there was a practical element as well, with The Courant arguing that release of the records could help the public understand the ruthless attack on the elementary school, and the state police arguing that a ruling in The Courant's favor could expose financial records or a private diary. During arguments in the case, several justices challenged Barry's assertion that the laws covering search warrants were in conflict with the Freedom of Information Act and in his written opinion Justice Raheem L. Mullins said the law was silent on the issue. “The trial court pointed to nothing in the express terms of the search and seizure statutes that creates confidentiality in the documents or otherwise limits the disclosure, copying, or distribution of the documents,” Mullins wrote. “Indeed, the search and seizure statutes are silent on the issues of confidentiality, copying, or disclosure to the public.” The court also rejected the argument that the documents were private property and should not be disclosed since they were seized from the Lanza home. “Even if we agree with the trial court that the search and seizure statutes protect the ownership rights of the people whose property has been seized, we cannot conclude that a statutory scheme requiring that property be returned to its owners creates a duty of confidentiality for those items or otherwise limits public disclosure,” Mullins wrote. State police declined to release the documents, arguing that statutes covering search warrants treat the material as private property that may be used only for limited law-enforcement purposes. On that basis, the police pointed to a portion of the Freedom of Information Act that makes records subject to disclosure unless \\"otherwise provided by any federal law or state statute.\\" Uncredited / ASSOCIATED PRESS A photo of Adam Lanza's bedroom where state police recovered journals, computer records and other documents that have never been released to the public. A photo of Adam Lanza's bedroom where state police recovered journals, computer records and other documents that have never been released to the public. (Uncredited / ASSOCIATED PRESS) The Freedom of Information Commission rejected that argument, concluding that records may be withheld under that provision only if a competing federal or state law explicitly provides for the confidentiality of the records. But that analysis was rejected in turn by Schuman, setting the stage for the Supreme Court to resolve the dispute over what exactly the phrase \\"otherwise provided\\" means under Connecticut law. ||||| FILE - In this Dec. 18, 2012, file photo, a police cruiser sits in the driveway of the home of Nancy Lanza in Newtown, Conn., the Colonial-style house where she had lived with her son Adam Lanza.

Some... (Associated Press) HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) — Some of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooter's personal belongings, including personal journals containing stories about hurting children and a spreadsheet ranking mass murders, must be released to the public because they are not exempt from open record laws, the Connecticut Supreme Court ruled Tuesday. Thousands of documents already have been released from the investigation that ended without determining a motive for the massacre of 20 first-graders and six educators at Sandy Hook Elementary School on Dec. 14, 2012, but the writings could provide insights into the thinking of the shooter, Adam Lanza. The Hartford Courant and other media organizations requested to view Lanza's belongings, which were seized by authorities during a search of Lanza's home and described in a state police report released about a year after the shooting. State police rejected the requests, citing privacy rights in the state's search and seizure law. The Courant appealed to the state Freedom of Information Commission, which in 2015 ordered state police to release the documents. But Superior Court Judge Carl Schuman overruled the commission in 2016 — a decision overturned Tuesday in the 5-0 Supreme Court ruling. \\"We feel these documents are necessary to tell a complete story in our reporting,\\" said Andrew Julien, publisher and editor-in-chief of the Courant. \\"Understanding what a mass killer was thinking not only paints a clearer picture of the individual, it helps us identify and understand red flags that could be part of a prevention formula for future mass shootings.\\" It's not immediately clear when the 35 requested items will be released. The state attorney general's office, which represents state police and declined to comment Tuesday, could ask the Supreme Court to reconsider its ruling or possibly appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. State police officials did not return messages seeking comment. Among the disputed documents are a spreadsheet ranking mass murders by name and number killed and a notebook titled \\"The Big Book of Granny.\\" The notebook contains a story that Lanza wrote in the fifth grade about a woman who uses her \\"rifle cane\\" to kill people. Police also so far have not released an eight-page document titled simply, \\"me,\\" which was described in a police inventory as \\"detailing relationships, ideal companion, culture, voting, personal beliefs, describes doctors touching children as rape.\\" Another, named \\"tomorrow,\\" apparently contains details about the author's \\"desires, list of the benefits of being thin and negative connotations associated with being overweight, list of goals ...\\". Some of the other requested items include a folder containing hand-drawn, comic-style pictures and stories about Pokemon-type characters; a packet of educational materials from the Sandy Hook school to Lanza's mother including report cards and an educational plan addressing his mental health issues; a list of problems and requests from Lanza to his mother; and a story about a relationship between a 10-year-old boy and a 20-year-old man. A report by the Connecticut child advocate said Lanza's severe and deteriorating mental health problems, his preoccupation with violence and access to his mother's weapons \\"proved a recipe for mass murder.\\" Lanza's medical and school records included references to diagnoses of autism spectrum disorder, anxiety and obsessive compulsive disorder, the child advocate's office said. The 2014 report said Nancy Lanza backed her son's resistance to medication and from the 10th grade on kept him at home, where he was surrounded by an arsenal of firearms and spent long hours playing violent video games. In Tuesday's court decision, Justice Raheem Mullins wrote that the court must \\"narrowly construe\\" language in state law that allows exceptions to public disclosure, and that \\"otherwise any statute governing an agency's general treatment of records becomes a possible restriction on disclosure.\\" \\"The trial court pointed to nothing in the express terms of the search and seizure statutes that creates confidentiality in the documents or otherwise limits the disclosure, copying, or distribution of the documents,\\" wrote Mullins. \\"Indeed, the search and seizure statutes are silent on the issues of confidentiality, copying, or disclosure to the public.\\" |||||Summary:","completion":"The Connecticut Supreme Court ruled that documents and journals belonging to Sandy Hook Elementary School shooter Adam Lanza will be released to the public.

Question: Information: - Post-hardcore is a punk rock music genre that derives from hardcore punk, maintaining hardcore's aggression and intensity, but emphasizes a greater degree of creative expression initially inspired by post-punk and noise rock. Like post-punk, the term has been applied to a broad constellation of groups. The genre took shape in the mid to late 1980s with releases by bands from cities that had established hardcore scenes, such as Fugazi from Washington, D.C. as well as groups such as Big Black and Jawbox that stuck closer to post-hardcore's noise rock roots. - Q and Not U was a post-hardcore band from Washington, D.C., signed to Dischord Records. Members John Davis, Harris Klahr, Christopher Richards, and Matt Borlik formed the band in 1998. After Borlik's departure following the release of their first album, the band went on to record two more critically acclaimed LPs as a three-piece, exploring aspects of dance-punk, and other disparate musical styles. Q and Not U disbanded in September 2005 after completing their touring commitments and a short farewell stand at Washington, D.C. venue The Black Cat. - Dance-punk (also known as disco-punk or punk funk) is a music genre that emerged in the late 1970s, and is closely associated with the post-punk and new wave movements. - Power was the 3rd and final album by Q and Not U. It was released on October 5 , 2004 . After touring in support of the album , the group disbanded in September 2005 . The album was co-produced by Pete Cafarella and Rafael Cohen ( of Supersystem ) . All tracking was done at The Love Story in Brooklyn , NY . The album was mixed with Don Zientara at Inner Ear Studio and mastered by Chad Clark at Silver Sonya . - Albums of recorded music were developed in the early 20th century, first as books of individual 78rpm records, then from 1948 as vinyl LP records played at rpm. Vinyl LPs are still issued, though in the 21st century album sales have mostly focused on compact disc (CD) and MP3 formats. The audio cassette was a format used from the late 1970s through to the 1990s alongside vinyl. - Dischord Records is a Washington, D.C.-based independent record label specializing in the independent punk rock music of the D.C.-area music scene. The label is co-owned by Ian MacKaye and Jeff Nelson, who founded Dischord in 1980 to release \\"Minor Disturbance\\" by The Teen Idles. Along with other independent American labels such as Twin/Tone, Touch and Go Records, and SST Records, Dischord helped to spearhead the nationwide network of underground bands that formed the pre-Nirvana indie-rock scene. These labels presided over the shift from the hardcore punk that then dominated the American underground scene to the more diverse styles of alternative rock that were emerging. - The LP (from \\"long playing\\" or \\"long play\\") is an analog sound storage medium, a vinyl record format characterized by a speed of rpm, a 12 or 10 inch (30 or 25 cm) diameter, and use of the \\"microgroove\\" groove specification. Introduced by Columbia in 1948, it was soon adopted as a new standard by the entire record industry. Apart from a few relatively minor refinements and the important later addition of stereophonic sound, it has remained the standard format for vinyl albums. - MPEG-1 and/or MPEG-2 Audio Layer III, more commonly referred to as MP3, is an audio coding format for digital audio which uses a form of lossy data compression. It is a common audio format for consumer audio streaming or storage, as well as a de facto standard of digital audio compression for the transfer and playback of music on most digital audio players and computing devices. - A book is a set of written, printed, illustrated, or blank sheets, made of paper, parchment, or other materials, fastened together to hinge at one side, with text and/or images printed in ink. A single sheet within a book is a leaf, and each side of a leaf is a page. A set of text-filled or illustrated pages produced in electronic format is known as an electronic book, or e-book. - Compact disc (CD) is a digital optical disc data storage format released in 1982 and co-developed by Philips and Sony. The format was originally developed to store and play only sound recordings but was later adapted for storage of data (CD-ROM). Several other formats were further derived from these, including write-once audio and data storage (CD-R), rewritable media (CD-RW), Video Compact Disc (VCD), Super Video Compact Disc (SVCD), Photo CD, PictureCD, CD-i, and Enhanced Music CD. Audio CD players have been commercially available since October 1982, when the first commercially available CD player was released in Japan.

Please answer the following question: In recent weeks, the investigation into possible collusion between President Donald Trump’s presidential campaign and Russia has intensified, raising the prospect that the probe could become an issue in advance of the November midterm congressional elections. Former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort made another appearance in federal court in Washington Wednesday, where he pleaded not guilty to the latest round of charges brought by special counsel Robert Mueller. Last week, Rick Gates, Manafort’s former deputy, pleaded guilty to lying to prosecutors and is now cooperating with the investigation. In mid-February, 13 Russians were indicted in connection with election meddling, which deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein described as an effort to “promote discord in the United States and undermine public confidence in democracy. We must not allow them to succeed.” Congressional inquiries also continue. Hope Hicks, the White House communications director and a longtime Trump aide, was the latest figure to testify before a congressional committee on the Russia probe. Hicks declined to answer some questions before a closed session of the House Intelligence Committee, frustrating several Democrats. “This is not executive privilege. This is executive stonewalling,” said ranking committee Democrat Rep. Adam Schiff. But there was more pushback from the White House this week. President Trump fired off a series of tweets dismissing the probe as a “WITCH HUNT.” “They have had this phony cloud over this administration, over our government,” Trump told reporters at the White House last month. “And it has hurt our government, it does hurt our government. It is a Democrat hoax.” Democrats reject that view, including Sen. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee. “I continue to believe that this is the most important thing that I will work on in my whole public career, and getting the whole truth out is extraordinarily important,” he said. Warner’s committee is also investigating possible... What did Trump think of Sen. Mark Warner the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee? A.

The jealousy of other people’s better houses, Make this lower case.","completion":"The jealousy of other people's better houses, Lower case version: \\"the jealousy of other people's better houses,\\" To provide a detailed explanation, capitalization is one of the fundamental aspects of writing in English. Rules for using capitalization in English can be simple but a bit tricky to remember and apply. In English, we can classify sentences or phrases into two types according to their capitalization: 1. Upper case: All words in the sentence/ phrase starts with a capital letter. This is often used in headlines, titles, or headers. For example, \\"The Jealousy of Other People’s Better Houses.\\" 2. Lower case: Only the first letter of the first word (and any proper nouns or names) start with a capital letter. Everything else that follows in the sentence or phrase starts with small letters unless they are proper nouns, pronouns, etc. For example, \\"the jealousy of other people's better houses,\\" The request in question asked me to convert \\"The jealousy of other people’s better houses,\\" into lower case. When we do so, we start the sentence with a small letter, and all other letters remain small unless they are the start of a proper noun or pronoun. Therefore, \\"The jealousy of other people’s better houses,\\" became \\"the jealousy of other people's better houses,\\" after converting it to lower case. This is important because different styles of capitalization have different effects upon the reader. Proper capitalization following standard rules can help writing appear more formal and professional, whereas unconventional uses of capitalization can change the tone or emphasis in a piece of text. Even small pieces of manipulation, like simply putting a sentence into lower case letters, can affect interpretation of the text. It can make a line seem less important or quieter and tends to draw less attention, meaning it appears less assertive or less of a proclamation. So, such a change carries that added sense of indirectness or subordination, can render the phrase less obtrusive and, by common extension, less forceful. Therefore, understanding the usage and rules of capitalization is important for one's overall proficiency in written English."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: This article: Scarpia's apartment in the Palazzo Farnese, that evening Scarpia, at supper, sends a note to Tosca asking her to come to his apartment, anticipating that two of his goals will soon be fulfilled at once. His agent, Spoletta, arrives to report that Angelotti remains at large, but Cavaradossi has been arrested for questioning. He is brought in, and an interrogation ensues. As the painter steadfastly denies knowing anything about Angelotti's escape, Tosca's voice is heard singing a celebratory cantata elsewhere in the Palace. She enters the apartment in time to see Cavaradossi being escorted to an antechamber. All he has time to say is that she mustn't tell them anything. Scarpia then claims she can save her lover from indescribable pain if she reveals Angelotti's hiding place. She resists, but the sound of screams coming through the door eventually breaks her down, and she tells Scarpia to search the well in the garden of Cavaradossi's villa. Scarpia orders his torturers to cease, and the bloodied painter is dragged back in. He's devastated to discover that Tosca has betrayed his friend. Sciarrone, another agent, then enters with news: there was an upset on the battlefield at Marengo, and the French are marching on Rome. Cavaradossi, unable to contain himself, gloats to Scarpia that his rule of terror will soon be at an end. This is enough for the police to consider him guilty, and they haul him away to be shot. Scarpia, now alone with Tosca, proposes a bargain: if she gives herself to him, Cavaradossi will be freed. She is revolted, and repeatedly rejects his advances, but she hears the drums outside announcing an execution. As Scarpia awaits her decision, she prays, asking why God has abandoned her in her hour of need: \\"Vissi d'arte\\" (\\"I lived for art\\"). She tries to offer money, but Scarpia isn't interested in that kind of bribe: he wants Tosca herself. Spoletta returns with the news that Angelotti has killed himself upon discovery, and that everything is in place for Cavaradossi's execution.

Question: Where does the tribute band rehearse? Movie title: Rock Star Movie plot: Chris Cole (Mark Wahlberg) is a Pittsburgh fanatical admirer of a 1980s heavy metal band called Steel Dragon. By day, Chris is a photocopier technician and by night, he is the lead singer of a Steel Dragon tribute band called Blood Pollution (the name is taken from a Steel Dragon song). Internal struggles among the actual Steel Dragon band members culminate with the firing of their lead singer, Bobby Beers (Jason Flemyng), and the starting of recruitment sessions to find a new vocalist. Chris experiences his own strife with his Blood Pollution bandmates, particularly guitarist Rob Malcolm (Timothy Olyphant). During a live performance, Rob's playing fails to live up to Chris' over-demanding standards regarding note-for-note accuracy to the original Steel Dragon recordings, and Chris sabotages Rob's amplifier mid-song - a fight breaks out between the two onstage. The next day, Chris arrives at Blood Pollution's rehearsal space (the basement of an X-rated theater) to find that he's been fired and replaced with his arch-rival, the (now former) lead singer of another Steel Dragon tribute band. Rob also cites Chris' inability to create his own musical style, preferring to remain the singer in a tribute band. One day in 1984, Chris receives an unexpected phone call from Steel Dragon's founder and rhythm guitarist, Kirk Cuddy (Dominic West), and is offered an audition for the band (thanks to two of Blood Pollution's groupies, who showed Kirk a videotape of one of Blood Pollution's concerts). After hanging up on Kirk once, thinking he's being made fun of, Chris ecstatically agrees. At the studio, he meets the band, as well as learning that Bobby Beers was fired because he was a closeted gay, and gives an outstanding performance of \\"We All Die Young\\" (a Steel Dragon song in the movie, but it is actually a song by Steelheart, whose lead vocalist Miljenko Matijevic provides Cole's singing voice for the film).

Answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: American sign language has an interesting history. Although there have always been deaf individuals in America, the history really begins in 1817. Before 1817 deaf people communicated by using \\"home signs\\". Gestures were individually created and used within the home for simple communication. There were no schools or formal sign language training for the deaf. So, why was 1817 an important date? Well, the story begins with Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet. Gallaudet met his neighbor's daughter Alice Cogswell. Alice was the young deaf daughter of Dr. Mason Cogswell from Hartford, Connecticut. Gallaudet began teaching Alice to read and write a few simple words. Excited by the success Dr. Cogswell encouraged Gallaudet to establish a school for the deaf. Cogswell raised the money and Gallaudet traveled to Britain to learn the methods used there. However, the schools refused to share their instructional techniques and methods. While in London, there happened to be a demonstration of the French method of deaf education. Britain was using an oral method of instruction; however, the French method used signs. Gallaudet was fascinated with the method and was able to meet with the instructor, Sicard, and his two deaf pupils, Jean Massieu and Laurent Clerc. Sicard agreed to teach Gallaudet his method and Gallaudet went to Paris to learn French signs. After a while, Gallaudet wished to return home and convinced Clerc to go with him and help him establish the school. The trip home was a 52-day voyage during which Clerc taught Gallaudet French signs and Gallaudet taught Clerc English. On April 15, 1817, Laurent Clerc and Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet established what is currently known as the American School for the Deaf in Hartford, Connecticut. The opening of the first school for the deaf can be viewed as one of the most important events in current deaf culture. Options: A How Gallaudet set up the first school for the deaf in America. B What contributions Gallaudet made to the education of the deaf in America. C Different methods of teaching the deaf in the world. D Who invented American sign language.

In 1885 Louis Pasteur and Pierre Paul Émile Roux created the first rabies vaccine. The first diphtheria vaccines were produced in 1914 from a mixture of diphtheria toxin and antitoxin (produced from the serum of an inoculated animal), but the safety of the inoculation was marginal and it was not widely used. The United States recorded 206,000 cases of diphtheria in 1921 resulting in 15,520 deaths. In 1923 parallel efforts by Gaston Ramon at the Pasteur Institute and Alexander Glenny at the Wellcome Research Laboratories (later part of GlaxoSmithKline) led to the discovery that a safer vaccine could be produced by treating diphtheria toxin with formaldehyde. In 1944, Maurice Hilleman of Squibb Pharmaceuticals developed the first vaccine against Japanese encephelitis.

It plays a major role in defending against disease and maintaining overall health. The immune system can be broadly divided into two components: the innate immune system and the adaptive immune system. Each of these components has a distinct function. The innate immune system, which is the first line of defense, provides an immediate but general response to foreign invaders. It is composed of cells like macrophages, neutrophils, and natural killer cells, as well as various physical barriers, such as the skin and mucous membranes. This system recognizes pathogens based on general patterns present on their surface and initiates a rapid response. On the other hand, the adaptive immune system reacts in a more specific and targeted manner towards a particular pathogen. It is responsible for creating a memory of the pathogen, allowing the body to quickly identify and eliminate the same pathogen if it is encountered again in the future. The adaptive immune system consists of B cells and T cells, both of which play an essential role in recognizing and eliminating specific pathogens. In summary, the best answer to fight off disease is the immune system. Other options like name (B), one head (C), grip (D), and fingernails (E) do not play a significant role in defending the body against disease-causing pathogens. Maintaining a healthy immune system through lifestyle choices like a balanced diet, regular exercise, adequate sleep, stress reduction, and proper hygiene practices is essential to prevent the development of various illnesses and ensure overall well-being."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Incidents involving law enforcement officers firing across national boundaries, as well as cases of innocent lives being compromised, have led to heightened concerns on matters of jurisdiction, authority, and accountability. One of the key players in the US response to border shootings is the Department of Justice. This article will explore the Justice Department's perspective and actions on border shootings, focusing on its legal position, the challenges it faces, and its recommendations for the future. 1. Justice Department's Legal Position on Border Shootings As the leading federal agency responsible for enforcing the rule of law, the Justice Department takes a stand on various aspects of border shootings. These aspects include use of force by law enforcement, extraterritorial jurisdiction, and civil rights considerations. To start with, the Justice Department maintains that each situation involving a border shooting should be assessed on its unique circumstances, the relevant laws, and the legal obligations of the involved parties. In the context of use of force by law enforcement, the Justice Department asserts that federal officers should adhere to the constitutional mandate and exercise restraint, with force being used only when necessary to protect themselves or others from imminent harm. Additionally, force should always be proportionate and reasonable—a principle upheld consistently by Supreme Court decisions. 2. Challenges Faced by the Justice Department on Border Shootings One of the key challenges faced by the Justice Department with regard to border shootings is extraterritorial jurisdiction. Extraterritoriality raises complex legal questions regarding the extent to which US law enforcement officers and federal agents may exercise their authority beyond the nation's borders. Furthermore, the involvement of foreign governments and their citizenry complicates issues of jurisdiction, cooperation, and reciprocity. Another significant challenge is differentiating between legitimate self-defense and excessive force when assessing incidents. Proving whether a law enforcement officer's use of force was justified can be a difficult process, often relying on witness testimonies and the availability of evidence. In some cases, circumstances like distance from the border, obstructed views, and language barriers may hinder a thorough investigation. 3. Upholding Civil Rights in Border Shootings The Justice Department also plays a crucial role in upholding the civil rights of all individuals involved in border shooting incidents, irrespective of their nationality. It seeks to ensure that the constitutional rights of all individuals, including foreign citizens, are respected and protected. The Civil Rights Division of the Justice Department is responsible for investigating any allegations of rights violations and prosecuting those found guilty of misconduct. 4. Recommendations for Addressing Border Shootings In light of the challenges associated with border shootings, the Justice Department strongly advocates for a thorough evaluation and reformulation of border security policies, use of force guidelines, and training methods for law enforcement personnel. It encourages law enforcement agencies to adopt the use of non-lethal alternatives and de-escalation techniques to reduce the possibility of border shootings. Additionally, the Justice Department promotes bilateral and regional cooperation to ensure effective communication and trust-building between countries. This includes intelligence sharing, joint training exercises, and harmonization of legal frameworks. Conclusion: Border shootings pose significant challenges to the Justice Department, with complex legal questions and potential human rights violations at stake. By addressing these challenges through policy reforms, enhanced cooperation, and a commitment to uphold civil rights, the Justice Department can play a pivotal role in ensuring that cases of border shootings are minimized, and that justice is served for the victims and their families."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A RUSSIAN interpreter's incredible mission to keep Hitler's teeth safely in a box in the days after his death has been told in English for the first time. Yelena Rzhevskaya was 25-years-old when her Soviet unit commander Colonel Gorbushin handed her a burgundy box and told her 'these are Hitler's teeth, if you lose them you are answerable with your head'. Alamy 6 Yelena Rzhevskaya was handed a burgundy box with Hitler's teeth German radio had announced Hitler killed himself on April 30, 1945, eight days later officials were still trying to get confirmation. Theories were circulating that the Fuhrer could have escaped from Berlin and was either hiding in the Alps or en route to South America. Yelena's unit was tasked with finding out if the charred teeth discovered in the grounds of the Reich Chancellery were in fact Hitler's. Her memoirs have now been published in English for the first time and tell the true story of how the Nazi dictator's death was confirmed. Moscoop 6 The teeth were the key to proving Hitler had died Getty - Contributor 6 There were rumours Hitler had fled Berlin Colonlel Gorbushin is said to have told Yelena she was entrusted with the mission because 'we have no safe and as a woman, you're less likely than a man to get drunk and lose them'. The memoir tells of trying to trace Hitler's dentists in the war-torn streets of Berlin. She wrote: \\"In places smoke was still rising, the city’s air still filled with the fumes of battle. \\"The barricades, crushed by tank tracks, had yet to be dismantled. Nurses in grey, with white head-scarves bearing a red cross, looked exhausted as, sternly and silently, they went about their duties.\\" Reuters 6 A dentist was able to recite the make-up of Hitler's teeth Getty - Contributor 6 The Fuhrer's death was announced in April 1945 After hours of searching around the city the team traced the dentist Kathe Heusermann to an apartment near the surgery.

After the war, Yelena returned to Moscow and became a writer. She died in April last year. ||||| French researchers claim to have put an end to conspiracy theories surrounding the death of Adolf Hitler, after a study of his teeth proved he definitely died after taking cyanide and shooting himself in the head in Berlin in 1945. The researchers reached their conclusion after they were given rare access to fragments of Hitler’s teeth which have been held in Moscow since the end of World War II. \\"The teeth are authentic, there is no possible doubt. Our study proves that Hitler died in 1945,\\" said professor Philippe Charlier. \\"We can stop all the conspiracy theories about Hitler. He did not flee to Argentina in a submarine, he is not in a hidden base in Antarctica or on the dark side of the moon,\\" he told AFP news agency. The teeth were put on display in 2000 in Moscow as part of an exhibition to mark the 55th anniversary of the end of the war. They were back in the news again last month when the memoirs of a Russian interpreter who worked in Berlin in 1945 were published in English for the first time. She recounted how she had been tasked with proving Hitler's death by tracking down his dental records in the ruined German capital and seeing if they matched a set of teeth she had been entrusted with - which they did. ||||| In a new study, French scientists analyzed fragments of Adolf Hitler’s teeth to prove that he died in 1945, after taking cyanide and shooting himself in the head. The research, published in the European Journal of Internal Medicine in May 2018, seeks to end conspiracy theories about Adolf Hitler’s death through scientific analysis of the dictator’s teeth and skull. “Our study proves that Hitler died in 1945,” lead study author Philippe Charlier told AFP. “The teeth are authentic, there is no possible doubt.” Though it’s widely established that Hitler died in his bunker in Berlin, rumors of his escape abound. Their research proves that “he did not flee to Argentina in a submarine, he is not in a hidden base in Antarctica or on the dark side of the moon,” said Charlier. In late April 1945, as Soviet forces stormed Berlin, Hitler made plans for his suicide, including testing SS-supplied cyanide pills on his Alsatian, Blondi, and dictating a final will and testament. Two days earlier, Mussolini had been shot by a firing squad and then publicly hung by his feet in a suburban square in Milan, Italy: A similar fate seemed inevitable. Late on April 30, the bodies of Hitler and his new wife, Eva Braun, were found in the bunker, with a bullet hole in Hitler’s temple. In April 2018, the English publication of the memoirs of a Russian interpreter revealed how she had been entrusted with a set of teeth in 1945, and tasked with cross-checking them against the dictator’s dental records: They matched, and have remained in Russian hands ever since, the Telegraph reported. After months of negotiations, Russia’s FSB secret service and the Russian state archives gave the researchers permission to examine a skull fragment and bits of his teeth. The piece of skull had a hole on its left side, consistent with a bullet wound, with black charring around the edges. Though scientists weren’t allowed to take samples from the skull, they noted in the study, its shape seemed “totally comparable” to radiographies of Hitler’s skull taken a year before his death. Gruesome pictures of the teeth published in the study show a jaw made mostly of metal. “At the moment of his death,” they wrote in the report, “Hitler had only four remaining teeth.” The few there are are misshapen, brown at the base, and flecked with white tartar deposits. The analysis corroborated frequently-cited claims that Hitler was a vegetarian, but could not conclusively prove whether he took cyanide before the gunshot. Bluish deposits on his false teeth, the researchers wrote, suggest a variety of different hypotheses—did some chemical reaction take place between his fake teeth and the cyanide at the moment of death, during his cremation, or while the remains were buried? Without taking samples for analysis, it’s hard to say for sure. “We didn’t know if he had used an ampule of cyanide to kill himself or whether it was a bullet in the head. It’s in all probability both,” Charlier said. Either way, the study may help finally put to tales of Hitler’s flight to rest, once and for all. ||||| Write a summary.","completion":"Yelena Rzhevskaya, a Russian interpreter, was entrusted with a mission to confirm Adolf Hitler's death by verifying his dental records with a set of teeth in a box in 1945.

Question: I have a new situation: Uncle Tom and uncle Sam both have high cholesterol. Uncle Tom is on statin drugs and uncle Sam is not. But I can use this background: Currently, millions of individuals with high cholesterol take a similar type of drug, known as a statin. The drug, an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase (3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase), the rate limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis, decreases blood levels of cholesterol by induce the expression of low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors in the liver. The increased levels of the LDL-receptors stimulate the catabolism of plasma LDL, removing cholesterol from plasma, which is an important determinant of atherosclerosis. You may know of people who take a statin to help with their cholesterol levels. However, these drugs probably work slightly differently in many of those people. In some, it lowers their cholesterol significantly; in others it may lower it only moderately; and in some, it may have no significant effect at all. (Luckily for those individuals, there are multiple versions of the statins, so different drugs can be tested to find the proper combination for that individual.) Why the difference? Because of the genetic background of all people; the different single nucleotide polymorphisms that make us all different. Pharmacogenomics, a combination of pharmacology and genomics (the study of the genome) that refers to the study of the relationship between pharmaceuticals and genetics, may explain and simplify this problem.

Even the most consistent ones donate an average of just three to four times during their lifetime. Now the officials in Sweden are trying to change the trend with the help of modern-day technology. The encouragement to donate again begins shortly after the donor leaves the clinic when he/she receives a \\"thank you\\" text. Though that certainly helps them feel appreciated, what is even more pleasing is the text they receive each time their blood is used to help someone in need. Karolina Wiberg, manager of the Stockholm blood service, believes this small gesture not only results in repeat donors, but helps bring in new ones. The program that was started in Stockholm has received such positive feedback that it is now being rolled out across the country. However, Swedish officials are not stopping there. They are also encouraging local clinics to publish the exact levels of the different blood groups they have at any given time on their websites. This allows potential donors to realize that their blood can make a difference in saving someone ' s life. While all these outreach programs are great, busy citizens, even the ones with the best intentions have to be occasionally reminded. In order to jog their memories, officials ask people for authorization to send them text, Facebook, and e-mail reminders.

So it really started in earnest in 2003, when we started working on this story that became the movie.\\" Technology has also played its part. Jean continued, \\"The technology to do this film really wasn't even around five years ago. For example, there was this joke I once pitched and David Silverman, the director, started drawing and as I was pitching it, it went into the film and it was cut a day later.

Article: Shading is an artistic endeavor - no instructions will be able to duplicate the confidence you'll gain by trying to shade yourself. Shading a tattoo is not so much different from shading a still life. Try to become comfortable shading off body, even if you are already an accomplished artist. Practice with pressure. Pressing hard versus pressing lightly can have dramatically different effects, so you should get a feel for this ahead of time. Also, practice using different strokes to prepare yourself for tattooing different kinds of artwork. Pigs make good human analogues and you can buy a pork belly at a local grocery store or even online. This way you can get a feel for how much pressure to use and what type of strokes to use without worrying about permanently marking a human's skin just yet. Different shader needles result in different effects. For instance, bigger shader needles create a softer shade than smaller needles, which concentrate the color more. Ensure that the needle is protruding no more than 1 mm (0.039 in) for the purposes of shading. A slower speed helps create a softer shade that you can build upon. Using a faster speed creates darker shading. Adjust the speed as needed depending on what type of look and depth the customer wants. Clean the entire area with soap and water, especially if you have already done the lining. Make sure that you have gotten rid of any stencil marks, sticky residue, or grease that will get in the way of your shading process.

Please segment the words:","completion":"Ability to license the application objects that are needed to modify the code according to the client's requirements. The capacity to grant permissions and access rights for specific application objects plays a crucial role in enabling developers to modify the code to suit a client's unique needs. This process typically involves several steps that ensure the protection of intellectual property while accommodating user requirements. Let's explore these in greater detail: 1. Identifying the application objects: The first step in this process is to pinpoint the various components or objects within the application that require modification. These could include libraries, APIs, frameworks, or specific modules that make up the structure and functionality of the software. 2. Evaluating licensing terms and conditions: Before proceeding, it is essential to review and comprehend the licensing terms and conditions of the application objects. Certain licenses can be quite restrictive and could limit the feasibility of making modifications as per the client’s requirements. 3. Obtaining licenses for application objects: After assessing the licensing terms, you may need to acquire the appropriate permissions to modify the code. Depending on the situation, this could entail purchasing or negotiating a suitable license package or obtaining authorization from the relevant stakeholders. 4. Conducting a risk assessment: It is important to gauge the potential risks involved in modifying the application objects. This may include evaluating the potential impact on application stability, compatibility, and security. In addition, you must consider the risks associated with breaching licensing conditions, as this could lead to legal ramifications or compromise the software's integrity. 5.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Process: - Wind or water breaks small pieces off of a rock - The wind or water deposits tiny rocks - The rocks become known as sediment - The layers of sediment are pressed together by other layers of sediment on top - Minerals from the rocks in the sediment dissolve - Minerals glue the sediment together into a single rock. Question: suppose some water moves gravel happens, how will it affect smaller rocks moving around. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect Answer:","completion":"When water moves gravel, it can have a variety of effects on the smaller rocks within the gravel. In this case, we can determine that the correct answer is A: more. To better understand why the movement of water would cause an increase in the movement of smaller rocks, let us examine the process more closely. Water is a powerful force of erosion and sediment transport. When water flows over a surface, it can pick up and carry small rocks, gravel, sand, and other sediments, transporting them to a new location. The ability of water to carry sediment depends on its velocity, its volume, and the size and weight of the sediment particles. In the case of water moving gravel, the force and flow of the water can increase the movement of smaller rocks within the gravel. Here are some reasons why: 1. Increase in water velocity: As water speeds up, it becomes more powerful and can carry more and larger sediment particles. When the water moves gravel, it suggests that the water flow is strong enough to transport larger rock fragments. As a result, the smaller rocks within the gravel will be carried along, increasing their movement. 2. Turbulence: When water flows over a surface, it creates turbulence. This turbulence has the ability to dislodge and pick up smaller rocks. As the water moves the larger gravel particles, the smaller rocks may be caught in the turbulent eddies and whorls created by the water's movement, further increasing their movement. 3. Streambed scouring: As the water moves the gravel, it can create areas of scouring and erosion on the streambed. This scouring can help to loosen and mobilize smaller rocks that were previously in place, allowing them to be more easily picked up and carried by the water. 4. Sorting of sediments: When water moves gravel and other sediments, it can lead to a sorting of particles based on their size and weight. As the water flows, it may preferentially pick up and transport smaller rocks due to their lower weight and often smoother surfaces. Consequently, these smaller rocks might move more than they would if the water were simply flowing over a stable gravel bed. In conclusion, the movement of water over gravel can significantly affect the smaller rocks within the gravel, causing them to move more. The increase in water velocity, turbulence, streambed scouring, and sediment sorting all contribute to increasing the movement of smaller rocks as the water transports the gravel."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie title: The Host Context: The human race has been taken over by small parasitic aliens called \\"Souls\\". They travel to planets inserting themselves into a host body of that planet's dominant species while suppressing the host's consciousness. They access the host's memories, and occupied hosts are identifiable by silver rings in the hosts' eyes. A human on the run, Melanie Stryder, is captured and infused with a soul called \\"Wanderer.\\" Wanderer is asked by Seeker to access Melanie's memories in order to discover the location of a pocket of unassimilated humans. Melanie's consciousness, however, has not been completely eliminated, and it struggles to regain control of her body. Melanie and Wanderer carry out an internal conversation and debate with each other, forming a friendship. Wanderer shares with Seeker that Melanie was traveling with her brother, Jamie, and her boyfriend, Jared Howe, to find Melanie's uncle Jeb in the desert. Wanderer admits that Melanie is still present, so Seeker decides to be transferred into Melanie's body to get the information herself. With the help of Melanie, Wanderer escapes and makes her way to the desert, where she is found by Jeb, who takes her to a series of caves hidden inside a mountain where the humans (including Jared and Jamie) are hiding. Wanderer's presence is met with hostility by all but Jeb and Jamie. Melanie instructs Wanderer not to tell anyone she is still alive, since it would provoke them, though she later allows her to tell Jamie. Wanderer begins interacting with the humans and slowly begins to gain their trust, forming a bond with Ian O'Shea. Seeker leads a search party into the desert to find Wanderer. They intercept one of the shelter's supply teams, and in the ensuing chase, Aaron and Brandt commit suicide to avoid capture.

She is debriefed by her employers at the Weyland-Yutani Corporation over the destruction of her ship, the USCSS Nostromo; they are skeptical of her claims that an Alien killed the ship's crew and forced her to destroy the ship. The exomoon LV-426, where the Nostromo encountered the alien eggs, is now home to the terraforming colony Hadleys Hope. When contact is lost with Hadleys Hope, Weyland-Yutani representative Carter Burke and Colonial Marine Lieutenant Gorman ask Ripley to accompany Burke and a Colonial Marine unit to investigate the disturbance. Traumatized by her encounter with the Alien, Ripley initially refuses, but she relents after experiencing recurring nightmares about the creature; she makes Burke promise to destroy, and not capture, the Aliens. Aboard the spaceship USS Sulaco, she is introduced to the Colonial Marines, their commanding officer Lieutenant Gorman, and the android Bishop, toward whom Ripley is initially hostile following her experience with the traitorous android Ash aboard the Nostromo.

Einstein showed in his thought experiments that people travelling at different speeds, while agreeing on cause and effect, measure different time separations between events, and can even observe different chronological orderings between non-causally related events. Though these effects are typically minute in the human experience, the effect becomes much more pronounced for objects moving at speeds approaching the speed of light. Many subatomic particles exist for only a fixed fraction of a second in a lab relatively at rest, but some that travel close to the speed of light can be measured to travel farther and survive much longer than expected (a muon is one example). According to the special theory of relativity, in the high-speed particle's frame of reference, it exists, on the average, for a standard amount of time known as its mean lifetime, and the distance it travels in that time is zero, because its velocity is zero. Relative to a frame of reference at rest, time seems to \\"slow down\\" for the particle. Relative to the high-speed particle, distances seem to shorten. Einstein showed how both temporal and spatial dimensions can be altered (or \\"warped\\") by high-speed motion. If it is possible to answer this question, answer it for me (else, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): In what case do these effects become much more relative?","completion":"Alright, let me explain this in a simple way. Imagine you have a toy car. When you move it slowly, you can see how far it goes and how long it takes to get there. But if you make the car go super-duper fast, almost as fast as a lightning bolt, it becomes harder to see how far it goes and how long it takes. Einstein was a really smart guy who found out that when things go really, really fast, like close to the speed of light, the way we measure time and distance can change. For example, a tiny particle in a science lab might look like it lives a very short time and doesn't go very far. But if that tiny particle goes super fast, close to the speed of light, it can live a bit longer and go further than we expected. So, these effects become much more noticeable when things are moving close to the speed of light, which is extremely fast.

Earths magnetic field helps protect Earth and its organisms. It protects us from harmful particles given off by the sun. Most of the particles are attracted to the north and south magnetic poles. This is where Earths magnetic field is strongest. This is also where relatively few organisms live. Another benefit of Earths magnetic field is its use for navigation. People use compasses to detect Earths magnetic north pole. Knowing this helps them tell direction. Many animals have natural 'compasses' that work just as well. Birds like the garden warbler in Figure 1.36 use Earths magnetic field. They use it to guide their annual migrations.

Write an article with the title: \\"Semi-pro owners mean big money for Airbnb, hotels say\\"","completion":"Title: Semi-pro Owners Mean Big Money for Airbnb, Hotels Say Introduction: (Step 1: Introduce the topic) According to hotels, Airbnb has seen a surge in profits thanks to semi-pro owners turning their homes into lucrative short-term accommodations. In this article, we will explore how semi-pro owners are significantly contributing to the growth of Airbnb's business, creating fierce competition for hotels, and affecting the market dynamics. Section 1: Who are the semi-pro owners? (Step 2: Define semi-pro owners and their characteristics) Semi-pro Airbnb owners are individuals who don't just rent out their spare rooms, they turn their properties into fully-fledged businesses. These owners focus on short-term rentals, investing heavily in properties, and curating positive guest experiences. They have turned the casual host model of Airbnb on its head, moving it towards a more professionalized approach. Section 2: Growth of Airbnb due to semi-pro owners (Step 3: Discuss the impact of semi-pro owners on Airbnb's business growth) The rise of semi-pro owners has contributed significantly to Airbnb's growth, further solidifying its position in the competitive hospitality market. According to industry analysts, this segment of hosts has shown a faster growth rate as compared to casual hosts. With their business-oriented mindset and focus on revenue generation, semi-pro owners have brought a new level of professionalism to the platform. Section 3: The impact on hotels (Step 4: Explain the response of hotels to the rise of semi-pro owners on Airbnb) Hotels have begun to take notice of the expanding role that semi-pro owners play in the Airbnb market. Many claim that these owners are directly competing with hotels and challenging traditional business models. Some hotels are reporting a drop in revenue, specifically in areas where semi-pro owners have flocked to, as they struggle to maintain their market share. Section 4: The future implications for the hospitality industry (Step 5: Discuss the potential trends in the hospitality industry as a result of semi-pro owners) The growth of the semi-pro owner segment on Airbnb seems to indicate a shift in the hospitality landscape. Hotels have started adapting their business models to compete with this new class of hosts, incorporating more flexible stay options and investing in technology to enhance guest experiences. Moreover, legislative and regulatory actions are expected in response to this growing trend, as cities grapple with housing shortages and community concerns related to the rising number of Airbnb listings. Conclusion: (Step 6: Summarize the main points) In conclusion, the rise of semi-pro owners on Airbnb has transformed the platform into a significant player in the hospitality market, competing directly with traditional hotels. As this trend continues, the landscape and business models for travel accommodations will likely shift to reflect these new market dynamics. Hotels must remain adaptive and innovative in order to stay competitive and thrive in the face of this changing industry landscape."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Detailed Instructions: Given a command in a limited form of natural language, provide the correct sequence of actions that executes the command to thus navigate an agent in its environment. A command can be broken down into many different actions. Actions are uppercase and are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. The word 'opposite' turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively. There are only six actions: 'I_LOOK', 'I_WALK', 'I_RUN', 'I_JUMP', 'I_TURN_LEFT', and 'I_TURN_RIGHT'.

Tammy Wynette (; born Virginia Wynette Pugh; May 5, 1942 - April 6, 1998) was an American country music singer-songwriter and one of country music's best-known artists and biggest-selling female singers. Wynette was called the \\"First Lady of Country Music\\", and her best-known song, \\"Stand by Your Man\\", is one of the best-selling hit singles by a woman in the history of country music. Many of her hits dealt with classic themes of loneliness, divorce, and the difficulties of life and relationships. During the late 1960s and early 1970s, Wynette charted 20 number-one songs. In 1981, a TV movie about Wynette's life was aired called Stand by Your Man, which was based on her memoir of the same title. Actress Annette O'Toole portrayed Wynette in the film. Beginning in the early 1980s, however, her chart success began to wane, though, she did continue to have top-20 hits during this period, including \\"Starting Over\\" and \\"He Was There (When I Needed You)\\" (both 1980), a cover of the Everly Brothers' hit \\"Crying in the Rain\\" (1981), \\"Another Chance\\", \\"You Still Get to Me in My Dreams\\" (both 1982) and \\"A Good Night's Love\\" (1983). A 1985 cover of the '70s Dan Hill hit \\"Sometimes When We Touch\\", performed with Mark Grey, reached No. 6 in 1985. In 1982 she recorded a track with The Ray Conniff Singers, a rendition of \\"Delta Dawn\\", in order to be included in the Conniff's duets album \\"The Nashville Connection\\", but ultimately the track didn't enter. Meanwhile, her medical problems continued, including inflammations of her bile duct. In 1986, she acted on the CBS TV soap opera Capitol, playing beautician/singer Darlene Stankowski. In 1988, she filed for bankruptcy as a result of a bad investment in two Florida shopping centers. Wynette's 1987 album Higher Ground featured a neotraditional country sound and was both a critical and relative commercial success. The album featured contributions from Larry Gatlin, Vince Gill, Ricky Van Shelton, Rodney Crowell, Ricky Skaggs, Emmylou Harris and The O'Kanes. Two of the singles released from the album, \\"Your Love\\" and \\"Talkin' to Myself Again\\", reached the top 20 on the U.S. country singles charts; a third single, \\"Beneath a Painted Sky\\" (featuring duet vocals from Emmylou Harris) reached No. 25 in early 1988 (it would ultimately be Tammy Wynette's final top-40 country single).","completion":"This text is about Tammy Wynette, an American country music singer-songwriter who was born as Virginia Wynette Pugh on May 5, 1942, and passed away on April 6, 1998.

Jenny, 13, a US student, feels bored. She knows the feeling because she has been in hospital many times herself. One day, she thought of an idea--if patients could get some books to read, they would feel better. So, from May, she and many of her friends began to collect books for hospital patients. In six months the students collected 1,250 books at school. They decided to donate the books to the North Shore Medical Centre, a children's hospital next door to their school. \\"There are books for kids of all ages, from babies up to high school level.\\" said Jenny. The students put the books into \\"early readers\\", \\"middle readers\\" and \\"advanced readers\\". Then they wrote their best wishes to patients on bookmarks and letters, put the books in big boxes and donated them to the hospital. \\"We wrote things like, \\"Keep on reading!' and 'Hope you feel better!,\\" said John, 14, Jenny's brother. \\"And we also wrote some funny things to make them laugh.\\" Frank, 12, and Steven, 14, helped carry 16 large boxes of books into a car. \\"I think these books will make me a lot of patients feel happy.\\" said Frank.

Her idea was not only to offer entertainment through books, but also to provide a form of mental stimulation and escapism to these patients. She then collaborated with her friends to bring this idea to reality and started collecting books for hospital patients from May. In just six months, they managed to collect 1,250 books which they later categorized based on different reading levels and donated to the North Shore Medical Centre.

Amelia's parents had regrettably lost their lives in a tragic car accident when she was just seven years old. Ever since then, her loving grandfather, Old Tom, had become her guardian, raising her with a blend of wisdom and compassion. Old Tom was well known throughout the town for his extensive coin collection. He possessed an inordinate amount of rare and valuable coins, earned throughout his life as a world-renowned numismatist. As Amelia grew older, her curiosity and fascination with her grandfather's coin collection increased day by day. Old Tom would spend hours discussing the history, rarity, and stories behind each coin, fostering in Amelia a love and understanding of the numismatic world. One day, Amelia's grandfather decided she was mature enough to apprentice with him and delve deeper into the mysteries of collecting coins. He assigned her simple tasks, such as sorting coins by their rarity and date, polishing them, and logging the collection's inventory. The grandfather-daughter duo derived immense pleasure from their shared passion. When Amelia had her sixteenth birthday, Old Tom decided to take her to the annual Green Valley coin fair, which showcased rare coins from all around the world. Amelia, full of excitement, spent the night before her big day unable to sleep, her mind racing with visions of the shiny, precious coins she would soon behold. The morning finally arrived, and, fueled by a hearty breakfast, Amelia and Old Tom set off for the fair. The fairground was bustling with vendors, collectors, and enthusiasts alike. As they wandered through the vast sea of coin displays, Old Tom proudly introduced Amelia to all of his old friends and fellow members of the coin collector's guild. Towards the end of the day, with the sun beginning to set and flood the fairground with an orange hue, Old Tom led Amelia to the booth of his oldest friend, Mr. Silverton. They went to examine the collection Mr. Silverton had brought to the fair. Amelia's gaze was arrested by a beautiful, gleaming silver coin sitting among the others: a 1932 Liberty Head quarter, rumored to be one of the most valuable and sought-after quarters in existence. Amelia already knew all about this elusive quarter; it was a rare key-date coin, highly prized for its rarity and historical significance. She couldn't believe it lay before her, even more resplendent than she had imagined. Overwhelmed by the sight of the coin, Amelia hesitated to touch it. But Old Tom sensed her reservations, and with a supportive nod, he encouraged her to pick up the Liberty Head quarter to appreciate it better. As Amelia's fingers touched the silver surface, a sudden surge of electricity ran through her. She was transported into the thrilling history of the coin. The formation, the numerous exchanges, and the stories of those who had once possessed it played out before her eyes in vivid detail. It was the hidden history of the coin that brought Amelia so much closer to her grandfather and the numismatic world. Old Tom purchased the Liberty Head quarter for Amelia as a birthday present – a treasure marking both her coming of age and her entry into the coin community as a collector in her own right. Time passed, and Amelia grew into a wise and skilled numismatist, with her grandfather's spirit lighting the way. Amelia and Old Tom continued to share their passion until Old Tom passed away on a quiet, autumn evening. During Old Tom's funeral, Amelia reached into her pocket and pulled out the Liberty Head quarter. Through tears, she remembered the day her grandfather had given her the coin, the spark it ignited in her heart, and the love and admiration she held for the man who had changed her life. Emotion welled up inside her as she whispered a solemn thank you, clutching the coin as the embodiment of her treasured memories. It was a quarter. But to Amelia, it symbolized a lifetime of love, wisdom, and the bond between her and her beloved grandfather. Amelia knew she would cherish it forever, a priceless testament to the incredible journey they had shared together."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Virus: The Ebola virus epidemic has killed more than 3,000 people in West Africa. The virus continues to spread in the hardest-hit West African countries of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. The smaller outbreaks in both countries started when. infected travelers crossed borders after the Ebola outbreak in. West Africa had begun to raise alarms among public health. experts. At least 3,091 people have died from Ebola since the. West African outbreak was first reported in the remote southeast. forest region of Guinea in March. The first case in Nigeria was a traveler exposed to Ebola in. Liberia, who flew by commercial airline to Lagos on July 20,. where he was immediately transported to a private hospital with. symptoms of fever, vomiting and diarrhea. When the case was discovered in Africa's largest city,. Nigeria declared an Ebola emergency and quickly established a.

A burial team wearing protective clothing remove a body of a person suspected of having died of the Ebola virus, in Freetown, Sierra Leone. Outbreak: Officials warn tens of thousands may die from Ebola. China's first high-security biosafety laboratory will be ready for use by December, in a move hailed as a 'crucial' moment in the fight against pathogens such as the Ebola virus, officials said Tuesday. The facility, which has been under construction since July 2011, has been billed as the first in China that will be equipped to handle Class 4 pathogens - dangerous viruses that pose a high risk of airborne person-to-person transmission, which can include haemorrhagic fevers such as Ebola, and others. The laboratory in Wuhan, Hubei province, was built in cooperation with French bio-industrial firm Institut Merieux and the Chinese Academy of Sciences. It joins just a handful of labs around the world cleared to handle the most highly pathogenic germs. The Wuhan P4 laboratory comes 'at a crucial moment', said Institut Merieux president Alain Merieux in Beijing. 'Now we are all working side by side on Ebola,' he added, referring to French and Chinese efforts to address the crisis in affected African countries. As of September 24, healthcare personnel identified a total. of 19 laboratory-confirmed Ebola cases and one probable case, as. well as 894 contacts with those patients. In addition, contact. tracers conducted 18,500 face-to-face visits checking for signs. of Ebola symptoms. No new cases have emerged. The first confirmed case in Senegal occurred in August in a. 21-year-old Guinean man who traveled from his home in Guinea to. Dakar to visit family. Medical personnel learned of the man's possible exposure. from Guinean health authorities after his mother and sister had. been admitted to an Ebola unit on August 26 and identified the. young man as a contact. All three were likely exposed when. preparing the body of the patient's brother - who died of Ebola. in Guinea on August 10 - for burial. Senegalese health workers identified a total of 67 contacts. of the patient. All were monitored for Ebola for 21 days with no. further Ebola cases. The patient recovered and was released on. September 19. It comes as Federal health officials on Tuesday confirmed the first case of Ebola diagnosed in the U.S., a male patient who recently traveled from Liberia to Dallas. The unidentified patient was critically ill and has been in isolation at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital since Sunday, officials said. Health authorities have begun tracking down family and friends who may have had close contact with the patient and could be at risk for becoming ill. But officials said there are no other suspected cases in Texas. The Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital patient traveled from Liberia on September 19 and arrived in the United States the next day, without showing symptoms of the deadly virus, CDC Director Tom Frieden told reporters in a press conference filmed by NBC News. The patient, Frieden said, started to show signs of the virus September 24 and then 'sought care' on the 26th. Frieden said two days later the patient was admitted to Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas and isolated. It has been reported that the patient would not be given the experimental Ebola treatment ZMapp - because there is none of it left. Highlights:","completion":"1.

Blink-182 (often stylized as blink-182; pronounced \\"blink one eighty two\\") is an American rock band formed in Poway, California in 1992. Since 2015, the lineup of the band has consisted of bassist and vocalist Mark Hoppus, drummer Travis Barker, and guitarist and vocalist Matt Skiba. Founded by guitarist and vocalist Tom DeLonge, Hoppus and drummer Scott Raynor, the band emerged from the Southern California punk scene of the early 1990s and first gained notoriety for high-energy live shows and irreverent lyrical toilet humor. Blink-182 was initially known as Blink until an Irish band of the same name threatened legal action; in response, the band appended the meaningless number \\"-182\\". Hoppus and Barker decided to continue on without DeLonge, and enlisted Alkaline Trio vocalist/guitarist Matt Skiba to \\"fill in\\" for three shows in March 2015. Hoppus and Skiba had been wanting to work together musically for several years, so he was the first and only person considered for the role. After legal battles with DeLonge were worked out, Skiba joined Blink-182 as an official member and began preparations for new music. The resulting album, California, was produced by John Feldmann. He was the group's first new producer since longtime collaborator Jerry Finn. California was recorded between January and March 2016. The band, as well as Feldmann, would regularly spend \\"18 hours\\" in the studio a day, aiming to start and complete multiple songs in that timeframe. \\"We all wanted to write the best record that we could [...] It does feel like a new beginning. It feels like when we used to tour and sleep in the van because that's all we wanted to do is play rock music,\\" said Hoppus. Upon its July 2016 release, California became the band's second number-one album on the Billboard 200, and first in 15 years; it also reached the top for the first time in the United Kingdom. Its lead single, \\"Bored to Death\\", became the group's first number one single in 12 years. The band supported the album with a large headlining tour across North America between July and October 2016, and a European leg in June and July 2017. A deluxe edition of California--essentially a double album including songs left off the original album--was issued in 2017. California earned the band their first nomination for Best Rock Album at the Grammy Awards. Critical reviews of the album, however, were mixed; many considered Feldmann's input and the throwback nature of the songs as formulaic. Recently, the band has taken time off and are preparing to record their eighth studio album. \\"Somehow, Blink has had this resurgence like we never expected,\\" Hoppus told Kerrang! in July 2017. \\"I count myself lucky to have been [playing in the band] as long as I have.\\" The band signed a 16-date residency deal with the Palms Casino Resort in Las Vegas. The shows, known as \\"Kings of the Weekend,\\" will take place on select weekends beginning May 26, 2018. The last show is on November 17, 2018.

What is the name of the person that traveled to Italy in 1706? Answer the above question based on the context below: Handel's earliest opera compositions, in the German style, date from his Hamburg years, 1704–06, under the influence of Johann Mattheson. In 1706 he traveled to Italy where he remained for three years, developing his compositional skills. He first settled in Florence where he was introduced to Alessandro and Domenico Scarlatti. His first opera composed in Italy, though still reflecting the influence of Hamburg and Mattheson, was Rodrigo (1707, original title Vincer se stesso ê la maggior vittoria), was presented there. It was not particularly successful, but was part of Handel's process of learning to compose opera in the Italian style and to set Italian words to music.Handel then spent time in Rome, where the performance of opera was forbidden by Papal decree, and in Naples. He applied himself to the composition of cantatas and oratorios; at that time there was little difference (apart from increasing length) between cantata, oratorio and opera, all based on the alternation of secco recitative and aria da capo. Works from this period include Dixit Dominus and the dramatic cantata Aci, Galatea e Polifemo, written in Naples. While in Rome, probably through Alessandro Scarlatti, Handel had become acquainted with Cardinal Grimani, a distinguished diplomat who wrote libretti in his spare time, and acted as an unofficial theatrical agent for the Italian royal courts. He was evidently impressed by Handel and asked him to set his new libretto, Agrippina. Grimani intended to present this opera at his family-owned theatre in Venice, the Teatro San Giovanni Grisostomo, as part of the 1709–10 Carnevale season. The answer to this question is:","completion":"George Frideric Handel is the name of the person who traveled to Italy in 1706.

What is the missing first step of the following process: - The oxygen travels into the lungs - The oxygen binds to hemoglobin proteins within erythrocytes (red blood cells) - The erythrocytes are pumped through the body by the heart - All cells receive the oxygen. The answer to this question is:","completion":"The missing first step of the process is called \\"inspiration\\" or \\"inhalation\\", which occurs when the diaphragm and intercostal muscles contract as a response to the need for oxygen. This is the essential first step before oxygen can travel into the lungs and be delivered to the body's cells. Inhalation is a vital part of the respiratory process and ensures a steady supply of oxygen to be used by the body in various metabolic activities. Here is a step-by-step elaboration of the process: 1. Inhalation (the missing step): Controlled by the respiratory center in the brainstem, this step creates a negative pressure within the thoracic cavity when the diaphragm and intercostal muscles contract, causing the chest cavity to expand and the air to be drawn into the lungs through the nose or mouth, passing through the pharynx, larynx, and trachea. 2. Oxygen travels into the lungs: The inhaled air enters the bronchi and bronchioles, eventually reaching the alveoli, which are small air sacs surrounded by a network of capillaries. The alveoli are the site of gas exchange, where oxygen diffuses into the bloodstream through the thin walls of the capillaries. 3. Oxygen binds to hemoglobin proteins within erythrocytes (red blood cells): Once oxygen diffuses into the bloodstream, it binds to hemoglobin proteins within the erythrocytes, forming oxyhemoglobin. Hemoglobin has a strong affinity for oxygen and can carry up to four oxygen molecules at a time, transporting them efficiently throughout the body. 4. The erythrocytes are pumped through the body by the heart: The oxygen-rich blood is carried by the pulmonary veins from the lungs and returns to the left atrium of the heart. From there, the blood passes to the left ventricle, which pumps it through the aorta and into the systemic circulation, which comprises arteries, arterioles, capillaries, venules, and veins that reach every organ and tissue in the body. 5. All cells receive the oxygen: The oxygen bound to hemoglobin is delivered to the cells, where it is utilized for various cellular processes, including energy production through the process of cellular respiration. Oxygen is essential for the conversion of glucose into ATP (adenosine triphosphate), which acts as the primary energy currency within the cell. Finally, after the oxygen has been used in the cellular processes, carbon dioxide (a waste product) is produced and diffuses back into the bloodstream. It then gets transported back to the lungs, where it is expelled from the body during exhalation, completing the respiratory process and making way for a new cycle of oxygen delivery."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Extract the answer to the question from the following context.

What might be the first step of the process? The answer is:","completion":"The first step of the process that leads to water becoming acidic, fish dying, soil damage around trees, and harm to leaves is the release of air pollutants, primarily sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx), into the atmosphere. These pollutants are mainly produced by burning fossil fuels, such as coal and oil, in industries, power plants, and vehicles. Upon release into the atmosphere, they react with water, oxygen, and other substances to form sulfuric and nitric acids. These acids then fall to the ground as acid rain, affecting the aquatic ecosystems, soil, and vegetation. To summarize, the first step of the process is the emission of air pollutants like sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides into the atmosphere, which eventually lead to the formation of acid rain and various negative environmental impacts."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the following question: Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: High school student Wendy Christensen visits an amusement park with her boyfriend Jason Wise, best friend Carrie Dreyer, and Carrie's boyfriend Kevin Fischer for their senior class field trip. As they board the Devil's Flight roller coaster, Wendy has a premonition that the hydraulics securing the seat belts and roller coaster cars will fail, killing everyone on board. When she panics a fight breaks out and several people leave or are forced off the ride, including Kevin; best friends Ashley Fruend and Ashlyn Halperin; alumnus Frankie Cheeks; athlete Lewis Romero; and goths Ian McKinley and Erin Ulmer. As they leave they witness the roller coaster derail, killing the remaining passengers, including Jason and Carrie, leaving Wendy devastated.

(CNN) -- Shirley Chisholm, elected in 1968 as the first black woman in the U.S. Congress, once said: \\"I've always met more discrimination being a woman than being black.\\" The U.S. Senate gained one more woman this election in New Hampshire Senator-elect Jeanne Shaheen. Slightly more than three years after Chisholm's death, Barack Obama will be sworn in as president, a huge step forward for African-Americans. But for women, progress this election year was defined by \\"creeping and leaping,\\" said CNN contributor Hilary Rosen, the Washington editor-at-large for Huffingtonpost.com. Rosen favored Hillary Clinton, but she and other influential women pundits and activists note that Clinton and Gov. Sarah Palin's loss at the polls does not diminish the strides they made for their gender. \\"Women are about 54 percent of the vote,\\" Rosen said. \\"Do we have equal representation? No. Are we closer to it? Yes.\\" In the House, 10 new congresswomen will join the 64 incumbents who were re-elected, according to Rutgers University's Center for American Women and Politics, bringing the number of women in the 435-seat body to a record 74. The 100-member U.S. Senate gained one woman, Democrat Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, who became the 17th female senator. And several women could be appointed to prominent roles in Obama's administration. Shaheen will be New Hampshire's first female senator. She won in a bitter battle against Republican incumbent John E. Sununu, tying him to the unpopular President Bush. \\"It was an extraordinarily hard year for Republicans,\\" said Leslie Sanchez, a CNN contributor, Republican strategist and former adviser to President Bush. \\"You didn't have to go much further than relying on how unhappy people are with the administration.\\" North Carolina elected Beverly Perdue, who becomes the state's first woman governor. Perdue is the first pro-choice female governor of a Southern state since the late Ann Richards of Texas, according to Emily's List, which raised 43 million in 2007-2008 to help develop the candidacies of Democratic women. \\"This is the state of Jesse Helms!\\" said New York Rep. Carolyn Maloney, a Democrat, referring to one of the most polarizing figures in American political history. Helms opposed civil rights and a holiday honoring the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. \\"It's always a big deal when a woman is elected to high office, but this was a significant shift,\\" Maloney said. Perdue and North Carolina Democrat Kay Hagan, who beat Republican U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Dole, are strongly pro-Obama and pro-public education. North Carolina Association of Educators mobilized a massive get-out-the-vote campaign for them. Perdue was the subject of a GOP ad that pictured Obama with his arms around her as his former pastor Jeremiah Wright's incendiary sermons play in the background. In the closing days of the campaign, Dole ran an ad that insinuated Hagan was \\"godless.\\" \\"Women generally don't react favorably to campaign smears and mudslinging,\\" said Kim Gandy, the president of the National Organization for Women. \\"We elected the women who talked about issues that we care about -- child care, minimum wage, health care, equal pay.\\" Both Hagan and Perdue were overwhelmingly favored by women voters, according to exit polls. Perdue headed up a commission that spent money from a settlement with tobacco companies on health care. In the days before the election, Lilly Ledbetter appeared at a Hagan event. A jury awarded Ledbetter 3 million in damages when it found that Goodyear had discriminated against her by giving her smaller raises than male managers. By a 5-4 vote, the Supreme Court threw out that award and said the complaint had been filed too late. Obama supported the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act; McCain said it wasn't necessary. Democrats passed it in the House but Republicans blocked it in the Senate. \\"Lilly Ledbetter has come to symbolize so much to women,\\" NOW's Gandy said. \\"That issue alone will change votes.\\" Among the women expected to play a key role in the Obama administration is Karen Kornbluh, who served as a policy adviser and was the principal author of the Democrats' party platform. Kornbluh used to direct The Work and Family Program at the New America Foundation, served in the Clinton administration and was an adviser to Sen. John Kerry on the Senate Commerce Committee. She's well-known in D.C. for her essays \\"The Mommy Tax\\" and \\"The Joy of Flex,\\" which addressed the needs of the \\"juggler family,\\" or the household where two parents are working and no one is at home full-time. She argues for federal support for child care and after-school care, and control over flex-time for employees whose long hours usually come at the expense, emotionally and financially, of their families. \\"In Washington, she is really considered Obama's brain on so many policies,\\" said Steven Clemons, director of the American Strategy Program at the New America Foundation and writer of the Washington Note blog. Read exclusive interview with Kornbluh. \\"Her ideas are fresh and applicable to real life, real Americans.\\" Clemons said. \\"She's been quoted all over Washington from Joseph Lieberman to John Edwards since the [presidential] race in '04.\\" Also, Susan Rice is believed to be under consideration for national security adviser. She is Obama's chief foreign policy adviser, a former assistant secretary of state for African Affairs and protégé of former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. Valerie Jarrett has also been mentioned for White House postings and as a possible appointee to fill the Senate seat that Obama will vacate. She is the Obamas' closest friend and has served as a political adviser. \\"The consultants will drag you through the mud so Obama was brilliant in putting Valerie in that role,\\" Sanchez said. \\"Her counsel was very grounding for him and she protected him as a candidate.\\" Write highlights for this article.","completion":"1.

Have you ever wanted to play a card game with your family or friends? Today, I am going to teach you a super-simple card game that you can enjoy with anyone. Let's get started! Step 1: Learning the Hand Rankings First, you need to know which card combinations are the best. These combinations are called \\"hand rankings.\\" For our simple game, we will use these hand rankings: 1. Pair - Two cards with the same number or letter (like two 3s or two Kings) 2. High Card - The card with the highest number/letter if nobody has a pair Step 2: Agree on the Rules of Play Before starting the game, make sure you and your friends understand the rules and agree to them. This will make the game more enjoyable and fair. Step 3: Deal One Card to Each Player Now, you're ready to begin! Sit in a circle with your friends. Choose one person to be the dealer. The dealer will give one card to each player, including themselves. Step 4: Starting the Betting The player to the left of the dealer starts by deciding if they want to bet. Betting is like saying, \\"I think my card is the best!\\" If they want to bet, they can place something small, like a candy or a chip, in the middle of the circle. This starts the \\"pot.\\" Step 5: Play Continues Clockwise Now, the next player has to decide if they want to \\"call\\" (match the bet) or \\"fold\\" (give up their chance to win). If they call, they add the same amount to the pot. If they fold, they cannot win this round. This continues until everyone has had a turn. Step 6: Deal a Second Card Once everyone has made their decision, the dealer gives each player another card. Step 7: Bet Again Just like before, the first player to the left of the dealer can decide to bet. Then, everyone else can call, raise, or fold, going around the circle. Step 8: Deal a Third Card Then, the dealer deals one more card to each player. Step 9: Repeat the Betting Now, the players bet one more time using their three cards, like before. Step 10: Reveal All Hands Once all the betting is finished, players show their cards. Remember the hand rankings? Here's where you'll use them. Players compare their hands to see who wins. Step 11: The Winner Takes the Pot The player with the best hand ranking wins and takes all the goodies in the pot! Step 12: Rotate Dealers and Play Another Round After that exciting round, now it's time to give someone else a chance to be the dealer. The dealer role moves to the left. Keep playing rounds like this until you all decide to stop. And that's it! This simple and fun card game is an excellent way to spend time with your friends and family.

Albanian was proved to be an Indo-European language in 1854 by the German philologist Franz Bopp. The Albanian language comprises its own branch of the Indo-European language family. Some scholars believe that Albanian derives from Illyrian while others claim that it derives from Daco-Thracian. (Illyrian and Daco-Thracian, however, might have been closely related languages; see Thraco-Illyrian.) Establishing longer relations, Albanian is often compared to Balto-Slavic on the one hand and Germanic on the other, both of which share a number of isoglosses with Albanian. Moreover, Albanian has undergone a vowel shift in which stressed, long o has fallen to a, much like in the former and opposite the latter. Likewise, Albanian has taken the old relative jos and innovatively used it exclusively to qualify adjectives, much in the way Balto-Slavic has used this word to provide the definite ending of adjectives. The cultural renaissance was first of all expressed through the development of the Albanian language in the area of church texts and publications, mainly of the Catholic region in the North, but also of the Orthodox in the South. The Protestant reforms invigorated hopes for the development of the local language and literary tradition when cleric Gjon Buzuku brought into the Albanian language the Catholic liturgy, trying to do for the Albanian language what Luther did for German. After reading the above, is \\"Vowel shift from O to A\\" the correct answer to the question \\"The Albanian language used jos to qualify adjectives and made what other shift?\\"?

Answer should be yes or no. Note that URLs in the text have been replaced with [Link]. Verify if the sentiment of the following document towards the entity Steve Bannon is Negative . WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump’s lawyer said on Thursday he would try to stop publication of a book that portrays an inept president in a fumbling White House and threatened legal action against former top aide Steve Bannon over “defamatory” comments in the book. Harder also told Reuters “legal action is imminent” against Bannon . Trump cut ties with Bannon on Wednesday saying his former adviser had “lost his mind ” in a blistering statement issued after comments attributed to Bannon in the book were made public. Trump lawyers sent a cease-and-desist letter to Bannon on Wednesday asking him not to disclose any confidential information. They said Bannon had breached an agreement by communicating with Wolff about Trump his family and the campaign and made “disparaging statements and in some cases outright defamatory statements” about them. In the book Bannon was quoted as describing a June 2016 meeting with a group of Russians at Trump Tower in New York as “treasonous” and “unpatriotic.” The meeting held after the Russians promised damaging information on Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton was attended by Donald Trump Jr. Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner and Paul Manafort who was Trump’s campaign manager at the time. Trump’s statement also diminished Bannon ’s role in the election victory and accused him of leaking to the media. Before joining the campaign Bannon had headed conservative Breitbart News website and he proved to be a divisive figure in the White House. He returned to Breitbart after being fired although he reportedly continued to talk with Trump.

REUTERS/Carlos Barria/File Photo Bannon ’s reaction to the book controversy has been muted. In interviews with Breitbart News after the news broke he called Trump a “great man” and pledged continued support for his agenda. Bradley Moss a Washington lawyer specializing in national security law said any non-disclosure agreement would not apply to Bannon once he became a government employee. The government has far less power to limit speech by employees than private companies Moss said. A lawsuit could hurt Trump because Bannon ’s lawyers would be entitled to interview White House officials and collect potentially damaging documents from them in his defense Moss said. On Thursday the White House said no personal devices including cellphones would be allowed in the West Wing beginning next week for security purposes. The moves followed the Bannon split but had been considered for some time. Bannon helped Trump shape a populist anti-establishment message and had been the president’s link to his hard-line conservative base of support which is often at odds with the Republican Party establishment.","completion":"Yes"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

While you can write a creative marketing brief alone, gathering a team of advisors and experts within your company can ensure that you don't miss any important information. By writing the brief together, you'll be able to work simultaneously on different sections and complete the brief in a smaller amount of time. Can we draw the following conclusion? You must have at lest 2 experts on your team","completion":"Yes, based on the information provided, we can conclude that having at least two experts on your team can be beneficial in writing a creative marketing brief. However, the number of experts can vary depending on the size and complexity of your marketing project. The main purpose of involving experts is to ensure that the marketing brief is comprehensive, accurate, and addresses all relevant aspects of the project. In order to write a creative marketing brief, follow these steps: 1. Assemble a diverse team: Gather a team of advisors and experts within your company from different departments, such as marketing, sales, design, and content. This interdisciplinary approach ensures that you include various perspectives in the brief and increases the chances of delivering a successful marketing campaign. 2. Define the objective: Clearly state the marketing goals and objectives for your project, considering factors like target audience, intended outcome, brand positioning, and the competitive landscape. 3. Provide context: Explain the background and reasoning behind your project, including the company's current market position, any recent changes in the industry, and potential opportunities or threats. 4. Identify the target audience: Describe your target audience in detail, listing their demographics, psychographics, and any specific behavior or needs that your campaign should address. 5. Outline the key message: Develop a clear and compelling key message for your marketing campaign, keeping in mind your target audience and overarching goals. This message should embody the central theme of your campaign and guide subsequent creative output. 6. Establish the tone and style: Specify the overall tone and style you'd like your campaign to have, whether it's humorous, serious, or inspirational. Provide some visual or written examples to give your team a clear idea of what you're aiming for. 7. Detail the deliverables: List all the marketing materials and content formats you plan to create, such as social media posts, blog articles, videos, print materials, and more. Be as precise as possible, including word counts, dimensions, and any production requirements. 8. Set a timeline and budget: Establish a realistic timeline for the completion of each deliverable and the overall project. Allocate a budget for each task and the overall project, keeping in mind any potential contingencies or unforeseen circumstances. 9. Assign responsibilities: Clearly define roles and responsibilities within your team, assigning tasks to specific individuals or departments. This will help to ensure that everyone understands their role in the project and that tasks are completed on time and within budget. 10. Include a feedback and evaluation process: Outline the process for reviewing, revising, and evaluating the marketing materials to ensure they meet the stated objectives and align with your brand identity. This could include regular team meetings, internal or external reviews, and post-project analysis. In conclusion, having at least two experts on your team is certainly a good starting point when writing a creative marketing brief, but the actual number of experts is subject to the size and requirements of your marketing project. Engaging experts from various departments also enhances the depth and accuracy of the marketing brief, improving the overall success of your campaign."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Answer: For example, the penis of a mammal is at most analogous to the penis of a male insect or barnacle . Question: what are penises made out of Answer:","completion":"Penises, like other body parts, are composed of various types of tissues, blood vessels, and muscles. In most mammals, including humans, the penis serves as both a reproductive organ and a means for the expulsion of urine. Though the overall purpose and function of penises may be similar across various species, their anatomical structures may display variations. For example, as you mentioned, the penis of a mammal may be analogous to the penis of a male insect or barnacle in terms of their reproductive role, but their structure, composition, and formation may vary significantly. The main components of the human penis include: 1. Corpora Cavernosa: These are two sponge-like cylindrical tissues that extend along the length of the penis. They are composed of smooth muscle fibers, connective tissue, and sinusoidal spaces that fill with blood during erection. The corpora cavernosa tissues aid in determining the size and rigidity of the penis during erection. 2. Corpus Spongiosum: This is another sponge-like tissue, but it is smaller and runs along the underside of the penis, surrounding the urethra. The corpus spongiosum has a similar composition to the corpora cavernosa, containing smooth muscle fibers, connective tissue, and sinusoidal spaces. Its primary function is to prevent the urethra from being compressed during erection, allowing for the passage of semen and urine. 3. Tunica Albuginea: A thin, fibrous sheath encompassing the corpora cavernosa and corpus spongiosum. It is comprised of a dense network of collagen fibers, which help maintain the shape and rigidity of the penis during erection. The tunica albuginea plays a crucial role in the penile erection mechanism by compressing the veins and restricting blood outflow, thus maintaining an erect state. 4. Blood Vessels and Nerves: The penis is rich in blood vessels and nerves that facilitate its various functions. Arteries and veins transport blood to and from the erectile tissues, providing essential nutrients and oxygen to the cells. Nerves are responsible for transmitting sensory information to the brain during sexual activity and communicating the brain's response to trigger erections. 5. Skin and Fascia: The outermost layer of the penis consists of skin and a loose connective tissue known as the fascia. This sheath-like structure permits flexibility, free movement, and accommodates changes in penile size during erections. Moreover, the skin of the penis contains nerve endings that provide sensory feedback during sexual activity. In conclusion, penises are made up of an intricate combination of tissues, blood vessels, and muscles designed to fulfill both reproductive and urinary functions. While there are similarities in the core functions of penises across different species, the specific structure, composition, and formation may differ significantly, as observed in the comparisons between mammalian and insect penises."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Answer the following question: Information: - The green jersey is a term used in road bicycle racing and Grand Tour stage races in particular. The green jersey is a distinctive racing jersey worn by the leader in a subsidiary competition. - The Tour de France is an annual multiple stage bicycle race primarily held in France, while also occasionally making passes through nearby countries. The race was first organized in 1903 to increase sales for the newspaper \\"L'Auto\\"; which is currently run by the Amaury Sport Organisation. The race has been held annually since its first edition in 1903 except when it was stopped for the two World Wars. As the Tour gained prominence and popularity the race was lengthened and its reach began to extend around the globe. Participation expanded from a primarily French field, as riders from all over the world began to participate in the race each year. The Tour is a UCI World Tour event, which means that the teams that compete in the race are mostly UCI WorldTeams, with the exception of the teams that the organizers invite. - The Great Dividing Range, or the Eastern Highlands, is Australia's most substantial mountain range and the third longest land-based range in the world. The range stretches more than from Dauan Island off the northeastern tip of Queensland, running the entire length of the eastern coastline through New South Wales, then into Victoria and turning west, before finally fading into the central plain at the Grampians in western Victoria. The width of the range varies from about to over . - The Amaury Sport Organisation (ASO) is part of the French media group, EPA (Éditions Philippe Amaury). It organises sporting events including the Tour de France, Vuelta a España and ParisNice professional cycle road races, and the Dakar Rally. In 2008 it began the Central Europe Rally, a rally raid endurance race in Romania and Hungary. - The points classification is a secondary competition in the Tour de France, that started in 1953. Points are given for high finishes in a stage and for winning intermediate sprints, and these are recorded in a points classification. It is considered a sprinters' competition. The leader is indicated by a green jersey which has become a symbol for the points classification in the sense that when a cyclist wins the points classification. - Robbie McEwen ( born 24 June 1972 in Brisbane , Queensland ) is an Australian former professional road bicycle racer . He last rode for Orica - GreenEDGE on the UCI World Tour , . As a triple winner of the Points classification in the Tour de France , at his peak he was arguably the fastest sprinter in the world . A former Australian BMX champion , McEwen switched to road racing in 1990 at 18 . He raced as a professional from 1996 until 2012 . McEwen lives in Australia with his Belgian wife Angélique Pattyn , his son Ewan , and his daughters Elena and Claudia . In 2011 he published an autobiography , One Way Road . McEwen lived a long time in the Belgian town of Everbeek and is fluent in Dutch . He retired from the World Tour after riding the 2012 Tour of California . - The UCI ProTour was a series of road bicycle races in Europe, Australia and Canada organised by the UCI (International Cycling Union). Created by Hein Verbruggen, former president of the UCI, it comprises a number of 'ProTour' cycling teams, each of whom are required to compete in every round of the series. It was initially the basis of a season long competition for rankings points, created for 2005 to replace the UCI Road World Cup series, which ended at the end of the 2004 season (although the World Cup did not include any stage races). The ProTour was the subject of continuing disputes involving the UCI, cycling teams, and the organizers of the world's most prominent bicycle races (most notably, the Grand Tours), and in 2009 and 2010 the ranking element of the ProTour was superseded by the UCI World Ranking. For 2011, the ProTour and World Ranking were fully merged into the UCI World Tour. ProTour status for teams relabelled UCI ProTeams will continue as the highest level of registration, and will carry the right and obligation to participate in all World Tour races. - The UCI World Tour (20092010: \\"UCI World Ranking\\") is the premier annual male elite road cycling tour. It refers to both the tour of 28 events and an annual ranking system based upon performances in these. The World Ranking was launched in 2009, and merged fully with its predecessor the UCI ProTour in 2011. - Brisbane is the capital and most populous city in the Australian state of Queensland, and the third most populous city in Australia. Brisbane's metropolitan area has a population of 2.3 million, and the South East Queensland urban conurbation, centred on Brisbane, encompasses a population of more than 3.4 million. The Brisbane central business district stands on the original European settlement and is situated inside a bend of the Brisbane River, about from its mouth at Moreton Bay. The metropolitan area extends in all directions along the floodplain of the Brisbane River Valley between Moreton Bay and the Great Dividing Range, sprawling across several of Australia's most populous local government areas (LGAs), most centrally the City of Brisbane, which is by far the most populous LGA in the nation. The demonym of Brisbane is Brisbanite. - The points classification is a secondary award category in road bicycle racing. Points are given for high finishes and, in some cases, for winning sprints at certain places along the route, most often called \\"intermediate sprints\\". The points classification is the top prize for many cycling sprinters and is often known as the sprint classification; however, in some stage races these classifications are based on different criteria. What is the relationship between 'robbie mcewen' and 'road bicycle racing'? Answer:","completion":"Robbie McEwen has a profound connection with road bicycle racing. He is an Australian former professional road bicycle racer who had a prolific career competing in some of the most prestigious cycling events globally, including the Tour de France. Robbie McEwen was born on June 24, 1972, in Brisbane, Queensland, and his journey into cycling began with his involvement in BMX racing where he was a champion before switching to road racing in 1990 at the age of 18. He turned professional in 1996 and continued his professional racing career until 2012. One of Robbie McEwen's signature triumphs in road bicycle racing was his triple victory in the Points classification at the Tour de France. The Point classification, symbolized by the green jersey, is a significant part of the Tour de France and other Grand Tour stage races. It is a secondary competition within the race where points are given for high finishes in a stage and for winning intermediate sprints. This competition is particularly suited to sprinters, and hence McEwen's repeated victories in this classification underlined his reputation as one of the fastest sprinters in the world during his prime. McEwen competed in the most elite circuit of road bike racing. This included the UCI ProTour, a series of road bicycle races organised by the International Cycling Union (UCI), which later merged into the UCI World Tour. McEwen's team, the Orica - GreenEdge, was a part of the UCI World Tour, which attests to the level of competition that McEwen was up against. Despite retiring from the World Tour after competing in the 2012 Tour of California, McEwen has remained connected to the sport. His experiences and achievements have made him a renowned figure in the field of road bicycle racing. In summary, Robbie McEwen's relationship with road bicycle racing is extensive, from being a competitor at the highest levels of the sport, excelling particularly in sprint finishes, to being a celebrated figure within the sport even post-retirement. His accomplishments have solidified his status as one of the leading figures in the road bicycle racing domain.

OPTIONS: [+] yes; [+] it is not possible to tell; [+] no;","completion":"[+] yes; Based on the given premise, \\"A Dutch and British cemetery is to be found farther down the hill,\\" we can confidently conclude that it entails the hypothesis \\"Further down the hill, there is a Dutch and British cemetery.\\" Both the premise and the hypothesis convey the same information, but they are structured differently. The premise is expressed in the passive voice, while the hypothesis is in the active voice. The key elements in both sentences are the location (\\"further down the hill\\"), and the existence of a \\"Dutch and British cemetery.\\" Since the premise asserts that such a cemetery is located down the hill, it also inherently supports the same claim made by the hypothesis. The relationship between these two statements is an example of a semantic entailment. Semantic entailment is the idea that if one statement is true, another statement or a series of statements must also be true. In this case, the truth of the premise automatically ensures the validity of the hypothesis since they express the same fact. Consequently, we can answer with certainty that \\"yes,\\" the premise entails the hypothesis in question."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. News article: NEW DELHI: As you read this article, security personnel are swarming all over the tiny hamlet of Tembhali in northern Maharashtra, preparing for the flagging off of India's great UID mission by the prime minister.The Unique ID Authority of India has officially dubbed the initiative \\"Aadhar\\" and UIDAI chairman Nandan Nilekani is all set to tackle possibly the largest IT project, ever undertaken. We at Technoholik got exclusive access to Aadhar's technology centre in Bangalore to figure out whats happening under the hood.The tech can broadly be divided into three areas ie. enrollment, data centre and authentication.The UIDAI will partner with a number of agencies ranging from district collectors' offices to banks as \\"enrollment partners\\" who will be tasked with collecting data.These partners will receive a slick-looking pair of tough briefcases containing neatly packed hardware required for enrollment. A laptop with the Aadhar enrollment software installed along with a fingerprint reader and an iris scanner go into one briefcase while a webcam, a laser printer (for the receipt) and a small monitor fit into the other one. That last bit of hardware is an innovative touch because it's meant purely for the person getting enrolled to verify that the data being entered into the laptop is accurate.While Aadhar may be collaborative in its approach to enrollment, it's taking no chances with its central servers and whats being stored in them. The data centres themselves will be built and maintained by vendors, but access will be strictly controlled solely by the UIDAI at multiple levels. No data can leave the enrollment laptops unencrypted and any attempt to tamper or modify the data will raise an alarm when it is uploaded to the central server. Only once it is validated as being secure will it be accepted for further processing.Then comes the tricky part called \\"de-duplication\\" ie. checking to see if the person has not already enrolled which means comparing his biometric data (iris and ten fingerprints) to that of all the existing IDs. This will require enormous computing power and although Aadhar will have a large \\"grid\\" of networked computers, built using open-source technologies to do these \\"compute jobs\\" , building this grid as the volume grows will be the challenge.Complex algorithms to quickly compare biometrics have also been procured from specialist vendors to be run on this grid. \\"It has never been tried before, so it's the first time and Indians are attempting to do it with the next largest system only about 1/10th the size\\" , says Dr Pramod Varma, chief architect, Aadhar.\\"Once the data comes into the CIDR it never leaves, its like a blackhole\\" , quips Dr Varma. What he means is that in order to protect citizens' privacy, no data will actually leave the Aadhar servers.Outsiders can only \\"query\\" the database for a yes/ no answer to authenticate someone who is quoting an ID, but cannot extract any other information. The authentication API (application programming interface) is publicly available on the Aadhar website, which means any programmer can build this querying ability into a software application in the future. ||||| India's vaunted tech savvy is being put to the test this week as the country embarks on a daunting mission: assigning a unique 12-digit number to each of its 1.2 billion people. The project, which seeks to collect fingerprint and iris scans from all residents and store them in a massive central database of unique IDs, is considered by many specialists the most technologically and logistically complex national identification effort ever attempted. To pull it off, India has recruited tech gurus of Indian origin from around the world, including the co-founder of online photo service Snapfish and employees from Google Inc., Yahoo Inc. and Intel Corp. The country's leaders are pinning their hopes on the program to solve development problems that have persisted despite fast economic growth. They say unique ID numbers will help ensure that government welfare spending reaches the right people, and will allow hundreds of millions of poor Indians to access services like banking for the first time. Critics question whether the project can have as big an impact as its backers promise, given that identity fraud is but one contributor to India's development struggles. Civil-liberties groups say the government is collecting too much personal information without sufficient safeguards. The technology requires transferring large amounts of data between the hinterland and an urban database, leading some to question whether the system will succumb to India's rickety Internet infrastructure. An ambitious national ID program in India is using sophisticated biometric technology to register the country's 1.2 billion citizens. WSJ's Amol Sharma reports. The sign-up effort is already under way in a handful of districts, and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is expected to kick off nationwide enrollment Wednesday. The government hopes to issue the first 100 million unique ID numbers by March and 600 million within four years. The undertaking is the latest chance for India to show it can pull off a massive project after what is widely viewed as its mishandling of next week's Commonwealth Games in New Delhi, where infrastructure and hygiene issues led some nations to threaten withdrawing. To lead the program, Mr. Singh picked Nandan Nilekani, former CEO of Infosys Technologies Ltd., which helped pioneer India's low-cost offshore model of technology services. A native of Bangalore, India's tech hub, and son of a textile-mill manager, the 55-year-old billionaire is trying to infuse some of Infosys's efficiency into a lumbering bureaucracy. \\"You have a whole mass of people who are shut out of society,\\" Mr. Nilekani says. \\"A lack of identity is a big source of exclusion. You're giving them a key to social services.\\" In one early registration drive in Nagaram, a village 30 miles outside the southern city of Hyderabad in Andhra Pradesh state, dozens of people were streaming into a drab government office one recent afternoon to have their fingerprints taken and irises scanned. Many applicants, who ranged from vegetable and rice farmers to real-estate brokers and shopkeepers, had never used a computer much less seen biometric equipment. Local officials had knocked on their doors the night before to tell them about the program. Salekula Anjaiah, a 44-year-old farmer who earns about 40 per month for his family of five, said he hoped the IDs would keep people from cheating the welfare system and getting food rations they don't qualify for. \\"It will take fraud out of the government schemes,\\" said Mr. Anjaiah, who relies on subsidies to feed his family. \\"Then it will be guaranteed I get what I deserve.\\" India has been attempting to improve governance through technology for two decades. Programs have digitized land records, created Web portals for government agencies and computerized tax filing systems. But the unique ID program, dubbed \\"Aadhaar,\\" or \\"foundation\\" in Hindi, is by far the largest and most ambitious effort. Many countries have some form of national ID and a handful use biometrics, but none come close to matching the scale of what India is attempting. Mr. Nilekani started recruiting Indians in the global technology industry in the summer of 2009. These early recruits included Srikanth Nadhamuni, who had spent 16 years as a technology engineer for companies like Sun Microsystems and Intel. Word spread in Silicon Valley that Mr. Nilekani wanted help, and by the fall a few others arrived in Bangalore. The team rented an apartment at a gated community on the eastern outskirts of the city to use as an office. Everyone worked for free. The group worked in the living room. They bought a few tables, two whiteboards and some markers. For food, they went to Mr. Nadhamuni's house nearby, where his wife served rice cakes, lentil crepes and lemon rice. Visitors had to use a wooden shoe rack as a bench since there weren't enough chairs. The team came up with a plan to capture a mix of biometric information—digital photos, fingerprints and iris scans—as well as names, addresses, genders and dates of birth. Since they knew they wouldn't have a second chance to collect the data, the engineers say they erred on getting too much information, including all 10 fingerprints instead of just one. The government would issue the random 12-digit numbers by mail. Passports, driver's licenses, ration cards and government health-insurance cards could either have the numbers printed on them or embedded electronically. Enlarge Image Close Bloomberg News Project head Nandan Nilekani says 'a lack of identity is a big source of exclusion' in India today. That still left a major hurdle: How to verify that a number and a person actually match? Retailers, like banks and cell-phone companies, could install fingerprint readers and match the data over the Internet. But getting readers and Internet access to the 500,000, often remote locations where subsidized food is distributed to the poor would be costly and impractical. The Indian government is expected to spend as much as 250 billion over five years on programs aimed at the poor, including subsidies for food, diesel, fertilizer and jobs. But 40% of the benefits, as the system now stands, will go to the wrong people or to \\"ghosts\\" with fake identification papers, according to a report by brokerage firm CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets. Today's ration cards, for example, are issued on paper, and are relatively easy to forge or doctor. India Real Time Who's Who in Nilekani's UID Dream Team In November 2009, Mr. Nilekani wrote to tech companies such as Intel, Google, Oracle Corp. and Yahoo, asking them to send Indian-origin engineers to contribute to the cause, either on paid sabbatical or as volunteers. More than 20 people joined the effort. The government has approved about 670 million for the project so far, and the entire cost will likely be \\"several billion dollars,\\" says Mr. Nilekani. By early this year, the Bangalore team moved into a real office at a technology park. Mr. Nilekani became a traveling salesman for the project, taking a PowerPoint presentation on the road and making the case for unique IDs with government agencies and regulators across the country. In his pitch, Mr. Nilekani focused in part on reducing fraud, but also on the potential for bringing into the financial system the roughly two-thirds of Indian adults who don't have bank accounts. The poor often have few or no documents to prove who they are or where they live. The unique ID would solve that problem, says Mr. Nilekani, and could be linked to banks' plans to offer \\"no-frills\\" accounts, with no minimum balance and low fees, as well as nascent money-transfer services via mobile phones. Scanning the World India's unique ID program is the largest and most logistically challenging identification project in the world. A look at other such schemes. Germany Now issues paper ID cards, but plans to replace with electronic cards embedded with fingerprints and a six-digit PIN number that can be used to digitally sign forms. Nigeria Creating a national database with biometric data on citizens. Government hopes that 100 million out of 150 million Nigerians will be issued a unique ID card in three years. Bosnia-Herzegovina National ID cards were issued in 2002, partly to encourage unity following ethnic strife. The technology involves a bar code, a single fingerprint and a photograph. About 2.5 million IDs had been issued as of May. Malaysia Smart cards hold personal data and a thumbprint, and can be used to pay road tolls and access ATM machines. Oman One objective of smart-card program is to track immigrants, including workers from Pakistan, Iran, India and elsewhere. U.S. The US-VISIT program collects digital fingerprints and photos from foreign travelers as a way to keep immigration violators and criminals from entering the country. It has over 100 million records. Source: CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets; WSJ Research In the village of Nagaram, officials say they have been signing up 200 people per day, and as of early September, had made it through half of the 4,500 residents. The goal is for hundreds of villages and towns in Andhra Pradesh to start enrollment soon, and to reach 30 million people state-wide by the end of the year. Signing up is technically voluntary, but any government agency or company will be allowed to require a unique ID as identity proof, an approach critics say amounts to a de facto mandate for people to enroll. The process is slow going, taking anywhere from 15 to 30 minutes per person. Capturing iris scans with binocular-like devices is tricky and can take several minutes. Administrators had to hold one elderly man's eyelids open to get a good image. In addition to biometrics, residents provided an array of personal information, including their caste, religion and cellphone number. State agencies and companies who register people can gather whatever information they deem appropriate. Such vast data gathering rankles privacy advocates who say demographic details can potentially be used to discriminate in the services that companies offer customers or government agencies offer citizens. Another concern is that marketers will find ways to build profiles of people based on how they use their IDs—tracking where people bank, which hospitals they have checked into and who their cellphone providers are, for example. \\"You will basically be creating these wonderful resources for people to mine,\\" says Sudhir Krishnaswamy, a law professor at the National University of Juridical Sciences in Kolkata. Mr. Nilekani says he has drafted legislation to address the concerns of critics. Under the bill, which has been approved by India's cabinet but must still be passed by parliament, the government would have to ensure that the information it collects \\"is secured and protected against any loss or unauthorized access.\\" Anyone who discloses private information or hacks into the ID database would face up to three years in prison and stiff fines. Mr. Nilekani said India also needs a broader privacy law. Andhra Pradesh officials say early data already show how unique IDs could reduce corruption at the state's 43,000 ration shops, which distribute subsidized food to the poor. At one shop, records showed rations were being delivered to 330 families, but after the IDs were rolled out, only 203 families claimed benefits by placing their finger on a scanner at the shop. State officials suspect the shop owner had been making up fake accounts to divert some of the food into the black market. Jejjayila Venkatesh, a 35-year-old Nagaram resident who earns 50 a month in a local government job, said he isn't concerned about privacy. He just hopes the ID will help him open a bank account and get a driver's license, which he has had difficulty obtaining thus far, and maintain his benefits when he goes out of state for work: \\"This will help me prove my identity wherever I roam.\\" —Vibhuti Agarwal contributed to this article.

This number will be used to help people get access to important things like government support, education, and bank accounts. It is a huge project because there are 1.2 billion people in India, and it will require very advanced technology to make sure that every person gets a unique number. To do this project, India hired talented people from many technology companies like Google and Intel.

However, it is not to be confused with gasoline, especially in North America, where the term gasoline is often shortened in colloquial usage to gas. is oil and natural gas the same thing?","completion":"No, oil and natural gas are not the same thing, although they are both hydrocarbon-based fossil fuels formed from the remains of ancient marine plants and animals. They are found together in underground reservoirs, but they have different properties, uses, and methods of extraction. Here is a detailed comparison of oil and natural gas: 1. Composition: Oil is a liquid hydrocarbon, primarily composed of carbon and hydrogen, with some additional impurities like sulfur, nitrogen, and oxygen. It mainly consists of large hydrocarbon molecules and is also referred to as petroleum or crude oil. On the other hand, natural gas is a gaseous hydrocarbon, primarily composed of methane (CH4), which is a much lighter molecule than those found in oil. It may also contain small amounts of other gases such as ethane, propane, and butane. 2. Formation: Both oil and natural gas are formed from the remains of tiny marine organisms such as plankton and algae, which accumulate on the ocean floor over millions of years. Over time, the organic material is buried under layers of sediment, subjected to heat and pressure, and eventually transformed into either crude oil, natural gas, or both. The difference in their formation primarily lies in the temperature and pressure conditions they undergo. Higher temperatures and pressures favor the formation of natural gas, while lower temperatures and pressures are more conducive to oil formation. 3. Extraction: Crude oil is typically extracted using drilling techniques, and the liquid is pumped to the surface. Once extracted, it is transported to refineries to be processed into various petroleum products such as gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, heating oil, and lubricants. Natural gas, being a lighter and less viscous substance, often flows to the surface on its own once a well is drilled. It can also be extracted from oil wells as a byproduct during the production of crude oil. Once extracted, natural gas is typically processed to remove impurities and then transported through pipelines to end-users. 4. Uses: Oil is mainly used as a fuel for transportation (gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel), heating, and for generating electricity. Crude oil is also the primary raw material for producing various petrochemicals and plastics utilized in countless industrial and consumer goods. Natural gas, on the other hand, is primarily used for heating, cooking, and power generation, as well as a feedstock for the chemical and fertilizer industries. It is considered a cleaner fuel than oil, as it produces fewer greenhouse gases and pollutants when burned. 5. Environmental Impact: Both oil and natural gas contribute to greenhouse gas emissions, but natural gas is considered a cleaner alternative due to its higher hydrogen-to-carbon ratio, which results in lower carbon dioxide emissions when combusted. However, methane, the primary component of natural gas, is a potent greenhouse gas with a global warming potential much higher than carbon dioxide. Methane leaks during extraction and transportation of natural gas can offset its environmental benefits over other fossil fuels. Additionally, oil spills, such as those resulting from tanker accidents or well blowouts, can have devastating environmental impacts on marine and coastal ecosystems. In summary, while oil and natural gas both originate from similar sources and are commonly found together underground, they are different in terms of their composition, extraction processes, uses, and environmental impacts. They each serve distinct roles in the global energy mix and cannot be considered the same thing."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

As expected, it was about 1,000 degrees there (Celsius or Fahrenheit, you pick – either way, that’s way too hot). Welcome to Florida in July. 😀 We would have melted completely but fortunately, the house was air conditioned and they had some fans outside. I really wanted to see a few of the polydactyl cats 3 who live there and sure enough, there are plenty roaming around the place – and by “roaming”, I mean laying around sleeping as cats do. Cats normally have 4 toes on their back feet and 5 on the front but these polydactyl cats mostly have 5 on the back and 6 on the front, thanks to a genetic mutation. Their front paws are noticeably larger and look like they have mittens on. In addition to extra toes, they also have cat condos, complete with shutters on the windows for decorative purposes to match the main house and there are tiny cat houses scattered around the property for shelter and privacy. And if that’s not enough, they have free reign over the main house too and clearly don’t read the signs that say not to sit or lay on the furniture. These cats have a good deal. Hemingway bought this enormous home sitting on prime real estate for a whopping 8,000 back in the early 1930s in the middle of the Great Depression. At 16 feet above sea level, it sits on the second-highest point on the island and was the first house to have indoor plumbing and a swimming pool.

Here's my step-by-step reasoning: 1. The title of the review is negative, as the customer is disappointed that the CD only has two songs they like. 2. They describe the first song, 'Poisoning,' as only being alright for the first minute and a half. This indicates dissatisfaction because they find that the song loses appeal after a short time. 3. The customer says the second song, 'Send Your Regrets,' is amazing, but unfortunately, all the other songs sound like these two without the positive aspects. This shows dissatisfaction as they find the rest of the album uninteresting and repetitive. 4. They only give the product two stars, which is a low rating and indicates dissatisfaction. The rating is based on the two songs they actually like. 5. The reviewer suggests that the album is worth a buy if the listener wants songs that all sound alike. This implies they find the album lacking in variety and creativity, further pointing towards dissatisfaction. 6. The customer questions the appeal of the trend of bands producing songs that sound alike. This highlights their disapproval or dissatisfaction with the current music trend. In summary, the reviewer is dissatisfied with the product, as they only like two songs, find the rest repetitive, and give it a low rating."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Question: \\"Where are glaciers not found?\\" Context: \\"The permanent snow cover necessary for glacier formation is affected by factors such as the degree of slope on the land, amount of snowfall and the winds. Glaciers can be found in all latitudes except from 20° to 27° north and south of the equator where the presence of the descending limb of the Hadley circulation lowers precipitation so much that with high insolation snow lines reach above 6,500 m (21,330 ft). Between 19˚N and 19˚S, however, precipitation is higher and the mountains above 5,000 m (16,400 ft) usually have permanent snow.\\" Answer: A:","completion":"Based on the given context, glaciers are not found in certain regions primarily due to the specific climatic conditions and topographical factors that influence the formation and sustenance of glaciers. Notably, glaciers cannot be found in the latitudinal range of 20° to 27°, both north and south of the equator. This is because the descending limb of the Hadley circulation in these areas significantly reduces precipitation, causing the snow lines to reach above 6,500 meters (21,330 feet). With high insolation (the amount of solar radiation reaching the Earth's surface) in these regions, it becomes highly unlikely for glaciers to form or persist. Hadley circulation is a large-scale pattern of atmospheric circulation in which warm air rises near the equator, cools as it travels poleward at high altitude, descends as cool dry air, and then warms as it moves towards the equator. In the specific latitudinal range mentioned, the presence of this descending limb leads to very low levels of precipitation, which, coupled with high insolation, makes it nearly impossible for the permanent snow cover necessary for glacier formation to exist. However, between 19°N and 19°S, the situation is slightly different. Here, the precipitation levels are higher, and as a result, mountains with elevations above 5,000 meters (16,400 feet) typically have permanent snow cover. This makes it possible for glaciers to form and survive at these higher altitudes in the regions close to the 19°N and 19°S latitudes. Moreover, the presence or absence of glaciers is also influenced by other factors such as the angle of the slope of the terrain, the amount of snowfall received annually, and prevailing wind patterns. For instance, a steep slope can hinder the accumulation of sufficient snow required for glacier formation, whereas gently sloping terrain is more favorable for snow accumulation. In summary, glaciers are not found in areas between latitudes 20° to 27°, north and south of the equator, where the combination of low precipitation due to the descending limb of the Hadley circulation and high insolation makes it difficult for permanent snow cover to form and persist. Furthermore, other factors such as the degree of slope on the land, the amount of snowfall, and wind patterns play a role in determining whether or not glaciers can form and survive in any given region."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Victory Tour of 1984 headlined the Jacksons and showcased Jackson's new solo material to more than two million Americans. It was the last tour he did with his brothers. Following controversy over the concert's ticket sales, Jackson donated his share of the proceeds, an estimated 3 to 5 million, to charity. His charitable work continued with the release of \\"We Are the World\\" (1985), co-written with Lionel Richie, which raised money for the poor in the US and Africa. It earned 63 million, and became one of the best-selling singles of all time, with 20 million copies sold. It won four Grammys for 1985, including Song of the Year for Jackson and Richie as its writers. The project's creators received two special American Music Awards honors: one for the creation of the song and another for the USA for Africa idea. Jackson, Jones, and promoter Ken Kragan received special awards for their roles in the song's creation.Jackson collaborated with Paul McCartney in the early 1980s, and learned that McCartney was making 40 million a year from owning the rights to other artists' songs. By 1983, Jackson had begun buying publishing rights to others' songs, but he was careful with his acquisitions, only bidding on a few of the dozens that were offered to him. Jackson's early acquisitions of music catalogs and song copyrights such as the Sly Stone collection included \\"Everyday People\\" (1968), Len Barry's \\"1-2-3\\" (1965), and Dion DiMucci's \\"The Wanderer\\" (1961) and \\"Runaround Sue\\" (1961). In 1984 Robert Holmes à Court announced he was selling the ATV Music Publishing catalog comprising the publishing rights to nearly 4000 songs, including most of the Beatles' material. In 1981, McCartney had been offered the catalog for £20 million (40 million). Jackson submitted a bid of 46 million on November 20, 1984.

The sentence presents a clearly unfavorable view of the movie being discussed. Several negative connotations within the sentence help in identifying and supporting this conclusion. 1. \\"Opaque\\": This word is often used to describe something that is difficult to understand or interpret. Its use in this context indicates that the movie is not clear or easy to follow, which is typically undesirable in film. 2. \\"Self-indulgent\\": This term suggests that the movie was created with the primary intent of fulfilling the filmmaker's personal desires or fantasies rather than making a good film for the audience to enjoy. This discredits the movie, implying it is not focused on delivering a quality or engaging experience for the viewers. 3. \\"Just plain goofy\\": The phrase \\"just plain\\" is used here to emphasize the writer's frustration and dissatisfaction with the level of goofiness in the film. \\"Goofy\\" can be interpreted as silly, frivolous, or foolish. While some movies are intentionally and successfully goofy, the author uses this as a criticism, implying that the degree of goofiness in the movie is out of place and detracts from the overall quality of the film. All these negative descriptions express the author's disapproval and dissatisfaction with the movie.

Born on December 22, 1949, in Douglas, Isle of Man, Robin Gibb became well-known for his contributions to the iconic Bee Gees alongside his brothers Maurice and Barry Gibb. Throughout their career, the trio achieved numerous accolades, such as inductions into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Songwriters Hall of Fame. Robin Gibb succumbed to his long battle with cancer at the age of 62 in London, England. His health issues initially emerged in August 2010 when he was admitted to a hospital for severe abdominal pain. Later, in October 2011, he was diagnosed with liver and colorectal cancer. Despite undergoing aggressive chemotherapy treatments and several surgeries, the cancer spread to other parts of his body, including the liver. Over time, Robin's health deteriorated, and he eventually fell into a coma in April 2012 due to complications of pneumonia. Miraculously, Robin briefly emerged from his coma in mid-April 2012, providing a moment of hope for his family, friends, and fans. However, the cancer ultimately proved to be too aggressive, and Robin Gibb passed away at his home in Thame, Oxfordshire, England, on May 20, 2012. Robin Gibb's death had a profound impact on the music world, as he was not only the co-creator of the distinct Bee Gees sound but also a talented singer and songwriter.

As punishment for his failure, Zophael kills the assassin and starts going after Danyael himself with an extendable bladed weapon (the blade can be turned into a three-pronged hook) with which he plans to use to remove Danyael's heart, killing him for good. However, Danyael is protected by Gabriel, a now-human fallen angel who killed Danyael's father and performed many misdeeds. After being defeated by Danyael's mother, Gabriel was turned into a human as punishment. He has spent eighteen years as a human, and realized how wrong he was in the past so has now switched sides.Zophael manages to convince Danyael's girlfriend Maggie to work with him on killing Danyael, but she realizes she's on the wrong side and tries to shoot the angel. It has little effect on Zophael, and he tells her what he is. Frightened, Maggie agrees to help him, and the two catch up to Danyael on a Native American reservation, where he is going to confront Pyriel, another angel who wants to overthrow God. Danyael briefly meets Mary, a Native American woman (first introduced as a child in the first film). Mary informs Danyael that she dreamed of his coming, and that she believes he will be victorious against Pyriel. After parting from Mary, Danyael is attacked by Zophael, crashing Maggie's truck and badly injuring her. He then faces off against Danyael in battle, and seemingly defeats him by impaling his chest with a motorcycle tailpipe, but the angel gets back up and uses his weapon to impale Danyael from behind.

They are sometimes called long-spinneret ground spiders. - Mesothelae is a suborder of spiders (order Araneae) that includes a single living (extant) family, Liphistiidae, and a number of extinct families. This suborder is thought to form the sister group to all other living spiders, and retain ancestral characters, such as a segmented abdomen with spinnerets in the middle and two pairs of book lungs. Members of Liphistiidae are medium to large spiders with eight eyes grouped on a tubercle. They are only found in China, Japan, and southeast Asia. - The Thomisidae are a family of spiders, including about 175 genera and over 2,100 species. The common name crab spider is often applied to species in this family, but is also applied loosely to many other species of spiders. Among the Thomisidae, \\"crab spider\\" refers most often to the familiar species of \\"flower crab spiders\\", though not all members of the family are limited to ambush hunting in flowers. - The Entelegynae or entelegynes are a subgroup of araneomorph spiders, one of the two main groups into which the araneomorphs are divided. Almost all members of this group, unlike most members of Haplogynae (the other main group), have eight eyes, and females have a genital plate. However, some entelegyne species have no (or reduced) eyes, and six-eyed spiders do occur, for example in the genus \\"Lygromma\\" (Prodidomidae, Gnaphosoidea). - The Mygalomorphae or mygalomorphs are an infraorder of spiders. The name is derived from the Greek \\"mugal\\", meaning \\"shrew\\", plus \\"morph\\" meaning form or shape. An older name for the group is Orthognatha, derived from the orientation of the fangs which point straight down and do not cross each other (as they do in the araneomorphs). - The Dionycha are a phylogenetic group of spiders ( Araneomorphae : Entelegynae ) with about 10,000 species . 17 families belong to this group , amongst others : Salticidae ( jumping spiders ) , Gnaphosoidea , Thomisidae ( crab spiders ) , and the Clubionidae . Spiders in this group have better senses ( sight , hearing ) than others , some even show courtship dances and songs . The Dionycha probably evolved from the web - building Trionycha . Unlike these , the Dionycha have only two instead of three tarsal claws . The central third claw of the Trionycha is responsible for tracking the silk thread . Instead of this claw , Dionycha have dense tufts of scupula hairs that produce strong adhesion , enabling some species to climb glass . Most species hunt their prey instead of building webs , although some species of Trionycha ( members of Lycosoidea ) also hunt . There are no cribellate members in the Dionycha . The monophyly of the Dionycha has been disputed . Today it is thought that the reduction of the third claw evolved several times independently . - Lygromma is a spider genus of Central and South America. There are species with eight, six (e.g. \\"L. senoculatum\\", \\"L. valencianum\\") and no eyes. The eyeless \\"L. anops\\" is endemic to Galapagos, while the not closely related blind \\"L. gertschi\\" is found only on Jamaica. - Tarantulas comprise a group of large and often hairy arachnids belonging to the Theraphosidae family of spiders, of which approximately 900 species have been identified. This article only describes members of Theraphosidae, although some other members of the same suborder are commonly referred to as \\"tarantulas\\". Except in cases of anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction) no species of tarantula are dangerous to humans, and some species have become popular in the exotic pet trade. - Opisthothelae is a taxon within Order Araneae, consisting of the Mygalomorphae and the Araneomorphae, but excluding the Mesothelae. Opisthothelae is sometimes presented as an unranked clade and sometimes as a suborder of the Araneae. In the latter case, Mygalomorphae and Araneomorphae are treated as infraorders. - Araneomorphae (sometimes referred to as Labidognatha) is an infraorder of spiders. They are distinguished by having fangs that oppose each other and cross in a pinching action, in contrast to the Mygalomorphae (tarantulas and their close kin), which have fangs that are nearly parallel in alignment. Both Araneomorphae and Mygalomorphae belong to the suborder Opisthothelae, which comprises nearly all extant species of spider. Mesothelae, the only other suborder in Aranea, includes only about 100 living species. - The Gnaphosoidea or gnaphosoids are a superfamily of araneomorph spiders with seven families. A 2014 study did not find the group to be monophyletic. Given the paragraphs above, decide what entity has the relation 'instance of' with 'taxon'. Answer:","completion":"Haplogynae, Prodidomidae, Mesothelae, Thomisidae, Entelegynae, Mygalomorphae, Dionycha, Lygromma, Tarantulas, Opisthothelae, Araneomorphae, and Gnaphosoidea."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write down the solution for this math problem: Solve -24*l - 13*l - 74 = 0 for l.","completion":"To solve the equation -24*l - 13*l - 74 = 0 for l, we will follow these steps: Step 1: Combine like terms. We have two terms with the variable l: -24*l and -13*l. We will combine these terms by adding their coefficients. -24*l - 13*l = (-24 - 13) * l = -37 * l Step 2: Rewrite the equation. Now our equation looks like this after combining like terms: -37*l - 74 = 0 Step 3: Isolate the variable term. To isolate the variable term, we want to get rid of the constant term, which is -74. We can do this by adding 74 to both sides of the equation: -37*l - 74 + 74 = 0 + 74 -37*l = 74 Step 4: Solve for l. To solve for l, we need to get it alone on one side of the equation. Right now, we have -37 times l. To undo this multiplication, we'll divide both sides of the equation by -37: (-37*l) / -37 = 74 / -37 l = -2 So the solution to the equation -24*l - 13*l - 74 = 0 is l = -2."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Answer the following question: Given the background: Organisms can use different strategies to increase their reproduction rate. Altricial organisms are helpless at birth, and their parents give them a lot of care. This care is often seen in bird species. ( Figure below ). Altricial birds are usually born blind and without feathers. Compared to precocial organisms, altricial organisms have a longer period of development before they reach maturity. Precocial organisms, such as the geese shown below, can take care of themselves at birth and do not require help from their parents ( Figure below ). In order to reproduce as much as possible, altricial and precocial organisms must use very different strategies. and the situation: A female goose now has a large family of chicks, the chicks mostly fend for themselves and can move around almost immediately after being born. A short way away a female dog gives birth to a litter of puppies. These on the other hand are defenseless, cant really move and are blind. They require extensive care from their mother. Answer the following question: given a new species of animal is helpless at birth, it needs constant attention and care from a parent and is completely defensive, will this animal be categorized as precocial or altricial?

Q:Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Tulou, the special residential architecture of Fujian Province was included on the UNESCO's World Heritage List during the 32ndsession of the World Heritage Committee in Quebec, Canada. In the fourth century, Han Chinese living in the Central Plains area began to migrate south, gradually gathering in Fujian and forming the Hakka communities. As a defence against enemies, the Hakkas chose to live in compact communities, and the tulou was their preferred houses. Tens of thousands of such earthen structures were constructed in Fujian Province. Most tulous are to be found in the valleys, surrounded by high mountains, and some are in the depths of the great mountains. Most are three to four stories high, and look like circular blockhouses . Rooms on the first floor are used as kitchens, rooms on the second floor are used as barns , and rooms on the third and fourth floors are for bedrooms and living rooms. For defensive purposes, the rooms on the first floor have no windows. Raw materials for the tulou were obtained locally. Their main building material was a mixture of clay, sand, lime and water, and egg whites, brown sugar and rice water were added as adhesive agents . It was then mixed to form the walls. Once they dried, the walls were so hard that driving a nail into them would have been difficult. Fir branches, which are extremely strong and do not rot, were used to strengthen them, and many centuries later they have remained their original look. Tulous are located in a region where earthquakes happen frequently, and their circular construction helps them resist the regular shocks. The proven design even inspired one famous Peruvian architect, who paid several visits to Yongding, to build a tulou back home. Not long after, an earthquake struck only 10 kilometers away, and while all the houses around the earthen building fell down, his tulou remained. Options: A Hakkas built tulous when they lived in the Central Plains area B Raw materials for the tulou were obtained from far away C It is difficult to dig a hole into the walls of the tulou D Fir branches may help them resist the regular shocks Answer: C It is difficult to dig a hole into the walls of the tulou Question: A:","completion":"Which of the following is true about the construction and features of Fujian tulou?

However, I have to acknowledge that no diet is perfect for every single person and Mediterranean diet is no exception to that rule. The Mediterranean Diet is not for everyone. There may be some people who find that they have negative reactions to some of the foods on the diet – others may find that it simply is not suitable for their lifestyle. However, it is an excellent choice for most people because the health benefits are tremendous. Lower blood pressure, reduced cholesterol levels, reduced risk of diseases such as cancer, Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, diabetes and much more. The diet is based on consuming wholesome fresh foods in their natural state and by cooking them in a healthy ways. Red meats are eaten only on occasion; sugar, processed foods filled with additives, fast foods, and junk food, which are the cause of so many illnesses in today’s world are simply not eaten. It should not be news that most health problems in the US can be attributed to a poor diet and a sedentary lifestyle. The Mediterranean diet solves both problems, if you let it. It provides the healthy nutritious foods your body needs for energy and well-being; plus, it incorporates exercise to solve the sedentary lifestyle issue.

Given the question: Build a movie plot around this: How many times Lyme disease people are greater than AIDS and West Nile Virus combined? Ten times greater The answer is:","completion":"Title: \\"Outbreak Unchained: The Lyme Revelation\\" Genre: Science-Fiction/Thriller Setting: A near-future world in which Lyme disease has become a pandemic, affecting ten times as many people as AIDS and West Nile Virus combined. Society faces complete collapse as the disease spreads at an alarming rate, and the once bustling cities lie in ruins. Plot: Act 1: Introducing the World and the Characters. Dr. Jennifer Adams, a talented but haunted virologist, is working day and night with her dwindling team at the Center for Disease Control (CDC) in Atlanta, desperately trying to find a cure for the rapidly spreading Lyme disease pandemic. Ten times more people are getting infected with the disease compared to those suffering from AIDS and West Nile Virus combined, pushing humanity to the brink of extinction. Enter Jack Thompson, a grizzled and determined former special forces soldier turned private security consultant who has lost his wife and daughter to the disease. Desperate for answers and fuelled by revenge, he follows a lead about a mysterious biotech corporation called Genesis Labs, which was rumored to be developing a revolutionary vaccine for Lyme disease but had unexpectedly shut down its operations. Act 2: Discovering the Hidden Truth. Dr. Adams and Jack's paths cross as both follow clues leading to Genesis Labs. Together, they navigate through the lawless and dangerous world, evading Lyme-infected people and cutthroat scavengers. As they grow closer, they find solace and hope in each other's company amid the pervasive bleakness. Upon reaching the abandoned Genesis Labs facility, they make a shocking discovery. The corporation had developed a highly effective Lyme disease vaccine but had intentionally withheld it for nefarious purposes: to create an artificially-induced apocalypse that would wipe out most of the world's population, only to later introduce the vaccine at a premium, allowing them to profit and essentially control the remaining population. Act 3: Fighting for a Cure and Redemption. A morally conflicted scientist who had worked at Genesis Labs, Dr. Simon Reeves, leaks vital information to Jennifer and Jack, revealing the whereabouts of the hidden vaccine stockpiles. They realize that they are pawns in a bigger game and that they are the only ones who can expose Genesis Labs' sinister plan and save humanity from the Lyme disease menace. With the help of Dr. Reeves and a group of trusted allies, Jennifer and Jack embark on a mission to infiltrate Genesis Labs' secret underground facility and retrieve the vaccine. As the clock ticks and infected hordes draw nearer, they face challenges and betrayals from unexpected sources. Through their shared pain and purpose, their bond grows stronger, and their determination to succeed becomes unbreakable. The climax involves a gripping confrontation with the ruthless leaders of Genesis Labs and a relentless fight for survival against overwhelming odds. Dr. Adams, Jack, and their team engage in a fierce battle to retrieve the vaccine and expose the corporation's evil deeds to the world. In the end, Jennifer and Jack emerge victorious, and the vaccine is distributed globally in the nick of time, saving millions of lives and averting complete human extinction. Genesis Labs is dismantled, and its leaders are prosecuted for their heinous acts. Epilogue. The world begins a slow and arduous journey towards recovery. Jennifer and Jack, having found love amid chaos, dedicate their lives to rebuilding society and contributing to the scientific community. Their personal triumph signifies the enduring nature of hope, love, and the human spirit in the face of unspeakable adversity. \\"Outbreak Unchained: The Lyme Revelation\\" would not only be a thrilling and engaging science-fiction movie but also serve as a warning about the potential consequences of unregulated corporate greed and the importance of unity in overcoming seemingly insurmountable challenges."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The sleeve - made of material that mimics heart muscle - hugs the outside of the heart and squeezes it, mimicking the action of cardiac muscle. The early study, published in Science Translational Medicine, shows the concept works on pig hearts. The British Heart Foundation describes it as a \\"novel approach\\" that requires further trials. Over half a million people in the UK have heart failure. It is a long-term condition that gradually gets worse over time. For people with the illness, the heart is unable to pump blood around the body properly - most commonly because cardiac muscle has been damaged, after a heart attack, for example. Scientists based at Harvard and the Boston Children's Hospital, and in Leeds, say their soft sleeve was inspired by the actions and structure of real heart muscle. The silicon-based device stiffens or relaxes when inflated with pressurised air. Fixing it around six pig hearts, scientists found they were able to synchronise the sleeve with each heart's shape and movements. The study shows the robotic sleeve helped boost the amount of blood being pumped around the body. And when the hearts stopped beating, the sleeves helped restore blood flow. Currently, mechanical devices can be implanted in the heart to help it pump. But because they are in direct contact with heart tissue, the body can react to them - leading to the risk of dangerous blood clots. Researchers argue their sleeve could help cut this risk by \\"hugging\\" the outside of the heart rather than being implanted inside it. But they acknowledge their research is still at an early stage and much longer-term animal studies and then human studies would need to be carried out before it could be used in patients. Christopher Allen, senior cardiac nurse at the British Heart Foundation, said: \\"People living with end-stage heart failure are in desperate need of symptom relief, and some will even require a heart transplant. \\"We currently don't have enough hearts available to meet the needs of those who require a heart transplant, so we're always looking for innovative new ways to buy time to give people the best chance possible of receiving a new heart and a new lease of life. \\"This early research suggests a novel approach to help support heart function, and it will be interesting to see if this translates successfully in human trials in the future.\\" This article was about:","completion":"This article is about a novel medical device - a robotic sleeve made of silicon-based material inspired by the structure and action of heart muscle.

This technology was successfully tested on pig hearts. The innovative aspect of this approach is that by working outside the heart, the device may minimize the risk of blood clots associated with traditional implants. However, the researchers acknowledge further long term animal studies and human trials are needed. The British Heart Foundation commended this development due to the shortage of hearts available for transplants and the potential relief it could provide to patients with end-stage heart failure."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This special kind of art can take the form of paintings, sculptures, cloth or even stickers. Street art has become part of a culture which can be seen around the world. Now, even art museums and galleries are collecting the works of street artists. People have different thoughts about street art. Some think street art is bad, but others see this art as a rich form of non-traditional cultural expression. Street art began in New York City in the 1960s. Young adults would use paint in special cans to spray their \\"tag\\" on walls and train cars around the city. This tag was a name they created to show off themselves and their artwork. This style of drawing and writing became known as graffiti . Graffiti art showed that young people wanted to rebel against the rules. They traveled around cities to make paintings that everyone could see. Street artists do their work for some reasons. A number of them choose street art because it is closer to the everyday life. What they enjoy most is the freedom of expressing themselves which street art permits . One well-known street artist is Swoon. She cuts out paper images of people and puts them on walls. Swoon didn't start her career as a street artist. She studied art but, as time went on, got bored with the works she saw in museums. Then she fell in love with graffiti. The people in New York enjoy Swoon's strong and interesting style. Some museums have already bought some of her works. Nowadays street art has become part of a world-wide culture. It is supported by websites, artist groups, books and magazines. Question: According to the writer, the artists love street art because _ .

The Disappeared are those who were abducted, murdered and secretly buried by republicans during the Troubles. Mrs McConville's body was found at a beach in County Louth in 2003. By Alison MillarProducer/Director of The Disappeared \\"I remember as a child being at an agricultural fair with my family. Between the latest tractor and cutting edge machinery were stalls selling novelty jeweller. This year I knew exactly what I wanted - an 'Elvis' necklace. In my excitement to get the necklace, I ran ahead, but in the busy crowds I lost my mum. It felt like an eternity before my mum came to find me in the security hut. I have never been so happy to see her in my life. Way before this film began, I saw the footage of the McConville children appealing for their mum to come home. It broke my heart. Darragh MacIntyre and I spent almost a year getting to know the families of the Disappeared - we listened to one tragic tale after another. Years of silence inflicted on them by the fear of the IRA had caused a pain that was as raw as the memory of the last moment they saw their loved ones alive. I saw a profound sadness in the eyes of those families who are waiting for their loved ones remains to be found. A crucial part of the grieving process has been removed and emptiness will always be in their hearts. \\" One of her 10 children, Agnes, described her mother's abduction, which happened in 1972. \\"We could hear her squealing, still squealing and looked over at the banister on Divis Flats (in west Belfast) and there she was getting thrown into the back of a van,\\" she said. \\"That was the last time that we saw her.\\" Agnes' brother Michael also recalled seeing his widowed mother being taken away. \\"All of us were just wrapped around her, all crying and squealing,\\" he said. \\"I remember one of the girls (who abducted her) talking, who I knew because she hadn't got a mask on, she used to be a neighbour of ours, her and her sister were there. \\"They kept trying to calm us down, because they knew us and they knew us by name.\\" In the programme, Mr Adams is asked about allegations that he ordered the murder of Mrs McConville. He is also asked about his knowledge of the fate of two IRA men who also disappeared the same year. \\"No, I had no act or part to play in either the abduction, the killing or the burial of Jean McConville or indeed any of these other individuals,\\" he said. \\"My focus is in trying to do what I can as an individual to bring those remaining bodies to the families who grieve them, who want a burial place to go to. \\"Of course I regret, one wouldn't be a thinking, living human being if one didn't have regrets. All of us bear a responsibility, those of us who are in leadership, and I've never shirked that.\\" Although the remains of some of the Disappeared have been recovered, seven have never been found. One of them is Columba McVeigh, a 19-year-old from Donaghmore in County Tyrone, who was abducted and murdered by the IRA in 1975. His sister, Dympna, told the programme: \\"I never did anything to the IRA, neither did my mum, so why are they torturing us? Thirty-eight years on and they're still torturing us and that's what it is.

Multi-choice problem: Would you say that these questions are the same? Pick your answer from: * no * yes","completion":"Celebrating birthdays is a topic that has been debated among Islamic scholars and communities. Some argue that it is haram (forbidden) in Islam, while others hold a more open stance, stating that it is permissible as long as it does not conflict with Islamic teachings and values. Those who argue that birthdays are haram often cite the absence of such celebrations in Islamic history and traditions to support their claim. The Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) himself did not celebrate his own birthday, nor did he direct his followers to do so. Additionally, there is no evidence to suggest that the early Muslims marked such events. Critics assert that birthday celebrations stem from non-Islamic cultures and may incorporate elements that conflict with Islamic values. On the other hand, some scholars and individuals believe that birthday celebrations are permissible in Islam as long as they comply with Islamic teachings. Proponents state that there are no explicit Quranic verses or Hadiths that expressly forbid marking this milestone. As long as a birthday celebration is conducted modestly, without indulging in extravagance or acts contrary to Islamic principles, such as drinking alcohol or engaging in immoral behavior, it can be seen as a permissible social gathering. Now, if you would like to know the best way to celebrate your birthday, keeping in mind Islamic values, here are a few suggestions: 1. Express gratitude to Allah: Begin your special day by offering prayers and thanking Allah for all the blessings in your life - not only on your birthday but every day. 2. Give back to the community: Use the occasion as an opportunity to engage in charitable activities as a gesture of gratitude. Help the less fortunate, volunteer, or donate to a worthy cause. 3. Strengthen bonds: Birthdays can be a time to connect with family and friends. Prioritize modesty and simplicity by hosting a small gathering to strengthen relationships. 4. Engage in self-reflection: Use the time to evaluate your past year and envision goals for the upcoming one, in both your personal life and faith. Assess your spiritual growth and continue on your journey towards self-improvement. Addressing the multi-choice problem that you presented, I would say that these questions are *no*, not the same. While both are related to the topic of birthdays in the context of Islam, the first question addresses the permissibility of these celebrations from a religious standpoint, while the second question concerns the best way to celebrate one's birthday in adherence to Islamic values."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: \\"Where in Asia did greke language and culture extend?\\" Context: \\"After Alexander the Great's ventures in the Persian Empire, Hellenistic kingdoms were established throughout south-west Asia (Seleucid Empire, Kingdom of Pergamon), north-east Africa (Ptolemaic Kingdom) and South Asia (Greco-Bactrian Kingdom, Indo-Greek Kingdom). This resulted in the export of Greek culture and language to these new realms through Greco-Macedonian colonization, spanning as far as modern-day Pakistan. Equally, however, these new kingdoms were influenced by the indigenous cultures, adopting local practices where beneficial, necessary, or convenient. Hellenistic culture thus represents a fusion of the Ancient Greek world with that of the Near East, Middle East, and Southwest Asia, and a departure from earlier Greek attitudes towards \\"barbarian\\" cultures. The Hellenistic period was characterized by a new wave of Greek colonization (as distinguished from that occurring in the 8th–6th centuries BC) which established Greek cities and kingdoms in Asia and Africa. Those new cities were composed of Greek colonists who came from different parts of the Greek world, and not, as before, from a specific \\"mother city\\". The main cultural centers expanded from mainland Greece to Pergamon, Rhodes, and new Greek colonies such as Seleucia, Antioch, Alexandria and Ai-Khanoum. This mixture of Greek-speakers gave birth to a common Attic-based dialect, known as Koine Greek, which became the lingua franca through the Hellenistic world.\\" Answer: A:","completion":"The Greek language and culture extended to various regions in Asia as a result of the conquests and subsequent Hellenistic kingdoms established by Alexander the Great and his successors. The Hellenistic period, which stretched from 323 BCE to 31 BCE, witnessed the expansion of Greek influence and colonization throughout Asia, merging with local cultures and customs. The regions where Greek language and culture extended in Asia included: 1. Southwest Asia: After Alexander the Great's conquest of the Persian Empire, the Seleucid Empire was established, covering a vast area that included present-day Iran, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Israel, Jordan, Kuwait, the Caucasus, and parts of Turkey. The Seleucid Empire played a crucial role in the dissemination of Greek culture and language throughout these regions. Important centers of Hellenistic culture like Seleucia and Antioch were founded in this region and adopted Greek as their official language. 2. Anatolia: The Kingdom of Pergamon, located in modern-day Turkey, was another Hellenistic realm where Greek culture and language flourished. Pergamon itself was a significant center of learning and culture, with its famous library rivaling the renowned Library of Alexandria in Egypt. Greek culture and language were deeply integrated into the society, with inscriptions and public buildings adorned with Greek art and architecture. 3. South Asia: Alexander's conquests extended as far as the Indus River in modern-day Pakistan. Although the Greek presence in India was relatively short-lived, the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom and the Indo-Greek Kingdom became gateways for the diffusion of Greek culture and language into South Asia. The Greek city of Ai-Khanoum, located in present-day Afghanistan, was a prime example of Hellenistic culture, with Greek inscriptions, art, and architecture found throughout the city. 4. Central Asia: Following Alexander's conquests, the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom emerged in what is now Afghanistan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan. The Greek language was widely spoken in this region, and several major cities, such as Bactra (modern Balkh), were known for their Hellenistic architectural and artistic styles. The fusion of Greek culture with the traditions of the Near East, Middle East, and Southwest Asia led to the development of a distinct Hellenistic civilization characterized by the diffusion of a common Attic-based dialect, Koine Greek. This language became the lingua franca of the Hellenistic world, unifying diverse Greek-speaking populations and facilitating the spread of Hellenistic culture throughout regions in Asia. In conclusion, the Greek language and culture extended throughout various regions in Asia during the Hellenistic period, including Southwest Asia, Anatolia, South Asia, and Central Asia. This expansion was driven by the conquests of Alexander the Great and the establishment of Hellenistic kingdoms, which encouraged the mingling of Greek and indigenous cultures; thus, creating a unique and diverse Hellenistic civilization."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Teacher:Given a command in a limited form of natural language, provide the correct sequence of actions that executes the command to thus navigate an agent in its environment. A command can be broken down into many different actions. Actions are uppercase and are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. The word 'opposite' turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively. There are only six actions: 'I_LOOK', 'I_WALK', 'I_RUN', 'I_JUMP', 'I_TURN_LEFT', and 'I_TURN_RIGHT'. These actions respectively align with the commands 'look', 'walk', 'run', 'jump', 'turn left', and 'turn right'. Actions and commands do not have quotations in the input and output.

This provided a bigger, more dependable food supply. It also allowed people to settle down in villages and cities for the first time. Birth rates went up because there was more food and settled life had other advantages. Death rates also rose because of crowded living conditions and diseases that spread from domestic animals. Because the higher birth rates were matched by higher death rates, the human population continued to grow very slowly. Paragraph: Gary researched two old human settlements. Village A was smaller, it existed about 12,000 years ago. He also studied village B, which existed about 6,000 years ago. The village was much bigger and better developed. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which village had higher birth rates? Answer:","completion":"Based on the provided information, it is not possible to definitively determine which village had higher birth rates. However, we can make some educated assumptions based on the given context. The background information states that agriculture was invented about 10,000 years ago, which led to a bigger, more dependable food supply, allowing people to settle in villages and cities, and resulting in increased birth rates. Village A existed about 12,000 years ago, which means that it predated the invention of agriculture. It is likely that Village A had a relatively smaller and less dependable food supply, leading to potentially lower birth rates compared to later settlements. On the other hand, Village B existed about 6,000 years ago, well after the development of agriculture. The paragraph mentions that Village B was much bigger and better developed when compared to Village A. This information implies that Village B had a more dependable food supply and probably a larger population, which supports the possibility of higher birth rates in that village. While we cannot conclusively determine which village had higher birth rates based solely on the given information, it is more plausible that Village B experienced higher birth rates than Village A due to the advancements in agriculture and the subsequent advantages this provided, such as increased food supply and improved living conditions. Nevertheless, this is an assumption based on the provided context, and further research or data would be required to confirm the actual birth rates of these villages."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

The formula can also be applied to other factors such as unemployment and literacy, they claim. Brazil is known to have extremely high murder rates, which the team argue could now be better anticipated. The scientists say their work, published in journal Plos One, could one day help prevent crime. Gang and drug violence are among the factors accounting for many of Brazil's cities being classed as the most violent in the world. Now a team has analysed data from Brazilian cities from the year 2000 and found that mathematical laws emerge when looking at how several factors - what they refer to as \\"urban metrics\\" - relate to each other. Criminologists are less convinced and say statistics and formulas are too far removed from the social issues that affect crime. \\"We have shown that most of the indicators that we use to characterise cities - such as GDP, the number of illiterate, the number of unemployed - are closely related with the population of the cities,\\" said Haroldo Ribeiro, from the State University of Maringa, Brazil, one of the co-authors of the study. \\"Usually, the indicators increase with the population size, following a well-defined mathematical law.\\" He told BBC News that the same mathematical law can be applied to homicides as well as 11 other urban indicators, including cases of child labour. However, it was hard to predict the most likely indicator for crime, added Dr Ribeiro, although he found that factors relating to money - such as unemployment and family income - had more influence on the number of homicides, something already well established by criminologists. \\"While this work is not focused on preventing crime... I believe that unveiling relationships between crime and urban metrics can help to guide public policies towards more effective investments, and, consequently, to help prevent crime.\\" Despite the problems Brazil is facing, Dr Ribeiro said his country was becoming better at tackling its crime problems. But he added that justice was very slow, which could keep spreading a \\"culture of impunity\\". Criminologist David Wilson of Birmingham City University, UK, said that although murders \\"do tend to be concentrated in parts of cities with low levels of income\\", the idea that there was a mathematical formula related to population growth \\"entirely ignores\\" the emotional triggers - or \\"foreground factors\\" - that lead to crime. \\"Murder is usually about the loss of face; it's about young men in circumstances in which there's some kind of conflict that results in one of those young men wanting to extract revenge. \\"It's about the foreground factors much more than the background factors - which this study looks at. \\"This study doesn't capture the phenomenon of murder. It's such a complicated phenomenon based on emotion,\\" Prof Wilson told BBC News. He added that statistical correlations could be found in many kinds of data \\"but that doesn't prove cause and effect\\". But Luis Bettencourt of the Santa Fe Institute, US, who works with data from cities to analyse human behaviour, said the formula could be applied to other cities too. \\"When you look at a city and want to characterise it in some way, the obvious one is population size. What's interesting about crime is that the levels of homicides tend to increase on a per capita basis, the larger the city. \\"The explanation is essentially that cities exist to promote social interaction. And crime is one such social interaction.\\"","completion":"Researchers have developed a mathematical formula that reveals a connection between high murder rates and urban metrics, such as unemployment and literacy, in Brazilian cities, potentially aiding crime prevention efforts."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the below context: The two sides to Poulenc's musical nature caused misunderstanding during his life and have continued to do so. The composer Ned Rorem observed, \\"He was deeply devout and uncontrollably sensual\\"; this still leads some critics to underrate his seriousness. His uncompromising adherence to melody, both in his lighter and serious works, has similarly caused some to regard him as unprogressive. Although he was not much influenced by new developments in music, Poulenc was always keenly interested in the works of younger generations of composers. Lennox Berkeley recalled, \\"Unlike some artists, he was genuinely interested in other people's work, and surprisingly appreciative of music very far removed from his.

This causes air pollution, acid rain, and global warming. Fossil fuels are also limited and may eventually run out. Like fossil fuels, radioactive elements are limited. In fact, they are relatively rare, so they could run out sooner rather than later. On the other hand, nuclear fission does not release air pollution or cause the other environmental problems associated with burning fossil fuels. This is the major advantage of using nuclear fission as a source of energy. I am facing a new situation today: Jennifer is currently looking for a new city to move to since she is looking to change her life and just do something different. Jennifer is a strong environmentalist and doesn't want to move to a city that contributes a lot to climate change since she feels it's every person's duty to take care of the Earth. She looks online and finds out about two cities in Minnesota that are several hundred miles apart. Jamestown has a very famous water park and uses coal to generate the city's electricity. Dapperton, the other city she is considering, has a neat hobby shop that Jennifer likes and the city uses nuclear power for its electricity needs. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which city is more likely to run out of the material used to generate electricity first?

A:","completion":"No, \\"Get warm\\" is not a valid answer in this context. To explain better, the situation tells us that Casey rushed to their car tonight in the rain without having a jacket on. Typically, a jacket provides warmth by insulating the body from cold weather, and one might usually wear a jacket especially when it's raining to keep warm and dry. In Casey's case, they did not even wear a jacket, implying conditions that were either urgent or in some way disruptive to normal procedures. There are several possible reasons why Casey might act in this manner. Maybe they were in a hurry and forgot to pick up their jacket, or perhaps the urgency of their situation caused them to ignore the cold and rain. It might also be possible that they didn't anticipate the rain, or felt that getting to the car was more essential than staying dry. To put it in another way, if the rain began suddenly, they may have rushed to the car to avoid getting any wetter than they already were. Given these possible explanations, saying that Casey went to the car without a jacket on to \\"get warm\\" is counter-intuitive. If their aim was to feel warm, the logical thing to do would have been to wear a jacket before going out in the cold and rainy weather. Therefore, it is not a valid answer to the question \\"Why did Casey do this?\\". It might, however, be a valid answer if the question was more directed towards what Casey might be hoping to do once inside the car - getting warm inside the car by turning on the heater, for instance. But as it stands, the act of rushing to the car in the rain without a jacket does not appear to be an effort made with the intention of getting warm."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Blue group did weight training for 3 months, while Brown group ran 3 miles a day for three months. The Captain observed different results on each group. Which group didn't have their hearts pumping more blood while training? Hint: In exercises such as weight lifting, skeletal muscle contracts against a resisting force (see Figure below ). Using skeletal muscle in this way increases its size and strength. In exercises such as running, the cardiac muscle contracts faster and the heart pumps more blood. Using cardiac muscle in this way increases its strength and efficiency. Continued exercise is necessary to maintain bigger, stronger muscles. If you don’t use a muscle, it will get smaller and weaker—so use it or lose it. Answer:","completion":"The Blue group, which did weight training for 3 months, didn't have their hearts pumping more blood while training. This is because weight training primarily focuses on increasing the size and strength of the skeletal muscles by making them contract against a resisting force. On the other hand, the Brown group, which ran 3 miles a day for three months, engaged in an exercise that made their cardiac muscles contract faster, leading to their hearts pumping more blood. This increased the strength and efficiency of their cardiac muscles. In summary, the Blue group didn't experience the same level of cardiovascular benefits during their training program as the Brown group did."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Researchers from the University of Sydney are conducting a world-first study on newborn babies to investigate whether it is possible to predict whether a child will stutter even before they can talk. Sydney University's Australian Stuttering Research Centre are conducting the study in an attempt to discover the cause of stuttering, using 20 babies with a family history of the disorder and 20 without. 17-week old Levi Crellin was the first baby to take part in the study, after his older sister Zoe suffered from a debilitating stutter from the time she was two years old. 17-week old Levi Crellin was the first baby to take part in the study on the causes of stuttering","completion":"The researchers are utilizing advanced brain imaging techniques, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG), to monitor the brain activity of these infants as they listen to speech sounds. By comparing the brain responses of babies with and without a family history of stuttering, the researchers aim to identify specific neural patterns that may indicate an increased likelihood of developing the speech disorder. In addition to brain imaging, the infants are also being closely monitored in other aspects of their development. This includes tracking their language acquisition, motor skills, and social interactions over the course of several years. The comprehensive approach will allow researchers to gather a wealth of data to better understand the full spectrum of factors that might contribute to stuttering. The study's lead researcher, Professor Alice Scott, explains that while previous research has already established that genetics play a significant role in stuttering, the exact causes remain unknown. \\"By studying these babies from such an early age, we hope to shed light on the specific neural, genetic, and environmental factors that contribute to the development of stuttering. Understanding these factors could ultimately help us to develop better screening methods and more targeted interventions for children at risk.\\" Once the study is completed and the results have been analyzed, the researchers anticipate that their findings will not only provide valuable insights into the origins of stuttering but may also pave the way for innovative, early detection and prevention strategies. These strategies, in turn, could potentially minimize the social and emotional burdens faced by children who stutter and their families. For the Crellin family, their participation in the study represents a hope for a better future not only for their son Levi but also for thousands of other families around the world who face the challenges of stuttering on a daily basis. Zoe's father, Mark Crellin, said, \\"We want to do everything we can to help understand this condition and give Levi the best possible chance to avoid the struggles that Zoe has faced. Even if it's too late for Zoe, if this research helps just one child, then it's worth it.\\" In conclusion, the University of Sydney's groundbreaking study on newborn babies is set to revolutionize the way we understand and approach stuttering. By identifying the root causes of stuttering and developing early intervention methods, the researchers aim to make a significant and positive impact on the lives of those who stutter and their loved ones. With continued support for research into this complex and often misunderstood condition, there is hope for a future where stuttering can be predicted, managed, and ultimately overcome."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Calculate the probability of getting the sequence 'nnn' when picking three letters without replacement from a given set. 2. Provide the final answer as a single number, either as a positive or negative integer, a fraction, or a decimal. Guidelines: 1. You're given a set with specific quantities of letters: {p: 6, n: 4}. 2. You pick three letters without replacement, meaning each time you pick a letter, it is removed from the set for the next pick. 3. You need to find the probability of getting the sequence 'nnn'. 4.

Now, let's solve the problem: There are a total of 6 p's and 4 n's in the set, making a total of 10 letters. We need to calculate the probability of picking 'n' three times in a row, without replacement. 1. First pick: The probability of picking an 'n' is 4 (number of n's) out of 10 (total letters): 4/10. 2. Second pick: After picking one 'n', there are now 3 n's left and a total of 9 letters. So the probability is 3/9. 3. Third pick: After picking two 'n's, there are 2 n's left and a total of 8 letters. The probability is 2/8. To find the probability of 'nnn', multiply these probabilities together: (4/10) * (3/9) * (2/8) = 24/720 Now simplify the fraction by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD), which is 24. 24/720 = 1/30 So, the probability of getting the sequence 'nnn' when picking three letters without replacement from the given set is 1/30."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The 12 days of Christmas has been extended to 100 days as the nation's favourite supermarket launches its festive season - in mid-September. The first packets of mince pies, plum puddings, stollen and Santa shaped sweets and biscuits have been stacked on the country's most popular supermarket. The shelves which just days before were stacked with uniforms, pens and pencils, and stationary for school children going back to school, have been swapped for festive goodies. Ho ho no? The shelves in some Tesco supermarkets are being stocked with Christmas produce in September. Chocs away: These are the festive shelves at the Meadows Tesco, in Camberley, Surrey. Tesco is ranked as the country's top supermarket and it has unashamedly heralded that there was the '100 sleeps' until Christmas at the weekend. The countdown features on the homepage of Tesco.com. As from today there are 'just' 98 sleeps to go!

Question: Amoxicillin and penicillin are examples of what kind of medical treatments? Context: Possible improvements include clarification of clinical trial regulations by FDA. Furthermore, appropriate economic incentives could persuade pharmaceutical companies to invest in this endeavor. Antibiotic Development to Advance Patient Treatment (ADAPT) Act aims to fast track the drug development to combat the growing threat of 'superbugs'. Under this Act, FDA can approve antibiotics and antifungals treating life-threatening infections based on smaller clinical trials. The CDC will monitor the use of antibiotics and the emerging resistance, and publish the data.

Context: President Donald Trump is counting on congressional Republicans to enact a package of tax cuts in the coming weeks, in the process delivering his first major legislative achievement since taking office in January. But even as Trump and his Republican allies close in on the goal of passing tax reform, the Russia investigation continues to be a major distraction. The recent plea deal between Trump’s former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, and the office of special counsel Robert Mueller sent shockwaves around Washington and at the very least seemed to indicate the Russia probe is a long way from being completed. Trump is banking on a tax cut victory to shore up his political base and show supporters and detractors alike that he is a man of his word when it comes to delivering on his campaign promises. House and Senate negotiators are now working to resolve differences in the two versions with hopes of final votes in the coming weeks. But even if the tax plan is enacted into law, its impact is not likely to be felt for at least a year. And polls show the plan has less than majority support. Trump insists the tax cuts will lead to economic growth and more jobs. “I will tell you this is in a nonbraggadocio way,” Trump told supporters in Missouri recently. “There has never been a 10-month president that has accomplished what we have accomplished. That I can tell you.” Democrats oppose the tax plan but lack the votes to stop it. “It rewards the rich in terms of individuals and corporations at the expense of tens of millions of working middle class families in our country,” warned House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi. Despite his poor standing in national polls, just less than 40 percent approval in most surveys, Trump’s base is largely sticking with him. The latest American Values Survey by the Public Religion Research Institute found that 84 percent of Republicans continue to back the president. Question: Why do the Democrats oppose the Trump tax plan? Answer: Answer:","completion":"The Democrats oppose the Trump tax plan because they believe it rewards the rich in terms of individuals and corporations at the expense of tens of millions of working middle-class families in the country, as stated by House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Andoheb has called him to undertake a mission for the priesthood, but first refreshes his memory on the story of Kharis (Lon Chaney Jr.).3000 years ago, Kharis and the Princess Ananka were involved in a forbidden love affair. The princess died and because of her sin, her soul was cursed forever. Kharis was buried alive along with her. 30 years prior to the present time, an expedition located and entered the tomb of Ananka. They fought and escaped from the guardian of the tomb-the living Mummy of Kharis. The archaeologists brought Ananka's body back to the Scripps Museum in the United States. However, the priests of Arkham sent Kharis to seek vengeance against the defilers of the tomb. Every person from the expedition that entered the tomb died at the Mummy's hands. Kharis was believed to be destroyed in a fire at the residence of Stephen Banning (Dick Foran), leader of the expedition.The same story is being told to a group of skeptical college students in Mapleton Massachusetts. Professor Norman (Frank Reicher) expands on the story, explaining how Kharis was kept alive by the fluid of the leaves of the Tana bush, a plant that has long been extinct. In fact, Professor Norman himself was entrusted with a quantity of the tana leaves that investigators found in order to conduct scientific research.After the lecture ends, one of the students, Tom Hervey (Robert Lowery), meets up with his girlfriend Amina Mansori (Ramsay Ames), a beautiful woman of Egyptian descent. Amina has been researching Egyptian history, which has brought on a strange, clouded feeling in her mind.Back in Egypt, Andoheb informs Yousef Bey that Kharis still lives and that Yousef's mission is to retrieve Kharis and the body of Ananka and return them to their rightful resting place in Egypt.

In 1928, the British government set up the Simon Commission to report on the political situation in India. Some Indian political parties boycotted the Commission because there were no Indians in its membership, and there were protests across the country. When the Commission visited Lahore on 30 October 1928, Lala Lajpat Rai led a march in protest against it. Police attempts to disperse the large crowd resulted in violence. The superintendent of police, James A. Scott, ordered the police to lathi charge (use batons against) the protesters and personally assaulted Rai, who was injured. Rai died of a heart attack on 17 November 1928. Doctors thought that his death might have been hastened by the injuries he had received. When the matter was raised in the Parliament of the United Kingdom, the British Government denied any role in Rai's death. Bhagat was a prominent member of the HRA and was probably responsible, in large part, for its change of name to HSRA in 1928. The HSRA vowed to avenge Rai's death. Singh conspired with revolutionaries like Shivaram Rajguru, Sukhdev Thapar, and Chandrashekhar Azad to kill Scott. However, in a case of mistaken identity, the plotters shot John P. Saunders, an Assistant Superintendent of Police, as he was leaving the District Police Headquarters in Lahore on 17 December 1928. Contemporary reaction to the killing differs substantially from the adulation that later surfaced. The Naujawan Bharat Sabha, which had organised the Lahore protest march along with the HSRA, found that attendance at its subsequent public meetings dropped sharply. Politicians, activists, and newspapers, including The People, which Rai had founded in 1925, stressed that non-co-operation was preferable to violence. The murder was condemned as a retrograde action by Mahatma Gandhi, the Congress leader, but Jawaharlal Nehru later wrote that: Bhagat Singh did not become popular because of his act of terrorism but because he seemed to vindicate, for the moment, the honour of Lala Lajpat Rai, and through him of the nation. He became a symbol, the act was forgotten, the symbol remained, and within a few months each town and village of the Punjab, and to a lesser extent in the rest of northern India, resounded with his name. Innumerable songs grew about him and the popularity that the man achieved was something amazing.

Harvey told jurors the victim threatened to stab the woman at the house.","completion":"Title: The Aggressive Action of Lee Harvey in Middlesbrough: A Glimpse into the Trial and Sentencing Introduction Lee Harvey, a 26-year-old man from Middlesbrough, has recently become the center of attention in the local news for his violent actions against another individual. The incident, which took place some time ago, has now reached its legal conclusion with the sentencing of Mr. Harvey by the Teesside Crown Court. In this article, we will delve deeper into the events and trial, analyzing the reasons behind Lee Harvey's aggressive behavior and the outcome of the judicial process. The Incident The initial event, which sparked the subsequent legal proceedings, involved Lee Harvey assaulting another man on the streets of Middlesbrough. Witnesses and video evidence from the scene showed that Harvey had violently punched, kneed, and kicked the victim for an extended period. During the trial, Harvey admitted that he wanted to knock the man out to \\"neutralize\\" him, an admission that would play a significant role in the prosecution's case against him. Harvey's Reasoning Though the violent actions of Lee Harvey were not contested, the trial brought forth his reasoning for the assault. Harvey's defense centered on the claim that the victim had threatened to stab a woman at the house they were all in. As a result, Harvey took it upon himself to defend the woman and neutralize the perceived imminent threat. It is important to note that the testimony of other individuals regarding the alleged threat played a key part in Harvey's explanation and subsequent trial. The Trial The case went to trial at the Teesside Crown Court. Here, jurors carefully considered Lee Harvey's testimony, cross-examinations, and evidence in order to reach their verdict. The prosecution questioned Harvey's claims that the assault was purely an act of self-defense or defense of others. The defense, however, focused on presenting Harvey as a man acting in the best interest of others and reacting to a dangerous situation. The jury weighed this evidence alongside the video footage of the decidedly brutal attack, considering whether Harvey's actions were justified based on his claims. While the reason given for the assault was taken into account, there was a strong focus on the disproportionate level of force used by Harvey, who had sought to incapacitate the victim entirely. By doing so, they assessed whether this level of force aligned with the principles of legitimate self-defense or defense of others. The Sentencing In light of the evidence and testimonies, the jury reached a decision. Lee Harvey was found guilty and sentenced to five years in prison by the Teesside Crown Court. This sentence takes into account the severity of the assault, Harvey's deliberate use of excessive force, and the negative impact of his actions on the victim and community. Although Harvey had sought to neutralize a perceived threat, his actions ultimately landed him in jail. Conclusion The case of Lee Harvey serves as a cautionary tale for the wider public and showcases the importance of understanding the legal principles surrounding self-defense and the defense of others. It is not enough to claim one is protecting others from harm; the actions taken must align with the legal framework. The judicial process in this case has demonstrated that using excessive force, even in defense of another, can have severe consequences that lead to long-term penalties."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Patience is distraught to learn her sister, Mary's mother, has died. When Mary tells Joss that Pengallan has accompanied her to Jamaica Inn, Joss goes upstairs and reports to Pengallan. We learn that Pengallan is the secret criminal mastermind behind the wrecking gang, who finds out when well-laden ships are passing near the coast, determines when and where the wrecks are to be done, disposes of the stolen cargo, and uses the booty to support his lavish lifestyle, passing a small fraction of the takings back to Joss and the gang. In another part of the inn, the gang convenes to discuss why they get so little money for their efforts. They suspect Jem Traherne (Robert Newton), a gang member who has been with them for only two months, of embezzling goods. They hang him from one of the rafters of the inn, but Mary cuts the rope afterwards and saves his life. Together, Traherne and Mary flee from the gang. They are almost...

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the name of the DVD about The Smashing Pumpkins that was released in November 2008? On June 21, 2005, the day of the release of his album TheFutureEmbrace, Corgan took out full-page advertisements in the Chicago Tribune and Chicago Sun-Times to announce that he planned to reunite the band. \\"For a year now\\", Corgan wrote, \\"I have walked around with a secret, a secret I chose to keep. But now I want you to be among the first to know that I have made plans to renew and revive the Smashing Pumpkins. I want my band back, and my songs, and my dreams\\". Corgan and Chamberlin were verified as participants in the reunion, but there was question as to whether other former members of the band would participate.In April 2007 Iha and Auf der Maur separately confirmed that they were not taking part in the reunion. Chamberlin would later state that Iha and Wretzky \\"didn't want to be a part of\\" the reunion. The Smashing Pumpkins performed live for the first time since 2000 on May 22, 2007, in Paris, France. There, the band unveiled new touring members: guitarist Jeff Schroeder, bassist Ginger Reyes, and keyboardist Lisa Harriton. That same month, \\"Tarantula\\" was released as the first single from the band's forthcoming album. On July 7, the band performed at the Live Earth concert in New Jersey.The band's new album, Zeitgeist, was released that same month on Reprise Records, entering the Billboard charts at number two and selling 145,000 copies in its first week. Zeitgeist received mixed reviews, with much of the criticism targeted at the absence of half of the original lineup. The album divided the Pumpkins' fanbase. Corgan would later admit, \\"I know a lot of our fans are puzzled by Zeitgeist. I think they wanted this massive, grandiose work, but you don't just roll out of bed after seven years without a functioning band and go back to doing that\\". Corgan and Chamberlin continued to record as a duo, releasing the four-song EP American Gothic in January 2008 and the singles \\"Superchrist\\" and \\"G.L.O.W.\\" later that year.

Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: Valerie Plame is employed by the Central Intelligence Agency, a fact known outside the agency to no one except her husband and parents. She is an agent involved in a number of sensitive and sometimes dangerous covert operations overseas.Her husband, Joseph C. Wilson, is a diplomat who most recently has served as a U.S. ambassador to Gabon, Sao Tome and Principe. Due to his extensive background, Wilson is approached by Plame's CIA colleagues to travel to Niger and glean information as to whether yellowcake uranium is being procured by Iraq for use in the construction of nuclear weasons. Wilson determines to his own satisfaction that it is not.After military action is taken by George W. Bush, who justifies it in a 2003 State of the Union address by alluding to the uranium's use in building weapons of mass destruction, Wilson submits an op-ed piece to the New York Times claiming these reports to be categorically untrue.Plame's status as a CIA agent is subsequently revealed in the media, the leak possibly coming from White House officials including the Vice President's chief of staff and national security adviser, Scooter Libby, in part to discredit her husband's allegation that the Bush administration had manipulated intelligence to justify the invasion of Iraq. As a result, Plame is instantly dismissed from the agency, leaving several of her delicate operations in limbo and creating a rift in her marriage.Plame leaves her husband, further angered by his granting of television and print interviews, which expose them both to public condemnation and death threats. Wilson ultimately persuades her, however, that there is no other way to fight a power as great as that of the White House for citizens like them.

I haven’t lost my enthusiasm though and am busy planning all sorts of new posts for the future, so watch this space! Today I wanted to tell you all about a fantastic natural brand, Moogoo. Regular readers of Beauty Best Friend may recall that I reviewed their Full Cream Moisturiser last year, but having received this Oil Cleansing Method* cleanser in a goody bag from a blogger event a couple of months ago it fired up my love for them all over again! MooGoo is an Australian natural skincare brand that was first created when the founder adapted a cream used in dairy farms to help a family member with a skin problem. Their products contain lots of natural oils and are not tested on animals – well, apart from the very first of their products that was created for cows! Moogoo Oil Cleansing Method is an all natural cleansing oil that can be used in two ways…. you can use it like a wash-off cleanser by applying a few drops to the face then rinsing it off with warm water, or my favourite method is to massage the oil into the skin then place a warm flannel or muslin over the face to allow the oil to draw any impurities out of the skin, before wiping away the oil. This is a great way of starting off a DIY facial at home! There are four varieties of Oil Cleansing Method, I’ve been using the one for Oily Skin but it’s also available in Normal, Combination and Dry too. The ingredients include ‘drawing oils’ that help to lift dirt and germs off the skin so they can be washed away, plus the Oily one contains Juniper Oil which helps to prevent bacteria on the skin, great for helping keep spots at bay.

The term applies to raster digital images, film images, and other types of images. Higher resolution means more image detail. - Prop comedy is a comedy genre in which performers use humorous objects, or conventional objects in humorous ways. The stages and films term \\"prop\\", an abbreviation of \\"property\\", refers to any object an actor handles in the course of a performance. Though some form of prop comedy has likely existed as long as there have been comedians, the genre reached its zenith in the vaudeville era. The vaudeville team Olsen and Johnson used prop comedy extensively in their long running Broadway revue \\"Hellzapoppin\\". - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe.

Stephen Fry was host of the show from its initial pilot, before departing after the final episode of the M series in 2015, with frequent \\"QI\\" panelist Sandi Toksvig replacing him prior to the beginning of the N series in 2016. The format of the show focuses on Alan and three other guest panelists answering questions that are extremely obscure, making it unlikely that the correct answer will be given. To compensate, the panelists are awarded points not only for the right answer, but also for interesting ones, regardless of whether they are right or even relate to the original question, while points are deducted for \\"answers which are not only wrong, but pathetically obvious\\" typically answers that are generally believed to be true but in fact are misconceptions which are known as forfeits that are usually indicated by a loud siren, flashing lights, and the incorrect answer being displayed on screen. Bonus points are sometimes awarded or deducted for challenges or incorrect references, varying from show to show. \\"QI\\" has a philosophy that \\"everything is interesting if looked at in the right way\\"; many factual errors in the show have been corrected in later episodes or on the show's blog. - A joke is a display of humour in which words are used within a specific and well-defined narrative structure to make people laugh. It takes the form of a story, usually with dialogue, and ends in a punch line. It is in the punch line that the audience becomes aware that the story contains a second, conflicting meaning. This can be done using a pun or other word play such as irony, a logical incompatibility, nonsense or other means. Linguist Robert Hetzron offers the definition: - Alternative comedy is a term coined in the 1980s for a style of comedy that makes a conscious break with the mainstream comedic style of an era but can also be found in cartoons. The phrase has had different connotations in different contexts: in the UK, it was used to describe content which was an \\"alternative\\" to the mainstream of live comedy, which often involved racist and sexist material. In other contexts, it is the nature of the form that is \\"alternative\\", avoiding reliance on a standardised structure of a sequence of jokes with punch lines. Patton Oswalt has defined it as \\"comedy where the audience has no pre-set expectations about the crowd, and vice versa. In comedy clubs, there tends to be a certain vibealternative comedy explores different types of material.\\" - James Roderick Moir (born 24 January 1959), better known by the stage name Vic Reeves, is an English comedian, artist, actor and television presenter, best known for his double act with Bob Mortimer (see Vic and Bob).

It was renamed BBC TV in 1960, using this name until the launch of sister channel BBC2 in 1964, whereupon the BBC TV channel became known as BBC1, with the current spelling adopted in 1997. - In a modern sense, comedy (from the , \\"kmidía\\") refers to any discourse or work generally intended to be humorous or amusing by inducing laughter, especially in theatre, television, film, and stand-up comedy. The origins of the term are found in Ancient Greece. In the Athenian democracy, the public opinion of voters was influenced by the political satire performed by the comic poets at the theaters. The theatrical genre of Greek comedy can be described as a dramatic performance which pits two groups or societies against each other in an amusing agon or conflict. Northrop Frye depicted these two opposing sides as a \\"Society of Youth\\" and a \\"Society of the Old\\". A revised view characterizes the essential agon of comedy as a struggle between a relatively powerless youth and the societal conventions that pose obstacles to his hopes. In this struggle, the youth is understood to be constrained by his lack of social authority, and is left with little choice but to take recourse in ruses which engender very dramatic irony which provokes laughter. - Vic and Bob, also known as Reeves and Mortimer, are a British comedy double act consisting of Vic Reeves (born 24 January 1959, real name James Roderick Moir) and Bob Mortimer (born 23 May 1959).

After similar work for Richard D'Oyly Carte's opera companies on the works of Arthur Sullivan and others, Wood became the conductor of a small operatic touring company. He was soon engaged by the larger Carl Rosa Opera Company. One notable event in his operatic career was conducting the British premiere of Tchaikovsky's Eugene Onegin in 1892. From the mid-1890s until his death, Wood focused on concert conducting. He was engaged by the impresario Robert Newman to conduct a series of promenade concerts at the Queen's Hall, offering a mixture of classical and popular music at low prices.

The orange circle shows one of the sun glints. The \\"pale blue dot\\" has been twinkling like a brilliant diamond in satellite images, and scientists may have finally solved the mystery of why. Mysterious flashes of light from Earth were captured by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Deep Space Climate Observatory, or DSCOVR, an Earth and space weather satellite launched in 2015. Eagle-eyed amateur observers noticed the flashes of light, which occurred hundreds of times over the span of a year. Now, NASA scientists think they may have uncovered the cause: Flecks of high-flying ice crystals in the atmosphere glinting in the sun. [Earth from Above: 101 Stunning Images from Orbit] A powerful camera aboard the DSCOVR satellite has been taking pictures every hour since 2015 from its spot between the sun and the Earth. While skimming through these hourly images, Alexander Marshak, DSCOVR deputy project scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, first noticed these sparkling lights over the oceans. It turned out that Marshak wasn't the first to observe these flashes. Astronomer Carl Sagan first spotted the reflections in 1993. At the time, the Galileo spacecraft was studying Jupiter, but briefly turned its lens toward the home planet. While reviewing these Earth images, Sagan and his colleagues noticed the anomaly. \\"Large expanses of blue ocean and apparent coastlines are present, and close examination of the images shows a region of [mirror-like] reflection in ocean but not on land,\\" Sagan and his colleagues wrote in their study, which was published in Nature in 1993. These flickering lights occur when sunlight hits smooth patches in the ocean, and the light then reflects directly back into space and hits the camera head-on, Marshak said in a statement. In this scenario, the ocean acts like a flashbulb in front of the camera. But in Galileo's images, many of the flashes seemed to occur over land, Marshak and his colleagues noticed. Enthusiasts who were looking at the database of images from DISCOVR began pointing out the flashes, too. \\"We found quite a few very bright flashes over land as well,\\" Marshak said in the statement. \\"When I first saw it, I thought maybe there was some water there, or a lake the sun reflects off of. But the glint is pretty big, so it wasn't that.\\" To explain the phenomenon, the team looked for hidden sources of water to explain the sun glint. One possibility: ice crystals floating high in the atmosphere. To test this idea, the team first took an inventory of all the sun glints occurring over land in the modern satellite images. Overall, the bursts occurred 866 times. Based on the physics of light reflection, only certain spots on Earth should produce these twinkling reflections, they reasoned. Only when the angle between Earth and the sun equals the angle between the Earth and the satellite camera would light from these ice crystals bounce directly onto the camera and produce bright glints. Sure enough, the flashes occurred only at times and locations on Earth where these angles matched, the researchers reported today (May 15) in the journal Geophysical Research Letters. Next, they looked at the angle of light to show that these glints occurred when light reflected off horizontally aligned ice crystals. Finally, the researchers showed that the light probably wasn't coming from Earth. Whenever these glints occurred, they found thin, wispy clouds, known as cirrus clouds, hovering high in the atmosphere. Cirrus clouds are composed of supercooled ice crystals. \\"The source of the flashes is definitely not on the ground. It's definitely ice, and most likely solar reflection off of horizontally oriented particles,\\" Marshak said. Originally published on Live Science. ||||| One million miles from Earth, a NASA camera is capturing unexpected flashes of light reflecting off our planet. The homeward-facing instrument on NOAA's Deep Space Climate Observatory, or DSCOVR, launched in 2015, caught hundreds of these flashes over the span of a year. As keen observers from outside NASA wrote in, questioning the source of these lights, scientists deciphered the tiny cause to the big reflections: high-altitude, horizontally oriented ice crystals. NASA's Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera (EPIC) instrument aboard DSCOVR is taking almost-hourly images of the sunlit planet from its spot between Earth and the sun. Alexander Marshak, DSCOVR deputy project scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, first noticed light flashes occasionally appearing over oceans as he looked through that day's EPIC images. Investigating the flashes, Marshak and his colleagues found that similar reflections from our pale blue dot caught the attention of astronomer Carl Sagan in 1993. Sagan was looking at images taken by the Galileo spacecraft, which launched in 1989 to study Jupiter and its moons. During one if its gravitational-assist swings around Earth, Galileo turned its instruments on this planet and collected data. Sagan and his colleagues used that to test a key question: Whether spacecraft could detect signatures of life from afar. \\"Large expanses of blue ocean and apparent coastlines are present, and close examination of the images shows a region of [mirror-like] reflection in ocean but not on land,\\" they wrote of the glints. Flashes of light reflected off oceans - like those referenced by Sagan - could have a simple explanation, Marshak said: Sunlight hits a smooth part of an ocean or lake, and reflects directly back to the sensor, like taking a flash-picture in a mirror. But when the scientists took another took a look at the Galileo images, they saw something Sagan and his colleagues apparently missed -- bright flashes of light over land as well. And those flashes appeared in the EPIC images as well. As the contact listed on the website that posts all EPIC images, Marshak started getting emails from people curious about what the flashes were. \\"We found quite a few very bright flashes over land as well,\\" he said. \\"When I first saw it I thought maybe there was some water there, or a lake the sun reflects off of. But the glint is pretty big, so it wasn't that.\\" Instead, he and his colleagues Tamas Varnai of the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, and Alexander Kostinski of Michigan Technological University, thought of water elsewhere in the Earth system: ice particles high in the atmosphere. The scientists conducted a series of experiments, detailed in a new paper published in Geophysical Research Letters, to confirm the cause of the distant flashes. First, the researchers cataloged all of the prospective sunlight glints over land in images from the EPIC camera. The flashes show up in three distinct colors because the camera takes the red, green and blue images several minutes apart. In all, the scientists found 866 bursts between DSCOVR's launch in June 2015 and August 2016. The scientists reasoned that if these 866 flashes were caused by reflected sunlight, they would be limited to certain spots on the globe - spots where the angle between the sun and Earth is the same as the angle between the spacecraft and Earth, allowing for the spacecraft to pick up the reflected light. When they plotted the locations of the glints with where those angles would match, given Earth's tilt and the spacecraft's location, the two matched. This helped confirm that it wasn't something like lightning causing the flashes, Marshak said: \\"Lightning doesn't care about the sun and EPIC's location.\\" The researchers also plotted angles to determine that the light was reflecting off of ice particles floating in the air nearly horizontally. Another feature of the EPIC data helped confirm that the flashes were from a high altitude, not simply water on the ground. Two channels on the instrument are designed to measure the height of clouds, and when the scientists went to the data they found high cirrus clouds, 3 to 5 miles (5 to 8 kilometers) where the glints were located. \\"The source of the flashes is definitely not on the ground. It's definitely ice, and most likely solar reflection off of horizontally oriented particles,\\" Marshak said. Detecting glints like this from much farther away than in this case could be used by other spacecraft to study exoplanets, he said. As an Earth scientist, however, Marshak is now investigating how common these horizontal ice particles are, and whether they're common enough to have a measureable impact on how much sunlight passes through the atmosphere. If so, it's a feature that could be incorporated into computer models of how much heat is reaching and leaving Earth. The DSCOVR mission is a partnership between NASA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the U.S. Air Force, with the primary objective to maintain the nation's real-time solar wind monitoring capabilities, which are critical to the accuracy and lead time of space weather alerts and forecasts from NOAA. # For an archive of daily EPIC images, visit: https:/ / epic. gsfc. nasa. gov ||||| Strange light flashes that reflect off planet Earth have been captured by a NASA project. Now, scientists believe they may have discovered the origins: high-altitude ice crystals. The mysterious phenomenon was imaged by the Deep Space Climate Observatory or DSCOVR of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, an Earth and space weather satellite launched back in 2015. Over a one-year period, keen observers caught hundreds of flashes of light, leading NASA scientists to a thorough probe. Flashing Lights That Have Puzzled Carl Sagan The EPIC instrument is a powerful camera aboard DSCOVR that takes near-hourly images of the space between the sun and our planet. Project scientist Alexander Marshak noticed the light flashes first over oceans as he went through that day’s EPIC captures. Apparently, the reflections from the “pale blue dot” were the same ones that garnered Carl Sagan’s attention back in 1993 while he was going over Galileo spacecraft images. Galileo was investigating Jupiter yet briefly turned its tools toward the home planet, where the weird scene appeared. The light flashes were so huge they can be seen from space, and originally scientists thought they were caused by sunlight that reflected off the ocean surface. \\"Large expanses of blue ocean and apparent coastlines are present,” Sagan and his colleagues wrote in a 1993 study in Nature, “and close examination of the images shows a region of [mirror-like] reflection in ocean but not on land.\\" Marshak offered an explanation: sunlight touches a smooth lake or ocean portion, reflects back directly into space, and hits the camera right on. The ocean then works like a flashbulb in front of the camera. But how would one explain spotting them on land? In Galileo images, on the other hand, there were sparkling light flashes over land, and Marshak began getting flooded by emails from curious minds as to what could the flashes be. “When I first saw it, I thought maybe there was some water there, or a lake the sun reflects off of. But the glint is pretty big, so it wasn’t that,” Marshak said in a statement. The Key Is In Ice Crystals The scientists put their thinking cap on and focused on water elsewhere in the planet: ice particles situated high up in the atmosphere. They conducted new experiments and, in a new paper, confirmed the source of the remote flashes. They tested their idea by taking an inventory of sun glints hitting land in the satellite images, where the bursts took place 866 times from June 2015 to August last year. If reflected sunlight is the cause, the flashes would be restricted to certain spots where the angle between Earth and the sun is equivalent to the angle between the space vehicle and the planet. This way, the spacecraft would pick up the reflected light. As they suspected, the flashes happened only at locations and times on Earth where the angles matched. Next, they plotted the angle of light to see if the glints reflected off ice particles that horizontally floated up there in the atmosphere. The team finally showed that the light likely wasn’t emanating from the planet, as whenever they occurred, there were cirrus clouds hovering around. These clouds are made up of, what else, ice crystals. The scientists are studying how commonly the horizontal ice crystals manifested, and if they are typical enough to notably impact the amount of sunlight passing through Earth’s atmosphere. They could potentially be integrated into computer models of how much heat the Earth receives and sees leaving. The findings have been discussed in the journal Geophysical Research Letters and EPIC images can be found here. ⓒ 2018 TECHTIMES.com All rights reserved.

I had my appendix removed in about 1970 before keyhole surgery and the surgeon had not properly stitched the inside incision. This meant I was slowly “leaking” blood into the area between my abdominal cavity lining and my skin. I was kept in the hospital for two weeks and every day the same nurse would come along and open the end of the incision in my skin to relieve the pressure caused by the pooling of my blood. That was fine for the first five days, but the weekend came and she was off duty. Apparently, nobody else knew what to do. By Monday morning, I was in agony and when she arrived, she was appalled I had not been drained during the weekend. The other thing that happened during the weekend was the end of the skin incision, which she had opened, had mostly healed meaning there was no convenient hole for the blood to be drained. The nurse used a sharp pair of scissors to reopen one end of the partly-healed incision, but still the blood would not simply drain of its own accord. She used both hands to squeeze downwards onto the swollen blood reservoir. At first, there was no reaction except agonizing pain, but after a few seconds and a very hard squeeze, the stinking, coagulated blood jetted out of the hole she’d made squirting across the ceiling, down the wall and down her full-length coating her face and the front of her uniform. Despite the pain, I couldn’t keep myself from laughing loud and long. She then dressed the wound, directed some junior nurses to clean the ceiling and the wall while she went to clean herself. I apologized for laughing the following day when she returned. She told me she appreciated the humor of the situation so there was no “hard feelings.” According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.

It also hosted six FA Cup finals and several other high-profile football fixtures whilst Wembley Stadium was being redeveloped. - A multi-sport event is an organized sports event, often held over multiple days, featuring competition in many different sports between organized teams of athletes from (mostly) nation states. The first major, modern, multi-sport event of international significance is the modern Olympic Games. - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight. - London is the capital and most populous city of England and the United Kingdom, as well as the most populous city proper in the European Union. Standing on the River Thames in the south east of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded by the Romans, who named it \\"Londinium\\". London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its medieval boundaries. Since at least the 19th century, \\"London\\" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which today largely makes up Greater London, governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly. - The 2012 Summer Paralympics, the fourteenth Summer Paralympic Games, and also more generally known as the London 2012 Paralympic Games, were a major international multi-sport event for athletes with disabilities governed by the International Paralympic Committee (IPC), that took place in London, England from 29 August to 9 September 2012. These Paralympics were one of the largest multi-sport events ever held in the United Kingdom after the 2012 Summer Olympics, and were the largest Paralympics ever: 4,302 athletes from 164 National Paralympic Committees participated, with fourteen countries appearing in the Paralympics for the first time ever. A total of 503 events in 20 sports were held during these games; for the first time since their suspension after the 2000 Paralympics, events for the intellectually disabled were also held in selected sports. - Cardiff is the capital and largest city in Wales and the eleventh-largest city in the United Kingdom. The city is the country's chief commercial centre, the base for most national cultural and sporting institutions, the Welsh national media, and the seat of the National Assembly for Wales. The unitary authority area's mid-2011 population was estimated to be 346,100, while the population of the Larger Urban Zone was estimated at 861,400 in 2009. The Cardiff metropolitan area makes up over a third of the total population of Wales, with a mid-2011 population estimate of about 1,100,000 people.

The town lends its name to the Royal Borough of Greenwich. - The Millennium Dome, subsequently referred to simply as The Dome, is the original name of a large dome-shaped building, originally used to house the Millennium Experience, a major exhibition celebrating the beginning of the third millennium. Located on the Greenwich Peninsula in South East London, England, the exhibition was open to the public from 1 January to 31 December 2000. The project and exhibition was the subject of considerable political controversy as it failed to attract the number of visitors anticipated, with recurring financial problems. All of the original exhibition and associated complex has since been demolished. The dome still exists, and it is now a key exterior feature of The O2. The Prime Meridian passes the western edge of the Dome and the nearest London Underground station is North Greenwich on the Jubilee line. - An arena is an enclosed area, often circular or oval-shaped, designed to showcase theater, musical performances, or sporting events. The word derives from Latin \\"harena\\", a particularly fine/smooth sand used to absorb blood in ancient arenas such as the Colosseum in Rome. It is composed of a large open space surrounded on most or all sides by tiered seating for spectators. The key feature of an arena is that the event space is the lowest point, allowing for maximum visibility. Arenas are usually designed to accommodate a large number of spectators. - The International Paralympic Committee (IPC) is an international non-profit organisation and the global governing body for the Paralympic Movement. The IPC organizes the Paralympic Games and functions as the international federation for nine sports. Founded on 22 September 1989 in Düsseldorf, Germany, its mission is \\"To enable Paralympic athletes to achieve sporting excellence and inspire and excite the world\\". Furthermore, the IPC wants to promote the Paralympic values and to create sport opportunities for all persons with a disability, from beginner to elite level. - The 2012 Summer Olympics, formally the Games of the XXX Olympiad and commonly known as London 2012, was a major international multi-sport event celebrated in the tradition of the Olympic Games, as governed by the International Olympic Committee (IOC). It took place in London and to a lesser extent across the United Kingdom from 25 July to 12 August 2012.

The insurance for the car was more expensive than the insurance for the truck because the","completion":"car was deemed to be a higher risk by the insurance company for several reasons, including the type of vehicle, its safety features, the driver's profile and driving history, the car's primary use, and the geographical location where it would be operated. Firstly, the type of car plays a significant role in determining insurance premiums. In this case, the car might have been a high-performance sports car or a luxury vehicle, which generally comes with a higher price tag and a higher likelihood of theft or involvement in accidents. On the other hand, the truck could be a more modest and robust vehicle with generally lower repair or replacement costs, thus translating into more affordable insurance rates. Secondly, some cars are equipped with more advanced safety features than others, which can significantly impact insurance costs. The car in question could have fewer safety features or a lower safety rating compared to the truck, resulting in a higher risk of severe injuries or fatalities in case of an accident. Insurance providers would factor this in when calculating the premiums, making the car insurance more expensive. The driver's profile and driving history are also critical factors in determining insurance rates. If the person driving the car has a track record of traffic violations, accidents, or has been deemed a high-risk driver due to their age or driving experience, the insurance company might charge more for their coverage. Conversely, the driver of the truck may have a clean driving record and is considered a safer and more responsible driver, leading to lower insurance premiums. Another factor to consider is the car's primary use. If the car is primarily used for personal use and is driven more frequently, especially amid heavy traffic or over long distances, it may be considered a higher risk for accidents than the truck. The truck, on the other hand, could be used for commercial purposes involving less time spent on the road or potentially more predictable, safer routes. This difference in usage patterns would reflect in their respective insurance costs. Lastly, the geographical location where the car and truck are operated also affects insurance costs. If the car is typically driven in urban areas with heavier traffic and higher crime rates, it will inevitably be considered a higher risk compared to the truck, which might be more likely to operate in rural or less congested areas. In summary, the insurance for the car was more expensive than the insurance for the truck because the car was identified as a higher risk vehicle due to a range of factors, including its type, safety features, driver profile and history, primary use, and area of operation. These aspects all contributed to the overall difference in insurance premiums and the car's higher insurance costs."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The premise explicitly states that \\"we still have bins at the grocery stores where you can turn in bottles and cans.\\" This information directly contradicts the hypothesis, as it confirms the presence of bins for bottles and cans at the grocery store. The premise suggests that there are still facilities available in grocery stores for customers to bring in and turn in bottles and cans, likely for recycling or refund purposes. This practice is common in many areas where recycling programs are in place, incentivizing people to recycle their bottles and cans by offering monetary redemption values. For example, many regions in the United States have a bottle bill or container deposit legislation that provides a financial incentive for consumers to return their empty bottles and cans to a designated location for recycling. By offering such bins in grocery stores, retailers encourage and facilitate eco-friendly behavior among customers, which ultimately benefits the environment through reduced waste. As recycling efforts increase, the demand for raw materials decreases, leading to a decrease in the exploitation of resources and energy consumption. The premise also implies that there is the potential for monetary gain when turning in bottles and cans at the grocery store, as it mentions \\"getting that two cents.\\" This part of the statement seems to refer to the value assigned to specific types of containers (e.g., aluminum cans or plastic bottles) that may vary depending on the jurisdiction's recycling policies.

The Associated Press revealed that the intense pressure to produce results overrode any ethical considerations and fostered a climate in which dishonesty thrived. The report minces no words in pointing the finger squarely at Hall, stating that she and her administration prioritized test results and public praise above all else, with no regard for integrity and ethics. The lengths to which the administration went to conceal their actions speak to a broader issue plaguing the American education system: an obsessive focus on quantifiable results at the expense of genuine learning and intellectual growth. Although Hall's attorneys maintain that she \\"steadfastly denies\\" any knowledge of the cheating, it’s difficult to imagine how such widespread and systematic malfeasance could have occurred without her awareness, or at least her willful ignorance. It remains to be seen whether criminal charges will be brought against Hall and other administrators, but the damage to Atlanta's education system has already been done. The trust between students, parents, and educators has been severely eroded, and the fallout will likely be felt for years to come. This tragic scandal serves as a stark reminder of the dangers of a single-minded pursuit of success at any cost. While high test scores and public praise may have once made Atlanta the envy of the nation, the bitter truth that has now emerged paints a very different picture. It is up to the city’s educators, administrators, and lawmakers to begin the arduous task of rebuilding Atlanta's educational system on a foundation of integrity, transparency, and genuine dedication to the success and well-being of its students."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

(CNN) -- A flurry of last-minute legal maneuvers Tuesday spared, for now, the life of John Ferguson, a Florida death row inmate who suffers from mental illness and at one point called himself the 'prince of God.' Ferguson, a diagnosed schizophrenic convicted of killing eight people, was scheduled to get the lethal injection Tuesday at 6 p.m. ET at a Florida State Prison. But an appeals court in Atlanta granted an emergency stay of execution Tuesday night. Florida officials then asked the Supreme Court to allow the lethal injection to proceed. Just before midnight the high court denied Florida's request, keeping in place the stay of execution, according to court documents. Some had questioned why authorities would kill a man who suffered from mental illness. Laurel Bellows, the president of the American Bar Association, released a statement earlier Tuesday saying she was concerned about how thoroughly Ferguson's competency was evaluated. \\"The American Bar Association is alarmed that Florida is poised to execute John Ferguson, a man diagnosed as severely mentally ill for more than 40 years, before the constitutionality of his execution is fully evaluated.\\" Chris Handman, one of Ferguson's attorneys, told CNN. \\"We think the court should intervene to stop that execution from going forward.\\" Handman said a court had earlier found that Ferguson was mentally ill and had delusions that caused him to think he is the \\"Prince of God.\\" Ferguson is on death row for the murders of eight people in Hialeah and Carol City, Florida, in the late 1970s.

Answer the following question: Hypertension , which is also called \\"high blood pressure,\\" occurs when a person’s blood pressure is always high. Hypertension is said to be present when a person's systolic blood pressure is always 140 or higher, and/or if the person's diastolic blood pressure is always 90 or higher. Having hypertension increases a person’s chance for developing heart disease, having a stroke, or suffering from other serious cardiovascular diseases. Hypertension often does not have any symptoms, so a person may not know that he or she has high blood pressure. For this reason, hypertension is often called the \\"silent killer.\\" Treatments for hypertension include diet changes, exercise, and medication.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Ross James Brawn OBE (born 23 November 1954) is the Formula One Managing Director of Motorsports and technical director. He is also a former motorsport engineer and Formula One team principal. He had worked for a number of Formula One teams, serving as the technical director of the championship-winning Benetton and Ferrari teams. He took a sabbatical from the sport in 2007 but returned to F1 for the 2008 season as Team Principal of Honda. His career in motorsport began in 1976 when he joined March Engineering in the town of Bicester as a milling machine operator. Soon afterwards he joined their Formula 3 racing team as a mechanic. Brawn was hired by Sir Frank Williams in 1978 as a machinist for the newly formed Williams team. He quickly moved up through the ranks, working in the R&D department with Frank Dernie and as an aerodynamicist in the team's wind tunnel. Brawn joined the Haas Lola team in 1985 and was part of Neil Oatley's design team at FORCE that produced both the Lola THL1 and THL2 cars used by the team. However, with the 4 cylinder Hart engine in the THL1 and the new Ford V6 turbo powering the THL2, results were scarce against teams like McLaren and Williams with their TAG-Porsche and Honda turbo engines. This was despite the cars generally being regarded by most in the F1 paddock as being the best handling cars on the grid, as well as having 1980 World Champion Alan Jones and former factory Ferrari and Renault driver Patrick Tambay as the drivers. When the Haas team left F1 at the end of the 1986 season, Brawn moved to Arrows. There he designed the Megatron powered Arrows A10 and its update, the A10B for the 1987 and 1988 seasons respectively and the Ford V8 powered Arrows A11 used in 1989. Later in 1989 Brawn moved to the Jaguar Sportscar racing division, and was lead designer on the Jaguar XJR-14 which won the 1991 World Sportscar Championship. What did he do there?","completion":"At Jaguar Sportscar racing division, Ross Brawn was the lead designer on the Jaguar XJR-14, a car that went on to win the 1991 World Sportscar Championship.

Coming off their win over the Steelers, the Patriots stayed at home for an AFC East rematch with the 3-10 Jets. The Patriots punted on their first drive of the game, giving the Jets the ball at their own 3-yard line. After a 1-yard Thomas Jones run, Jets quarterback Clemens threw an interception to Eugene Wilson, who returned it for a touchdown. Clemens was hit by Seymour and suffered an ankle injury on the play and did not return to the game. Wilson also became the Patriots' 21st player to score a touchdown on the season, tying an NFL record set by the Denver Broncos in 2000 and Los Angeles Rams in 1987. On their ensuing possession, the Jets gained 49&#160;yards on an option play to running back Leon Washington, but then failed a fourth down conversion from the Patriots' 17-yard line. With 6:36 remaining in the first quarter, the Patriots began a drive that ended 17 plays later, in the 2nd quarter, on a 26-yard Gostkowski field goal. After a Jets punt, the Patriots moved the ball to their own 40-yard line when a Chris Hanson punt attempt was blocked by David Bowens and returned for a touchdown to cut the Patriots' lead to 10-7. On the Jets' next possession, Washington blocked a Graham punt attempt to give the Patriots the ball at the Jets' 3-yard line. A 1-yard Maroney touchdown run a play later gave the Patriots a 17-7 lead going into halftime. Gostkowski's extra point, his 67th of the season, broke Uwe von Schamann's single-season record of 66 with the Miami Dolphins in 1984. A Jets punt gave the Patriots the ball at their own 9-yard line early in the third quarter. After two Maroney rushes for a total of 5&#160;yards, a Brady pass on third down intended to Moss was intercepted by Jets cornerback Darrelle Revis. The Jets moved into the red zone, but were driven back on a Thomas Jones run for a 1-yard loss and a delay of game penalty. On third down, Pennington completed a 10-yard pass to Baker, who then fumbled. Wilson recovered it for the Patriots, but a subsequent exchange of punts kept the third quarter scoreless. Another Hanson punt began the fourth quarter, giving the Jets the ball from their own 15-yard line. The Jets then embarked upon a 17-play drive where Pennington completed 10 passes on 12 attempts, none for more than 14&#160;yards. The drive ended at the Patriots' 15-yard line, where the Jets cut the Patriots' lead to 17-10 on a 33-yard Mike Nugent field goal. The Patriots' ensuing drive began with two incompletions intended for Moss. On third down, Brady completed a 16-yard pass to Moss, and then a 46-yard pass to Moss to give the Patriots the ball at the Jets' 14-yard line. A 4-yard Maroney run, incompletion, and sack for a loss of 6&#160;yards set up a 33-yard Gostkowski field goal. The Jets' next possession ended in a 35-yard missed Nugent field goal, and the Jets failed to score on their final drive to give the Patriots a 20-10 win. It gave the Patriots a 14-0 record, tying them with the 1972 Miami Dolphins for the best record to start a season. The win also clinched home-field advantage throughout the playoffs for the Patriots. Answer this question: How many total yards of field goals did Gostkowski make?","completion":"Gostkowski made two field goals in the game, one from 26 yards and another from 33 yards.

A senior congressional Democratic source conveyed to CNN's Chief Congressional Correspondent Dana Bash, \\"We've got to get out of the bunker and fix these problems.\\" The flaws in the newly rolled out law have only served to fuel the Republican-led efforts to undermine the President and his allies, as well as deter a policy they have long deemed unworkable.

The White House, facing mounting criticism and dissatisfaction from both parties, now has until Friday to devise a solution to counteract the problem-ridden rollout of the ACA. Failure to do so could lead to an even greater rift between the political parties and potentially put the future of the ACA at risk. Various issues have affected the ACA's implementation, including technical glitches and inaccessibility of the website, which has led to the low number of sign-ups. These difficulties have not only been detrimental to the government's agenda but have also led to the current contentious political climate.

Summarize this article: Put a new speculum, or pointed end, onto your otoscope before each patient. Select the largest possible speculum that your patient’s ear will accommodate. When inserted, the speculum should fit snugly into the outer third of the ear canal. Speculums that are too small can cause discomfort and reduce how much of the ear you can examine. Use the following guidelines for speculum size: Adults: 4 to 6 millimeters Children: 3 to 4 millimeters Infants: as small as 2 millimeters Without using the otoscope, take a look at the person’s external ear and notice any redness, discharge or swelling. Manipulate the ear gently and ask the patient if there is any pain. With Swimmer’s ear there is often pain, swelling, redness, and discharge that can be observed before even using the otoscope. Place the otoscope at your patients ear, not in it. Look into your otoscope and then slowly insert the pointed end of it into the ear canal. Steady your hand on the side of the individuals face if necessary. Slow and gentle insertion can prevent unwanted movement in your patient. It also keeps your hand and scope in line with the ear and minimizes the risk of injury. Avoid putting too much pressure on the otoscope, which can bump the inner canal wall, causing the patient discomfort. Avoid ramming the speculum into the ear canal. Insert it at most 1 to 2 centimeters and then use the light to view beyond the tip of the speculum. Stop the examination immediately if the patient expresses any pain or discomfort. Examine the middle ear and eardrum. Angle the tip of the otoscope towards the person’s nose. This follows the normal angle of the ear canal. From here, move the otoscope gently at different angles. This allows you to view the person’s eardrum and canal walls. Stop the exam at any sign of increased pain or discomfort. Return the otoscope back to your starting position. As you watch through the speculum, gentle take the speculum and scope out of the person’s ear canal and outer ear. Release the person’s ear from your grasp. Remove the speculum from the otoscope. Throw it away in a certified medical waste container to minimize the spread of disease or infection to other patients. If you don’t have disposable speculums, scrub each tip with hot water to remove excess wax. Then soak the speculum in a covered dish of rubbing alcohol for 10 minutes.","completion":"This article talks about how to use a tool called an otoscope to check someone's ear. First, you need to put a clean, pointy part (called a speculum) on the otoscope. The size of the speculum should be right for the person's age. Next, you need to look at the person's ear without the otoscope to see if it's red or swollen. If it looks okay, you can gently put the otoscope near the person's ear and slowly move it into the ear canal. Be very careful not to hurt the person's ear. Then, you can angle the otoscope and look at different parts of the ear, like the eardrum. If the person feels any pain, stop the exam. Once you're done, take the otoscope out, remove the speculum and clean it or throw it away."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Who invented the disc brake in 1902?","completion":"The disc brake, a revolutionary innovation in automotive engineering and vehicle safety, was invented in 1902 by a British engineer named Frederick William Lanchester. Born on October 28, 1868, Lanchester was a highly skilled and inventive engineer who contributed significantly to the development of the British automobile and aviation industries. Born in Lewisham, London, Frederick Lanchester displayed a keen interest in engineering from a young age. He received his formal education at Hartley University College (now the University of Southampton) and the Royal College of Science (now Imperial College London). His career began at the Forward Gas Engine Company in Birmingham, where he designed and developed engines. In 1895, Frederick Lanchester, alongside his brother George, co-founded the Lanchester Engine Company to design and manufacture engines for motor vehicles. The company soon became the Lanchester Motor Company when the brothers started producing their own automobiles. In 1902, while working on improving the braking system of the motor vehicles, Lanchester came up with the disc brake concept. He patented this invention, making it the first-known patent for a disc brake system. At that time, the existing braking systems were mainly drum brakes, which had a tendency to overheat and lose their effectiveness when used frequently or for an extended period. Lanchester's disc brake innovation incorporated a rotating disc that was clamped by calipers, with brake pads on either side of the disc. When the driver applied the brake pedal, the calipers' hydraulic system would apply pressure to the brake pads, which then created friction against the spinning disc to slow or stop the vehicle. This design provided superior heat dissipation and better braking efficiency compared to drum brakes. Although the disc brake concept was ahead of its time, it did not gain widespread adoption in the automotive industry until the 1950s and 1960s, when advancements in materials technology and manufacturing processes made it feasible and cost-effective to produce disc brakes on a large scale. Frederick Lanchester's invention of the disc brake in 1902 has had a significant and lasting impact on the automotive and transportation industries. His innovation has undoubtedly contributed to improving vehicle safety and performance, making it a cornerstone of modern braking systems."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This House Believes Alternative Medicine Poses a Threat to Public Health What is a possible side to this debate?","completion":"The debate around whether alternative medicine poses a threat to public health has two main contrasting sides: one that agrees with the proposition (proponents) and the other that disagrees (opponents). In order to provide a comprehensive analysis, it is important to consider the arguments from both perspectives. Proponents' Arguments: 1. Lack of Scientific Evidence: One of the primary arguments put forth by proponents is that alternative medicine lacks solid scientific evidence and peer-reviewed research that supports its effectiveness. Many alternative therapies are not subjected to rigorous clinical trials or do not produce consistent, replicable results. This lack of evidence can lead to misinformed individuals relying on unproven methods that may not be effective in treating their health concerns. 2. Interference with Conventional Treatments: Another concern is that individuals may turn to alternative therapies as a substitute for proven conventional treatments, leading them to refuse or delay evidence-based care. This can result in the worsening of existing health conditions, and in some cases, can have fatal consequences. In particular, individuals with serious illnesses, such as cancer, may elect to forego traditional medical treatments in favor of alternative therapies which do not have a proven track record of success. 3. Quality Control and Regulation: Alternative medicine products, such as supplements and herbal remedies, often lack strict quality control and regulations. This can lead to products with varying effectiveness, potential adulteration, or even contamination. Without standardized manufacturing, it is difficult for consumers to know if the products they buy are safe and contain the necessary ingredients in the correct dosage. Additionally, some practitioners who offer alternative therapies may not be held to the same standards of care and licensing as conventional healthcare providers, leaving room for potential malpractice and harm to patients. 4. Misinformation and Exploitation: Proponents argue that the alternative medicine industry is driven by profit and preys on vulnerable individuals who are desperate for a cure. The spread of misleading information, false claims, and anecdotal successes creates an environment where people are encouraged to try unproven interventions. This not only puts their health at risk but can also lead to financial exploitation as they invest in costly treatments that may not provide any tangible benefit. Opponents' Arguments: 1. Holistic and Complementary Approach: Opponents of the proposition argue that alternative medicine can be a valuable complement to conventional treatments. Oftentimes, alternative therapies focus on holistic care, addressing not just the physical symptoms of an illness but also the emotional, mental, and spiritual aspects of the patient's well-being. This approach may provide individuals with a more comprehensive care plan and promote overall health and wellness. 2. Patient Empowerment and Autonomy: The use of alternative medicine can provide individuals with a sense of control and autonomy over their healthcare decisions. By exploring various treatment options and engaging in self-care practices, individuals can actively participate in their healing process and feel more invested in their health outcomes. 3. Cultural Sensitivity: Alternative medicine often incorporates traditional healing practices from various cultures. Opponents of the proposition argue that it is important to respect and preserve these practices, as they can provide a sense of identity, heritage, and connection to one's cultural roots. Additionally, these traditional practices may offer unique perspectives and approaches to healing that can complement or enhance conventional medical treatments. 4. The Potential for Scientific Discovery: Some opponents believe that alternative medicine should not be dismissed outright, as it may offer the potential for future scientific discoveries. Documented cases of alternative therapies providing benefit or showing promise in early scientific studies can serve as the impetus for further research and development, potentially leading to new and effective treatments in the future. In conclusion, the debate over whether alternative medicine poses a threat to public health requires careful consideration of the benefits and risks involved, as well as the importance of preserving cultural practices and the potential for future scientific discoveries. Both proponents and opponents of the proposition make valid points, and an informed stance should take into account the diverse factors at play. Ultimately, public health would benefit from a cautious and discerning approach that takes into consideration both conventional and alternative healthcare practices, ensuring that individuals receive the safest and most effective treatments available."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Emiliano Zapata Salazar (Spanish pronunciation: [emi'ljano sa'pata]; 8 August 1879 - 10 April 1919) was a leading figure in the Mexican Revolution, the main leader of the peasant revolution in the state of Morelos, and the inspiration of the agrarian movement called Zapatismo. Zapata was born in the rural village of Anenecuilco in Morelos State, where peasant communities were under increasing pressure from the small landowning class who monopolized land and water resources for sugar cane production with the support of dictator Porfirio Diaz. Zapata early on participated in political movements against Diaz and the landowning hacendados, and when the Revolution broke out in 1910 he was positioned as a central leader of the peasant revolt in Morelos. Cooperating with a number of other peasant leaders he formed the Liberation Army of the South of which he soon became the undisputed leader. Meanwhile, the disintegration of the revolution outside of Morelos put pressure on the Zapatistas. As General Arenas had turned over to the constitutionalists, he had secured peace for his region and he remained in control there. This suggested to many revolutionaries that perhaps the time had come to seek a peaceful conclusion to the struggle. A movement within the Zapatista ranks led by former General Vazquez and Zapata's erstwhile adviser and inspiration Otilio Montano moved against the Tlaltizapan headquarters demanding surrender to the Carrancistas. Reluctantly, Zapata had Montano tried for treason and executed (Womack 1983-86). Zapata began looking for allies among the northern revolutionaries and the southern Felicistas, followers of the Liberalist Felix Diaz. He sent Gildardo Magana as an envoy to communicate with the Americans and other possible sources of support. In the fall of 1917 a force led by Gonzalez and the ex-Zapatista Sidronio Camacho, who had killed Zapata's brother Eufemio, moved into the eastern part of Morelos taking Cuautla, Zacualpan and Jonacatepec. Zapata continued his work to try to unite with the national anti-Carrancista movement through the next year, and the constitutionalists did not make further advances. In the winter of 1918 a harsh cold and the onset of the Spanish flu decimated the population of Morelos, causing the loss of a quarter of the total population of the state, almost as many as had been lost to Huerta in 1914. (Womack 311). Furthermore, Zapata began to worry that by the end of the World War, the US would turn its attention to Mexico forcing the Zapatistas to either join the Carrancistas in a national defense or to acquiesce to foreign domination of Mexico. In December 1918 Carrancistas under Gonzalez undertook an offensive campaign taking most of the state of Morelos, and pushing Zapata to retreat. The main Zapatista headquarters were moved to Tochimilco, Puebla, although Tlaltizapan also continued to be under Zapatista control. Through Castro, Carranza issued offers to the main Zapatista generals to join the nationalist cause, with pardon. But apart from Manuel Palafox, who having fallen in disgrace among the Zapatistas had joined the Arenistas, none of the major generals did (Womack 313-14). Zapata emitted statements accusing Carranza of being secretly sympathetic to the Germans (Womack 315). In March Zapata finally emitted an open letter to Carranza urging him for the good of the fatherland to resign his leadership to Vazquez Gomez, by now the rallying point of the anti-constitutionalist movement (Womack 319-20). Having posed this formidable moral challenge to Carranza prior to the upcoming 1920 presidential elections, the Zapatista generals at Tochimilco, Magana and Ayaquica, urged Zapata not to take any risks and to lay low. But Zapata declined, considering that the respect of his troops depended on his active presence at the front (Womack 320-22). Did they capture any other territory or peoples?","completion":"Yes, they did capture other territories and places. During the fall of 1917, a force led by Gonzalez and the ex-Zapatista Sidronio Camacho, who had killed Zapata's brother Eufemio, moved into the eastern part of Morelos and took control of Cuautla, Zacualpan, and Jonacatepec. This shows that the Zapatistas and their allies were able to capture other territories and areas during their struggle."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Article: In the latter half of his career Hayek made a number of contributions to social and political philosophy, which he based on his views on the limits of human knowledge, and the idea of spontaneous order in social institutions. He argues in favour of a society organised around a market order, in which the apparatus of state is employed almost (though not entirely) exclusively to enforce the legal order (consisting of abstract rules, and not particular commands) necessary for a market of free individuals to function. These ideas were informed by a moral philosophy derived from epistemological concerns regarding the inherent limits of human knowledge. Hayek argued that his ideal individualistic, free-market polity would be self-regulating to such a degree that it would be 'a society which does not depend for its functioning on our finding good men for running it'.

Let's examine each sentence in detail to better understand the distinction. 1. \\"Hold your tongue.\\" In this sentence, \\"hold\\" refers to the act of restraining oneself from speaking. It means to stop oneself from saying something, especially in situations where it would be considered inappropriate, rude, or harmful. This expression is idiomatic and figurative; someone who's told to \\"hold their tongue\\" is not literally being asked to physically grasp their tongue and prevent it from moving. The meaning of \\"hold\\" in this situation primarily focuses on exercising self-control and discretion in one's speech. 2. \\"He can hold his liquor.\\" The meaning of \\"hold\\" in this sentence is contextually different from its meaning in the first sentence.

Firefighters are trained professionals responsible for combating and extinguishing fires, besides performing rescue operations and other emergency services. The primary methods of putting out a fire involve either removing heat, oxygen, fuel, or disrupting the chemical reaction in the fire triangle. One common technique involves using water to cool down the fire, thereby reducing its heat. 2. \\"A firefighter sprays water onto a gigantic pile of burning ash that includes flames and dark smoke.\\" In this statement, we have a more specific scenario as we see a firefighter employing their skills to tackle a fire. As mentioned earlier, using water is a standard method of extinguishing flames, and the description clearly details the firefighter's actions. The firefighting task involves spraying water on a massive pile of burning ash, which is in line with their profession and the attempt to suppress the fire.

Schlitterbahn death was due to neck injury, police say Police and firefighters found Caleb Thomas Schwab in the pool at the end of the ride on Sunday, police said. The circumstances of the boy's death are still being investigated, police said. Caleb was the son of Rep. Scott Schwab and his wife, Michele, who issued a statement Sunday night. \\"Since the day he was born, he brought abundant joy to our family and all those who he came into contact with,\\" the parents said. \\"As we try and mend our home with him no longer with us, we are comforted knowing he believed in his savior, Jesus, and they are forever together now. We will see him another day.\\" Kansas state police are investigating Caleb's death at the Schlitterbahn water park, which has been closed for the investigation, said spokeswoman Winter Prosapio. The boy died while riding the Verrückt, the world's tallest water slide, she said. The park has released no other details into how the boy died. The slide requires two to three riders to be strapped in a raft with a total weight between 400 and 500 pounds. The raft then \\"will slide down a jaw-dropping 168 foot 7 inch structure, only to be blasted back up a second massive hill and then sent down yet another gut wrenching 50 foot drop for the ultimate in water slide thrills,\\" the park's website says. Caleb Schwab was riding with two adult women, to whom he was not related, police said. The women suffered minor facial injuries, police said. It was unclear whether the party met the weight requirement. Police declined to comment further on the investigation. Some park guests say the slide's harness wasn't working properly earlier in the day. \\"A lady in front of me said that multiple times she rode the ride today, the Verruckt, and that the front harness did not work any of the times that she rode it,\\" Verrückt riders are required to be at least 54 inches tall, . It was not immediately known whether Caleb met the height requirement. Leslie Castaneda was at the park Sunday and told CNN affiliate that the victim's brother saw what happened. \\"The little boy said to a worker, 'I just saw my little brother die because of one of your attractions,'\\" . \\"(Caleb) looked skinny. He shouldn't have been on that ride.\\" Thousands of children are hurt annually on amusement rides, according to a by Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus, Ohio, which examined data from the Consumer Product Safety Commission. Head and neck injuries were the most common at 28%, with 1.5% of the injuries requiring hospitalization, the study said. Consumer Product Safety Commission statistics for 2015 are not available, but a review of the raw data . About 30,000 of these cases involved those under age 18. At 17 stories high -- higher than Niagara Falls -- Verrückt propels riders at 50 mph. Its name translates as \\"insane\\" in German. Standing at exactly 168 feet 7 inches, the slide was certified by Guinness World Records in May 2014 as the world's tallest water slide. It is 5 feet taller than the previous record holder, a water slide at a Rio de Janeiro country club. The slide opened to the public in July 2014 after several weeks of delays. Technical glitches forced the original May 23 opening date to be pushed back three times, a park spokesperson told CNN at the time. \\"We always ride our rides first,\\" Schooley said. \\"And we found out it was too steep and too short. So we were able to redesign it from what we learned. We tore down two-thirds of the slide and rebuilt it into the design we have now.\\" The slide will remain closed during the investigation, Schlitterbahn said in a statement.

Cylindrotominae, Limoniinae, and Pediciinae have been ranked as subfamilies of Tipulidae by most authors, though occasionally elevated to family rank. In the most recent classifications, only Pediciidae is now ranked as a separate family, due to considerations of paraphyly. In colloquial speech, crane flies are sometimes known as mosquito hawks or daddy longlegs, a term also used to describe opiliones or the family Pholcidae, both of which are arachnids. The larvae of crane flies are known commonly as leatherjackets. Can we conclude that is there such a thing as a mosquito hawk?","completion":"Yes, there is such a thing as a mosquito hawk. It's just another name people use for crane flies. Crane flies are insects that belong to the family Tipulidae. They have long legs and might look like big mosquitoes, but they're different. Some people might also call them daddy longlegs. However, daddy longlegs can mean other creatures too, like some spiders or harvestmen, which are not insects like crane flies. But, it's important to note that crane flies don't actually eat mosquitoes. The name mosquito hawk can be a bit confusing.

If you encounter difficult stains that do not come off with a commercial cleaner, paint thinner applied with steel wool can help. Make sure to follow package directions, especially any safety instructions, before applying paint thinner. Then, work the paint thinner into the frames using a steel wool sponge until the stains come off. Be gentle when using steel wool to avoid scratching the frames. Some steel wool pads have soap built in that can help you clean. After cleaning your frames, they may look a little dull.

Firstly, the individual's long-standing friends are unhappy with him due to his pretentious and arrogant demeanor, which may indicate a change in his attitude or behavior over time. Secondly, there seems to be dissatisfaction among the person's new business associates. They express discontent regarding his authoritarian and domineering nature.

Step 2: Air goes through all the little branches in your lungs to fill up the air sacs, or alveoli This step distributes the air you breathed in evenly throughout your lungs so that it can efficiently transfer the oxygen to the bloodstream. Step 3: Oxygen goes through the walls of the alveoli and into the capillaries Here, the oxygen molecules diffuse across the alveolar wall and enter the tiny blood vessels called capillaries, where they become available to the bloodstream. Step 4: The oxygen goes into the bloodstream As the oxygen diffuses from the alveoli into the capillaries, it binds to a protein called hemoglobin in red blood cells. This allows oxygen to be transported throughout the body to cells and tissues that need it. Step 5: Oxygen is left and carbon dioxide is picked up Once the oxygen has been delivered to the cells, it releases the carbon dioxide, which is a waste product of cellular respiration. The carbon dioxide then binds to hemoglobin and is transported back to the lungs for removal.

Which country introduced fewer non-native species to the environment? Hint: One of the main causes of extinction is introduction of exotic species into an environment. These exotic and new species can also be called invasive species or non-native species . These non-native species, being new to an area, may not have natural predators in the new habitat, which allows their populations to easily adapt and grow. Invasive species out-compete the native species for resources. Sometimes invasive species are so successful at living in a certain habitat that the native species go extinct ( Figure below ). Answer:","completion":"Based on your description, it can be inferred that Singapore introduced fewer non-native species to the environment compared to India. This is because Singapore was very protective of its native species and thus less likely to introduce exotic or invasive species which could threaten the native ecosystems. By being protective, Singapore helps to maintain the natural balance and prevents the negative impact that these invasive species may have on their native species and environment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Q:Background: The classical explanation of gravity is that a force of attraction acts at a distance between two objects and the magnitude of the force is directly proportional to each of the masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the objects. The objects move toward each other due to this force of attraction. Einstein’s new concept of gravity states that matter (mass) causes the space around the matter to curve and also distorts time. A straight line through this curved space would also be curved in order to be a straight line. Paragraph: Rob is an amateur astronomer. Recently, he detected four asteroids, asteroid A, asteroid B, asteroid C, and asteroid D. Asteroid A and asteroid B are of the same mass, but asteroid A is farther from the earth than asteroid B.

However, in my friend's opinion, we forget that when attending a regular school, the child is not into socializing all the while. The child is restricted to so many other activities. Studies take a major role in a child's life. The child hardly has the time to interact at school. The child might be meeting and studying along with many peers; however, how many kids interact with all the kids in a class? But in homeschooling system, as my friend mentioned, the kid has all the time and can plan his day accordingly. During the day the child studies just like other school-going kids but with no burden of homework and project work, the child has so much free time in the evening as to effectively interact and play with peers. The quality time the child spends in education is really impressive. Homeschooled kids have the opportunity to socialize more often as they have a lot of time in their hands. They can also make socializing a regular habit. Just as my friend said, her child goes to a neighboring park almost every day and has a set of friends who go there daily. Other children get back home to finish off homework and project work whereas her child who is already through with studies gets the opportunity to spend time with family members.

Article: A deal has been signed to turn by-products from a Scottish distillery into fuel for cars. In what is declared to be a world first, the Tullibardine distillery in Perthshire has linked up with a spin-out company from Napier University in Edinburgh. They plan to use bacteria to feed on the \\"leftovers\\" from the whisky making process. This will produce butanol which can be used to fuel vehicles. More than 90% of the stuff that comes out of a whisky distillery is not whisky. It is leftovers like draff and pot ales -- both produced in the early stages of the process. They are high in sugar and are currently used for things like fertiliser and cattle feed. Napier University's Biofuel Research Centre (BfRC) has already shown that the right bacteria can feed on those by-products to produce butanol--a direct replacement for vehicle fuel. Now the spin-out company, Celtic Renewables, and independent whisky producer Tullibardine have signed an agreement. Together they will apply the process to thousands of tons of the distillery's leftovers. Professor Martin Tangney, founder of Celtic Renewables, said \\"Our partnership with Tullibardine is an important step in the development of a business which combines two important Scottish industries -- whisky and renewables. This project shows that creative use of existing technologies can _ resources on our doorstep to benefit both the environment and the economy.\\" Douglas Ross, managing director of Tullibardine, which spends PS250,000 disposing of its by-products every year, said \\"We are delighted to be partnering Celtic Renewables in this creative business, the obvious benefits of which are environmental. It takes a cost to us and turns it into something that has social as well as commercial value.\\" The project is being supported by a grant from the Scottish government's Zero Waste Scotland initiative. Celtic Renewables said it eventually aimed to build a processing plant in Scotland, with the hope of building an industry that could be worth PS60m a year.

Title: Longford Movie plot: From HBO.com:LONGFORD [Jim Broadbent] is a thought-provoking story inspired by real events in the life of British Lord Frank Pakenham, the 7th Earl of Longford, and his controversial headline-making friendship with one of England's most notorious criminals. Longford, a devout Catholic, often visited prisoners because of his passionate belief in forgiveness and society's need for prisoner rehabilitation.In 1965, he begins visiting Myra Hindley [Samantha Morton], a young woman serving a life sentence for murdering children with her lover Ian Brady [Andy Serkis]. Though Longford encountered public outrage, discouragement from his wife Elizabeth [Lindsay Duncan], doubt from his family, and criticism from his colleagues and the press, he continued to visit and exchange letters with Hindley. After learning that she once converted to Catholicism, Longford encourages her to return to the church and ask for God's forgiveness.After the Prime Minister removes him from the House of Lords, he devotes his time to crusading for Hindley and other prisoners. His wife eventually joins the crusade after reading Hindley's letters, meeting her and seeing the horrible prison conditions. She suspects that Hindley is receiving harsher punishment because she is a woman. Longford takes Hindley's cause public, talking to the press about her case and defending her as an accomplice corrupted by Ian Brady.At first, Hindley is grateful for Longford's efforts and seems to make progress in her return to the church. Later, she unexpectedly rejects his help and shocks him with the news that she lied to him about the murders. Once this information is made public, Longford's good name is damaged even further. Longford begins to question his religious beliefs, but reaches a deeper level in his Catholic faith when he is able to forgive Hindley for her transgressions against him.Many years later, she asks him to visit her once again and he complies.

Adam, a medical student, is lured to a cabin far from civilization where he volunteers to be repeatedly killed and reanimated by Dr. Franklin Vick, through use of a mysterious serum. While \\"Subject Two\\" as he is initially successful, he begins to experience violent seizures and excruciating pain, begging Vick to kill him or committing suicide several times. Adam eventually gains complete immortality and near instantaneous regeneration, but as a consequence he loses the very sense of being alive; he can no longer feel things (including pain) and no longer can have emotions. His eyes turn snow white, and, to compensate for the gradual loss of his sense of self, he becomes violent and depressed, going so far as to kill a hunter that accidentally shoots him rather than risk him exposing the project. Eventually the student leaves Vick, only to become a walking ghost doomed to walk the earth for eternity. After returning home, \\"Vick\\" finds the real Dr. Franklin Vick, and it is revealed that the doctor for the course of the entire movie was his assistant, Subject One. Thinking that he had accidentally killed Dr. Vick, Subject One assumed his identity to continue the work, but finds that the serum was initially perfect, and it was only his tampering that gradually changed Adam.

Robert Ekaireb, who is accused of murdering his pregnant wife Li Hua Cao, arriving at the Old Bailey. A 'paranoid' millionaire accused of murdering his pregnant wife did not to tell police about bank statements 'proving' she was alive for five years, the Old Bailey heard today. The jury heard the 'paranoid' 38-year-old, who suffered from OCD and depression, claimed the letters were proof his missing wife Li Hua Cao was still alive. But he claims he failed to hand them over to police, because he did not like the detective in charge of the investigation. The 38-year-old allegedly murdered his wife when he flew into a jealous rage at their home in Hampstead, north London. He wanted Li Hua to take a lie detector test to prove the paternity of her unborn baby. The property developer spent the night at a nightclub in Londonâ€™s West End after she vanished, before arranging for their luxury flat to be be redecorated, professionally cleaned and recarpeted the next day. Ekaireb claims that she had packed her. bags and left him for a better life - but she has not been seen alive. since October 23, 2006. The couple moved into at a luxury one-bed apartment at Pavilion Court in the Mount Vernon complex, a private gated community in Hampstead, north London, at the beginning of August 2006, the court heard. Despite only living there for three months, Ekarieb allegedly undertook extensive cleaning and decorating, even hiring professional marble cleaners to ensure the flat was spotless. He also fitted new cream carpets which were identical to the original ones - and then could not remember doing it, the jury were told. Prosecutor Brian Altman QC said: 'When he was asked by the police about work done to the apartment, although saying he recalled he had the place professionally cleaned as a condition of the letting he claimed to have completely forgotten about the re-carpeting and he flatly denied having any other work done to the flat.' The carpets were so similar, that the. previous owner was not able to distinguish any difference from. photographs shown to him by the police. It emerged Ekaireb also owned a three-bedroom apartment on the same gated estate. He. had lived there with his Slovakian ex-lover Martina Kamenistiakova. before abandoning the property when their relationship ended. Pavilion Court in Hampstead, where the couple shared a one-bedroom flat. The Old Bailey heard Ekarieb had the flat completely re-carpeted and re-decorated in the months after his pregnant wife disappeared. 'Gainsborough House was kept locked by him and resembled a time capsule when police entered it six years later, rather than a shrine to a lost romance,' said Mr Altman. When police first entered that property in February last year the apartment, which had not been rented out for years, was 'in a state of deep freeze', the prosecutor explained. 'They found the place as it was when the defendant had last left it, even to the point of items of food being left uneaten or half-eaten,' he said. Nearby: Ekarieb also owned a three-bedroom apartment in Gainsborough House (pictured), which is part of the same gated complex in north London. 'And although the defendant had provided the security men on the estate with the keys for all the properties, they never had the keys for Gainsborough House.' Li Hua's family had made contact with that address after her disappearance believing she was living there. 'We know the defendant had access to two apartments in two blocks for his own private purposes,' said Mr Altman. Li Hua Cao has not been seen since October 2006. Her brother reported her missing from China in 2007. 'If he killed her it took place in private where there were no eye witnesses and no one to tell tales.' After his wife's disappearance, Ekaireb kept computer generated bank letters as 'dynamite' proof she was still alive. He only handed the letters from HSBC to the police five years after Li Hua went missing, it was said. Mr. Altman said the letters were sent to Gainsborough House 'a few weeks. after she had disappeared' from her bank advising her they were going. to close her account as they mistakenly believed the Chinese passport. she used to set up the account had expired. 'He thought it was dynamite - showing 'my wife is alive and well',' said Mr Altman. Ekaireb. said he did not hand in the letters because he disliked a detective. working on the investigation, claiming he was 'obstructive and. unhelpful'. But Mr Altman dismissed this as 'a lame excuse'. But. when Li Hua visited him in London on a tourist visa, he did not allow. her to sleep at Gainsborough House because 'to him that didn't feel. right'. It was said that Li Hua's principal ambition was to marry a wealthy man who could support a lavish lifestyle and send money to her family in China. The couple met at the lapdancing club where Li Hua was working in Ireland in late 2005. They married on October 4, 2006, by which time the 27-year-pld was already pregnant. But Li Hua had become disillusioned with her marriage and the 'superficiality of her married existence' and repeatedly attempted to leave Ekaireb who was growing paranoid and jealous. Ekaireb was so paranoid about his wife cheating on him that he tried to hire a private investigator and set up a lie detector test, the court heard. He made an appointment for a test at 3pm on October 9, 2006 but either cancelled or did not turn up, it is claimed. On 28 August Ekaireb assaulted Li Hua in public after an argument on the way home from a restaurant, the jury were told. A passer-by called police and officers found Li Hua in East Finchley Food and Wine with cuts and grazes to both arms. Li Hua Cao has not been seen since October 2006. Her brother reported her missing from China in 2007. She claimed that Ekaireb pushed her to the ground after they rowed about her past and him smoking in the car while she was pregnant. Li Hua told her sister that Ekaireb's father Rex had persuaded her to withdraw her allegation of assault, jurors heard. Ekaireb told police that Li Hua fell over after kicking him. Li Hau was 22 weeks pregnant when she 'simply vanished' on Monday 23 October 2006, jurors were told and no record of a birth has been discovered. Phone records show that Li Hau contacted her brother Li Bin Cao in Denmark earlier that day but never contacted him or her family in China again. Ekaireb allegedly arrived back at Pavilion Court at 11.07pm and at 11.44pm he rang his parents' home. He then phoned the manager's office at Club Tantra nightclub at around 1am before heading there in the early hours. That was the last phone call ever made from the flat, the court heard. He also made no attempts to track down his wife or report her disappearance to police, the court heard. Li Hau was finally reported missing by her brother in February 2007 but no evidence has been found that she is alive. In 2010 the investigation being taken over by a team from the Specialist Crime Directorate of the Metropolitan Police. The court heard Ekaireb was too embarrassed about meeting Li Hua at the lap-dancing club in Cork to introduce her to his mother. 'He did not want to lie to his mother about the circumstances in which they met,' Mr Altman said. They married in a Chinese wedding ceremony after Ekaireb gave her a wedding ring which he claimed was worth Â£10,000. But he looked down on her family, who originated from a fishing village. He reportedly said:'They had no sign of money, no sign of finesse, no sign of class'. Ekaireb, of Corrigan Close, Hendon, northwest London, denies murder. The trial continues.

Campbell was the seventh son of 12 children. The family lived on a farm where they barely got by growing cotton, corn, watermelons and potatoes. \\"We had no electricity,\\" he said, and money was scarce. \\" Campbell made a cameo appearance in the 1980 Clint Eastwood movie Any Which Way You Can, for which he recorded the title song. He gave up smoking in March 1992, and believed it improved his singing voice. In 1991, Campbell voiced Chanticleer the rooster in Don Bluth's live action/animated film Rock-a-Doodle. In 1999 he was featured on VH-1's Behind the Music, and on A&E Network's Biography and a PBS in concert special in 2001. He also appeared on a number of CMT programs, where he ranked among their Greatest Men of Country Music.

Options: - happiness - blank stares - communication - getting arrested - stage fright Explain why a human would choose \\"getting arrested\\" to answer the question above: The answer is:","completion":"\\"getting arrested\\" Step 1: Analyze the question The question is asking what is likely to happen if someone expresses themselves in public without wearing pants. Step 2: Evaluate the options Next, I will evaluate the given options and their relevance to the question: - Happiness: Though the person may feel a brief moment of happiness by expressing themselves, this option does not fully address the consequences of doing so without pants. - Blank stares: People might stare at someone expressing themselves without pants, but this option does not cover the full spectrum of potential reactions. - Communication: The individual expressing themselves without pants might spark some level of communication, but this option is a bit ambiguous and does not directly address the consequences. - Getting arrested: Public indecency laws typically make it illegal to expose one's body, particularly genitals, in public. As a result, a person who expresses themselves in public without wearing pants may indeed be arrested for violating these laws. - Stage fright: While it's reasonable to assume that someone not wearing pants in public could experience stage fright, this option does not address the legal consequences of doing so. Step 3: Choose the best answer Upon evaluating the options, \\"getting arrested\\" seems the most accurate and relevant choice because it addresses the legal consequences that a person could face for expressing themselves in public without wearing pants. The other options do not completely address the potential reactions or consequences that might stem from this type of behavior."},{"prompt":"Q: If I tell you that CO2 concentrations in the air have increased over the last decade dramatically, and ask you the question \\"what concentration in the air has increased dramatically over the last decade?\\", is the correct answer \\"zinc\\"?

(b). juice felt abrasive with the pills..","completion":"The sentence ends with option (a): \\"She swallowed her vitamins with juice instead of water, because the water felt abrasive with the pills.\\" This sentence describes a person's preferred method of taking vitamins, opting for juice rather than water. The reason provided is that the water feels abrasive when combined with the pills. This could be due to the taste, texture, or temperature of the water, making it an unpleasant experience for the individual. In contrast, consuming the vitamins with juice offers a more pleasant experience, as the fruity flavors likely help mask the taste or texture of the vitamins. Moreover, the thickness and natural sugar content of juice could help coat the person's throat and ease the swallowing process. This choice might be particularly effective for those who have a sensitive palate or find it difficult to swallow large pills with water alone. However, it's essential to consider that consuming vitamins with a beverage like fruit juice could impact the absorption and efficacy of certain nutrients. Some elements in vitamins, like calcium or iron, might bind with compounds found in specific fruit juices, such as oxalates or phytates, potentially reducing their availability to the body. To maximize the benefits of vitamins and minerals, individuals should carefully read the label and, if necessary, consult with a healthcare professional on the best practices for taking supplements. In summary, the sentence illustrates a personal preference for swallowing vitamins with juice instead of water due to the abrasive sensation created by the water when combined with the pills."},{"prompt":"Q: I heard that Casey used money to get food for their children, but didn't have enough for themselves.

Density reflects how closely packed the particles of matter are. When particles are packed together more tightly, matter is more dense. Differences in density of matter explain many phenomena. It explains why helium balloons rise. It explains why currents such as the Gulf Stream flow through the oceans. It explains why some things float in or sink. You can see this in action by pouring vegetable oil into water. You can see a colorful demonstration in this video.

The question asks for ways to observe the role density plays, and the response suggests watching the moon. While the moon can exhibit density differences due to its composition, this is not a practical or observable way to explore the concept of density for most people. A more appropriate response could be: To observe the role density plays, you can perform simple experiments at home. One such experiment involves using different liquids and objects to see how they interact based on their densities. You will need: 1. A clear container (such as a glass or tall jar) 2. Water (preferably at room temperature) 3. Cooking oil (e.g., vegetable oil) 4. Syrup or honey 5. Small objects of various densities (e.g., a grape, a cork, a small piece of metal, a plastic bottle cap, etc.) Follow these steps: 1. Fill the bottom third of the container with syrup or honey. This represents a denser liquid. 2. Carefully pour the oil into the container until it fills the middle third. Given its density differences, the oil should float on top of the syrup or honey. 3. Gently add water to the container until it fills the top third. Since water has a lower density than the previous two liquids, it should remain separate and form a third layer. 4. One by one, drop the objects into the container. Observe their positions as they settle. You should notice that objects will position themselves at different levels within the container based on their densities. Objects denser than water will sink to the syrup or honey layer, whereas objects less dense than water will float on the oil or water layers. Objects with similar densities to the liquids will settle within the respective layer. This experiment demonstrates the role of density in the behavior of matter, showing how the relative densities of different substances and objects influence their interactions and positioning."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: What would be the ★-rating of this review (★ being the lowest and ★★★★★ being the highest)? \\"Tsss\\" The answer is:","completion":"It is difficult to determine the exact star rating for a review that only contains the word \\"Tsss.\\" However, we can provide an interpretation based on similar situations and the context in which it might have been used. First, it would be helpful to know more about the product or service being reviewed. Is it a restaurant, a movie, a book, a service provider, or a tangible product? The context is essential to decipher the sentiment behind the review properly. Assuming we still have no context, let's evaluate both alternatives; the review could be interpreted as negative or positive. 1. Negative Interpretation: If we assume that \\"Tsss\\" is an approximation of the \\"tsk\\" noise, commonly used to express disapproval or annoyance, then it is possible that the review could be negative. The reviewer may not have had a good experience with the product or service, and instead of writing a detailed explanation, they decided to convey their dissatisfaction with a simple expression. In this case, the star rating could be interpreted as ★ (the lowest), ★★, or at most, ★★★. 2. Positive Interpretation: On the other hand, \\"Tsss\\" could be interpreted as a colloquial or slang expression equivalent to \\"Wow!\\" or \\"Amazing!\\" If the reviewer is expressing awe or excitement on the reviewed product or service, it might receive a positive rating. In this case, the star rating could be as high as ★★★★★, ★★★★, or at least, ★★★. Clearly, providing a specific star rating based solely on the word \\"Tsss\\" is impossible without additional context to understand the reviewer's intent better. Nevertheless, the interpretations outlined above give us a range of potential star ratings based on whether the reviewer intended to express a negative or positive sentiment. In conclusion, without further context, it is impossible to assign a definitive star rating to this review.

Here are possible answers to this question: - getting tired - go somewhere - water pollute - backache - automobile accidents I believe the correct choice is \\"automobile accidents\\", here's why:","completion":"The correct choice is indeed \\"automobile accidents.\\" Here's a detailed explanation of why this is the best answer among the options provided: 1. Relevance to driving a car: Among the options given, \\"automobile accidents\\" is the only one that directly relates to the act of driving a car. The other choices, such as getting tired or having a backache, may occur as a result of spending long hours in a car, but they are not specific to the experience of driving. 2. Universality of the experience: Almost everyone who has driven a car has either seen or been in an automobile accident, even if it's just a minor fender-bender. This is because millions of automobile accidents occur every year, making it an unfortunately common part of the driving experience. In contrast, not everyone who drives experiences significant fatigue, back pain, or contributes to water pollution. Therefore, it is statistically more likely for someone who has driven a car to have encountered an automobile accident. 3. Severity and impact: Automobile accidents can range from minor to severe, and they can have significant consequences on people's lives, including property damage, injuries, and sometimes fatalities. This makes the experience of seeing or being in an automobile accident a notable part of someone's driving history, as opposed to something like getting tired, which is generally less severe and impactful. 4. Public awareness and safety concerns: Due to the frequency and consequences of automobile accidents, public awareness campaigns, insurance companies, and driving schools all emphasize the importance of safe driving practices to avoid accidents. Driving laws and regulations are in place to reduce the risk of accidents occurring. As a result, the concept of automobile accidents is more prominently embedded in the collective consciousness than other issues, such as backaches or water pollution, which may not be as directly associated with driving a car. In conclusion, the correct choice is \\"automobile accidents,\\" as it is the most relevant, universal, severe, and publicly recognized experience related to driving a car. The other options, while they may be issues that can affect those who drive, don't have as direct or significant an impact on the vast majority of drivers as the experience of witnessing or being involved in an automobile accident."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","completion":"A surveyor's chain, also known as a Gunter's chain, is a measuring instrument used by surveyors to measure distances on land. It was invented by the English mathematician Edmund Gunter in the early 17th century. The original surveyor's chain measures 66 feet (20.1168 meters) in length and is divided into 100 links, making each link 0.66 feet (0.201168 meters) long. The surveyor's chain comprises metal links connected by rings, creating a standardized and precise measurement tool that was widely used before the advent of modern measuring instruments such as tape measures and electronic distance measuring devices. It was particularly useful in surveying large parcels of land such as those found in the United States during the westward expansion. Despite the introduction of more advanced measuring tools, the surveyor's chain still holds importance in the United States, as it was incorporated in the design of the Public Land Survey System (PLSS), forming the basis of land measurements and property boundaries. As a result, many land records reference distances in chains and links. In summary, a standard surveyor's or Gunter's chain consists of 100 links, with each link measuring 0.66 feet (0.201168 meters) in length. This measurement system played a significant role in surveying and mapping land, especially in the United States, and continues to have relevance today in connection with historical land records and legal documents."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Tokyo experienced many more earthquakes than Kansas City. But I can use this background: Almost all earthquakes occur at plate boundaries. All types of plate boundaries have earthquakes. Convection within the Earth causes the plates to move. As the plates move, stresses build. When the stresses build too much, the rocks break. The break releases the energy that was stored in the rocks. The sudden release of energy is an earthquake. During an earthquake the rocks usually move several centimeters. Rarely, they may move as much as a few meters. Elastic rebound theory describes how earthquakes occur ( Figure below ). What is an answer for this question: Which city doesn't experience rocks moving several centimeters during earthquakes? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Kansas City doesn't experience rocks moving several centimeters during earthquakes as frequently as Tokyo. This conclusion is based on the given information that Tokyo experiences many more earthquakes than Kansas City. The background information provided explains that almost all earthquakes occur at plate boundaries, which are created by the movement of tectonic plates due to the convection within the Earth. When stresses build up too much, the rocks break and release energy, causing an earthquake. In this context, Tokyo is located near a convergent plate boundary where the Pacific Plate is subducting beneath the Eurasian Plate. This results in a high degree of tectonic activity, making Tokyo more prone to earthquakes. The movement of rocks during these earthquakes can range from several centimeters to a few meters. Therefore, the people living in Tokyo are more likely to experience the effects of earthquakes and the movement of rocks over several centimeters due to its geological location. On the other hand, Kansas City is situated within the stable interior region of the North American Plate, far from any plate boundaries. As a consequence, Kansas City doesn't experience earthquakes as frequently as Tokyo, nor does it experience the accompanying movement of rocks to the same extent. While it is possible for Kansas City to experience earthquakes (as the background information states all types of plate boundaries have earthquakes), these events are much rarer, and the likelihood of experiencing rocks moving several centimeters during earthquakes is considerably lower than in Tokyo. In summary, Kansas City is the city that doesn't experience rocks moving several centimeters during earthquakes as frequently as Tokyo, based on the difference in the number of earthquakes experienced by these two cities and the geological factors influencing seismic activities in these regions."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process Answer:","completion":"Tree blights can potentially affect bird nests, especially smaller ones, in several ways. In this case, the supposed perturbation would be indirectly impacting a step of the process. Tree blights are diseases or infestations that can damage or kill parts of a tree, which could impact the availability and quality of nesting materials for birds. While the direct steps of nest building (collecting twigs, making the base and sides, and adding soft materials) may not be directly impacted, the indirect consequences of a tree blight could be significant. 1. Reduced availability of nesting materials: As tree blights kill branches and leaves, there may be fewer twigs and other refuse available for birds to collect, making it more challenging for them to find suitable materials for their nests. 2. Reduced structural stability: If tree blights weaken the branches or trunk of a tree, it may be less sturdy and secure for birds to build their nests on, potentially leading to nest collapse or increased vulnerability to wind and other environmental factors. 3. Diminished food resources: If a tree blight affects the overall health of the tree or surrounding trees, it may also negatively impact the food resources available for birds, such as insects or fruits. This could make it harder for them to find enough food to support nesting activities and raise their offspring. 4. Loss of habitat: If tree blights become severe or widespread, they may lead to the loss of trees in an area, which would result in a loss of suitable nesting sites for birds. Although tree blights do not directly impact a specific step of the nest-building process, their indirect effects on the availability and quality of nesting materials and viable nesting sites could make it more challenging for birds to create smaller nests that are stable and secure."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: Information: - The Cabinet of Ministers of Venezuela ( Spanish : Gabinete de Ministros de Venezuela is one of the bodies that make up the Venezuelan executive in that country 's presidential system , alongside the Council of Ministers ( Spanish : Consejo de Ministros ) . The Cabinet is headed by the President of Venezuela , presently Nicolás Maduro , and his corresponding Vice President . The purpose of the ministries is to create , adopt , follow and evaluate policies , strategies , programs and projects in accordance with the constitution and the laws of the Republic . - A commander-in-chief is the person or body that exercises supreme operational command and control of a nation's military forces or significant elements of those forces. In the latter case, the force element is those forces within a particular region, or associated by function. As a practical term; it refers to military competencies that reside in a nation-state's executive leadershipeither a head of state, a head of government, a minister of defence, a national cabinet, or some other collegial body. Often, a given country's commander-in-chief (if held by an official) need not be or have been a commissioned officer or even a veteran. This follows the principle of civilian control of the military. - Executive Vice President of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (commonly known simply as the Vice President of Venezuela, is the second highest political position in the government of Venezuela. The Vice President is the direct collaborator of the President of the Republic according to the Constitution. The office of Vice President appeared in the Constitution of 1830 until the Constitution of 1858, and once again in the Constitution of 1999. - A politician (from \\"politics\\" + \\"-ian\\", from the Greek title of Aristotle's book \\"Politika\\", meaning \\"Civic Affairs\\") is a person active in party politics, or a person holding or seeking office in government. In democratic countries, politicians seek elective positions within a government through elections or, at times, temporary appointment to replace politicians who have died, resigned or have been otherwise removed from office. In non-democratic countries, they employ other means of reaching power through appointment, bribery, revolutions and intrigues. Some politicians are experienced in the art or science of government. Politicians propose, support and create laws or policies that govern the land and, by extension, its people. Broadly speaking, a \\"politician\\" can be anyone who seeks to achieve political power in any bureaucratic institution. - Venezuela, officially the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, is a federal republic located on the northern coast of South America. It is bordered by Colombia on the west, Brazil on the south, Guyana on the east, and the islands of Trinidad and Tobago to the north-east. Venezuela's territory covers around with an estimated population . Venezuela is considered a state with extremely high biodiversity (currently ranks 7th in the world's list of nations with the most number of species), with habitats ranging from the Andes Mountains in the west to the Amazon Basin rain-forest in the south, via extensive \\"llanos\\" plains and Caribbean coast in the center and the Orinoco River Delta in the east. - A head of state (or chief of state) is the public persona that officially represents the national unity and legitimacy of a sovereign state. In developing the current Constitution of France (1958), former French president Charles de Gaulle said the head of state should embody \\"the spirit of the nation\\" (\\"\\"). In some countries, typically those with parliamentary governments, the head of state is a ceremonial figurehead that does not actually guide day-to-day government activities and may not even be empowered to exercise any kind of political authority (e.g., Queen Elizabeth II in the United Kingdom). In other countries, the head of state is also the head of government, such as in the U.S., where the president is both a public figurehead and the actual highest ranking political leader who, in practice, oversees the executive branch. - Hugo Rafael Chávez Frías (28 July 1954 5 March 2013) was a Venezuelan politician who served as the 64th President of Venezuela from 1999 to 2013. He was also leader of the Fifth Republic Movement from its foundation in 1997 until 2007, when it merged with several other parties to form the United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV), which he led until 2012. - Impeachment is the process by which a legislative body formally levels charges against a high official of Government. Impeachment does not necessarily mean removal from office; it is only a formal statement of charges, akin to an indictment in criminal law, and is thus only the first step towards removal. Once an individual is impeached, he or she must then face the possibility of conviction via legislative vote, which then entails the removal of the individual from office. - A legislature is a deliberative assembly with the authority to make laws for a political entity such as a country or city. Legislatures form important parts of most governments; in the separation of powers model, they are often contrasted with the executive and judicial branches of government. - A presidential system is a system of government where a head of government is also head of state and leads an executive branch that is separate from the legislative branch. The United States, for instance, has a presidential system. The executive is elected and often titled \\"president\\" and is not responsible to the legislature and which cannot, in normal circumstances, dismiss it. The legislature may have the right, in extreme cases, to dismiss the executive, often through impeachment. However, such dismissals are seen as so rare as not to contradict a central tenet of presidentialism, that in \\"normal circumstances using normal means\\" the legislature cannot dismiss the executive. - The President of Venezuela, officially known as the President of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela and also commonly called President of the Republic is the elected head of state and head of government in Venezuela's presidential system. The president leads the National Executive of the Venezuelan government and is the commander-in-chief of the National Bolivarian Armed Forces. Presidential terms were set at six years in with the adoption of the 1999 constitution, and re-election has been unlimited since 2009. - Nicolás Maduro Moros (born 23 November 1962), more commonly known as Nicolás Maduro, is a Venezuelan politician who has been the 65th President of Venezuela since 2013. Previously he served under President Hugo Chávez as Minister of Foreign Affairs from 2006 to 2013 and as Vice President of Venezuela from 2012 to 2013. - Head of government is a generic term used for either the highest or second highest official in the executive branch of a sovereign state, a federated state, or a self-governing colony, (commonly referred to as countries, nations or nation-states) who often presides over a cabinet, a group of ministers or secretaries who lead executive departments. The term \\"head of government\\" is often differentiated from the term \\"head of state\\", (e.g. as in article 7 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, article 1 of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Crimes against Internationally Protected Persons, including Diplomatic Agents and the United Nations protocol list), as they may be separate positions, individuals, and/or roles depending on the country.

Allison expresses that Silvia is fortunate to be marrying Jason, implying that Jason is a desirable partner. Onin appears surprised at the news, and asks Allison about her own feelings regarding relationships or marriage. Allison dismisses the query, saying she's not interested in such things yet. Onin suggests that maybe she should consider it, possibly hinting that she should also think about relationships or settling down. Then, they both moved on to discussing the dress code for the upcoming function. Onin casually mentions that he has already ordered his suit. This causes some mild reproof from Allison for not informing her. Onin lightheartedly offers to have a dress made for Allison by his tailor, to which Allison responds positively.

Question: Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: A centuries long war between humans and vampires has devastated the planet's surface and led to a theocracy under an organization called The Church. They constructed giant walled cities to protect mankind and developed a group of elite warriors, the Priests, to turn the tide against the vampires. The majority of the vampires were killed, while the remainder were placed in reservations. With the war over, the Clergy disbanded the Priests. Outside the walled cities, some humans seek out a living, free from the totalitarian control of the Church. Priest is approached by Hicks, the sheriff of Augustine, a free town. Priest learns that his brother and his wife, Shannon - Priest's girlfriend before he entered the priesthood - were mortally wounded in a vampire attack, and Priest's niece, Lucy, was kidnapped. Hicks asks for Priest's help in rescuing Lucy. Priest asks the Clergy to reinstate his authority, but Church leader Monsignor Orelas (Christopher Plummer) does not believe the vampire story and refuses. Priest defiantly leaves the city and Orelas sends three Priests and a Priestess to bring him back. Priest and Hicks arrive at Nightshade Reservation where humans called Familiars, people infected with a pathogen that makes them subservient to the vampires, live alongside a number of the surviving vampires. After a fierce battle, the pair discovers that most of the vampires have taken shelter in Sola Mira, a vampire hive where Priest lost several of his comrades during a major battle. Priestess joins them at Sola Mira, revealing a bond with Priest. The trio destroys a Hive Guardian vampire, then discover that the vampires have bred a new army and dug a tunnel out of the mountain towards a town called Jericho. The other three Priests have arrived at Jericho just as night falls and an armored train arrives, unleashing hundreds of vampires upon the population. The vampires are led by a powerful and mysterious human wearing a black hat. When the three Priests reject Black Hat's offer to join him, he kills them...

Write some highlights for the following article: The historic six-month agreement over Tehran's nuclear program may begin a new era of relations with Iran, but it will be a long road back for the country's most vital sector, oil. Iran produces about two and half million barrels a day -- far off its 4-million-barrel-per-day peak a decade ago. Output is hovering at a level last seen at the end of Iran's war with Iraq. With North Sea Brent crude averaging over 100 a barrel for a record three years running, the sanctions on energy alone are costing Tehran about 50 billion in lost annual revenue. Despite the deal breakthrough, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said most of the sanctions will stick as the world gauges the intentions of this relatively new administration in Tehran. \\"During the six month phase, the oil sanctions that will remain in place will continue to cause over 25 billion in lost revenues to Iran or over 4 billion a month,\\" he said. The message is clear: the pressure remains, but if all goes well, in a half year's time Iran can expect more in return for transparency. The last few years have been filled with uncertainty. Tensions around the Strait of Hormuz with the on-and-off threats by the previous government of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to block oil shipments in the Gulf have kept what strategists call a 10-15% risk premium on global energy prices. Iran sits on about 9% of the world's proven oil reserves, claiming a few years back that it has nearly 150 billion barrels and the world's largest gas field. But its top four customers --China, India, Japan and South Korea -- have all had to cut back their energy imports by a third or more in the past few years due to U.S. and European pressure. With every year that has passed, the screws have been tightened by Washington and the countries of the European Union. It was not only sanctions against oil, but also blocking Iran's ability to secure shipping insurance and to trade in U.S. dollars and euros. That economic isolation, many Middle East strategists I have spoken with suggest, is what brought Iran's new government to the negotiating table. In 2012, the Iranian rial plunged by up to 80%. Basic staples of life, poultry and bread skyrocketed in price and the economy went through a period of hyper-inflation. With rising import prices due to a plummeting currency, industrial Iran is no longer able to compete. There are reports that the state manufacturing sector had laid off up to 800,000 workers in 2012 and those who have kept their jobs saw their wages eroded by skyrocketing prices. Oil executives with experience in the country say this initial agreement would help lift a cloud of uncertainty over the oil market, but that President Hassan Rouhani and his cabinet have to establish much better contract terms if this honeymoon period lifts sanctions. The blunt-speaking Chief Executive of French energy group Total, Christophe de Margerie, told me at an energy conference in Abu Dhabi this month that Iran needs to try and create a better climate for investment if this weekend's breakthrough is sustained. \\"I can tell you with the experience we have from Iran it doesn't always bring as we say in French partie de plaisir ... a win-win.\\" Oil giant Saudi Arabia has expressed doubts about signing a deal with Tehran, which will introduce more challenges within OPEC. Iraq plans to double production by 2020 to six million barrels a day and with Iran wanting to rebuild exports, the Kingdom may have trim its own production to defend prices. It is still early days, but this country of nearly 80 million people has been described as potentially being the Germany of the Middle East with plenty of natural resources -- that is, if it can emerge from years of economic isolation.

Question: What is the name of the country estate owned by Lady St Edmund? Title: Candleshoe Movie plot: Con-artist Harry Bundage (McKern) believes that the lost treasure of pirate captain Joshua St. Edmund is hidden at Candleshoe, the large country estate of Lady St Edmund (Hayes). Having gained access to Captain St. Edmund's hidden will with the help of a corrupt former cleaning woman at Candleshoe, Harry recruits American Casey Brown (Foster)âan unwanted foster child and hooliganâinto the plot, employing her to pose as Lady St Edmund's granddaughter, the Honourable Margaret, 4th Marchioness of St Edmund, who was kidnapped at age four by her father and subsequently disappeared after her father's death. Casey is the right age to pass for Margaret and possesses several identifying scars that young Margaret was known to have. Casey agrees to go along with the con and discover further clues in exchange for a cut of the treasure. Lady St. Edmund, however, is living in genteel poverty, and Casey quickly learns that Candleshoe itself is constantly on the verge of being unable to pay its taxes. Priory (Niven), the estate's butler (who is forced to pose as various members of the household to conceal that all the other servants have been let go) manages to keep one step ahead of foreclosure by pawning the house's antiques, conducting tours of the estate, and selling produce at market. Four local orphans adopted by Lady St. Edmund assist Priory. Casey eventually becomes part of the family and decides to find the treasure for the benefit of Candleshoe, rather than for Harry. This nearly costs the girl her life when she is seriously injured trying to prevent Harry from stealing money from Lady St Edmund. Casey is taken to hospital unconscious with severe concussion and remains there for several days. Meanwhile, without the money Harry has stolen, Candleshoe is unable to pay its taxes and is within days of being repossessed.

These are all the questions I’ve been thinking (and googling, and youtubing) since beginning this Capturing Creativity studio* and I have found some answers or maybe I’ve just found more questions: Creativity is generally defined as the ability to make new things, or come up with new ideas, it’s an ability to think outside the box, to see unique solutions and employ them in inventive ways. In this sense creativity is not always utilised when being ‘creative’, as to be creative is simply defined as the ability to make or produce something. However I guess that depends on your definition of creative, how different, unique, special, once off, un-influenced does something have to be, to be classified as creative? This is where creativity get’s tricky. It’s all well and good to be like oh this is what creativity is, so it’s easy to investigate it, but what if you don’t define that as being creative, maybe that was just following a formula, a somewhat inspired formula, but maybe it is just a formula.

The following article contains an answer for the question: What are the full scientific names of the mangrove tree species that all have the same characteristics? , can you please find it? Three species of mangrove trees exist in the region: red (Rhizophora mangle), black (Avicennia germinans), and white (Laguncularia racemosa), although all are from different families. All have the same characteristics: they are tolerant of salt, brackish, and fresh water; they grow in oxygen-poor soil; and they can survive drastic water-level changes. Black and white mangroves excrete salt from under their leaves, and red mangroves filter the salinity of sea water. All species are integral to coastline protection during severe storms. Red mangroves, for example, have far-reaching roots that trap sediments. The trees not only stabilize coastlines, but add land as more sand and decaying vegetation is trapped in the root systems. All three mangroves also absorb the energy of waves and storm surges. The estuaries act as fisheries for fry and nurseries for crustaceans. Shrimp, oysters, crabs, whelks, cockles, and snails thrive in these waters, as do primordial horseshoe crabs (Limulus polyphemus). The region supports a 59 million-a-year Tortugas pink shrimp (Farfantepenaeus duorarum) industry, and a 22 million-a-year stone crab (Menippe mercenaria) industry. Between 80 and 90 percent of species that are harvested commercially in Florida are born or spend time in the shallow waters near the Everglades. Oysters and mangroves work in tandem to build up the coastline. The sand around the coastline has minute white particles of quartz and fine shells. When currents are right, oysters grow in colonies or beds, and deposit their shells, reinforcing the bed. Mangrove seeds, called propagules, are full embryos and float in water until they reach a favorable location and take root, often on oyster beds. They shed skin and litter, ensuring other trees will not compete for space and nutrients.Mangroves also serve as excellent rookeries for birds.

The Jones family had a history of chronic viral infections. Jenny got human papillomavirus, while her brother Josh got infected with the Epstein–Barr virus. They were both under treatment. Hint: Hepatitis viruses can develop into a chronic viral infection that leads to liver cancer. Infection by human T-lymphotropic virus can lead to tropical spastic paraparesis and adult T-cell leukaemia. Human papillomaviruses are an established cause of cancers of cervix, skin, anus, and penis. Within the Herpesviridae, Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus causes Kaposi's sarcoma and body-cavity lymphoma, and Epstein–Barr virus causes Burkitt's lymphoma, Hodgkin's lymphoma, B lymphoproliferative disorder, and nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Merkel cell polyomavirus closely related to SV40 and mouse polyomaviruses that have been used as animal models for cancer viruses for over 50 years.

Given the context: What will Casey want to do next?","completion":"Based on the context provided, it seems that Casey is beginning to feel overwhelmed and perhaps even irritated by the barrage of questions from Lee. As an individual in this situation, Casey might consider taking several steps to address the issue: 1. Set boundaries: Casey may want to set some boundaries with Lee regarding the number and nature of questions. Communicating openly about the situation, explaining the feeling of annoyance and suggesting only asking questions when necessary might be a good start. This would help create a more comfortable atmosphere and prevent further frustration. 2. Politely redirect the conversation: Another approach Casey might consider is gently steering the conversation in a different direction. By shifting the focus onto a new topic, Casey might be able to reduce the frequency of Lee's questions without causing any conflict. 3. Offer an alternative solution: If Lee's questions are related to a particular problem or subject, Casey could point Lee to some resources or people who are better equipped to answer such questions. This would not only help Lee in finding the information they are seeking, but also alleviate the pressure on Casey. 4. Ask for some space: In order to remain calm and composed, Casey might consider asking for some time alone. By politely requesting some personal space, Casey can regain their composure and gather their thoughts. This is particularly important if the situation between Casey and Lee is escalating. 5. Reflect on the cause of annoyance: Sometimes, the annoyance might be a result of other, unrelated stressors. Casey should take a moment to self-reflect and determine if their reaction to Lee's questions is solely due to the inquiries, or if it stems from something else. If the issue is unrelated to Lee's questions, it is important for Casey to address the underlying cause of their annoyance. 6. Express empathy and understanding: It's possible that Lee may not be aware of Casey's discomfort. Rather than getting angry or annoyed, Casey could try to approach the situation with empathy and understanding. They could consider sharing how they feel with Lee and work together to find a solution that works for both individuals. Ultimately, Casey's next step should be one that fosters open communication, mutual understanding, and ideally resolves the issue without leading to further conflict between both parties."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. One week ago, the chief of Pakistan's Army Staff, Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, told graduating cadets in the city of Abbottabad that the \\"back of terrorism\\" in Pakistan had been broken, thanks to the sacrifices of Pakistan's soldiers. Kayani was speaking at the \\"passing out parade\\" at the prestigious Kakul military academy in Abbottabad, the West Point of Pakistan. At that very moment, the man who had dragged Pakistan into the \\"War on Terror\\" a decade earlier was, it transpires, just a mile or two away, living in apparent comfort behind the high walls of a very private compound. Osama bin Laden, who had declared war on Pakistan, had apparently been living for months in a city that had made its name as a military garrison. Abbottabad, pronounced AHB-tah-bahd, is some 60 miles by winding mountainous roads north of Pakistan's capital. Surrounded by green hills, it is renowned for its trees and parks. It's a popular retirement place for officers in the Pakistani army, partly because of its military academy, but also because of its agreeable climate. During British rule, the Imperial Gazeteer of India described it as \\"picturesquely situated,\\" 4,120 feet above sea level. Abbottabad sits on the Karakoram Highway, an engineering marvel that links Pakistan with China through the Himalayas. Before much of Pakistan became off-limits to most foreign tourists, it was also a popular spot for those on their way to and from the Swat valley and the foothills of the Himalayas. But despite its military traditions, its hockey fields and golf courses, Abbottabad and neighboring districts are also familiar territory to al Qaeda and other extremist groups. In January this year, Pakistani security forces stormed a modest house in the city and seized Umar Patek, an Indonesian linked to al Qaeda who had a 1 million bounty on his head under the FBI's Rewards for Justice program. He had allegedly helped build the bombs used in the 2002 bombings in Bali that killed 200 people. Patek -- a key leader in the Indonesian terrorist group Jemaah Islamiya -- had rented a room in the house of a retired accountant in Abbottabad after arriving in Pakistan some months earlier on a forged visa. He is now being held (after treatment for gunshot wounds sustained during his arrest) pending a decision on his extradition. Patek's arrest followed that of a Pakistani in Abbottabad called Tahir Shehzad, an alleged al Qaeda facilitator who had been under surveillance for some time, according to Pakistani media reports. Shehzad had allegedly gone to Lahore to meet two French militants who were planning to travel to North Waziristan with Patek. So Abbottabad emerges as something of a way station for al Qaeda and associated groups. Geographically, that makes sense. As the crow flies, the city is just over 100 miles from the border with Kunar province in Afghanistan, an area where al Qaeda has kept a foothold since 9/11. Even with poor roads and mountainous terrain in between, the journey can be completed in a day. It is even closer to the restive tribal territories. In the past two years, the Pakistani army in this area has been preoccupied with reversing the gains of the Pakistani Taliban, rather than chasing down the remnants of al Qaeda or launching the offensive against militants in North Waziristan that Washington has long demanded. The area to the north of Abbottabad saw a surge in Taliban activity two years ago, as the Taliban sought to extend their influence from the tribal areas that border Afghanistan into what was North West Frontier Province, now called Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The town of Buner, just 30 miles from Abbottabad and 60 miles from Islamabad, fell to the Taliban early in 2009. They also established a training camp close to the town of Mansehr, a few miles from Abbottabad. The Pakistani military has since gradually reasserted control over the area, expelling the Taliban from the Swat Valley, but at a bloody cost. Clashes continue sporadically in the area, and an attack on the offices of the charity World Vision last year in Mansehr resulted in six of the non-governmental organization's workers being shot dead. To the east of Abbottabad is Pakistani Kashmir, its forested hills hosting training camps for several groups committed to \\"liberating\\" Indian Kashmir. So it is a city close to the front lines of several of South Asia's insurgencies and terror campaigns. Like much of the region, Abbottabad has long been a theater of sectarian and religious rivalry. Back in the mid-19th century a British officer named Maj. James Abbott brought peace to an area that saw violent confrontations between its Sikh and Muslim populations. Abbott's contribution was recognized when the town was named after him. He even wrote a poem about the place that would bear his name:. \\"I remember the day when I first came here.

Location: The sentence is about Agra Airport, which signifies that it is an airport located in the city of Agra. Agra is a city in the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, known for its historical sites and monuments, such as the Taj Mahal. 2. Elevation: The sentence provides information about the airport's elevation, which is measured 167.94 meters above sea level. Elevation is significant for airports because it affects aircraft performance, runway length requirements, and air traffic control procedures. 3. Unit of Measurement: The elevation data is expressed in meters, which indicates that the metric system is being used to represent this measurement. Meters are the standard unit of length in the International System of Units (SI). 4. Specificity: The elevation measurement is given in two decimal points (167.94 meters), which demonstrates a certain degree of precision and accuracy in the data provided. This level of detail is often essential for various calculations and planning processes in aviation. 5. Datum Reference: The elevation is measured \\"above sea level.\\" This reference implies that the elevation is based on a common global datum, possibly the World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS84) or another standard convention. Using a consistent datum for elevation measurements allows for better comparison and compatibility between different airports and geographic locations. From this one sentence, we can gather specific information about Agra Airport's elevation and its relation to sea level. Moreover, we can infer that this information may be relevant to aviation professionals, such as pilots, air traffic controllers, and airport planners, who rely on accurate and standardized data for safe and efficient operations. Additionally, knowing the elevation of an airport can also help travelers prepare for changes in climate and weather conditions they may experience upon arrival or departure."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: Background: Generally, nearsightedness first occurs in school-age children. There is some evidence that myopia is inherited. If one or both of your parents need glasses, there is an increased chance that you will too. Individuals who spend a lot of time reading, working or playing at a computer, or doing other close visual work may also be more likely to develop nearsightedness. Because the eye continues to grow during childhood, myopia typically progresses until about age 20. However, nearsightedness may also develop in adults due to visual stress or health conditions such as diabetes. A common sign of nearsightedness is difficulty seeing distant objects like a movie screen or the TV, or the whiteboard or chalkboard in school. Paragraph: Two coworkers are sitting in the large break room eating lunch and watching the news on TV when they see an advertisement for glasses. John, upon seeing the ad, comments that he really should go and get a new pair since he is nearsighted and hasn't gotten a new pair of glasses in a couple years. Rick says he is glad that he doesn't need to wear glasses because it seems like such a pain to have to always have something on your face. John nods in agreement and then both men turn to see a woman at the other side of the break room waving at them and trying to get their attention. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Who is more likely a diabetic?

Article: On the first day of school I brought my camera to school. I gave the students a piece of 8 x11 cardboard , and asked them to write their names on both sides. As they finished, I asked them to get into groups of three to four students and took photographs of them holding their name cards. After school, I developed the film and printed two sets of photos. That evening, I started to match the names with the faces. I kept one set of pictures at home for about a week so that I could review their names each night. On the second day of school, I put up the other set of photos as a bulletin board , with a title such as \\"Presenting Room 108, ...\\" The kids loved it! After I had learned all of their names I brought the second set back to school and stuck them onto an 8 x11 sheet of paper. I placed it in the classroom for other teachers. The cardboard name cards that were made on the first day were collected and put on a shelf. From time to time, they were given back to the students and placed on their desks so that guests or supply teachers could identify all of the students.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize: However, in many ways, the groundwork is there - knowledge, ingenuity, willingness to learn and adapt, coupled with the rapid expansion of digital technology. All of this is really allowing Africa to play a major part in global scientific collaborations. Holding development back, higher education remains poor. Many non-governmental organisations (NGOs), churches and development agencies push basic literacy - it is a huge international industry. But there is nothing at the higher end, very little money for tertiary education. It is quite hard to study in Africa, and encouraging talented students to leave is an industry in itself, with a large variety of academic bursaries available for study in the US and Europe. If the limited available statistics are to be believed, there are perhaps fewer than five million students in higher education in the whole of sub-Saharan Africa - and most of those, perhaps two-thirds, are in South Africa, the wealthiest country. It is a low base to start from, but the tide is turning. Real, serious scientific work is taking place now in sub-Saharan Africa, especially in maths, physics and astronomy. Prof Justin Jonas, from the Square Kilometre Array (SKA), a collaborative international radio telescope project involving eight sub-Saharan African nations, as well as countries worldwide, says: \\"Africa has reached a stage of development where it has become a destination for doing world-class science - a place that has individuals, facilities and institutions that attract scientists from around the world to work on the continent. What if we could stay young forever? What if everyone had a car? What If? is a season across BBC News looking at visions of the future. What If (special report) \\"It has also become an attractive proposition for Africans to remain on home soil, rather than seek research opportunities abroad. \\"As an example, the SKA project has resulted in a net brain gain to the region, with leading astronomers, ranging from post-doc[toral]s to research professors, choosing to work in Africa.\\" Similar sentiments are expressed by Prof Tejinder Virdee, a former director of the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment, which has been at the forefront of the search for the Higgs boson at Europe's premier particle physics lab, Cern. Prof Virdee sees huge potential in sub-Saharan Africa for developing institutions to join in with global collaborative projects such as those pursued at Cern. He says the search for the Higgs particle involved number-crunching on a grand scale, and that the data could have been processed anywhere with the right tools - so why not in Africa? And from the African Institute of Mathematical Sciences (AIMS), itself an institute with strong links to the global physics community, there is the Next Einstein Initiative. This is currently setting up centres of excellence in Africa for the mathematical sciences, and is connected to some of the most forward-thinking academics in the fields of maths and physics across the continent, as well as in Canada, the UK and the US. Next Einstein Initiative executive director Thierry Zomahoun says: \\"So far, we have set up institutes in Senegal and Ghana, with more planned in Cameroon, Tanzania and Benin.. \\"And the idea is literally to create an environment in which an African Einstein could develop.\\" Perhaps the areas where Africa's scientific contributions are most striking is in our understanding of Malaria and HIV. Tune in to the BBC World Service at 1900 GMT on Friday 29 March to listen to the BBC Africa Debate - Should Africa take control of its science? - broadcast from Kampala. Or take part in Twitter - using #bbcafricadebate - Facebook or Google+ Africa Debate The Aids epidemic has ravaged major parts of the continent, but it was research led from Africa that made the connection in the 1980s between Aids, then prevalent among homosexual men in the US, and \\"slim disease\\" in Africa. HIV was the cause of both. Since then, Africa has seen some of the most important work in combating HIV - from demonstrating and tackling mother-to-child transmission, to research among people who appear to have immunity to the disease. \\"Africa-based research has clearly contributed to the fact that in many countries there are now fewer deaths from Aids and fewer new HIV infections,\\" said Peter Piot, the former director of UNAids. The potential for Africa to play a big role in global science is there, but questions remain over research funding and the appropriateness of research led by foreign donors. African solutions Last year, the African Union set up a science and technology advisory panel to develop a more Africa-centred research and development environment. Its co-chair, Harvard's professor of the Practice of International Development Calestous Juma, says: \\"As a latecomer, Africa is entering the field of global science facing major challenges but also opportunities. \\"It can build on the vast quantities of scientific and technical knowledge available worldwide to solve local problems in fields such as agriculture, water, health, education and environment. \\"The strategic focus for Africa should therefore be on generating research that has immediate local use. It is through such strategies that Africa will be able to make its own unique contributions to the global scientific enterprise. \\"Achieving this goal will require a focus on building a new generation of research universities that are focused on problem-solving and have direct links with enterprises and local communities. \\"While the focus in industrialised countries is 'science and technology', Africa's challenges call for 'technology and science'.\\" Certainly, the will is there. The key issue is how significant a part ideas from Africa will play within the future of global scientific research. On this, Justin Jonas is optimistic. \\"The MeerKAT radio telescope, designed and being built by South Africa as an SKA precursor, will be the most powerful instrument in its class until the construction of the SKA,\\" he says. \\"Initiatives such as the SKA and MeerKAT change the image that the world has of Africa, and perhaps more importantly, the image Africans have of their own continent.\\" Science Africa, a BBC science festival from Makerere University in Kampala, Uganda, runs from 24 March to 29 March. Much of the content will be broadcast on the BBC World Service. All the scientists featured in this article will be speaking at the festival. Your comments Africa is an exporter of talent. Every year thousands of the best and brightest students leave to study at universities in Europe and America. Every intelligent young African dreams of getting a scholarship to study abroad. The focus of governments and NGOs is very much on basic education yet if more research was done in Africa everyone would benefit. Research attracts talent and money and inspires students at all levels. Africa shouldn't just focus on local problems but needs to aspire to be at the core of global science to stop the brain drain and make the best of its talent. Projects like the square kilometre array discussed in this BBC news item are just a start. Dave Kidd, Woldia, Ethiopia Africa has been the birthplace of many in the science field including many doctors who are treating patients in the west. If all these talented people could be encouraged to stay home and the African governments equipped them to practice and complete their research from Africa, then we could take control of our own science. In the end progress hinges on government policy that encourages scientific innovation and research. Ambrose Kibuuka, Entebbe, Uganda Yes, Africa should take control of its science. We have spent most of our time waiting and depending on the west to help develop Africa. This is demoralizing and has really gotten us nowhere. Why can't we as Africans accomplish this with our own volition? Leaders all over Africa need to rebuild our African pride and the faith of young Africans in their leaders, this is one way I think they could achieve this and gain a respectable place in the world as peers. KB, Milwaukee, USA Julian Siddle deserves much credit for writing this article. It articulates a vision that will appeal to the competence and ingenuity of many Africans. The priority to find \\"African solutions\\" would bolster and diversify national economies currently too dependent on low-wages and unhealthy jobs in mining and oil industries designed primarily to benefit foreign investors. Jens A. Jorgensen, Brabant Wallon, Belgium I completely agree with the idea that Africa will, in the not too distant future be a hub for science development but also in other fields. We have tried here in Kampala to develop a new approach to higher education by giving professionals an opportunity to develop their skills and knowledge by studying at home or in the office. The Virtual University of Uganda, a project we started in 2011, has proved, after one year of operation, to be hugely successful. Being the first fully online institution of higher learning in sub-Saharan Africa, it has given us an opportunity to develop new methods of learning and teaching. Well done BBC for this inspiring piece and I am sure that the BBC science festival from Makerere University will be a success! Professor Michel Lejeune, Kampala, Uganda The science discussion is long overdue. Every culture can impact on science and technology, it is up to each community to take control of their destiny. We Africans have to take a second look at education. We must develop a culture that makes things, it is from there that we'll develop technical skills that will employ the population and power the economies. Joe Agu, Santa Clara, California, USA There are two ways for Africa to develop its scientific potential. First, by exploiting the advantages offered by innovation. Here because of escalating research and development costs as well as shrinking budgets there is a need for solutions and products that are simple, less costly for everyday use. Secondly, we can target \\"knowledge outsourcing\\" and build a niche in that area, by undertaking to put our knowledge in solving costly processes for which knowledge costs in western economies are simply too much to sustain. Allan Okoth, Nairobi, Kenya","completion":"The article talks about how Africa is making progress in the area of science and technology, but there is still a long way to go. African scientists are participating in many important research projects, but higher education in Africa is still not very good. Also, many smart African students go to other countries to study and work. To improve this, Africa needs to invest more money in education and research, and find solutions for their own problems.

See options at the end The man lost weight after he burned fat and lost some muscle, the Available choices: (A). muscle was heavier.. (B). fat was heavier..","completion":"To complete this task, I will analyze both sentences and consider which one makes the most sense given the context. Then, I will choose the most appropriate option as the correct answer. Option A: The man lost weight after he burned fat and lost some muscle, the muscle was heavier. Option B: The man lost weight after he burned fat and lost some muscle, the fat was heavier. Step 1: Evaluate the context The sentence is describing a man who has lost weight after burning fat and losing some muscle. Step 2: Analyze the options Option A suggests that the muscle was heavier, which could imply that the muscle mass lost had more impact on the weight loss than the burned fat. Option B suggests that the fat was heavier, which could imply that burning fat contributed more significantly to the weight loss than losing muscle. Step 3: Consider which option makes the most sense Weight loss commonly occurs when a person burns more calories than they consume. In general, burning fat is the primary goal in weight loss, although losing some muscle mass can unfortunately be a byproduct of certain weight-loss strategies. In most cases, losing fat contributes more to weight loss than losing muscle, because there's usually more fat mass to lose and because losing muscle mass is not typically desirable. Based on the context and analysis, it seems more reasonable to suggest that the fat had a greater impact on the weight loss. So, the most appropriate option to complete the sentence would be: Option B: The man lost weight after he burned fat and lost some muscle, the fat was heavier."},{"prompt":"Question: Austin had Taylor by the short hairs, and Austin had Taylor by the neck, ready to squeeze tighter.

Olivier Eugene Charles Prosper Messiaen (French: [olivje mesja]; December 10, 1908 - April 27, 1992) was a French composer, organist, and ornithologist, one of the major composers of the 20th century. His music is rhythmically complex; harmonically and melodically he employs a system he called modes of limited transposition, which he abstracted from the systems of material generated by his early compositions and improvisations. He wrote music for chamber ensembles and orchestra, vocal music, as well as for solo organ and piano, and also experimented with the use of novel electronic instruments developed in Europe during his lifetime. He travelled widely and wrote works inspired by diverse influences ranging from Japanese music, the landscape of Bryce Canyon in Utah and the life of St. Francis of Assisi. Messiaen's next work was the large-scale La Transfiguration de Notre Seigneur Jesus-Christ. The composition occupied him from 1965 to 1969 and the musicians employed include a 100-voice ten-part choir, seven solo instruments and large orchestra. Its fourteen movements are a meditation on the story of Christ's Transfiguration. Shortly after its completion, Messiaen received a commission from Alice Tully for a work to celebrate the U.S. bicentennial. He arranged a visit to the US in spring 1972, and was inspired by Bryce Canyon in Utah, where he observed the canyon's distinctive colours and birdsong. The twelve-movement orchestral piece Des canyons aux etoiles... was the result, first performed in 1974 in New York. In 1971, he was asked to compose a piece for the Paris Opera. While reluctant to undertake such a major project, he was persuaded in 1975 to accept the commission and began work on his Saint-Francois d'Assise. The composition was intensive (he also wrote his own libretto) and occupied him from 1975 to 1979; the orchestration was carried out from 1979 until 1983. Messiaen preferred to describe the final work as a \\"spectacle\\" rather than an opera. It was first performed in 1983. Some commentators at the time thought that the opera would be his valediction (at times Messiaen himself believed so), but he continued to compose. In 1984 he published a major collection of organ pieces, Livre du Saint Sacrement; other works include birdsong pieces for solo piano, and works for piano with orchestra. In the summer of 1978, Messiaen retired from teaching at the Conservatoire. He was promoted to the highest rank of the Legion d'honneur, the Grand-Croix, in 1987. An operation prevented his participation in the celebration of his 70th birthday in 1978, but in 1988 tributes for Messiaen's 80th included a complete performance in London's Royal Festival Hall of St. Francois, which the composer attended, and Erato's publication of a seventeen-CD collection of Messiaen's music including a disc of the composer in conversation with Claude Samuel. Although in considerable pain near the end of his life (requiring repeated surgery on his back) he was able to fulfil a commission from the New York Philharmonic Orchestra, Eclairs sur l'au-dela..., which was premiered six months after his death. He died in Paris on April 27, 1992. On going through his papers, Loriod discovered that, in the last months of his life, he had been composing a concerto for four musicians he felt particularly grateful to, namely herself, the cellist Mstislav Rostropovich, the oboist Heinz Holliger and the flautist Catherine Cantin (hence the title Concert a quatre). Four of the five intended movements were substantially complete; Yvonne Loriod undertook the orchestration of the second half of the first movement and of the whole of the fourth with advice from George Benjamin. It was premiered by the dedicatees in September 1994.

Sentence 2: I'd like to find out the truth, but can't say how I'd do it. If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","completion":"Understanding the meaning and intention behind each sentence is crucial in determining whether the two sentences are true or not, or if they are compatible. Let's analyze Sentence 1 first: \\"Can't say as how I'd like to find out the truth.\\" In this sentence, the speaker is expressing uncertainty about wanting to discover the truth. They may have doubts, fears, or concerns about what would happen if they were to learn the truth. As a result, they are unable to commit to the idea of seeking out the truth. Now, let's analyze Sentence 2: \\"I'd like to find out the truth, but can't say how I'd do it.\\" In this sentence, the speaker is expressing a desire to find out the truth but is unsure about the process or method they should use to do so. The focus here is not on whether they want to learn the truth but rather on how to go about it. Essentially, the speaker has a goal in mind but is uncertain about the steps to achieve it. Now, let's examine the compatibility and truthfulness of these two sentences. In Sentence 1, the speaker is expressing hesitation about wanting to find out the truth. In Sentence 2, the speaker expresses a desire to learn the truth but is unsure about the method. The two sentences seem to be addressing different aspects of the general idea of discovering the truth. While Sentence 1 is concerned about the uncertainty of seeking the truth itself, Sentence 2 is focused on the uncertainty of the means to accomplish this goal. If Sentence 1 is considered to be true, i.e., the speaker is genuinely uncertain about wanting to find the truth, then it becomes difficult to determine the truthfulness of Sentence 2. Since the speaker of Sentence 1 is unsure about even wanting the truth, the desire expressed in Sentence 2 appears to conflict with this uncertainty. However, one could argue that these two sentences reflect different moments in the thought process of the speaker. For instance, suppose the speaker initially displays their uncertainty about seeking the truth in Sentence 1. In that case, they might have further developed their thoughts and realized that, while they might want to learn the truth, they are uncertain about the method or process to accomplish it, which is captured in Sentence 2. In this light, both sentences can be seen as context-dependent expressions of the speaker's thoughts and feelings. While it might be challenging to say that both sentences are true simultaneously, given their apparent contradictions, it is possible that each sentence could be true at different points in the speaker's thought process. So, without a clearer indication of the context or chronology of the sentences, it is not possible to definitively determine if Sentence 2 is true if Sentence 1 is true."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. when is a galvanometer said to be sensitive??","completion":"A galvanometer is an electromechanical instrument used to detect and measure small electric currents. It is an essential component in various scientific and technical applications like physics laboratories, electronics, telecommunication, and engineering. Sensitivity is a crucial characteristic of a galvanometer that determines its ability to measure small currents accurately. A galvanometer is said to be sensitive when it can detect and respond to very small changes in the electric current. The sensitivity of a galvanometer depends on several factors, and improving these factors increases the sensitivity of the instrument. Here are some of the main factors that contribute to the sensitivity of a galvanometer: 1. Coil Area: The coil area is an essential factor in determining the sensitivity of a galvanometer. A larger coil area increases the magnetic torque acting on the coil, which in turn enhances the instrument's sensitivity. Therefore, sensitive galvanometers typically have larger coil areas to allow for more accurate detection and measurement of small currents. 2. Number of Turns: Increasing the number of turns in the coil results in a more significant magnetic torque, improving the sensitivity of the galvanometer. A highly sensitive galvanometer will have a higher number of turns in its coil to produce a larger response for the same amount of current as compared to a less sensitive one. 3. Strength of the Magnetic Field: The sensitivity of a galvanometer is directly proportional to the magnetic field strength in its core. Stronger magnetic fields generate larger magnetic torque on the coil and result in a more sensitive response. Therefore, a sensitive galvanometer will often have stronger magnetic fields to enhance its sensitivity. 4. Suspension System: The suspension system plays a crucial role in the sensitivity of a galvanometer. A good suspension system reduces friction and other external interferences, allowing the galvanometer to respond to smaller changes in current. Sensitive galvanometers often have low-resistance suspension systems, such as torsion wires or fiber suspensions, to ensure maximum sensitivity. 5. Damping System: The damping system is responsible for handling oscillations and vibrations that may interfere with galvanometer sensitivity. A highly sensitive galvanometer will have an efficient damping system, such as air or eddy current damping systems, to minimize any external disturbances and stabilize the reading quickly. 6. Scale and Pointer: The scale and pointer of a galvanometer should be able to accurately represent small changes in the measured current. Sensitive galvanometers generally have finely-divided scales and lightweight pointers to enable precise readings with minimal errors. 7. Quality of Materials: The materials used in constructing a galvanometer, such as the coil wire, magnetic core, suspension, and damping system, directly impact its sensitivity. High-quality materials result in better performance and higher sensitivity. In summary, a galvanometer is said to be sensitive when it can accurately detect and measure small electric currents. This sensitivity is influenced by many factors, such as the coil area, number of turns, strength of the magnetic field, suspension system, damping system, scale, pointer, and quality of materials. A highly sensitive galvanometer will have a combination of these favorable factors to ensure precise and accurate measurements, making it ideal for use in various scientific and technical applications."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He has been working at a place called NBC for 20 years. NBC is a big television company that broadcasts many shows that people watch every day. In 2005, Steve became the president of that company. That's a very important job. Now, Steve has decided it's time to say goodbye and leave NBC. He is resigning, which means he is stepping down from his important job.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What month and year were the surviving crew members of the brigantine formerly used as a whaler rescued? ? The last voyage of the Karluk, flagship of the Canadian Arctic Expedition of 1913–16, ended with the loss of the ship in the Arctic seas, and the subsequent deaths of nearly half her complement of 25. In August 1913, Karluk, a brigantine formerly used as a whaler, became trapped in the ice while sailing to a rendezvous point at Herschel Island. After a long drift across the Beaufort and Chukchi seas, in January 1914 the ship was crushed and sunk. In the ensuing months, the crew and expedition staff struggled to survive, first on the ice and later on the shores of Wrangel Island. In all, eleven men died before rescue. The Canadian Arctic Expedition was organised under the leadership of Canadian anthropologist Vilhjalmur Stefansson, and had both scientific and geographic purposes. Shortly after Karluk was trapped, Stefansson and a small party left the ship, stating that they intended to hunt for caribou. However, the ice carried Karluk westwards, far from the hunting party who found it impossible to return to the ship. Stefansson reached land and then devoted himself to the expedition's scientific objectives, leaving the crew and staff on board the ship under the charge of its captain, Robert Bartlett. After the sinking, Bartlett organised a march across the ice to Wrangel Island, 80 miles (130 km) away. Conditions were difficult and dangerous; two four-man parties were lost before the island was reached. From the island, Bartlett and an Inuk companion set out across the frozen sea for the Siberian coast, in search of help. Assisted by local populations, the pair eventually reached Alaska, but sea ice conditions prevented any immediate rescue mission. On Wrangel Island, the stranded party survived by hunting game, but were short of food and troubled by internal dissent. Before their eventual rescue in September 1914, three more of the party had died, two of illness and one in violent circumstances; 14 were rescued. Historians have divided views on Stefansson's decision to leave the ship. Some of the...

What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? The easiest way you can act like you have a boyfriend online is by making posts about your relationship together. Publically compliment your boyfriend via your social media account, and keep your online social circle up to date about romantic nights you're not actually having. Don't go overboard with these posts, as they often tend to be annoying to other people, especially to those who are having trouble finding a relationship of their own. Whatever your reason for faking a relationship, do your best to make yourself feel the way you would if you were really with someone. Visualize the thoughts and feelings that normally distinguish being single from being in a relationship, and try to emulate the latter as best as you can. For example, being in a relationship may lead to you making cheerier posts online, rather than unhappy ones. Although people may be suspicious of a faked profile, a fake boyfriend will seem that much more real if you stage pictures in the real world. A picture as basic as two coffee cups on a table with an appropriate caption will make it seem like you're out doing things with someone special. Even if you won't have an actual boyfriend to photograph, the implication is often enough. A caption is a vital part of creating the illusion. Make it affectionate and romantic. For instance, if you have two coffee cups set up, you can say something like \\"Drinking my favourite coffee with my favourite guy.\\" There are virtual relationship services that will give you the experience of having a fake relationship for a monthly fee. Upon paying, you'll normally get custom-made voicemails, cutesy texts, and a believable backstory on how the two of you met in the first place. If you need a quick way to act like you have a boyfriend, delegating some of the creativity to professionals may be the very help you need. Summary:","completion":"The article suggests that to convincingly fake an online boyfriend, one can make occasional relationship-related posts, use staged photos with affectionate captions, and even utilize virtual relationship services that provide customized voicemails, texts, and a plausible backstory, while maintaining a balance to avoid annoying others or arousing suspicion."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.
