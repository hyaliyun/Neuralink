Article: (Reuters) - Hundreds of victims of the Oct. 1 mass shooting in Las Vegas filed five lawsuits on Monday in a California court against the operators of the hotel from which the gunman fired, the organizers of the country music festival he targeted and the killer’s estate. A hat rests on flowers in a makeshift memorial during a vigil marking the one-week anniversary of the October 1 mass shooting in Las Vegas, Nevada U.S. October 8, 2017. REUTERS/Las Vegas Sun/Steve Marcus The largest of the lawsuits was filed on behalf of 450 people who were either injured in or witnessed the shooting, while the other four were brought by families of people who were killed or severely injured. All five cases were filed in Los Angeles Superior Court. Muhammad Aziz, a Houston-based lawyer heading the lawsuits, said they were filed in California because nearly all the plaintiffs were from the state and had been treated there. He noted that Live Nation Entertainment Inc, the event organizer, was a California-based company. Stephen Paddock, 64, fired into the crowd gathered for the Route 91 Harvest Festival from a 32nd-floor hotel suite at the Mandalay Bay Hotel in Las Vegas on Oct. 1, killing 58 people and injuring hundreds more, the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history. Paddock also killed himself. The victims accused the hotel operator MGM Resorts International and its subsidiary Mandalay Corp, which owns the hotel, of failing to properly monitor Paddock’s activities, train staff members and employ adequate security measures. The festival goers also alleged Live Nation was negligent for failing to provide adequate exits and properly train staff for an emergency. Several lawsuits have previously been filed in the shooting, mostly in Nevada state court. One of those filed on Monday was brought by college student Paige Gasper, who brought the first lawsuit over the mass shooting. Gasper voluntarily dismissed the Nevada lawsuit on Friday. Live Nation and MGM did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The companies have previously declined to comment on lawsuits. Plaintiffs also sued the shooter’s estate for battery and assault. The reportedly wealthy shooter is thought to have had multimillion-dollar real estate investments across Texas and California. A court hearing about who will be appointed to administer Paddock’s estate is set for Dec. 7. Slide Fire Solutions, the maker of the so-called bump stock device Paddock used to achieve a near-automatic rate of fire, was named in previous lawsuits over the shooting, but not in any of the suits filed on Monday. Aziz said Slide Fire was not named because most of his clients supported the right to bear arms. “We want to focus on hotel and venue security, not turn this into a gun rights case,” he said. ||||| Hundreds Of Victims Of Las Vegas Shooting File Lawsuits Enlarge this image toggle caption Robyn Beck/AFP/Getty Images Robyn Beck/AFP/Getty Images Hundreds of victims of the Oct. 1 shooting in Las Vegas filed five lawsuits in Los Angeles Superior Court on Monday. The largest of the suits names 450 plaintiffs. Among those being sued are MGM Resorts International, owner of the Mandalay Bay resort; Live Nation, organizer of the country music festival at which 58 people were killed; and the estate of Stephen Paddock, the shooter. The victims claim negligence by both MGM and Live Nation. They accuse MGM of not having adequate security policies, not properly training staff, not properly surveilling the premises, and failing to respond quickly when security guard Jesus Campos was shot. The suit alleges that Paddock's VIP status as a high-stakes gambler gave him access to a service elevator at the Mandalay Bay, which he used to stockpile weapons and ammunition in the days before the shooting. In Live Nation's case, the plaintiffs say the company failed to provide enough exits or properly train employees \\"in case of a foreseeable event, such as a terrorist attack or other emergency.\\" The shooter's estate is being sued for assault, battery and intentional infliction of emotional distress. The attorney heading the lawsuits, Muhammad Aziz, told Reuters that the cases were filed in California because most of the plaintiffs are from that state and received treatment there. He also noted that Live Nation is based in the state. Last week, a different law firm filed 14 suits in Nevada court. In addition to MGM, Live Nation, and Paddock's estate, these suits also name the manufacturers of the bump stock devices found in Paddock's hotel suite. Attorneys for the plaintiffs argue that the shooting could have been stopped, and that the lawsuits are intended to prompt policy changes so it can't happen again. Similar to the California lawsuits, the suits filed in Nevada argue that MGM assisted Paddock in transporting his arsenal by giving him access to a service elevator not open to the public, and that the Mandalay Bay failed to adequately monitor the hotel premises, discover his weapons, have gunshot detection devices in hotel rooms, or have adequate procedures to handle an active shooter situation. The suit alleges that Live Nation failed to provide adequate exits or properly train staff to handle emergencies. \\"The evidence we've seen thus far clearly indicates that the defendants were culpable in contributing to the 58 victims who lost their lives and the thousands more still suffering from severe injuries that will take years to overcome, if ever,\\" said attorney Antonio Romanucci in a press release. He is also lead counsel in lawsuits related to the 2016 shooting at Orlando's Pulse nightclub. Live Nation told NPR that it does not typically comment on ongoing litigation. MGM wrote in a statement to NPR: \\"The incident that took place on October 1st was a terrible tragedy perpetrated by an evil man. These kinds of lawsuits are not unexpected and we intend to defend ourselves against them. That said, out of respect for the victims, we will give our response through the appropriate legal channels.\\" It won't be easy to prove the venues were negligent. \\"One can't blame the hotel for not predicting that this gunman would go up to their 32nd floor with an arsenal and break out the windows and start firing at people,\\" Tom Russell, a personal injury lawyer and law professor at the University of Denver told NPR's Kirk Siegler. He said venues can also be victims, in the form of lost business or other harms. As Kirk reported last month, victims sued the theater chain Cinemark after the 2012 Aurora, Colo., movie theater shooting. But the victims lost their suit, and were ordered to pay Cinemark's legal fees. A legal expert also said that lawsuits against the gun industry tend to be unsuccessful. \\"Laws like the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act passed as recently as 2005 broadly exempt the gun industry from any tort lawsuits when criminals use their products,\\" Kirk reported. \\"Meanwhile some victims, as in one motion already filed in Las Vegas, go after the gunman's assets. But even if they win, there's rarely enough money to go around.\\" C. Chad Pinkerton, an attorney in the California suits, told the Associated Press that the shooting could have been avoided if officials had implemented safety recommendations and followed the weapons policies they had. \\"We know in this day and age that evil does happen, and we have to protect against that,\\" he told the AP. \\"This was the largest venue security failure in U.S. history.\\" ||||| What is a summary?","completion":"Hundreds of victims of the October 1 mass shooting in Las Vegas filed five lawsuits in a California court against hotel operator MGM Resorts International, the organizers of the country music festival Live Nation Entertainment Inc., and the shooter's estate.

Answer the following question: Background: Fish mortality is a parameter used in fisheries population dynamics to account for the loss of fish in a fish stock through death. The mortality can be divided into two types: Natural mortality: the removal of fish from the stock due to causes not associated with fishing. Such causes can include disease, competition, cannibalism, old age, predation, pollution or any other natural factor that causes the death of fish. In fisheries models natural mortality is denoted by (M).[1] Fishing mortality: the removal of fish from the stock due to fishing activities using any fishing gear.[1] It is denoted by (F) in fisheries models. Paragraph: The fisherman had 2 choices: he could go to Silver Lake situated at a higher altitude and fish there; or he could go to Red lake, a few miles further down the road. Both lakes were natural, but Red Lake had a few pollution problems last year, and the oxygen levels in the water decreased, leading to many fish dying. Silver lake was still pristine, untouched by human activities such as pollution. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which lake is situated at a lower altitude? Answer:","completion":"Red Lake is situated at a lower altitude. The paragraph mentions that the fisherman had two choices: going to Silver Lake, which was situated at a higher altitude, or going to Red Lake, which is further down the road. By stating that Silver Lake is at a higher altitude, it implies that Red Lake is at a lower altitude in comparison. Additionally, the paragraph also discusses the pollution problems that Red Lake faced last year, which could be related to its position at a lower altitude as human activities and pollution might have more impact on lower-lying bodies of water. In contrast, Silver Lake is described as pristine and untouched by human activities such as pollution, possibly due to its higher altitude that might help protect it from some of the negative impacts of human presence."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

There are hundreds of colleges that are \\"test optional\\" which means students can choose not to release their test scores in the application process. Admission decisions at these colleges for students who do not submit their test scores are made based on other factors. A list of test optional colleges can be found atfairtest.org. It is important, however, to make sure that the college is the right fit academically regardless of the test optional policy. You also asked if your daughter should write about her disability and if this would hurt her chances of being admitted.

To that end, he collected two compounds, compound A and compound B. Compound A was a polar compound, but compound B was a nonpolar compound. He then conducted two tests, case A and case B. In case A, he changed the state of a polar compound from solid to liquid. And, in case B, he changed the state of a nonpolar compound from solid to liquid. and a hint : Changes of state from solid to liquid and from liquid to gas occur when matter gains energy. The energy allows individual molecules to separate and move apart from one another. It takes more energy to bring about these changes of state for polar molecules. Although hydrogen bonds are weak, they add to the energy needed for molecules to move apart from one another, so it takes higher temperatures for these changes of state to occur in polar compounds. This explains why polar compounds have relatively high melting and boiling points. The Table below compares melting and boiling points for some polar and nonpolar covalent compounds. Please answer this question : Which compound would have higher boiling point, compound A or compound B? Answer:","completion":"Compound A, the polar compound, would have a higher boiling point compared to compound B, the nonpolar compound. This is because polar compounds form weak hydrogen bonds between molecules, which require additional energy to break apart.

Answer the following question: Article: In the past, people who graduated from college felt proud of their academic achievements and confident that their degree would help them to find a good job. However, in the past four years the job market has changed greatly. This year's college graduates are facing one of the worst job markets. For example, Ryan Stewart, a graduate of San Jose State University, got a degree in religious studies, but he has not gotten any job offers. He points out that many people already working are getting laid off and don't have jobs, so it's even harder for new college graduates to find jobs. Four years ago, the future looked bright for his class of 2006. There were many high-tech(\\"dot com\\") job opportunities, graduates received many job offers, and they were able to get jobs with high salaries and benefits such as health insurance and paid vacations. However, \\"Times have changed. It's a new market,\\" according to an officer of the university. The officer says students who do find jobs started preparing two years ago. They worked during summer vacations, they have had several short-time jobs, and they majored in fields that are still paying well, such as accounting or nursing. Even teaching is not a secure profession now. Ryan Stewart wanted to be a teacher. But instead he will probably go back to school in order to become a college teacher. He thinks college teaching could be a good career even in a bad economy. In conclusion, these days a college degree does not automatically lead to a good job with a high salary. Some students can only hope that the value of their degree will increase in the future. Question: What did a college degree mean to people in the past? Yes or no, is the answer \\"It built up their confidence in the job market.\\"? Answer:","completion":"In the past, a college degree held significant meaning for graduates. It was a source of pride for their academic achievements and instilled a sense of confidence in their ability to secure a good job in the market. So yes, the answer is \\"It built up their confidence in the job market.\\" A college degree was often viewed as a ticket to a stable career with high-paying job opportunities, along with benefits such as health insurance and paid vacations. The job market was more favorable for graduates, with many high-tech and \\"dot com\\" companies offering numerous positions to new degree holders. Therefore, a college degree was seen as a valuable asset, paving the way to a successful professional life. However, as mentioned in the article, the job market has undergone significant changes in the past four years, with recent college graduates facing one of the worst job markets in recent times. This has led to a shift in the perception of a college degree and the confidence it once instilled in graduates. The current job market is much more competitive, and even those who have been working for years are facing layoffs and job losses, making it even harder for new college graduates to find suitable job opportunities. The article points out that students now have to start preparing for jobs several years ahead, by participating in internships and lining up part-time jobs during summer vacations. Additionally, it is increasingly important to choose majors that are still in high demand, such as accounting or nursing, to boost the chances of finding a well-paying job after graduation. Even traditionally secure professions like teaching are no longer guaranteed to offer stable career paths. In conclusion, while a college degree in the past provided graduates with a heightened level of confidence in the job market, the current state of the job landscape has made this less certain. A college degree does not automatically guarantee a high-paying job anymore, and students must now strategically plan their education and career choices to optimize the value of their degrees in the increasingly competitive job market."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write an article based on this summary: – All eyes have been on Reunion Island these past few days, but some of the action has now shifted to Paris following Saturday's arrival of a piece of debris believed to possibly be from MH370. USA Today reports that military aviation and legal experts will on Wednesday begin their inquiry; today, French and Malaysian investigators will meet with an investigating judge. While a determination of whether the part belonged to the missing plane appears days off, Reuters is digging into a possible clue-on-a-clue: If the debris does belong to the missing Malaysia Airlines flight, what appear to be goose or stalk barnacles affixed to it could reveal some of the plane's secrets. An analysis of their shells and their positioning on the debris could allow scientists to make determinations about the \\"temperature and chemical composition\\" of the water the barnacles traveled through and how the debris moved through it (ie, above water or submerged); from there, their source can be pinpointed—in a general way, at least. An Australia PhD student whose focus is the shell chemistry of barnacles suggests the best they could do is narrow the search area to, at the least, tens of kilometers. Still, \\"it's very powerful stuff,\\" William Newman, a professor at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, tells Bloomberg News: Indeed, barnacles have been used to study the movement patterns of whales and turtles, have given up shipwreck secrets, provided info on enemy ships in WWII, and have even factored into murder investigations. Newman says he once helped police examine barnacles found on a body bag and skull.

Now, people think they might have found a piece of it on Reunion Island. That's a small island really far off the east coast of Africa. But they're not sure if it's really from the missing plane, so they decided to take it all the way over to Paris to check it out. There, experts who know all about airplanes, and people who know all the rules about things like this, will start trying to find some answers on Wednesday. But before they do that, people from France and Malaysia who are really good at solving mysteries will meet with a person called an investigating judge. This is a person whose job is to make sure everything is done right in an investigation. Finding out whether this piece is really from the missing airplane might take a few days. But in the meantime, the investigators might have found a clue right on this big piece of debris. Do you know what barnacles are? They are little creatures, like small shells, that stick to things in the water! They found some barnacles that could be from a goose or stalk on the debris. Now, these barnacles might be able to help solve the mystery. By looking really closely at the shells and where they are located on the debris, scientists can find out interesting things like how warm the water was where the barnacles came from, or what kind of stuff was in the water. They can also figure out whether the debris was above the water or under it. This could help them guess where the debris and barnacles came from. Isn't that super clever? Someone who is studying these little barnacles for their big school project said that this could help them find the area where the plane is, which would make the search a lot easier. This could even make the search area tens of kilometers smaller. Which is a lot! A clever professor called William Newman, who works at a place where they learn about the ocean, says that this could be very, very helpful. Barnacles have helped scientists study how whales and turtles move, told us secrets of ships that sank a long time ago, and gave details about enemy ships in a big war a long time ago. They even helped solve some crimes! Professor Newman once helped the police look at barnacles that were found on a bag and a skull.

It is the last period of the Mesozoic Era. The Cretaceous Period is usually abbreviated K, for its German translation \\"Kreide\\" (chalk). - The froghoppers, or the superfamily Cercopoidea, are a group of Hemipteran insects, in the suborder Auchenorrhyncha. Adults are capable of jumping many times their height and length, giving the group their common name, but they are best known for their plant-sucking nymphs which encase themselves in froth in springtime. - Baissa is a lower Cretaceous locality in Siberia, on the left bank of the Vitim River. The Zaza Formation sediments exposed at Baissa are represented mostly by sandstones, siltstones, marls and bituminous shales. The total thickness if the section is about 80 m. Insect remains occur throughout the section, except for the most coarse-grained rocks. Their abundance and state of preservation vary from one bed to another. - The Paleogene (or ; also spelled Palaeogene or Palæogene; informally Lower Tertiary) is a geologic period and system that spans 43 million years from the end of the Cretaceous Period million years ago (Mya) to the beginning of the Neogene Period Mya. It is the beginning of the Cenozoic Era of the present Phanerozoic Eon. The Paleogene is most notable for being the time during which mammals diversified from relatively small, simple forms into a large group of diverse animals in the wake of the CretaceousPaleogene extinction event that ended the preceding Cretaceous Period. - The Jurassic (from Jura Mountains) is a geologic period and system that spans 56.3 million years from the end of the Triassic Period million years ago (Mya) to the beginning of the Cretaceous Period Mya. The Jurassic constitutes the middle period of the Mesozoic Era, also known as the Age of Reptiles. The start of the period is marked by the major TriassicJurassic extinction event. Two other extinction events occurred during the period: the Pliensbachian/Toarcian event in the Early Jurassic, and the Tithonian event at the end; however, neither event ranks among the \\"Big Five\\" mass extinctions. - Saurophthirus is an extinct genus of flea that represents a transition between primitive stem fleas , and modern species . The type species , S. longipes is found in early Cretaceous strata of Baissa , Siberia . The second species , S. exquisitus , is from the is from the Lower Cretaceous Yixian Formation . - Insects (from Latin ', a calque of Greek ['], \\"cut into sections\\") are a class of invertebrates within the arthropod phylum that have a chitinous exoskeleton, a three-part body (head, thorax and abdomen), three pairs of jointed legs, compound eyes and one pair of antennae. They are the most diverse group of animals on the planet, including more than a million described species and representing more than half of all known living organisms. The number of extant species is estimated at between six and ten million, and potentially represent over 90% of the differing animal life forms on Earth. Insects may be found in nearly all environments, although only a small number of species reside in the oceans, a habitat dominated by another arthropod group, crustaceans. - A larva (plural \\"larvae\\" ) is a distinct juvenile form many animals undergo before metamorphosis into adults. Animals with indirect development such as insects, amphibians, or cnidarians typically have a larval phase of their life cycle. - Birds (Aves), also known as avian dinosaurs, are a group of endothermic vertebrates, characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a lightweight but strong skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in size from the bee hummingbird to the ostrich. They rank as the class of tetrapods with the most living species, at approximately ten thousand, with more than half of these being passerines, sometimes known as perching birds or, less accurately, as songbirds. - Mammals are any vertebrates within the class Mammalia (from Latin \\"mamma\\" \\"breast\\"), a clade of endothermic amniotes distinguished from reptiles and birds by the possession of a neocortex (a region of the brain), hair, three middle ear bones and mammary glands. The sister group of mammals may be the extinct \\"Haldanodon.\\" The mammals represent the only living Synapsida, which together with the Sauropsida form the Amniota clade. The mammals consist of the Yinotheria including monotrema and the Theriiformes including the theria. - Warm-blooded animal species can maintain a body temperature higher than their environment. In particular, homeothermic species maintain a stable body temperature by regulating metabolic processes. The only known homeotherms are birds and mammals. Other species have various degrees of thermoregulation. - Fleas are small flightless insects that form the order Siphonaptera. They are external parasites of warm-blooded animals, living by hematophagy off the blood of mammals and birds. The adults are up to about long and usually brown. They are flattened sideways to enable them to move through their host's fur or feathers, and have strong claws to prevent themselves from being dislodged.

Question: what happens to the luthers Movie title: Superman IV: The Quest For Peace Movie plot: Superman saves a spaceship of cosmonauts whose ship was thrown off course by debris, then visits his home-town of Smallville as Clark. Now that his adoptive parents have died, Clark has inherited their now-unattended farm. In an empty barn, he uncovers the capsule that brought him to Earth, and removes a luminescent green Kryptonian energy module. A recording left by his mother Lara states that its power can be used only once. Unwilling to sell the farm to a mall developer, Superman returns to Metropolis, where he stops a runaway Subway Train after the conductor collapses at the Controls. After returning to the Daily Planet, Clark learns that the newspaper went bankrupt and has been taken over by David Warfield, a tabloid tycoon who fires Perry White and hires his own daughter Lacy as the new editor. Lacy takes a liking to Clark and tries to seduce him. Clark agrees to go on a date with her. Following the news that the United States and the Soviet Union may engage in nuclear war, Clark is conflicted about how much Superman should intervene. After receiving a letter from a concerned schoolboy, Superman travels to the Fortress of Solitude to seek advice from the spirits of his Kryptonian ancestors. They recommend that he let Earth solve its own problems, or seek new worlds where war has been outlawed. After asking for advice from Lois Lane, Superman attends a meeting of the United Nations, announcing to the assembly that he will rid the planet of nuclear weapons. Various nations fire their nuclear warheads into space, which are collected by Superman into a giant net and then thrown into the sun. Meanwhile, young Lenny Luthor breaks his uncle Lex Luthor out of prison. Returning to Metropolis, Lex and Lenny steal a strand of Superman's hair from a museum, and create a genetic matrix which Lex attaches to a U.S. nuclear missile.

Answer:","completion":"In the movie \\"Superman IV: The Quest for Peace,\\" Lex Luthor, the main antagonist, escapes from prison with the help of his nephew, Lenny Luthor. Lex steals a strand of Superman's hair from a museum and creates a genetic matrix, which he attaches to a U.S. nuclear missile. When the missile is launched as a test, Superman intercepts it and throws it into the sun. As a result, a glowing ball of energy is discharged and forms a superhuman being named Nuclear Man, whose sole purpose is to kill Superman. Nuclear Man and Superman engage in an epic battle, during which Nuclear Man unleashes destruction around the world. Superman lures him to the dark side of the moon, where Nuclear Man loses his powers due to the absence of sunlight. Superman takes advantage of this and traps Nuclear Man on the moon's surface. However, he escapes and kidnaps Lacy Warfield, who he views as his potential bride. Superman saves Lacy, and the battle resumes on Earth. In the final confrontation, Superman learns that Nuclear Man's powers weaken in the shadows and that he gains strength from the sun. Superman defeats Nuclear Man by foiling his solar energy absorption, causing him to wither and become powerless. Superman then flies him into a nuclear reactor, which ultimately destroys him. After the battle, Superman gives a speech at the United Nations, acknowledging that he cannot eliminate all the world's nuclear weapons. He urges the nations to find a peaceful resolution to their conflicts and disarm their nuclear arsenals on their own. In the movie's subplot, Clark Kent (Superman's alter ego) faces his own difficulties as the Daily Planet newspaper is taken over by tabloid tycoon David Warfield. Warfield fires Perry White and hires his daughter, Lacy, as the new editor. Throughout the movie, Lacy takes a liking to Clark, trying to seduce him and even going on a date with him. However, Clark's alter ego, Superman, is the main focus of the plot, and his personal life takes a back seat to his responsibility as a superhero. To summarize, \\"Superman IV: The Quest for Peace\\" is centered on Superman's mission to rid the world of nuclear weapons. Along the way, he faces challenges from Lex Luthor and the newly created adversary, Nuclear Man, who he ultimately defeats. Despite his efforts, Superman admits that he cannot single-handedly eliminate all nuclear threats and instead urges the world to take responsibility for disarming their weapons in the pursuit of peace."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Ever wonder why sometimes a hug is all you need ? You can't explain it , but there's just something comforting about being in your wife's arms after a rough day or giving mom a hug after a long time apart . A new study says the warm feeling in a hug is more than just skin deep . Researchers from the University of California , Berkeley believe that this loving feeling could have anti-aging benefits . Oxytocin , sometimes referred to as the \\" love hormone \\" or the \\" trust hormone , \\" is responsible for those indescribable feelings we get when we're bonding with a lover or a loved one . Levels of the hormone drop as we age , and evidence suggests that could be a contributing factor to the _ of our bodies as we age . Muscle loss in particular is one of the major side effects of aging , with our bodies losing up to 5 percent of our muscle mass each decade past our 30s . In the study , published in the journal Nature Communications , researchers injected oxytocin into older mice with muscle damage . The older mice had lower levels of the homeone than younger mice initially . But after nine days , the older mice who were given the hormone healed better than those who did not . In fact , their ability to repair muscle damage was up to 80 percent that of the younger mice . The results were not only fast-acting , but provide hope for future uses of the hormone in a variety of anti-aging capacities . \\" This is good because it demonstrates that extra oxytocin improves aged tissue stem cells without making muscle stem cells divide uncontrollably , \\" study co-author Wendy Cousins said in a statement . Previous uses of anti-aging molecules have also been associated with higher cancer risk , but researchers are hopeful that oxytocin can be useful in humans without this risk . In the future , researchers of Berkeley say oxytocin could be used to fight other age-related health issues by improving bone health and even being used as an alternative to hormone replacement therapy . Now go out and give someone a hug . Question: What can be learned from the research ? Options: A: All the older mice healed faster in the research .

Why do we feel thirsty after eating? Select from the following. i. no. ii. yes. The answer is:","completion":"The answer is i. no. Although these two questions may appear similar at first glance, they are not asking the same thing. Here is a detailed explanation of the differences: 1. \\"Why do we feel thirsty after eating biryani?\\" Biryani is a traditional South Asian mixed rice dish typically prepared using fragrant basmati rice, spices, meat, vegetables, and sometimes, eggs. This question is specifically concerned with why we tend to feel thirsty after consuming this particular dish. In this case, the main reasons people experience thirst after eating biryani include: a. High salt content: Biryani usually contains a considerable amount of salt, which enhances the flavor but also increases our body's sodium levels. As a result, our body needs to maintain fluid balance, and our brain triggers the thirst sensation to encourage us to drink water to replenish the lost body fluids and maintain a proper electrolyte balance. b. Spices: Biryani is known for its rich blend of spices, such as cumin, coriander, cinnamon, cardamom, and so on. These spices often have a warming effect on the body, and as a result, the body seeks to cool down by drinking fluids. Additionally, spices can sometimes cause slight irritation in the throat or mouth, which might prompt us to drink water to soothe the discomfort. c. Dehydration from cooking: Depending on the cooking process, some types of biryani might lose a significant amount of water content. If this is the case, consuming the dish could lead to a temporary feeling of water deprivation in the body, inducing thirst. 2. \\"Why do we feel thirsty after eating?\\" This second question is a more general inquiry about why we tend to feel thirsty after consuming a meal, regardless of the dish. There are several factors that can contribute to thirst after eating, such as: a. Salt intake: Similar to the biryani, many dishes contain a high amount of salt. As mentioned earlier, this can increase our body's sodium levels, resulting in the need to maintain fluid balance, and thus, prompting thirst. b. Spicy and hot foods: Consuming spicy and warm foods can induce the body's need to hydrate and cool down, which usually leads to thirst. c. Foods rich in protein or carbohydrates: The digestion of protein and carbohydrates requires more water, so consuming meals high in these nutrients can lead to thirst as the body demands more fluids to aid in the digestive process. d. General dehydration: Dehydration is a common cause of thirst. Sometimes, we may not be drinking enough water throughout the day, and our body will use mealtime to signal the need for additional fluids. In conclusion, while both of these questions address the issue of post-meal thirst, they differ in their scope and focus. The first question is centered on the specific dish of biryani, while the second question is a broader inquiry into the various reasons why we may experience thirst after eating in general."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Input: Paragraph: The surveillance and prevention of pathogenic microbiological contamination are the most important tasks of biosafety management in the lab. There is an urgent need to establish an effective and unbiased method to evaluate and monitor such contamination. This study aims to investigate the utility of next generation sequencing (NGS) method to detect possible contamination in the microbiology laboratory. Environmental samples were taken at multiple sites at the lab including the inner site of centrifuge rotor, the bench used for molecular biological tests, the benches of biosafety cabinets used for viral culture, clinical sample pre-treatment and nucleic acids extraction, by scrubbing the sites using sterile flocked swabs. The extracted total nucleic acids were used to construct the libraries for deep sequencing according to the protocol of Ion Torrent platform. At least 1G raw data was obtained for each sample. The reads of viruses and bacteria accounted for 0.01 ± 0.02%, and 77.76 ± 12.53% of total reads respectively. The viral sequences were likely to be derived from gene amplification products, the nucleic acids contaminated in fetal bovine serum. Reads from environmental microorganisms were also identified. Our results suggested that NGS method was capable of monitoring the nucleic acids contaminations from different sources in the lab, demonstrating its promising utility in monitoring and assessing the risk of potential laboratory contamination. The risk of contamination from reagents, remnant DNA and environment should be considered in data analysis and results interpretation.

A basketball coach who suffered a brain injury in a car crash that killed his fiancee just days before their wedding has shown 'miraculous' progress in hospital, family friends have said. John Redman, 25, was driving his bride-to-be, Brittany Huber, 23, from Dalton, Georgia to her hometown of Mobile, Alabama on April 28 when he lost control of his Lexus during a rainstorm. The car smashed into the median along Interstate 85 in Meriweather County Georgia, killing Huber on impact and leaving him with broken ribs and a head injury. Amid the tragedy of losing Huber, the families are overjoyed that Redman is showing progress by blinking, smiling and squeezing his hands. Hope: John Redman, who suffered a brain injury in the car crash that killed his wife-to-be Britanny Huber, left, has shown progress two weeks on by blinking, smiling and squeezing his hands. 'John had a miraculous day,' Derek Waugh, the director of athletics at Dalton State College, where Redman works, wrote on his CaringBridge page on Monday. 'He really did some amazing things with respect to cognitive function.' On Tuesday night he added: 'John has come so far in the last 2 days. A list of progress includes squeezing a mini-basketball, answering questions with multiple eye blinks, making movements on command, smiling at jokes and generally being \\"aware\\" of his surroundings and people.' 'These are amazing steps...He has a long road to healing ahead of him but what an amazing 2 days!!!!' Redman has been treated at Atlanta's Grady Memorial Hospital, but he is being moved to Sheperd Spinal Clinic, which specializes brain and spinal cord injuries. The. couple’s wedding was scheduled to take place in Huber’s hometown of. Mobile, Alabama, Saturday, and the pair were on their way there when the. fatal accident happened.

Wreckage: They were driving from Georgia to her hometown of Mobile, Alabama when Redman lost control of his car and smashed into the median, killing his fiancee on impact. Scene: He suffered a brain injury and broken bones in the crash, which occurred on May 28. According to officials, Redman was driving too fast, and the slick road conditions did not play a role in the crash. The church where the couple were due to marry on Saturday May 3 was instead the venue for her memorial service. Seven women wore matching mint green dresses - their bridesmaids dresses - to the service, AL.com's Tommy Hicks reported. Redman's.

A: As a result of the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922, which limited the construction of new heavy surface combat ships, most early aircraft carriers were conversions of ships that were laid down (or had served) as different ship types: cargo ships, cruisers, battlecruisers, or battleships. Does the answer correctly answer the question","completion":"A: Yes, the answer provided an overview of why ship conversions took place in the 1920s, but it is essential to discuss the specific types of aircraft carriers that arose from these conversions in 1927. In 1927, ship conversions mainly gave rise to two types of aircraft carriers: fleet carriers and light carriers. These were developed from existing battlecruisers, battleships, or other large vessels, with modifications made to accommodate aircraft launching and recovery capabilities. 1. Fleet Carriers: Fleet carriers were the largest and heaviest aircraft carriers of the time, possessing considerable aircraft storage, launch, and recovery capabilities. One prominent example of a fleet carrier conversion in the late 1920s was the United States' USS Lexington (CV-2) and USS Saratoga (CV-3), which were initially built as battlecruisers. Both were converted into aircraft carriers in response to limitations imposed by the Washington Naval Treaty. 2. Light Carriers: Light carriers were smaller in size compared to fleet carriers and typically had fewer aircraft storage and operational capabilities. However, they could maintain a faster pace in naval operations and had a broader range of strategic possibilities due to their higher speed and maneuverability. One example of a light carrier conversion during the 1920s was the Japanese carrier, Hosho, which was initially designed as a seaplane tender, but was converted into a light aircraft carrier by adding a full-length flight deck to her design. To summarize, the ship conversions in 1927 mainly gave rise to fleet carriers and light carriers, which were the result of adapting and retrofitting existing battlecruisers, battleships, or other large vessels in response to the limitations imposed by the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922. These converted aircraft carriers played a significant role in naval aviation and shaped the future of naval warfare."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

In this case, A = 'uTwuwS' and B = 'QJwuDV'. Let's create a table (DP matrix) for dynamic programming, where its columns correspond to characters of A and rows correspond to characters of B. 1. Initialize an empty table with dimensions (length of A + 1) x (length of B + 1). \`\`\`python A = 'uTwuwS' B = 'QJwuDV' dp = [[0] * (len(A) + 1) for _ in range(len(B) + 1)] \`\`\` 2.

Question: Information: - North America is a continent entirely within the Northern Hemisphere and almost all within the Western Hemisphere. It can also be considered a northern subcontinent of the Americas. It is bordered to the north by the Arctic Ocean, to the east by the Atlantic Ocean, to the west and south by the Pacific Ocean, and to the southeast by South America and the Caribbean Sea. - An explosive eruption is a volcanic term to describe a violent, explosive type of eruption. Mount St. Helens in 1980 was an example. Such eruptions result when sufficient gas has dissolved under pressure within a viscous magma such that expelled lava violently froths into volcanic ash when pressure is suddenly lowered at the vent. Sometimes a lava plug will block the conduit to the summit, and when this occurs, eruptions are more violent. Explosive eruptions can send rocks, dust, gas and pyroclastic material up to 20 km into the atmosphere at rate of up to 100,000 tonnes per second, traveling at several hundred meters per second. This cloud will then collapse, creating a pyroclastic flow of hot volcanic matter. - A federal republic is a federation of states with a republican form of government. At its core, the literal meaning of the word republic when used to reference a form of government means: \\"a country that is governed by elected representatives and by an elected leader (such as a president) rather than by a king or queen\\". - An effusive eruption is a type of volcanic eruption in which lava steadily flows out of a volcano onto the ground. Effusive eruption differs from explosive eruption, wherein magma is violently fragmented when expelled from a volcano. The shape of the lava flows created by effusive eruptions is governed by the type of lava, rate and duration of eruption, and slope of the surrounding areas. - Bristol Bay (\\"Iilgayaq\\" in Central Yup'ik) is the eastern-most arm of the Bering Sea, at 57° to 59° North 157° to 162° West in Southwest Alaska. Bristol Bay is 400 km (250 mi) long and 290 km, (180 mi) wide at its mouth. A number of rivers flow into the bay, including the Cinder, Egegik, Igushik, Kvichak, Meshik, Nushagak, Naknek, Togiak, and Ugashik. - The Alaska Peninsula is a peninsula extending about to the southwest from the mainland of Alaska and ending in the Aleutian Islands. The peninsula separates the Pacific Ocean from Bristol Bay, an arm of the Bering Sea. - A shield volcano is a type of volcano usually built almost entirely of fluid lava flows. They are named for their low profile, resembling a warrior's shield lying on the ground. This is caused by the highly fluid lava they erupt, which travels farther than lava erupted from stratovolcanoes. This results in the steady accumulation of broad sheets of lava, building up the shield volcano's distinctive form. The shape of shield volcanoes is due to the low viscosity of their mafic lava. - A caldera is a large cauldron-like depression that forms following the evacuation of a magma chamber/reservoir. When large volumes of magma are erupted over a short time period, structural support for the crust above the magma chamber is lost. The ground surface then collapses downward into the partially emptied magma chamber, leaving a massive depression at the surface (from one to dozens of kilometers in diameter). Although sometimes described as a crater, the feature is actually a type of sinkhole, as it is formed through subsidence and collapse rather than an explosion or impact. Only seven known caldera-forming collapses have occurred since the start of the 20th century, most recently at Bárðarbunga volcano in Iceland. - Andesite (or ) is an extrusive igneous, volcanic rock, of intermediate composition, with aphanitic to porphyritic texture. In a general sense, it is the intermediate type between basalt and dacite, and ranges from 57 to 63% silicon dioxide (SiO) as illustrated in TAS diagrams. The mineral assemblage is typically dominated by plagioclase plus pyroxene or hornblende. Magnetite, zircon, apatite, ilmenite, biotite, and garnet are common accessory minerals. Alkali feldspar may be present in minor amounts. The quartz-feldspar abundances in andesite and other volcanic rocks are illustrated in QAPF diagrams. - Mount Dutton is a stratovolcano in the Aleutian Range of the U.S. state of Alaska , on the Alaska Peninsula . - The Bering Strait (\\"Beringov proliv\\", Yupik: \\"Imakpik\\") is a strait of the Pacific, which borders with the Arctic to north. It is located between Russia and the United States. Named after Vitus Bering, a Danish-born explorer in the service of the Russian Empire, it lies slightly south of the Arctic Circle being at about 65° 40' N latitude. The present Russia-US east-west boundary is at 168° 58' 37\\" W. - Katmai National Park and Preserve is a United States National Park and Preserve in southern Alaska, notable for the Valley of Ten Thousand Smokes and for its Alaskan brown bears. The park and preserve covers , being roughly the size of Wales. Most of this is a designated wilderness area in the national park where all hunting is banned, including over of land. The park is named after Mount Katmai, its centerpiece stratovolcano. The park is located on the Alaska Peninsula, across from Kodiak Island, with headquarters in nearby King Salmon, about southwest of Anchorage. The area was first designated a national monument in 1918 to protect the area around the major 1912 volcanic eruption of Novarupta, which formed the Valley of Ten Thousand Smokes, a , pyroclastic flow. The park includes as many as 18 individual volcanoes, seven of which have been active since 1900. - The Bering Sea is a marginal sea of the Pacific Ocean. It comprises a deep water basin, which then rises through a narrow slope into the shallower water above the continental shelves. - Russia (from the Rus'), also officially known as the Russian Federation, is a country in Eurasia. At , Russia is the largest country in the world by surface area, covering more than one-eighth of the Earth's inhabited land area, and the ninth most populous, with over 140 million people at the end of March 2016. The European western part of the country is much more populated and urbanised than the eastern, about 77% of the population live in European Russia. Russia's capital Moscow is one of the largest cities in the world, other major urban centers include Saint Petersburg, Novosibirsk, Yekaterinburg, Nizhny Novgorod and Samara. - Wilderness or wildland is a natural environment on Earth that has not been significantly modified by civilized human activity. It may also be defined as: \\"The most intact, undisturbed wild natural areas left on our planetthose last truly wild places that humans do not control and have not developed with roads, pipelines or other industrial infrastructure.\\" - Rhyolite is an igneous, volcanic rock, of felsic (silica-rich) composition (typically > 69% SiOsee the TAS classification). It may have any texture from glassy to aphanitic to porphyritic. The mineral assemblage is usually quartz, sanidine and plagioclase (in a ratio > 2:1see the QAPF diagram). Biotite and hornblende are common accessory minerals. It is the extrusive equivalent to granite. - The Pacific Ocean is the largest of the Earth's oceanic divisions. It extends from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Southern Ocean (or, depending on definition, to Antarctica) in the south and is bounded by Asia and Australia in the west and the Americas in the east. - Natural gas is a naturally occurring hydrocarbon gas mixture consisting primarily of methane, but commonly including varying amounts of other higher alkanes, and sometimes a small percentage of carbon dioxide, nitrogen, hydrogen sulfide, or helium. It is formed when layers of decomposing plant and animal matter are exposed to intense heat and pressure under the surface of the Earth over millions of years. The energy that the plants originally obtained from the sun is stored in the form of chemical bonds in the gas. - The Aleutian Range is a major mountain range located in southwest Alaska, and it extends from Chakachamna Lake (80 miles/130 km southwest of Anchorage) to Unimak Island, which is at the tip of the Alaska Peninsula. It includes all of the mountains of the peninsula, and what makes it so special is its large number of active volcanoes, which are also part of the larger Aleutian Arc. The mainland part of the range is about 600 miles (1000 km) long; the Aleutian Islands are (geologically) a partially submerged western extension of the range that stretches for another 1,600 km (1000 mi). However the official designation \\"Aleutian Range\\" includes only the mainland peaks and the peaks on Unimak Island. The range is almost entirely roadless wilderness, and Katmai National Park and Preserve, a large national park within the range, must be reached by boat or plane. - Unimak Island is the largest island in the Aleutian Islands chain of the U.S. state of Alaska. - The Arctic Ocean is the smallest and shallowest of the world's five major oceans. The International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) recognizes it as an ocean, although some oceanographers call it the Arctic Mediterranean Sea or simply the Arctic Sea, classifying it a mediterranean sea or an estuary of the Atlantic Ocean. Alternatively, the Arctic Ocean can be seen as the northernmost part of the all-encompassing World Ocean. - Yukon (also commonly called the Yukon) is the westernmost and smallest of Canada's three federal territories (the other two are Northwest Territories and Nunavut). The territory is very sparsely populated with its about 35,000 people on almost half a million square kilometres. Whitehorse is the territorial capital and Yukon's only city. - Lava is the molten rock expelled by a volcano during an eruption. The resulting rock after solidification and cooling is also called \\"lava\\". The molten rock is formed in the interior of some planets, including Earth, and some of their satellites. The source of the heat that melts the rock within the earth is geothermal energy. When first erupted from a volcanic vent, lava is a liquid usually at temperatures from . - In geology, felsic refers to igneous rocks that are relatively rich in elements that form feldspar and quartz. It is contrasted with mafic rocks, which are relatively richer in magnesium and iron. It refers to those rocks rich in silicate minerals, magma, and rocks which are enriched in the lighter elements such as silicon, oxygen, aluminium, sodium, and potassium. - Sovereignty is understood in jurisprudence as the full right and power of a governing body to govern itself without any interference from outside sources or bodies. In political theory, sovereignty is a substantive term designating supreme authority over some polity. It is a basic principle underlying the dominant Westphalian model of state foundation. - Pumice, called pumicite in its powdered or dust form, is a volcanic rock that consists of highly vesicular rough textured volcanic glass, which may or may not contain crystals. It is typically light colored. Scoria is another vesicular volcanic rock that differs from pumice in having larger vesicles, thicker vesicle walls and being dark colored and denser. - The Anchorage Metropolitan Statistical Area , as defined by the United States Census Bureau, is an area consisting of the Municipality of Anchorage and the Matanuska-Susitna Borough in the south central region of Alaska. - British Columbia (BC) is the westernmost province of Canada, with a population of more than four million people located between the Pacific Ocean and the Rocky Mountains. British Columbia is also a component of the Pacific Northwest and the Cascadia bioregion, along with the U.S. states of Idaho, Oregon, Washington and Alaska. - Americans are citizens of the United States of America. The country is home to people of many different national origins. As a result, Americans do not equate their nationality with ethnicity, but with citizenship and allegiance. Although citizens make up the majority of Americans, non-citizen residents, dual citizens, and expatriates may also claim an American identity. - A volcano is a rupture in the crust of a planetary-mass object, such as Earth, that allows hot lava, volcanic ash, and gases to escape from a magma chamber below the surface. - A mountain range (also mountain barrier, belt, or system) is a geographic area containing numerous geologically related mountains. A mountain system or system of mountain ranges, sometimes is used to combine several geological features that are geographically (regionally) related. On Earth, most significant mountain ranges are the result of plate tectonics, though mountain ranges are formed by a range of processes, are found on many planetary mass objects in the Solar System and are likely a feature of most terrestrial planets. - Alaska is a U.S. state located in the northwest extremity of North America. The Canadian administrative divisions of British Columbia and Yukon border the state to the east; its most extreme western part is Attu Island; it has a maritime border with Russia to the west across the Bering Strait. To the north are the Chukchi and Beaufort seasthe southern parts of the Arctic Ocean. The Pacific Ocean lies to the south and southwest. Alaska is the largest state in the United States by area, the 3rd least populous and the least densely populated of the 50 United States. Approximately half of Alaska's residents (the total estimated at 738,432 by the U.S. Census Bureau in 2015) live within the Anchorage metropolitan area. Alaska's economy is dominated by the fishing, natural gas, and oil industries, resources which it has in abundance. Military bases and tourism are also a significant part of the economy. - The Aleutian Arc is a large volcanic arc in the U.S. state of Alaska. It consists of a number of active and dormant volcanoes that have formed as a result of subduction along the Aleutian Trench. Although taking its name from the Aleutian Islands, this term is a geologic grouping rather than a geographic one, and the Aleutian Arc extends through the Alaska Peninsula following the Aleutian Range to the Aleutian Islands. - A stratovolcano, also known as a composite volcano, is a conical volcano built up by many layers (strata) of hardened lava, tephra, pumice, and volcanic ash. Unlike shield volcanoes, stratovolcanoes are characterized by a steep profile and periodic explosive eruptions and effusive eruptions, although some have collapsed craters called calderas. The lava flowing from stratovolcanoes typically cools and hardens before spreading far due to high viscosity. The magma forming this lava is often felsic, having high-to-intermediate levels of silica (as in rhyolite, dacite, or andesite), with lesser amounts of less-viscous mafic magma. Extensive felsic lava flows are uncommon, but have travelled as far as . - Attu is the westernmost and largest island in the Near Islands group of the Aleutian Islands of Alaska, and the westernmost point of land relative to Alaska, the United States, North America and the Americas. The island became uninhabited in 2010. - Fishing is the activity of trying to catch fish. Fish are normally caught in the wild. Techniques for catching fish include hand gathering, spearing, netting, angling and trapping. Fishing may include catching aquatic animals other than fish, such as molluscs, cephalopods, crustaceans, and echinoderms. The term is not normally applied to catching farmed fish, or to aquatic mammals, such as whales where the term whaling is more appropriate. - A U.S. state is a constituent political entity of the United States of America. There are 50 states, which are bound together in a union with each other. Each state holds administrative jurisdiction over a defined geographic territory, and shares its sovereignty with the United States federal government. Due to the shared sovereignty between each state and the federal government, Americans are citizens of both the federal republic and of the state in which they reside. State citizenship and residency are flexible, and no government approval is required to move between states, except for persons covered by certain types of court orders (e.g., paroled convicts and children of divorced spouses who are sharing custody). - Magma (from Ancient Greek (\\"mágma\\") meaning \\"thick unguent\\") is a mixture of molten or semi-molten rock, volatiles and solids that is found beneath the surface of the Earth, and is expected to exist on other terrestrial planets and some natural satellites. Besides molten rock, magma may also contain suspended crystals, dissolved gas and sometimes gas bubbles. Magma often collects in magma chambers that may feed a volcano or solidify underground to form an intrusion. Magma is capable of intruding into adjacent rocks (forming igneous dikes and sills), extrusion onto the surface as lava, and explosive ejection as tephra to form pyroclastic rock. - Dacite is an igneous, volcanic rock. It has an aphanitic to porphyritic texture and is intermediate in composition between andesite and rhyolite. The word dacite comes from Dacia, a province of the Roman Empire which lay between the Danube River and Carpathian Mountains (now modern Romania and Moldova) where the rock was first described.

After a bloody battle, both Hardrada and Tostig along with most of the Norwegians were killed. Although Harold Godwinson repelled the Norwegian invaders, his army was defeated by the Normans at Hastings less than three weeks later.

The process depends on a muscle called the diaphragm. This is a large, sheet-like muscle below the lungs. Inhaling, or breathing in, occurs when the diaphragm muscle tightens. This increases the size of the chest. This too decreases air pressure inside the lungs. This action allows air and gases to enter the lungs. Exhaling, or breathing out, occurs when the diaphragm muscle relaxes. This decreases the size of the chest. This increases air pressure inside the lungs. This action allows for air to leave the lungs. When you inhale, air enters the respiratory system through your nose and ends up in your lungs, where gas exchange with the blood takes place. What happens to the air along the way? In the nose, mucus and hairs trap any dust or other particles in the air. The air is also warmed and moistened. Next, air passes through a passageway that is connected to the windpipe. The air then finds its way to the lungs. In the chest, the windpipe splits so that air enters both the right and left lung. Question: \\"What is happening when your chest decreases in size while breathing?\\" Response: \\"Exhaling, or breathing out\\" Does the response correctly answer the question?","completion":"Yes, the response correctly answers the question.

Mr. Tucker's post was shared at least 16,000 times on Twitter and more than 350,000 times on Facebook. The problem is that Mr. Tucker got it wrong. There were no such buses packed with paid protesters. But that didn't matter. While some fake news is produced purposefully by teenagers in the Balkans or entrepreneurs in the United States seeking to make money from advertising, false information can also arise from misinformed social media posts by regular people that are seized on and spread through a hyperpartisan blogosphere. Here, The New York Times deconstructs how Mr. Tucker’s now-deleted declaration on Twitter the night after the election turned into a fake-news phenomenon. It is an example of how, in an ever-connected world where speed often takes precedence over truth, an observation by a private citizen can quickly become a talking point, even as it is being proved false. ||||| Tweet with a location You can add location information to your Tweets, such as your city or precise location, from the web and via third-party applications.

However, the latter was not completed to their satisfaction, and by December 2011, Clayton admitted it would not come to fruition. The sessions with Danger Mouse instead formed the foundation of U2's next album, and they worked with him until May 2013 before enlisting the help of producers Paul Epworth, Ryan Tedder, Declan Gaffney, and Flood. The band suspended work on the album late in 2013 to contribute a new song, \\"Ordinary Love\\", to the film Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom.

Given a command in a limited form of natural language, provide the correct sequence of actions that executes the command to thus navigate an agent in its environment. A command can be broken down into many different actions. Actions are uppercase and are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. The word 'opposite' turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively.

Given the question: What is the last name of the person who was offered a song on the condition that he release it as his next single? Answer the above question based on the context below: Paul McCartney said he came up with the title \\"The Long and Winding Road\\" during one of his first visits to his property High Park Farm, near Campbeltown in Scotland, which he purchased in June 1966. The phrase was inspired by the sight of a road \\"stretching up into the hills\\" in the remote Highlands surroundings of lochs and distant mountains. He wrote the song at his farm in 1968, inspired by the growing tension among the Beatles. Based on other comments McCartney has made, author Howard Sounes writes, the lyrics can be seen as McCartney expressing his anguish at the direction of his personal life, as well as a nostalgic look back at the Beatles' history. McCartney recalled: \\"I just sat down at my piano in Scotland, started playing and came up with that song, imagining it was going to be done by someone like Ray Charles. I have always found inspiration in the calm beauty of Scotland and again it proved the place where I found inspiration.\\"Once back in London, McCartney recorded a demo version of \\"The Long and Winding Road\\" during one of the recording sessions for The Beatles. Later, he offered the song to Tom Jones on the condition that the singer release it as his next single. In Jones' recollection, he was forced to turn it down since his record company were about to issue \\"Without Love\\" as a single.The song takes the form of a piano-based ballad, with conventional chord changes. McCartney described the chords as \\"slightly jazzy\\" and in keeping with Charles' style. The song's home key is E-flat major but it also uses the relative C minor. Lyrically, it is a sad and melancholic song, with an evocation of an as-yet unrequited, though apparently inevitable, love. In an interview in 1994, McCartney described the lyric more obliquely: \\"It's rather a sad song. I like writing sad songs, it's a good bag to get into because you can actually acknowledge some deeper feelings of your own and put them in it. It's a good vehicle, it saves having to go to a psychiatrist.\\"The opening theme is repeated throughout. The... The answer is:","completion":"Tom Jones.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Ventura was born James George Janos on July 15, 1951 in Minneapolis, Minnesota, the son of George William Janos and his wife, Bernice Martha (nee Lenz). Both of his parents were World War II veterans. Ventura has an older brother who served in the Vietnam War. Ventura has described himself as Slovak, since his father's parents were from what is now Slovakia; his mother was of German descent. After the legislature refused to increase spending for security, Ventura attracted criticism when he decided not to live in the governor's mansion during his tenure, choosing instead to shut it down and stay at his home in Maple Grove. Critics pointed to the loss of jobs for several working-class people at the mansion and the extra cost of reopening the mansion later. In 1999, a group of disgruntled citizens petitioned to recall Governor Ventura, alleging, among other things, that \\"the use of state security personnel to protect the governor on a book promotion tour constituted illegal use of state property for personal gain.\\" The petition was denied. The proposed petition was dismissed by order of the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Minnesota. Under Minnesota law, a proposed petition for recall is required to be reviewed by the Chief Justice for legal sufficiency, and, upon such review, the Chief Justice determined that it did not allege the commission of any act that violated Minnesota law. Ventura sought attorney's fees as a sanction for the filing of a frivolous petition for recall, but that request was denied, on the ground that there was no statutory authority for such an award. In November 2011, Ventura held a press conference in relation to a lawsuit he had filed against the Transportation Security Administration. During that press conference, Ventura stated that he would \\"never stand for a national anthem again, I will turn my back and raise a fist the same way Tommy Smith and John Carlos did in the '68 Olympics, Jesse Ventura will do that today.\\" During his tenure as governor, Ventura drew frequent fire from the press in the Twin Cities. He referred to reporters as \\"media jackals,\\" a term that even appeared on the press passes required to enter the governor's press area. Shortly after Ventura's election as governor, author and humorist Garrison Keillor wrote a satirical book about the event, spoofing Ventura as \\"Jimmy (Big Boy) Valente,\\" a self-aggrandizing former \\"Navy W.A.L.R.U.S. (Water Air Land Rising Up Suddenly)\\" turned professional wrestler turned politician. Initially, Ventura responded angrily to the satire, but later, in a conciliatory vein, said that Keillor \\"makes Minnesota proud\\". During his term, Ventura appeared on the Late Show with David Letterman, in which he responded controversially to the following question: \\"So which is the better city of the Twin Cities, Minneapolis or St. Paul?\\". Ventura responded, \\"Minneapolis. Those streets in St. Paul must have been designed by drunken Irishmen\\". He later apologized for the remark, adding that it was not intended to be taken seriously.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Were there other things he was also criticized for?","completion":"Yes, aside from not living in the governor's mansion and the state security issue, Ventura was criticized for his interactions with the press, calling reporters \\"media jackals,\\" and making controversial remarks about St. Paul's streets being designed by \\"drunken Irishmen.\\" Additionally, he faced criticism for his response to Garrison Keillor's satirical book about his election as governor."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

This is some data: Ayam penyet, country, Java. Generate a detailed description of this data. Sentence:","completion":"Ayam penyet is a delicious and traditional Indonesian dish that originates from the beautiful country of Indonesia, specifically from the culturally-rich island of Java. The name of the dish translates to \\"smashed chicken,\\" which refers to the unique preparation method that involves the use of a mortar and pestle or a heavy object to tenderize the chicken before it is fried to achieve a succulent and juicy taste. The dish is well-known for its distinctive blend of rich flavors and tantalizing aromas, which results from a combination of a wide variety of handpicked spices, such as turmeric, garlic, ginger, lemongrass, galangal, and candlenuts. These spices are finely ground into a fragrant paste, which serves as a marinade for the chicken before being cooked. Once the chicken has been thoroughly marinated, it is deep-fried in hot oil until it turns a beautiful golden-brown color, with a crispy skin and tender meat. In addition to the flavorful chicken, Ayam penyet is typically served with a mouthwatering accompaniment known as sambal, a special type of chili paste made from a mixture of ground red chilies, garlic, tomatoes, and shallots, seasoned with salt, sugar, and sometimes shrimp paste. This fiery condiment adds an extra layer of heat and complexity to the dish, making it burst with flavor. The dish is usually enjoyed with steamed white rice, which allows for the delicious spices and chicken flavors to truly shine. Additionally, Ayam penyet may be accompanied by various side dishes, such as fresh vegetables, including cucumbers, lettuce, and tomatoes, and crunchy fried tofu or tempeh. These side dishes not only add color and balance to the meal but also serve to temper the spiciness of the sambal for those who may be less accustomed to the heat. Ayam penyet is not only a popular dish in Indonesia but has also gained significant recognition and appreciation in neighboring countries like Malaysia and Singapore. The dish can be found in many Indonesian and Southeast Asian restaurants worldwide, reflecting its widespread appeal and influence on global culinary landscapes. In summary, Ayam penyet is an exquisite Indonesian dish hailing from the island of Java, which marries the succulent flavors of marinated and smashed fried chicken with the spicy kick of sambal, making it a quintessential representation of the diverse and rich culinary heritage of the country. The dish's bold flavors and satisfying texture have earned it recognition and popularity beyond Indonesia's borders, making it a beloved staple in Southeast Asian cuisine."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: A rare parasitic worm that can infect people's brains is causing concern in Maui, where there has been a rise in cases in recent months. So far this year, two residents in Maui and two visitors to the island have become infected with the parasite, and four additional cases are under investigation, according to local media outlet Hawaii News Now. Prior to this year, there were just two infections on the island in the past 10 years. The parasite, called rat lungworm or Angiostrongylus cantonensis, can infect the brain and cause meningitis, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Infected people may experience headaches, neck stiffness, nausea, vomiting and abnormal sensations in their arms and legs. Most people fully recover without treatment, but in rare cases the infection can cause neurological problems or death, the CDC said. [10 Bizarre Diseases You Can Get Outdoors] “If you could imagine, it’s like having a slow-moving bullet go through your brain,\\" Dr. Sarah Park, an epidemiologist at the Hawaii State Department of Health, told the Associated Press. \\"There’s no rhyme or reason why it’s going to hang out in this part of the brain or that part of the brain,\\" Park said. The parasite is found in rats, but larvae from the parasite can also infect snails and slugs, the CDC said. People can become infected if they eat raw or undercooked snails or slugs, or by eating contaminated produce, the CDC said. The parasite is prevalent in Southeast Asia and tropical Pacific islands, but in recent years, its geographical distribution has expanded to other areas, including Africa, the Caribbean and the United States, the CDC said. In the past decade, more than 70 cases of rat lungworm were reported in Hawaii, most on the Big Island, according to the Hawaii State Legislature. Original article on Live Science. ||||| State health officials are investigating four possible new cases of rat lungworm disease on Maui. In the past decade, there had been only two cases of the parasitic infection on the Valley Isle. Data show there were 60 cases in the last 10 years, with the vast majority of them on the Big Island. Already this year, there have been two other cases of Maui residents contracting the disease, including one who may have been infected during a work trip to the Big Island. The state Health Department said two other visitors to Maui also got the infection and returned to their home states. The increase in cases led to a standing room only crowd at a public information meeting Thursday night in Hana. There is no cure for the disease, which usually affects rats -- thus the name -- and then is passed along to slugs and snails like those found in the garden. \\"Even though it's just a few cases, it's still the fact that we received a few cases where we normally might see one in a blue moon on Maui. That makes us concerned that something has changed potentially on Maui to bring their risk of seeing the disease similar, closer to what we see on the Big Island, and trying to identify what that risk is an ongoing effort,\\" said State Epidemiologist Dr. Sarah Park. Park also said the infection is preventable. People are being told to was fruits and vegetables thoroughly to get rid of any slug or snail larvae that could be infected with the parasite.

Interested in Hawaii? Add Hawaii as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Hawaii news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest A worm called Angiostrongylus cantonensis causes the infection; there is no treatment, and in rare cases, it can be fatal. People who catch the infection by eating raw or undercooked snails, or contaminated fruits and vegetables, can develop meningitis. Earlier this week, health officials in Maui reported that six cases of the parasitic infection have been reported in the last three months compared to the previous decade when only two cases were found, according to the Associated Press and ABC News affiliate KITV. Dr. Lorrin Pang, the Maui district health officer, explained to worried residents why the disease is so damaging. In a live-streamed presentation on Facebook, Pang said that the parasite can live in the body for months. As a result, inflammation from the body's immune response can result in scarring or other damage to the nervous system, which can cause pain during the infection. \\"Our body realizes this is so foreign we attack it...by that time the worm is one inch big and by then it's a major battle,\\" Pang said, describing the immune system fight to kill the parasite. \\"There is a whole lot of collateral damage...attacking the worm attacks ourselves and that is the issue.\\" A bad headache, neck stiffness, light sensitivity and vomiting and can start more than six weeks after ingesting the worm, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. p://abcnews.go.com/Health/hundreds-scientists-offer-lab-space-people-affected-trump/story?id=45218998] text=[Hundreds of Scientists Offer Lab Space for People Affected by Trump Travel Ban]/> Dr. Constantine Tsigrelis, an infectious disease specialist with University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center, said that treatment is complicated because doctors don't want to exacerbate an immune response that kills the parasite but then injures the brain or nervous system in the process. \\"An anti-parasitic drug could kill the worm but the problem is that the dying organisms can create a very severe inflammatory response and the patient can get worse,\\" Tsigrelis told ABC News. The worm can’t live very long inside humans, usually only a few months according to Pang. However, it can cause permanent damage as it invades the brain's membrane. The worm has been found in Louisiana, Hawaii and the Caribbean, but lives primarily in the Pacific Basin and Southeast Asia, according to the CDC. The parasite lives in the blood vessels of rats' lungs – giving the parasite its name – but the larvae can be expelled in rat droppings and eaten by snails, slugs and other animals, who can pass these baby parasitic worms on to humans. Tsigrelis said potential visitors should not be deterred from a Hawaiian getaway. But they should take steps to protect themselves. “If you’re going to Hawaii, enjoy the local food but take those precautions regarding washing fresh produce, making sure salads have been washed and avoiding undercooked slugs, snails, crabs,” Tsigrelis said. Washing hands and utensils after eating or preparing raw slugs, snails, or freshwater shrimp can prevent infection, as can thoroughly cleaning raw vegetables, according to the Hawaiian Department of Health. Boiling food for three to five minutes, or freezing it at 5 degrees Fahrenheit for 24 hours or more, kills the larvae. Clearing snails, slugs and rats from gardens and other outdoor spaces can also prevent the spread of the worm.

Follow her on Twitter @AllisonRBond. ||||| W AILUKU, Hawaii — Maui health officials said six cases of rat lungworm disease have been reported on the island over the past three months, while the island has seen only two cases of the disease in the past decade. Three of the cases have been confirmed, while a seventh case involves a Maui woman who believes she contracted the parasite on the Big Island, Maui District Health Officer Dr. Lorrin Pang said Tuesday. Rat lungworm disease is a condition in which parasitic worm larvae infect people’s brains. It is carried by rats and transmitted by snails and slugs. advertisement Officials say residents can reduce the risk of contracting the potentially life-threatening disease by thoroughly washing fruits and vegetables before consumption. Experts are still determining the best way to get rid of the invasive slugs, Pang said. Smashing, burying or burning them does not deter rats from eating them and restarting the cycle of rat lungworm. “The slug is easy to kill, but the parasite; it’s not so easy,” he said. State epidemiologist Dr. Sarah Park said there is an average of about 10 rat lungworm cases each year statewide and that the recent spike is concerning. A vast majority of Hawaii’s cases are reported on the Big Island. The infection can cause a rare type of meningitis that triggers severe headaches and stiffness of the neck, tingling or painful feelings in the skin or extremities, fever, nausea and vomiting, according to the state Department of Health Disease Investigation Branch. Temporary paralysis of the face and light sensitivity may also occur. “If you could imagine, it’s like having a slow-moving bullet go through your brain and there’s no rhyme or reason why it’s going to hang out in this part of the brain or that part of the brain,” Park said. |||||Summary:","completion":"A rare parasitic worm called rat lungworm, or Angiostrongylus cantonensis, that can infect people's brains has caused concern in Maui, where there has been a significant rise in cases in recent months.

Thus a profession of faith is required of people wishing to enter into full communion with the Catholic Church, even if they have been members of a separate church whose sacraments the Catholic Church considers to be valid. Being \\"in full communion with the Catholic Church\\" is incompatible with denying what it has definitively proposed as its teaching on faith and morals. - Eurasia is the combined continental landmass of Europe and Asia. The term is a portmanteau of its constituent continents. Located primarily in the Northern and Eastern Hemispheres, it is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the west, the Pacific Ocean to the east, the Arctic Ocean to the north, and by Africa, the Mediterranean Sea, and the Indian Ocean to the south. The division between Europe and Asia as two different continents is a historical and cultural construct, with no clear physical separation between them; thus, in some parts of the world, Eurasia is recognized as the largest of five or six continents. In geology, Eurasia is often considered as a single rigid megablock. However, the rigidity of Eurasia is debated based on the paleomagnet data. - Paul Coussa ( 9 September 1917 -- 7 July 2012 ) was a Syrian born Iraqi prelate of the Armenian Catholic Church .

Review: jordan jealous Is this movie review sentence negative or positive?","completion":"The movie review sentence \\"Jordan jealous\\" appears to be more negative in sentiment. However, it is important to note that the sentence is very minimal and does not provide sufficient information to fully comprehend the intended sentiment. It would be beneficial to have additional context or more elaborative description to determine with certainty whether the writer is trying to express a positive or negative opinion about the movie. In most cases, the term \\"jealous\\" typically carries a negative connotation, suggesting feelings of envy or resentment. In the context of the given sentence, it seems possible that the character named Jordan may be experiencing envy or has acted negatively in the movie.

The date of his journey has become a point of contention due to Seagal's statement that he studied with Morihei Uyeshiba, the founder of aikido, who died in 1969. Terry Dobson, a fifth-degree black belt who studied with the master from 1961 to 1969, dismissed this claim, saying, \\"That story is bull. [Back then] I never heard of Steven Seagal.\\" By 1974 Seagal had returned California. That year he met Miyako Fujitani, a second-degree black belt and daughter of an Osaka aikido master who had come to Los Angeles to teach aikido. When Miyako returned to Osaka, Seagal went with her. The following year they married and had a son, Kentaro, and a daughter, Ayako. He taught at the school owned by Miyako's family (though he is often stated to have been the first non-Asian to open a dojo in Japan). As of 1990, Miyako and her brother still taught there, and her mother was the chairwoman. Seagal initially returned to Taos, New Mexico, with his student (and later film stuntman) Craig Dunn, where they opened a dojo, although Seagal spent much of his time pursuing other ventures. After another period in Japan, Seagal returned to the U.S. in 1983 with senior student Haruo Matsuoka. They opened an aikido dojo, initially in North Hollywood, California, but later moved it to the city of West Hollywood. Seagal left Matsuoka in charge of the dojo, which he ran until the two parted ways in 1997. Seagal helped train Brazilian Mixed Martial Artist Lyoto Machida, who credited Seagal for helping him perfect the front kick that he used to knock out Randy Couture at UFC 129 in May 2011. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: How long did they have the dojo","completion":"Seagal and Matsuoka opened their aikido dojo in 1983, and they ran it together until 1997.

Saint Patrick's feast day, as a kind of national day, was already being celebrated by the Irish in Europe in the ninth and tenth centuries. In later times, he became more and more widely seen as the patron of Ireland. Saint Patrick's feast day was finally placed on the universal liturgical calendar in the Catholic Church due to the influence of Waterford-born Franciscan scholar Luke Wadding in the early 1600s. Saint Patrick's Day thus became a holy day of obligation for Roman Catholics in Ireland. It is also a feast day in the Church of Ireland, which is part of the worldwide Anglican Communion. The church calendar avoids the observance of saints' feasts during certain solemnities, moving the saint's day to a time outside those periods. St Patrick's Day is occasionally affected by this requirement, when 17 March falls during Holy Week. This happened in 1940, when Saint Patrick's Day was observed on 3 April to avoid it coinciding with Palm Sunday, and again in 2008, where it was officially observed on 15 March. St Patrick's Day will not fall within Holy Week again until 2160. However, the popular festivities may still be held on 17 March or on a weekend near to the feast day. Based on the above text, what's the best answer to this question: is st. patrick's day a holy day? Options: [-] no. [-] yes.","completion":"[-] yes.

Although Powell was intimidated by Lennon's attitude and appearance, she heard that he was obsessed with the French actress Brigitte Bardot, so she dyed her hair blonde. Lennon asked her out, but when she said that she was engaged, he screamed out, \\"I didn't ask you to fuckin' marry me, did I?\\" She often accompanied him to Quarrymen gigs and travelled to Hamburg with McCartney's girlfriend to visit him. Lennon was jealous by nature and eventually grew possessive, often terrifying Powell with his anger and physical violence. Lennon later said that until he met Ono, he had never questioned his chauvinistic attitude toward women. He said that the Beatles song \\"Getting Better\\" told his own story, \\"I used to be cruel to my woman, and physically – any woman. I was a hitter. I couldn't express myself and I hit. I fought men and I hit women. That is why I am always on about peace.\\"Recalling his July 1962 reaction when he learned that Cynthia was pregnant, Lennon said, \\"There's only one thing for it Cyn. We'll have to get married.\\" The couple wed on 23 August at the Mount Pleasant Register Office in Liverpool, with Brian Epstein serving as best man. His marriage began just as Beatlemania was taking off across the UK. He performed on the evening of his wedding day and would continue to do so almost daily from then on. Epstein feared that fans would be alienated by the idea of a married Beatle, and he asked the Lennons to keep their marriage secret. Julian was born on 8 April 1963; Lennon was on tour at the time and did not see his infant son until three days later.Cynthia attributed the start of the marriage breakdown to Lennon's use of LSD, and she felt that he slowly lost interest in her as a result of his use of the drug.

How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect The answer to this question is:","completion":"Less effect. If there is less governmental protection in place for animals that undergo hibernation, it can negatively impact their ability to hibernate properly. The reason for this is that governmental protections often play a crucial role in preserving the habitats and ecosystems of these animals, helping to maintain the balance and stability of their environments. When these protections are reduced, there could be an increased risk of habitat destruction, pollution, and other human-related disturbances that threaten the well-being of the animals and their ecosystems. The second effect mentioned in the process is the animals gaining weight during good weather. This weight gain is important because it provides the animals with the energy stores they need to survive throughout their hibernation period. With less governmental protection, the animals' food sources may become threatened due to increased human activity or resource extraction, which could lead to a disruption in the availability and quality of their food sources. However, the impact of these changes on the animals' ability to gain weight during good weather may be less pronounced. This is because many animals have evolved to be highly adaptable to fluctuations in their environment, including variations in food availability. Additionally, these animals may be able to compensate for any disruptions in their food intake by adjusting their foraging behaviors or dietary preferences. While less governmental protection is likely to have a negative impact on the overall ability of animals to hibernate properly, the direct effect on their weight gain during good weather may be less pronounced. It is essential, however, to recognize that continued reductions in governmental protection could lead to worsening conditions for these animals and their habitats, potentially jeopardizing their ability to hibernate effectively in the long term. Therefore, it is crucial to advocate for adequate protection and conservation efforts to preserve these vital processes for the well-being and survival of hibernating animals."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Worries about the effects of late night cramming led the government to force cramming schools to close by 10 p.m. Finnish children spend the least time in class in the developed world, often finishing just after lunch, with about one hour of homework a day. Private tuition is uncommon. The British and American school day is quite long in comparison, around 6 hours, and secondary school pupils do 2 or 3 hours of selfstudy a night. The Korean education system, like many in Asia, is intensely competitive, with students even competing to get into the best cramming schools, to help them get ahead. Finnish education is far less cutthroat. Classes are all mixed ability, and there are no league tables. British schools again occupy the middle ground, with quite high levels of competition for places at university, and schools and universities battling to come top of league tables for everything from exam results to student satisfaction.

Jean Sibelius's Symphony No. 8 was his final major compositional project, occupying him intermittently from the mid-1920s until around 1938, though he never published it. During this time Sibelius was at the peak of his fame, a national figure in his native Finland and a composer of international stature. A fair copy of at least the first movement was made, but how much of the Eighth Symphony was completed is unknown. Sibelius repeatedly refused to release it for performance, though he continued to assert that he was working on it even after he had, according to later reports from his family, burned the score and associated material, probably in 1945. Much of Sibelius's reputation, during his lifetime and subsequently, derived from his work as a symphonist. His Seventh Symphony of 1924 has been widely recognised as a landmark in the development of symphonic form, and at the time there was no reason to suppose that the flow of innovative orchestral works would not continue. However, after the symphonic poem Tapiola, completed in 1926, his output was confined to relatively minor pieces and revisions to earlier works. During the 1930s the Eighth Symphony's premiere was promised to Serge Koussevitzky and the Boston Symphony Orchestra on several occasions, but as each scheduled date approached Sibelius demurred, claiming that the work was not ready for performance. Similar promises made to the British conductor Basil Cameron and to the Finnish Georg Schnéevoigt likewise proved illusory. It is thought that Sibelius's perfectionism and exalted reputation prevented him ever completing the symphony to his satisfaction; he wanted it to be even better than his Seventh. After Sibelius's death in 1957, news of the Eighth Symphony's destruction was made public, and it was assumed that the work had disappeared forever. But in the 1990s, when the composer's many notebooks and sketches were being catalogued, scholars first raised the possibility that fragments of the music for the lost symphony might have survived.

As you slid your finger down the columns of groceries and toiletries, you would invariably be stopped by something along the lines of \\"2dozjumHerbal Essences\\" or \\"1pepperoni TC,\\" with the \\"TC\\" underlined twice and flanked by gnarled masses of pencil scratch-outs. When we were kids, we dreaded accompanying her to Wal-Mart, or worse, the Cosco at the edge of town, where the echoing rafters and limitless aisles seemed to mock the confusion into which we were inevitably thrown when handed torn-off fragments of the list. Of course, it was easy enough to see in hindsight that \\"2dozjumHerbal Essences\\" was merely the bastard child of two drunkenly weaving columns--we had been supposed to get two dozen jumbo eggs and a bottle of my mother's favourite brand of shampoo (ever inventive in creating proprietary abbreviations--\\"TC\\" standing for, what else, thin crust pizza--my mother scrupulously wrote out brand names in full). It was a little like ordering chemicals for a laboratory, sans any knowledge of chemistry--or, for that matter, laboratories, although my ignorance of the distinction between baking soda and baking powder cannot be entirely the root of my confusion. Eventually I--and my siblings--learned the difference between tomato paste and tomato sauce, and could readily distinguish one brand of laundry detergent from a similarly-styled knock-off, but my shame-faced trips back to the mothercart never ceased. I would track her down, most often in the produce section--she was usually loath to trust us with the delicate task of selecting the very best fruits and vegetables--and hand her back my portion of the list, asking for an explanation. Usually it amounted to a failure of awareness on my part--get the kind of soap we always get, of course!

Bad Handwriting: The mother's handwriting is difficult to decipher, which adds to the confusion in understanding the items on the list. 2. Weird Abbreviations: The mother uses her own abbreviations, like \\"TC\\" for thin crust pizza, which are not commonly known to the author and their siblings. This makes it challenging for them to comprehend what each abbreviation stands for. 3. Incomplete Information: The mother's list often lacks clear and complete information about the items to be purchased, such as the specific brand of a product or the exact variant of an item. This forces the author and their siblings to guess what their mother wants, leading to errors and confusion. These factors collectively contribute to the author's experience of feeling overwhelmed and confused when tasked with shopping based on their mother's shopping list.

The answer to the question: What are the full names of the characters who learn that Serena cannot bear children? is inside the article: In Depression-era North Carolina, George Pemberton is an ambitious timber baron who meets Serena Shaw, a young woman with a sad past. He falls in love with her, they marry, and Serena comes with George to his land. There, she starts taking control of things, pressuring and questioning George, while remaining affectionate towards him. George's business partner Buchanan feels threatened by her, as she begins to exceed his authority. Things grow worse between George and Buchanan, and Buchanan strikes a deal with the local sheriff, who wants to buy George's land to make a park. George is hurt by Buchanan's betrayal, and Serena convinces George that Buchanan was never his friend. The next day, they both go shooting alone from the group attempting to flush out a bear. After some snide remarks from Buchanan, George contemplates killing him only to hesitate and be seen by Buchanan. As Buchanan cocks his rifle, George fires first and shoots him in the chest. Campbell, George's worker, witnesses the murder, but denies it when Sheriff McDowell inquires. The death is ruled an accident. Serena consoles George and justifies his actions.

Benefits Street star White Dee is currently living it up on Majorca, but had her sunny spell darkened by an alleged assault earlier this week. However, if these images are anything to go by, she would have given as good as she got, had she had the chance. White Dee, real name Deirdre Kelly, was seen throwing an entire bucket of ice over a fellow holiday maker as she enjoys the perks of her new fame in Magaluf. Ice, ice baby: White Dee attacks a fellow fun-timer with an entire bucket of ice while attending a pool party in Magaluf, Majorca. Ms Kelly, 42, was seen talking to the younger man by a cask used as a table, stacked with plastic cups full of colourful drinks. Lifting up the bucket of ice towards her companion, she decided to give him a cooling off, and threw the contents over his shoulder. Fortunately for Ms Kelly, the 'victim' seemed to take it all in his stride, laughing as she walked off, cigarette sticking out of her mouth. It is believed these photographs were taken before she was attacked by a man at the hotel, where she was hosting a Carnage Pool Party. White Dee was allegedly 'kicked in the back of the head and hurled into a swimming pool' by a British man working on the island. Add some ice? White Dee innocently picks up the bucket, possibly to offer her companion some more ice with his drink. Here we go: It soon becomes clear, White Dee is set to pull a cold prank on the man in front of her. Cooling off: The man appears to have at least caught a few ice cubes in his glass, with the rest of the bucket trickling down his shoulders. Ms Kelly struggled to swim as the man's friends filmed the incident, pointing and laughing.

Dee. was hosting a four-hour pool party. followed by a six-hour bar crawl at the holiday resort. No cold shoulder: Fortunately for White Dee, her younger companion seemed to find the ice bucket prank funny. Hold on tight! White Dee shrieks with delight as she gets taken for a spin on the back of a quad bike. Playful: The sisters get into a water fight as they cool off from the intense Spanish sun. Splashing around: Dee jokes around with her sister. Later that day the mood turned sour when she was pushed in a pool. It comes just a month after she sparked. outrage after being pictured drinking champagne in a VIP area as part of. a £10,000 promotional holiday. But while posing for pictures,. she was approached by the man who ran up the full length of the pool. before launching himself at her and hitting her in the head with his. knee. Both fell into the pool and the reality star was left trying to doggy-paddle. Suffering whiplash, she was then forced to miss the six-hour bar crawl. Her agent Barry Tomes, who witnessed the assault, told MailOnline: 'Thankfully Dee can swim. 'But as far as we are concerned this is clearly an assault and we called the police immediately. 'Dee intends to make an assault charge. ' Careful! The reality star nearly loses her strapless top when she jumps into the sea after her ride on the dinghy. Brrr!

Summarize this article: New York Knicks forward Carmelo Anthony has been suspended one game without pay for confronting Boston's Kevin Garnett in the arena tunnel, near the players' locker rooms, and in the parking garage following Monday's game against the Boston Celtics at Madison Square Garden. The NBA announced the suspension on Wednesday. Anthony served the suspension Thursday, when the Knicks lost 81-76 to the Indiana Pacers. \\"There are no circumstances in which it is acceptable for a player to confront an opponent after a game,\\" NBA executive vice president basketball operations Stu Jackson said in a statement. \\"Carmelo Anthony attempted to engage with Kevin Garnett multiple times after Monday's game and therefore a suspension was warranted.\\" Anthony said before the suspension was announced that he did not believe he deserved to be disciplined. \\"If you just go off the actual facts of what happened, I don't think anything will happen,\\" Anthony said. After he and Garnett were called for technical fouls for jawing at one another in the closing minutes of Monday's game, Anthony approached Garnett at the Celtics' team bus. Madison Square Garden security, New York City Police officers, team security and even Knicks coach Mike Woodson intervened before the incident could escalate. Anthony said Tuesday that his \\"motivation\\" in finding Garnett after the game was to have a \\"one-on-one conversation\\" with him after the Boston big man spewed a verbal insult at Anthony. \\"It's certain things that you just don't say to men, another man,\\" Anthony said Tuesday. \\"I felt that he crossed the line. Like I said, we're both at an understanding right now; we handled it the way we handled it. Nobody needs to know what was said behind closed doors. So that situation is handled.\\" Anthony's teammate, Tyson Chandler, was on the floor at the time and agreed that Garnett crossed the line. \\"I think it was a little too much, in all honesty,\\" Chandler said Wednesday in an appearance on \\"The Michael Kay Show\\" on ESPN New York 98.7 FM. \\"I felt like Melo wanted to have a conversation man to man (with Garnett), and I respect that.\\" According to a source close to Anthony, he and Garnett had a phone conversation after the confrontation to clear the air. The Knicks' star said Wednesday that he was ready to move on from the incident. \\"That's over with, don't even want to go back to that,\\" Anthony said after practice. \\"Whatever happened between me and Kevin, that's done. That's settled. It's done and over with. We move on, got Indiana (on Thursday). No disrespect, but I don't wanna keep talking about the same thing and beating a dead horse.\\" Anthony is averaging 29.0 points and 6.1 rebounds per game and is converting 42.8 percent of his 3-point attempts in one of his finest seasons as a pro. It's unclear at this point who will start in place of Anthony against the Pacers, who have won eight of 10. Ian Begley is regular contributor to ESPNNewYork.com ||||| Dallas Mavericks owner and entrepreneurial icon Mark Cuban is in hot water with the NBA again, this time over some costly comments he made on Twitter. The league fined Cuban 50,000 on Tuesday for a tweet he posted after his Mavericks lost at home to the lowly New Orleans Hornets on Saturday. Here is the tweet in question: Im sorry NBA fans. Ive tried for 13 yrs to fix the officiating in this league and I have failed miserably. Any Suggestions ? I need help — Mark Cuban (@mcuban) January 6, 2013 The 50,000 fine comes out to just over 367 per character for the 136-character tweet, but that's just chump change to Cuban, whose net worth tops 2 billion. It's the rough equivalent of a 1 fine for someone earning 40,000 per year. Cuban is also no stranger to the NBA dinging him for cash since he bought the Mavericks in 2000. According to the Dallas Morning News, he's been docked a total of some 2 million in the 13 years since. Cuban is exceptionally outspoken and candid on Twitter for a billionaire sports team owner, so it's not entirely surprising that his tweeting thumbs — rather than his sharp tongue — did him in this time. But for all that trash talk, there's one team's fan base he says he won't mess with online — the Los Angeles Lakers. “There is more Twitter courage in Southern California than probably any other part of the world,\\" Cuban said in November. “I could say ‘Kobe tied his shoe laces wrong’ and I’d probably get death threats on Twitter.” What do you think about the NBA fining Mark Cuban for his tweet — Right?

They lay eggs that can be fertilized either inside or outside of the body. In most fish, the eggs develop outside of the mother's body. In the majority of these species, fertilization also takes place outside the mother's body. The male and female fish release their gametes into the surrounding water, where fertilization occurs. Female fish release very high numbers of eggs to increase the chances of fertilization. Now, I have a new situation: All marine creatures are not fish. There are some mammals, for example, whales, also live in the water. Rob wants to know more about differences between fish and other non fish creatures in the water. He divided them into two groups, group A and group B. Group A consists of fish, and group B consists of non fish creatures in the water. He started to see the differences between these two groups.

Answer:","completion":"In group B, which consists of non-fish marine creatures, the eggs would most likely develop inside the mother's body. This is because many non-fish marine animals, such as marine mammals (e.g., whales, dolphins, and seals) and reptiles (e.g., sea turtles), give birth to live young. These animals undergo internal fertilization, and their embryos develop within the mother's body until they are ready to be born. However, it is also important to note that there are exceptions within group B, as some non-fish marine animals, like cephalopods (e.g., squid and octopus) and crustaceans (e.g., crabs and lobsters), do lay eggs that develop outside the mother's body.

Worrell works as a maintenance man at Kamp Kikakee but hopes to become a counselor. He quickly becomes a valuable addition to the staff, skilled at Plains Indian Sign Language, used by Kikakee's owner, Chief St. Cloud. A small group of juvenile delinquents, the Second Chancers, come to Kikakee. Head Counselor Tipton assigns Kikakee's most experienced counselor, Ross Stennis, to be the boys' counselor. Stennis is unhappy with this assignment, and he treats the boys harshly. After he goes too far by intentionally causing Moustafa Jones, the smallest boy in the group, to nearly drown in the lake during swimming, only for Moustafa to be rescued by Ernest, the boys retaliate against Stennis's cruelty by toppling his lifeguard perch into the lake, badly injuring Stennis's leg in the process.

Ex-Penn St. assistant Sandusky convicted of abuse BELLEFONTE, Pa. – For years, the children Jerry Sandusky had preyed upon kept quiet about what the former Penn State assistant football coach did to them in echoing shower stalls, empty hotel rooms and the muffled confines of his basement bedroom. Late Friday, after a swift trial and less than two days of deliberations, a jury issued an emphatic verdict: Sandusky was guilty on 45 counts of sexual abuse, meaning the man once considered a successor to coach Joe Paterno will likely die in prison. The verdict is not the end of the scandal that took down beloved football coach Joe Paterno and deeply shook the state's most prominent university. It will play out for years in courtrooms and through a set of ongoing investigations. But the trial did present one piece of finality: Sandusky was taken away in handcuffs to the county jail. Sentencing will be in about three months, but mandatory minimums will keep him behind bars for life. \\"One of the recurring themes in this case was, 'Who would believe a kid?'\\" said Attorney General Linda Kelly. \\"The answer is, we in Bellefonte, Pa., would believe a kid.\\" Sandusky, a retired defensive coach who was once Paterno's heir apparent, showed little emotion as the verdict was read, giving his wife, Dottie, and family members a half-wave as the county sheriff led him away. There were only three acquittals among the charges related to 10 victims, eight of whom took the stand to describe fondling, forced oral sex and anal rape. Many of the accusers testified that they had told no one of the abuse that dated as far back as the mid-1990s — not parents, not girlfriends and not police. The accuser known in court papers as Victim 6, whose mother alerted authorities in 1998 after Sandusky took her son into a shower, broke down in tears upon hearing the verdicts in the courtroom. Afterward, a prosecutor embraced him and said, \\"Did I ever lie to you?\\" The man, now 25, testified that Sandusky called himself the \\"tickle monster\\" in a shower assault. He declined to comment to a reporter afterward. His mother said: \\"Nobody wins. We've all lost.\\" One of the three counts for which Sandusky was acquitted concerned Victim 6, an indecent assault charge. The man testified that Sandusky had given him a bear hug in the shower but at one point he just \\"blacked out.\\" The other acquittals were an indecent assault charge related to Victim 5, who said Sandusky fondled him in the shower, and an involuntary deviate sexual intercourse charge regarding Victim 2, the boy graduate assistant Mike McQueary saw being attacked in a campus shower. Almost immediately after the judge adjourned, loud cheers could be heard from a couple hundred people gathered outside the courthouse as word quickly spread that Sandusky had been convicted. The crowd included victim advocates and local residents with their kids. Many held up their smartphones to take pictures as people filtered out of the building. As Sandusky was placed in the cruiser to be taken to jail, someone yelled at him to \\"Rot in hell!\\" Others hurled insults and he shook his head no in response. Defense attorney Joe Amendola was interrupted by cheers from the crowd on the courthouse steps when he said, \\"The sentence that Jerry will receive will be a life sentence.\\" In addition to the eight who testified, there were two yet-unidentified victims for which prosecutors relied on testimony from a university janitor and McQueary, whose account of a sexual encounter between Sandusky and a boy of about 10 years old ultimately led to the Paterno's dismissal and the university president's ouster. Sandusky did not take the stand in his own defense. After the verdict was announced, defense attorney Karl Rominger said it was \\"a tough case\\" with a lot of charges and that an appeal was certain. He said the defense team \\"didn't exactly have a lot of time to prepare.\\" The ex-coach had repeatedly denied the allegations, and his defense suggested that his accusers had a financial motive to make up stories, years after the fact. His attorneys also painted Sandusky as the victim of overzealous police investigators who coached the alleged victims into giving accusatory statements. One accuser testified that Sandusky molested him in the locker-room showers and in hotels while trying to ensure his silence with gifts and trips to bowl games. He also said Sandusky had sent him \\"creepy love letters.\\" Another spoke of forced oral sex and instances of rape in the basement of Sandusky's home, including abuse that left him bleeding. He said he once tried to scream for help, knowing that Sandusky's wife was upstairs, but figured the basement must be soundproof. Another, a foster child, said Sandusky warned that he would never see his family again if he ever told anyone what happened. And just hours after the case went to jurors, lawyers for one of Sandusky's six children, Matt, said he had told authorities that his father abused him. Matt Sandusky had been prepared to testify on behalf of prosecutors, his lawyers said in a statement. The lawyers said they arranged for Matt Sandusky to meet with law enforcement officials but did not explain why he didn't testify. \\"This has been an extremely painful experience for Matt and he has asked us to convey his request that the media respect his privacy,\\" the statement said. It didn't go into details about his allegations. Defense witnesses, including Dottie Sandusky, described Sandusky's philanthropic work with children over the years, and many spoke in positive terms about his reputation in the community. Prosecutors had portrayed those efforts as an effective means by which Sandusky could camouflage his molestation as he targeted boys who were the same age as participants in The Second Mile, a charity he founded in the 1970s for at-risk youth. Sandusky's arrest in November led the Penn State trustees to fire Paterno as head coach, saying he exhibited a lack of leadership after fielding a report from McQueary. The scandal also led to the ouster of university President Graham Spanier and criminal charges against two university administrators for failing to properly report suspected child abuse and perjury. The two administrators, athletic director Tim Curley and now-retired vice president Gary Schultz, are fighting the allegations and await trial. The family of Paterno, who died exactly five months before Sandusky's conviction, released a statement saying: \\"Although we understand the task of healing is just beginning, today's verdict is an important milestone. The community owes a measure of gratitude to the jurors for their diligent service. Our thoughts and prayers continue to be with the victims and their families.\\" In a statement, Penn State praised the accusers who testified and said that it planned to invite the victims of Sandusky's abuse to participate in a private program to address their concerns and compensate them for claims related to the school. Sandusky had initially faced 52 counts of sex abuse. Prosecutors dropped one count and the judge tossed three others during the trial, on grounds two were unproven, one was brought under a statute that didn't apply and another was duplicative.

By Sara Smyth PUBLISHED: 16:25 EST, 8 August 2013 | UPDATED: 18:03 EST, 8 August 2013 Attacker: Yuri Zarutsky today said he acted alone in the acid attack, which is a contradiction of previous statements The man accused of throwing a jar of sulphuric acid in Sergei Filin's face said he acted alone and top Bolshoi dancer Pavel Dmitrichenko did not pay him to commit the assault. In a reversal of previous statements, Yuri Zarutsky, who was alleged to be the hired 'hitman' who became involved in the attack on Mr Dmitrichenko's behalf, said he initiated the attack independently. He argued he expected Mr Zarutsky to beat Mr","completion":"Filin up, instead of using acid. \\"I took the decision [to use acid] on my own, without consulting anyone,\\" Zarutsky said in an interview with the Russian news website Life News. \\"I thought it would be a suitable punishment for everything that Filin had done to others, especially to the dancers in the theatre.\\" This new revelation has left investigators puzzled, as it directly contradicts earlier reports that top Bolshoi dancer Pavel Dmitrichenko had masterminded the assault in an attempt to exact revenge on Sergei Filin, the theatre's artistic director, for alleged professional slights. Zarutsky's confession, if true, would exonerate Dmitrichenko, who was previously implicated as the organizer of the attack. Dmitrichenko was arrested in March, alongside Zarutsky and an alleged getaway driver, for what was initially believed to be a retaliatory move against Filin for not promoting Dmitrichenko's partner within the Bolshoi Theatre. Filin suffered severe burns to his face and was left almost blind after the gruesome attack in January 2013 in Moscow. Despite numerous surgeries and extensive rehabilitation, the artistic director has been left with permanent damage to his eyesight. The acid attack scandal left not only the victim, but also the entire Bolshoi Theatre community, in shock, as it exposed the underlying tensions and rivalries within one of Russia's most prestigious cultural institutions. With Zarutsky now claiming sole responsibility for the attack, the question remains whether he is telling the truth, or if he is attempting to protect Dmitrichenko from potential legal consequences. As the investigation continues, authorities will have to assess the credibility of Zarutsky's statement and determine if his account of events aligns with the evidence gathered. Regardless of the outcome, this twist in the case is likely to have a lasting impact on the reputation and internal dynamics of the Bolshoi Theatre."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Richard was born on 2 October 1452 at Fotheringhay Castle, the twelfth of thirteen children of Richard Plantagenet, 3rd Duke of York and Cecily Neville at the beginning of what has traditionally been labelled the \\"Wars of the Roses\\", a period of \\"three or four decades of political instability and periodic open civil war in the second half of the fifteenth century\\", between supporters of Richard's father (a potential claimant to the throne of King Henry VI from birth)--\\"Yorkists\\"--in opposition to the regime of Henry VI and his wife, Margaret of Anjou, and those loyal to the crown (\\"Lancastrians\\"). When his father and the Nevilles were forced to flee to Ludlow in 1459, Richard and his older brother, George (later Duke of Clarence), were placed in the custody of the Duchess of Buckingham, and the Archbishop of Canterbury. When his father and elder brother Edmund, Earl of Rutland, were killed at the Battle of Wakefield on 30 December 1460, Richard, who was eight years old, and George were sent by his mother, the Duchess of York, to the Low Countries. They returned to England following the defeat of the Lancastrians at the Battle of Towton and participated in the coronation of Richard's eldest brother as King Edward IV in June 1461. In 1485, following his death in battle against Henry Tudor at Bosworth Field, Richard III's body was buried in Greyfriars Church in Leicester. Following the discoveries of Richard's remains in 2012, it was decided that they should be reburied at Leicester Cathedral, despite feelings in some quarters that he should have been reburied in York Minster. His remains were carried in procession to the cathedral on 22 March 2015, and reburied on 26 March 2015 at a religious re-burial service at which both the Right Reverend Tim Stevens, the Bishop of Leicester, and the Most Reverend Justin Welby, the Archbishop of Canterbury, officiated. The British Royal Family was represented by the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester and the Countess of Wessex. The actor Benedict Cumberbatch, who is a distant relation of the king and later portrayed him in The Hollow Crown television series, read a poem by Poet Laureate Carol Ann Duffy. His cathedral tomb was designed by the architects van Heyningen and Haward. The tombstone is deeply incised with a cross, and consists of a rectangular block of white Swaledale fossil stone, quarried in North Yorkshire. It sits on a low plinth made of dark Kilkenny marble, incised with Richard's name, dates and motto (Loyaulte me lie - loyalty binds me). The plinth also carries his coat of arms in pietra dura. The remains of Richard III are in a lead-lined coffin, inside an outer English oak coffin crafted by Michael Ibsen, a direct descendant of Richard's sister Anne of York, and laid in a brick-lined vault below the floor, and below the plinth and tombstone. The original 2010 raised tomb design had been proposed by Langley\`s \\"Looking For Richard Project\\" and fully funded by members of the Richard III Society. The proposal was publicly launched by the Society on 13 February 2013 but rejected by Leicester Cathedral in favour of a memorial slab. However, following a public outcry, the Cathedral changed its position and on 18 July 2013 announced its agreement to give King Richard III a raised tomb monument.

Given the question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person that worked at the Salzburg Festival? ? Sir Georg Solti, (born György Stern; 21 October 1912 – 5 September 1997) was a Hungarian-born orchestral and operatic conductor, best known for his appearances with opera companies in Munich, Frankfurt and London, and as a long-serving music director of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. Born in Budapest, he studied there with Béla Bartók, Leó Weiner and Ernő Dohnányi. In the 1930s, he was a répétiteur at the Hungarian State Opera and worked at the Salzburg Festival for Arturo Toscanini. His career was interrupted by the rise of the Nazis' influence on Hungarian politics, and being of Jewish background he fled the increasingly harsh Hungarian anti-Jewish laws in 1938. After conducting a season of Russian ballet in London at the Royal Opera House he found refuge in Switzerland, where he remained during the Second World War. Prohibited from conducting there, he earned a living as a pianist. After the war, Solti was appointed musical director of the Bavarian State Opera in Munich in 1946. In 1952 he moved to the Oper Frankfurt, where he remained in charge for nine years. He took West German citizenship in 1953. In 1961 he became musical director of the Covent Garden Opera Company, London. During his ten-year tenure, he introduced changes that raised standards to the highest international levels. Under his musical directorship the status of the company was recognised with the grant of the title \\"the Royal Opera\\". He became a British citizen in 1972.

Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: Was Origin published sooner in Swedish or Italian? Context: The book was widely translated in Darwin's lifetime, but problems arose with translating concepts and metaphors, and some translations were biased by the translator's own agenda. Darwin distributed presentation copies in France and Germany, hoping that suitable applicants would come forward, as translators were expected to make their own arrangements with a local publisher. He welcomed the distinguished elderly naturalist and geologist Heinrich Georg Bronn, but the German translation published in 1860 imposed Bronn's own ideas, adding controversial themes that Darwin had deliberately omitted. Bronn translated \\"favoured races\\" as \\"perfected races\\", and added essays on issues including the origin of life, as well as a final chapter on religious implications partly inspired by Bronn's adherence to Naturphilosophie. In 1862, Bronn produced a second edition based on the third English edition and Darwin's suggested additions, but then died of a heart attack. Darwin corresponded closely with Julius Victor Carus, who published an improved translation in 1867. Darwin's attempts to find a translator in France fell through, and the translation by Clémence Royer published in 1862 added an introduction praising Darwin's ideas as an alternative to religious revelation and promoting ideas anticipating social Darwinism and eugenics, as well as numerous explanatory notes giving her own answers to doubts that Darwin expressed. Darwin corresponded with Royer about a second edition published in 1866 and a third in 1870, but he had difficulty getting her to remove her notes and was troubled by these editions. He remained unsatisfied until a translation by Edmond Barbier was published in 1876. A Dutch translation by Tiberius Cornelis Winkler was published in 1860. By 1864, additional translations had appeared in Italian and Russian. In Darwin's lifetime, Origin was published in Swedish in 1871, Danish in 1872, Polish in 1873, Hungarian in 1873–1874, Spanish in 1877 and Serbian in 1878.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize the following: To start making a rectangular shaped mold, first gather your materials. You should be able to find the materials for this mold at most craft stores. For this mold, you'll need the following: Two pieces of 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) thick craft wood, cut into 12\\" by 4\\" length Two pieces of 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) thick craft wood, cut into 3 1/2″ x 4″ length One piece of 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) thick craft wood, cut into 3 1/2″ x 11″ length Wood clamps Wood glue You may not find craft wood cut into the exact dimensions you need. You should be able to ask someone at the store to trim the wood down for you. If this option is not available, you can cut most craft wood on your own with a small handsaw. Measure the wood using a ruler or measuring tape. Draw a line marking the dimensions with a pen or pencil. Use your handsaw to gently saw along that line. If the sides are rough, use sandpaper to smooth them down. Sand paper is rated by grit number. The higher the grit number, the stronger the sandpaper. As craft glue is fairly soft, you do not need a high grit sandpaper for your soap mold. Stick to grit levels below 100, as anything above a 100-level grit is best used on large furniture. Once your wood is cut into the proper dimensions, you can begin assembling your mold. To start, assemble the sides of the wood to form a rectangle. The 12\\" by 4\\" boards make up the longer sides of the rectangle. The 3 1/2\\" by 4\\" sides make up the shorter sides. The shorter sides will fit inside the longer sides. Take the 12\\" by 4\\" boards. Place a line of wood glue along each 4\\" side. Then, place the 3 1/2\\" by 4\\" sides between the 12\\" by 4\\" boards, creating a rectangle-shape with your boards. Use the wood clamps to secure while the wood is drying. Once the glue is dry to the touch, and the rectangle feels secure without the wood clamps, you can add the bottom board. The 3 1/2″ x 11″ board fits inside the rectangle. Run some wood glue along each side of the bottom board and then place it inside the rectangle. Use wood clamps to secure the board in place. If your board feels flimsy, use a cordless screwdriver to place four screws into the board where the sides connect. This will further secure the board, as wood glue may loose strength over time. Once you've assembled your board, set is aside and let it dry. To be 100% sure everything is dry, it's best to set your board aside overnight before use. Once you're done creating your board, you can use it to make soap. Make sure to line your board first, as liquid soap will stick to wood. You can use parchment paper or trash bags to line your board. It can take soap anywhere from a few hours to a few days to set. It depends on the soap recipe you're using. Once the soap is set, simply remove it from the board. Set it aside for 3 to 4 weeks to allow it to dry completely. In the event your box leaks, examine the area where the leak is occurring. You can seal this area up with masking tape, duct table, or extra wood glue. Also, you can deal with leaks by lining the box with parchment paper before use.","completion":"Creating a rectangular shaped mold requires several pieces of half-inch craft wood, wood clamps, and wood glue. These materials should be readily available at most craft stores. Begin with acquiring the craft wood. You'll need two pieces that are 12 inches by 4 inches, two pieces that are 3 1/2 inches by 4 inches, and one piece that is 3 1/2 inches by 11 inches. If these exact dimensions aren't available, the wood pieces could potentially be trimmed at the store or manually with a small handsaw at home. The steps for manual cutting involve measuring and marking the desired dimensions on the wood, using a handsaw to make a cut along the marked line, and smoothing any rough sides with sandpaper, preferably with a grit of less than 100. Once your wood pieces are ready, you can then assemble your mold. The 12 by 4-inch boards will be the longer sides of your rectangle, while the 3 1/2 by 4-inch sides will form the shorter sides fitting inside the longer ones. Adhere the boards together using wood glue, placing the shorter sides between the longer ones to create a rectangle. Secure this arrangement with wood clamps until the glue dries enough for the structure to hold together without them. After the sides are secure, it's time to attach the bottom board. This is your 3.5 inch by 11-inch piece, which should fit inside the rectangle. Apply wood glue to each side of this board and fit it into the rectangle. Secure it with wood clamps. To enhance the stability of this board, you can use a cordless screwdriver to add four screws into the board where the sides connect. Leave the whole structure to dry, ideally overnight. Once complete, your mold is ready to be used for soap making. Before pouring soap into it, line it to prevent the soap mixture from sticking to the wood: parchment paper or trash bags work well for that. The drying time for the soap varies, depending on the particular soap recipe and can take from a few hours to days until it is set. When it's fully hardened, remove the soap from the mold and let it dry completely for an additional 3 to 4 weeks. In case your mold experiences leaks, inspect the area where the leak happened. You can resolve this issue either by sealing that area with masking tape, duct tape, or extra wood glue, or by lining the box with parchment paper prior to use."},{"prompt":"Where could you see someone pretending to be an action figure but not trying to sell action figures?

The day after unveiling their new bill to replace Obamacare, the Republican authors of the Affordable Health Care Act find themselves in a bind. Even if the new bill has the votes in the House, it will also have to pass the Senate. Because this legislation is moving forward through the budget reconciliation process, which only requires 51 votes, the 52 Republicans in the Senate can only afford two defections and still pass the bill (assuming Vice President Mike Pence would break a tie in their favor). A third defection would doom the Obamacare replacement package. And, already, four Senate Republicans have already criticized Speaker Paul Ryan’s first proposal, saying it doesn’t do enough to protect Medicaid beneficiaries. That group consists of Rob Portman (R-OH), Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), Sen. Cory Gardner (R-CO) and Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK). Assuming Democrats stick together in opposition, that moderate bloc of Republicans could torpedo the bill on their own. But appeasing moderates could carry risk for Republican leadership as well: Conservative senators could defect in protest of a bill they think is too far to the left. The most conservative senators are already blasting the first draft as not doing nearly enough to slow entitlement spending, with Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX), Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY), and Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) echoing the arch-conservatives in the House Freedom Caucus who say that the bill amounts to “Obamacare-lite” and leaves too much of Obama’s law intact, including the expansion to Medicaid in place until 2020 and the “Cadillac tax” on health care plans for those with high incomes. National Review’s John Fund points out the difficult spot that Republican leadership is in on Twitter: Biggest obstacle to House health bill: 7 GOP senators on fence - 4 who said didn’t adequately protect Medicaid, 3 who say bill too generous — John Fund (@johnfund) March 7, 2017 If anything, Fund’s tweet undersells the challenge leading Republicans face in building the coalition to get to the 51 votes they’ll need at a minimum to get Trumpcare through reconciliation. It’s not just the fight over Medicaid. Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-LA), for instance, has said that the bill has to cover the same number of people as Obamacare. Sen. Bob Corker (R-TN) wants it to be neutral, meaning it doesn’t add to the deficit. \\"I'm going to be very anxious to hear how we'll get to 51 votes and [how] the House gets to 218,\\" said Sen. Roy Blunt (R-MO). The Congressional Budget Office hasn’t yet estimated how many people the bill will cover or how much it will cost, key to Cassidy and Corker’s support. But the challenge is obvious from a mile away. Meanwhile, Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME) and Sen. Murkowski say the House health bill should be stripped of its provisions to defund Planned Parenthood. “If you go too far and have too many drastic cuts, you lose the moderate four,” says Josh Huder, a congressional scholar at the Government Affairs Institute at Georgetown University, citing Portman, Caputo, Gardner, and Murkowski. “And if you don’t go far enough, you lose the conservatives.” Republicans need both to get to 51 votes. It’s perfectly possible either or both factions of Republicans are bluffing, simply hoping to pull the negotiations as far to their side as possible. “There's a high probability of that,” Huder says. That’s what happened during the debate over Obamacare. In 2010, it looked like then-Majority Leader Harry Reid didn’t have the votes for the Affordable Care Act. Two versions of the bill were shot down after passing separate committees, Democrats like Joe Lieberman threatened to withhold support, and the future of health care reform seemed to be in danger. Then the bill was reworked — and Reid had the votes. “All of a sudden, Harry Reid dropped a bill on the Senate floor that found the right mixture of people, and then the House swallowed the pill,” Huder says. “It looked like Obamacare was dead in the water — and then all of a sudden it sprang back to life.” But even if some Republicans are bluffing because they hope to influence what the final bill looks like, the balancing act between conservatives and moderates is a real challenge. “It’s going to be really, really hard for them to do this,” Huder says. “It’s the key question: Can they find a way to thread the needle here between the moderates and the conservatives in the Senate? There’s no way forward if not.” Tara Golshan contributed reporting. ||||| White House press secretary Sean Spicer said that what the House GOP released last night is the Obamacare repeal that everyone’s been waiting for.

(March 7) AP Do we stay with Obamacare and the unsustainable status quo, or do we repeal it and replace it with something better? House Speaker Paul Ryan (Photo: J. Scott Applewhite, AP) When I took the speaker’s gavel, I told my colleagues that it’s no longer good enough to just say what we’re against. We had to show what we’re for. That’s why last year we released a complete policy agenda — tracking closely with ideas from our presidential nominee, Donald Trump — to tackle all of the big challenges facing this country. The truth is, we have solutions to all of the many problems that Barack Obama left behind. And there is no more urgent problem than Obamacare. The collapsing law is driving up health care costs and driving out choices for American families. This year alone, premiums have gone up by double digits in 31 states. Choices have dwindled to the point that one out of every three counties in America has just one insurer to choose from. Not too long ago, Bill Clinton called Obamacare “the craziest thing in the world.” He is on to something there. That’s why we must end this law — repealing it once and for all. But rather than going back to the way things were, we must move to a better system that embraces competition and choice and actually lowers costs for patients and taxpayers. Introduced this week, the American Health Care Act keeps our promise to repeal and replace Obamacare. I hope you will read the bill online at readthebill.gop. Our goal is to give every American access to quality, affordable health care. For families, that means lower costs, more choices and greater control. Let me walk you through how our plan will help get us there. For starters, our bill repeals Obamacare. We cannot rebuild the American health care system on such a flawed foundation, and that’s why we eliminate Obamacare’s taxes, mandates and spending. Next, and this is important, our plan ensures there will be a stable transition. As we move from a Washington-driven system to a more vibrant market, we will make sure no one has the rug pulled out from under them. This also means we will ensure vital protections for patients with pre-existing conditions and allow young adults to stay on their parents’ plan. We will also give states more funding and flexibility to support high-risk pools and reinsurance programs. Where Obamacare was built on mandates and coercion that make coverage more expensive, our plan takes care of those in need without driving up costs for everyone else. Next, while Obamacare just added people to a broken Medicaid system, we will strengthen Medicaid so that states have the tools they need to take care of their poor and most vulnerable populations at a lower cost. Our plan represents the most significant entitlement reform in more than 50 years. Republicans have long said that we have to empower patients as consumers to spur competition and bring down costs. That’s why we will also nearly double the amount of money you can contribute to health savings accounts to pay for out-of-pocket expenses. This will end Obamacare’s limits on how you save and spend your health care dollars. POLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media Ultimately, we need a real marketplace for health insurance. Currently, the tax code discriminates against those who don't get coverage through their employer. To level the playing field, our plan offers an advanceable, refundable tax credit to those who don’t get insurance from work or a government program. Instead of mandates forcing you to buy what the government wants, you will have real choices. Available to those under a certain income level, this tax credit will be age-based and portable so that you can take it with you from job to job. And to help more people buy the kind of plan that fits their needs, we will get rid of costly insurance mandates and regulations. In the weeks ahead, the House will consider this plan through an open and transparent process, including legislation to allow people to purchase health care across state lines. As we do, I encourage you to read the bill so you can see the changes we are proposing. Here is the choice we face: Do we stay with Obamacare and the unsustainable status quo, or do we repeal it and replace it with something better? The American Health Care Act offers a better way. It keeps our promise, begins to clean up the mess Obamacare has made, and builds a better system for all Americans. Now we must deliver. Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., is speaker of the House of Representatives.

House Speaker Paul Ryan has long been the darling of conservative policy wonks. But on one of the biggest days of his political career, when House Republicans released their much-anticipated Obamacare replacement, many of Ryan's closest friends in the conservative intelligentsia expressed disappointment — if not outright dismay — with the legislation bearing the speaker's imprimatur. Indeed, virtually every prominent conservative health care expert — precisely the sort of ideological allies who have backed Ryan in the past — panned this legislation. Story Continued Below The Cato Institute’s Michael Cannon called it “a train wreck waiting to happen.” The American Enterprise Institute’s Jim Capretta told POLITICO the GOP’s decision to do away with a cap on tax credits for employer-based health insurance reflected a reluctance to “deal with reality.” Forbes’ Avik Roy, widely considered one of the pre-eminent health care policy experts on the right, predicted the legislation would make insurance unaffordable for millions of the nation’s poor and offered an analysis with subsections titled, “The Good,” “The Bad” and “The Terrible.” The Wall Street Journal editorial board was the lone dissenter, calling the bill \\"the most consequential GOP social-policy reform since the welfare overhaul of 1996.\\" “It is remarkable that they’ve produced a bill that is so out of touch with ACA opponents,” Cannon said. “The first rule in these situations is you want to dance with the gal that brung ya. You don’t want to walk away from your base.” Paul Ryan's spokesperson, AshLee Strong, took issue with that characterization. \\"The bill is a compilation of reforms conservatives have fought for over many years including Medicaid block grants, HSA expansion, equalized tax treatment for health benefits, and repeal of Obamacare to the full extent reconciliation allows,\\" she said. Conservatives have never seen eye to eye on just how to go about repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act, and, over time, right-leaning Obamacare critics have fallen into two camps: those who favor scrapping Obamacare without providing alternative coverage for its beneficiaries and those who favor replacing Obamacare’s subsidies with a tax credit, either flat or adjusted for the wealth and income of beneficiaries. The origins of the current debate stretch back to June 2016, when Ryan rolled out his own health care plan as part of a broader policy vision he dubbed “A Better Way.” The plan itself was the result of dozens of conversations with conservative think tankers over the years, and in it, Ryan planted his stake firmly in the camp of those who support replacing the current subsidies with a flat tax credit. But the Republican-controlled House never voted on the plan and the tensions and disagreements that would normally have surrounded it receded into the background in the midst of the election season. “There was never a vote or a poll taken on it,” Roy said. In Congress, “people just kind of kept their mouths shut, they didn’t complain about it and didn’t endorse it, they just kind of left it alone.” Though Ryan's plan sprang from conservative circles — and served as a framework for the current bill — the legislation unveiled on Monday night includes many compromises Ryan's blueprint did not. As a result, the current GOP bill has managed to rile all three major conservative camps. And a debate that as recently as a year ago was taking place in think tank board rooms and congressional offices is now unfolding on the national stage. House and Senate leaders seemed tacitly to acknowledge the precarious position they’re in, vowing to push forward as quickly as possible, without a debate in Congress and despite the fact that the Congressional Budget Office hasn't given the bill an official price tag. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Tuesday promised a vote on a health care bill by the end of April. Though few conservative policy wonks harbored the illusion that an Obamacare replacement would not reflect some painful bargaining, they are by and large surprised to see the initial volley riddled with so many compromises, leaving one prominent conservative to lament: “This bill has no friends.” Perhaps the biggest flash point in the legislation is the 30 percent surcharge on those who allow their insurance coverage to lapse, which has led experts to warn the bill will entrench and exacerbate problems introduced by Obamacare. Roy speculated that origins of the provision lie in reports from several insurance companies, on earnings calls and elsewhere, that those who enroll in Obamacare exchanges outside the regular enrollment period are on average 30 percent costlier to ensure.

Cannon predicted Republican House members would be “hammered” by their constituents who see their health care deteriorate. “I think if they actually enacted the House bill, they would create a mess in 2017, 2018 and 2019,” Capretta said. He demurred, though, when asked about the chances that the legislation would make it to the president’s desk. “Normally, leaders of Congress don’t proceed unless they think they have a pretty good chance of success,” he said. “It looks daunting to me but, you know …” ||||| Myth #1: This Amendment does not cover pre-existing conditions. FACT: The MacArthur Amendment explicitly maintains protections for pre-existing conditions. NO STATE, under ANY circumstances, may ever obtain a waiver for guaranteed issue of coverage, guaranteed renewability of coverage, or the prohibition on denying coverage due to pre-existing conditions. The amendment specifically clarifies that its provisions cannot be construed as allowing insurers to limit coverage for those with pre-existing conditions. All of these protections will remain the law. Myth #2: This Amendment will price those with pre-existing conditions out of the market, making health care unaffordable for them. FACT: The amendment’s limited waiver for health rating requires states to set up a program for high-risk individuals or premium stabilization, or to participate in the federal invisible risk sharing program. No state may obtain a waiver for health status unless it has taken these efforts to protect those who might be affected. In states with a waiver, individuals who maintain continuous coverage could not be rated based on health status. Myth #3: High-risk pools have traditionally been underfunded by states and the federal government, resulting in poor coverage and high costs for those who need insurance the most. FACT: The AHCA sets aside 100 billion over ten years to help states with high-risk pools and other innovations. It sets aside an additional 15 billion specifically for maternity care, mental health care, and substance abuse treatment. And it sets aside an ADDITIONAL 15 billion for a federal invisible risk-sharing program -- another innovative way to help people access affordable coverage. Myth #4: Under this amendment, States do not have to cover essential health benefits. FACT: This amendment ensures essential health benefits are the federal law of the land and maintains other important protections. States have the option to obtain a waiver regarding federal essential health benefits, but the state must publicly attest its purpose for doing so (to reduce the cost of health care coverage, increase the number of people with health care coverage, etc.) and it must specify the benefits it will require instead of the federal standard. NO STATE, under ANY circumstances, may ever obtain a waiver for pre-existing condition protection, prohibition on gender discrimination, for guaranteed issue and renewability, or for the right of dependents to stay on a family plan up to age 26. Myth #5: 129 Million Americans have pre-existing conditions and could be denied coverage. FACT: This legislation addresses the 7% of Americans on the individual market, and those in the small group market. Anyone with employer-provided coverage or government coverage (Medicare, Medicaid, Tricare, VA benefits, etc.) would not be affected. Again, this amendment would not allow any state to deny coverage to those with pre-existing conditions, and would require the extensive protections described above for those with riskier health profiles. It is also worth noting that many states required insurers to offer coverage to those with pre-existing conditions before Obamacare was implemented. ||||| Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump warned House Republicans Tuesday if they can't pass health care legislation after seven years of promises it could be a \\"bloodbath\\" in the 2018 midterm election, according to one member present in the meeting. Trump vowed to throw his full support behind the effort to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act during a meeting with House GOP leadership, saying he is \\"proud\\" to support a GOP-authored plan to replace Obamacare and told members behind closed doors that he would support it \\"100%,\\" according to sources in the room. But he warned lawmakers of the high-stakes nature of the effort, citing a potential electoral \\"bloodbath,\\" a member present said. \\"He said he hopes members understand that,\\" the source said. Despite early opposition from conservative groups and some members of Congress, there was a lot of optimism among the House leadership members charged with passing the legislation that members would come around. Trump promised House Republicans in the meeting he would use the power of the bully pulpit -- calling and meeting with members -- to get conservatives and moderates in line and pass the bill. \\"I'm proud to support the replacement plan released by the House of Representatives and encouraged by members of both parties,\\" Trump said during brief remarks captured by the press pool. Republicans first unveiled their legislation, which would eliminate the individual mandate to obtain health insurance contained in Obamacare and include tax incentives meant to encourage Americans to purchase coverage, Monday night. The gathered lawmakers told the President they faced obstacles ahead without any expectation of Democratic support for their plan, nor any idea of where some conservatives might land. The House GOP vote-counters told Trump they planned to move forward with a whip count later this week \\"We don't have it today, but I think we'll get it,\\" a source in the room told CNN. Trump's remarks during the roughly 30-minute meeting with members in the East Room of the White House reflected the most explicit administration endorsement yet of the replacement health care plan. \\"I cannot comment on the discussions in closed door meetings,\\" said Lindsay Walters, a White House spokeswoman, when asked about Trump's comments about the political pitfalls of failing to pass a replacement plan. Trump had not yet weighed in overtly on the Republican plan until Tuesday afternoon. Earlier, he tweeted support for the bill but also suggested there were elements of the measure that could be changed. JUST WATCHED Spicer compares healthcare bills by size Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Spicer compares healthcare bills by size 01:23 \\"Our wonderful new Healthcare Bill is now out for review and negotiation,\\" he wrote Tuesday morning. Sources in the room told CNN that Trump did not explicitly call out any member or group opposed to the bill, but did emphasize the importance of getting the job done and working together to do it. \\"We cannot toss this out and start all over. We are too far down the road for that,\\" the source said. The whip strategy going forward appears to be to remind members again and again that voting against the House's bill is the same as voting against their President, and handing a victory to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi. The strategy is to remind members there is no second chance to get this right. Vice President Mike Pence also joined the meeting and was feeling hopeful about the legislation's prospects in the Senate, sources said, despite the fact that two senators have already come out with deep concerns about the House legislation. While Trump said he was committed to the bill, he did indicate he was open to making changes. Sources in the room, however, said that the changes would have to win broad support and be passed through the amendment process, making it difficult to amend the contours of the legislation in any meaningful way. \\"This is a guy who knows how to close a deal, and he thinks we are at the point were we need to close,\\" the source said. Trump took to Twitter Tuesday evening to reach out to one of the bill's most vocal conservative opponents. \\"I feel sure that my friend @RandPaul will come along with the new and great health care program because he knows Obamacare is a disaster!\\" Trump tweeted, just as an interview with Sen. Rand Paul was about to air on CNN's Erin Burnett \\"OutFront.\\" I feel sure that my friend @RandPaul will come along with the new and great health care program because he knows Obamacare is a disaster! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 8, 2017 In that interview taped prior to Trump's tweet, the Kentucky Senator said he met with Trump and didn't believe the two were \\"that far off\\" from each other on how to proceed. Paul said they both want to repeal Obamacare, and the disagreement came over how exactly to replace it -- and whether or not that replacement should be combined with the repeal in one bill. \\"I did express with the President that I think separating repeal from replacement will get it done, and I think that's maybe the only vehicle for getting that done,\\" Paul said. ||||| Photo: Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images Following the unveiling of the House Republican plan to shrink Obamacare dramatically, two surprising things happened. The first is that the conservative-movement apparatus has lined up rapidly against the bill. The major right-wing pressure groups — Freedom­Works, the Club for Growth, Americans for Prosperity, and Heritage Action for America — all announced opposition, and were quickly echoed by the most right-wing members of Congress, like House Freedom Caucus chair Jim Jordan and Senator Rand Paul. The second surprising thing is that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced his intention to jam the House bill through the Senate quickly. Rather than develop its own bills through committees and the normal debate process, McConnell declared he plans to bring it directly to the Senate floor. Neither of these decisions makes a great deal of sense on their own, and they make even less sense in conjunction with each other. The grounds for the right’s opposition is that the House bill would replace Obamacare with a “new entitlement,” albeit one funded almost entirely through cuts to an old entitlement (Medicaid) and which would provide such meager benefits as to be useless to large numbers of its purported beneficiaries. What makes this revolt so confounding to the party leadership is that the House bill, while too liberal for the party’s right flank, is also almost certainly too conservative to pass the Senate. Senators Lisa Murkowski, Cory Gardner, Rob Portman, and Shelly Moore Capito signed a letter yesterday opposing the bill’s repeal of the Medicaid expansion. A fifth, Dean Heller, has raised concerns about protecting Medicaid. Susan Collins and Bill Cassidy have proposed a much more moderate replacement bill, which has also been co-sponsored by Capito and Johnny Isakson. Additionally, Lamar Alexander, Jeff Flake, and Lindsey Graham have urged caution and deliberation — all of which run counter to the leadership’s strategy of ramming a bill through as quickly as possible in order to enable the passage of a big tax cut later in the year. That makes 11 Republican senators who have, in some form or fashion, expressed reservations about the party leadership’s preferred health care strategy. Even assuming the three senators who object to the law from the right — Ted Cruz, Rand Paul, and Mike Lee — can be corralled, Trumpcare seems to be very far from corralling the necessary 50 Senate votes. And this is before the Congressional Budget Office produces its score, which will probably show millions and millions of people losing coverage, and may possibly also show the deficit blowing up. While McConnell’s plan might be necessary in order to keep the party’s legislative strategy on track, it is highly and even delusionally optimistic, given the state of his vote count. It also runs counter to the Senate’s institutional culture. Senators cherish their power to shape and control legislation. A strategy of photocopying the House bill and ramming it through seems almost designed to violate the Senatorial ego. This raises a question: Is it designed to violate the Senatorial ego? And thus to fail? Neither the conservative revolt nor McConnell’s plan make a lot of sense if you view them as strategies designed to yield the most right-wing health-care policy that is attainable. They do make sense as a strategy designed to insulate Republicans from failure. Republicans have made two promises that can’t be reconciled. They promised to repeal Obamacare, and to replace it with a terrific law that would take care of everybody. As the House Republican ad put it, they promised, “more choices and better care, at lower costs. … peace of mind to people with preexisting conditions … without disrupting existing coverage.” Those things cannot be reconciled. If Republicans repeal Obamacare, they will put in place something that not only fails to provide the better, cheaper care they have promised the country, but does not meet even the minimal threshold of access to basic care for people who currently receive it. From that standpoint, the winning play for the GOP might be to try to repeal and replace Obamacare but fail. If they are seen trying and failing to repeal the law, it might upset the base, but most Republican lawmakers will have their opposition to Obamacare on the record. And if it is to fail, it should fail quickly, so they can move on to cutting taxes. This may all be wrong. It is never safe to assume rational thought on the part of public actors, especially in the reality-distortion field of Trump’s Washington. Maybe ultra-conservatives think they are using their leverage to push the bill to the right. Or maybe McConnell believes he can whip his caucus into line. Whatever the explanation, the strategy behind the bill is almost as incompetent as the bill itself. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","completion":"Republicans are divided over the newly proposed Affordable Health Care Act, which aims to replace the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare. Conservative Republican senators Ted Cruz, Rand Paul, and Mike Lee argue that the new bill is too far to the left, while moderate Republicans argue that it doesn't provide enough protection for Medicaid beneficiaries. To pass the Senate, at least 51 votes are required, and the current divide could potentially make this very difficult."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Please answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What were two rooms the Great Dining room was transformed to? ? The final large reception room on the first floor is the Hondecoeter Room (16), so named because of the three huge oil paintings by Melchior d'Hondecoeter (1636–1695), depicting scenes of birds in courtyards, which are fitted into the neo-Carolean panelling. The panelling was introduced to the room by the 3rd Earl Brownlow in 1876, when it was furnished as the principal dining room of the mansion. The room was initially created as a library in 1808 from the upper part of the earlier kitchen which had originally risen two stories. The West staircase (14) was originally a service stairs, and would have been plainer in decor, but by the late nineteenth century it was in regular use by the family.Either side of the Marble Hall, lie the Great Staircase (2) and the Tapestry Room (11), which contains a collection of early eighteenth century Mortlake tapestries. The Great Staircase to the east of the Marble Hall is unusually placed at Belton, as in a house of this period one would expect to find the staircase in the hall. The stairs rise in three flights around the west, north, and east walls to the former Great Dining Room above the Marble Hall. Thus the staircase served as an important state procession link between the three principal reception rooms of the house. The Great Dining Room, now the Library, has been greatly altered and all traces of Carolean decoration removed, first by James Wyatt in 1778 when it was transformed into a drawing room with a vaulted ceiling, and again in 1876, when its use was again changed, this time to a library. The room contains some 6000 volumes, a superb example of book collecting over 350 years. When Lord Tyrconnel died in 1754 a catalogue of his library identified almost 2,300 books. Almost all of these remain in the Belton library today. Rupert Gunnis attributed the carved marble chimneypiece depicting two Roman goddesses to Sir Richard Westmacott.Leading from the Library is the Queen's Room, the former \\"Best Bed Chamber\\".

Can a photo competition change the world? Probably not, but when paired with the brainpower of IBM and the problem-solving capabilities of the world's most advanced artificially intelligent computer systems, it might just stand a chance. Last November, IBM opened its 12th global research lab -- and first on the African continent -- in Nairobi, Kenya. Though the lab employs 25 PhDs from the world's best universities, as well as Watson -- the AI supercomputer that won Jeopardy against human competitors in 2011 -- the company recognized that in order to truly shape innovation in the continent, it had to first hear from the people who live there. \\"If we're going to solve the grand challenges of Africa it has to start here in Africa with us identifying and underscoring what they are,\\" says Erik Hersman, founder of Nairobi's iHub tech hub and CEO of BRCK, and one of the four photo contest judges. To better understand what areas to invest in, IBM launched its The World is Our Lab photo competition, which invited anyone with a camera (or mobile phone) to contribute images that highlight the continent's grand challenges, city systems and examples of innovation. After three months (and 1,200 submissions), they chose a winner in each of those three categories. The competition even succeeded in offering the judges a few surprises. \\"I saw places in Nigeria I didn't even imagine existed,\\" says Kenyan Mutua Matheka, official photographer for The World is Our Lab project and another judge in the competition. \\"The winners each shared an Africa that most of us didn't know or didn't have access to.\\" Kenyan TV producer Frank Odwesso won in the City System category with his image of a woman on the back of a \\"boda boda,\\" or bicycle taxi. The judges felt the picture demonstrated how locals in Western Kenya and Nyanza circumvent an unreliable public transport system to create a more efficient means of getting around. Mainly, though, it was the strength of the image that they were drawn to. \\"It had the most vibrant colors, and it really summed up Africa to me,\\" admits Matheka. See the best photos from the competition here. Imole \\"Tobbie\\" Balogun won the Grand Challenges category with \\"Baby Sitting,\\" which highlights the very adult responsibilities imposed on many of Nigeria's children -- either because poverty forces them into jumpstarting their working lives, or because they have to assume the role of caretaker for their siblings. Visual artist Lawrence \\"Shabu\\" Mwangi won the Innovation category, and the competition overall, with \\"Digital Migration,\\" a shot he took of children playing with scrap in Nairobi's Mukuru slum. \\"We have these big dumping sites in Mukuru, and though we try to prevent the kids going to them, they find a way and use the scrap to play with,\\" says Mwangi, who also grew up in the area. \\"These kids were playing a role in the television. None of them have a TV at home, but here they had a chance to be reporters -- they could be anything they wanted to be within that television. I just wanted to capture the happiness in that moment,\\" he adds. See more from Inside Africa. The competition is part of IBM's 100 million Project Lucy initiative, which will employ Watson and other cognitive computing technologies to advance development and create business opportunities in Africa over the next 10 years. Matheka, a former architect and one of the continent's most respected photographers, says the competition has also shown him how photography has grown in Africa. \\"I feel like a lot of African photographers have observed how those in Europe and the U.S. have photographed in Africa, and many us still use that as a template of how Africa should be captured. I think we're starting to get out of that now,\\" he says. \\"I think photography is starting to feel more approachable, to include the African public and focus on the textures and people of Africa. We're starting to tell stories for Africans. It's important, because our stories matter, and we need to hear them and to see our heroes so that we can know what is possible.\\" What are highlight points for this article?","completion":"1.

Please tell me if those questions are the same.","completion":"The questions are essentially asking the same thing, but they are phrased differently. Both questions inquire about the effects of demonetizing Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 notes on the real estate industry in India. Here's a step-by-step analysis of the impact: Step 1: Understand the context - In November 2016, the Indian Government announced the demonetization of the existing Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 currency notes to curb black money and counterfeit currency in circulation. Step 2: Evaluate the role of cash in the real estate industry - The Indian real estate sector is traditionally known for having a significant amount of cash-based transactions, with the intention of avoiding taxes or using unaccounted money. Step 3: Assess the immediate impact - The demonetization move led to a liquidity crunch as these Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 notes accounted for around 86% of the currency in circulation at that time. This affected various sectors of the economy, including real estate businesses. Step 4: Analyze the effect on different segments of the real estate market - The luxury and high-end segment, where cash transactions were more prevalent, experienced a significant slowdown. - The affordable housing segment, which is largely driven by home loans and had fewer cash transactions, was less affected. Step 5: Consider the long-term implications - The demonetization drive led to greater transparency and formalization in the real estate sector as more transactions shifted towards digital payments and banking channels. - Property prices stabilized or fell in some markets due to reduced demand and increased accountability. - Increased emphasis on affordable housing and government incentives also helped revive the real estate market in the long run. In summary, the demonetization of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 notes had a significant impact on the Indian real estate industry, particularly in the high-end and luxury segments.

To do this, we can perform the following steps: Step 1: Subtract 54 from both sides of the equation. This reverses the addition of 54 and helps isolate the term with z. 0 - 54 = -18 * z + 54 - 54 -54 = -18 * z Step 2: Divide both sides of the equation by -18. This reverses the multiplication of -18 and helps us solve for z. -54 / -18 = (-18 * z) / -18 3 = z So the solution is z = 3."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Although Bin Laden, Atef, and KSM initially contemplated using established al Qaeda members to execute the planes operation, the late 1999 arrival in Kandahar of four aspiring jihadists from Germany suddenly presented a more attractive alternative. The Hamburg group shared the anti-U.S. fervor of the other candidates for the operation, but added the enormous advantages of fluency in English and familiarity with life in the West, based on years that each member of the group had spent living in Germany. Not surprisingly, Mohamed Atta, Ramzi Binalshibh, Marwan al Shehhi, and Ziad Jarrah would all become key players in the 9/11 conspiracy. Mohamed Atta was born on September 1, 1968, in Kafr el Sheikh, Egypt, to a middle-class family headed by his father, an attorney. After graduating from Cairo University with a degree in architectural engineering in 1990, Atta worked as an urban planner in Cairo for a couple of years. In the fall of 1991, he asked a German family he had met in Cairo to help him continue his education in Germany. They suggested he come to Hamburg and invited him to live with them there, at least initially. After completing a course in German, Atta traveled to Germany for the first time in July 1992. He resided briefly in Stuttgart and then, in the fall of 1992, moved to Hamburg to live with his host family. After enrolling at the University of Hamburg, he promptly transferred into the city engineering and planning course at the Technical University of Hamburg-Harburg, where he would remain registered as a student until the fall of 1999. He appears to have applied himself fairly seriously to his studies (at least in comparison to his jihadist friends) and actually received his degree shortly before traveling to Afghanistan. In school, Atta came across as very intelligent and reasonably pleasant, with an excellent command of the German language. When Atta arrived in Germany, he appeared religious, but not fanatically so. This would change, especially as his tendency to assert leadership became increasingly pronounced. According to Binalshibh, as early as 1995 Atta sought to organize a Muslim student association in Hamburg. In the fall of 1997, he joined a working group at the Quds mosque in Hamburg, a group designed to bridge the gap between Muslims and Christians. Atta proved a poor bridge, however, because of his abrasive and increasingly dogmatic personality. But among those who shared his beliefs, Atta stood out as a decisionmaker.

Write some highlights for the following article: For 11 years, Pedro Zapeta, an illegal immigrant from Guatemala, lived his version of the American dream in Stuart, Florida: washing dishes and living frugally to bring money back to his home country. Pedro Zapeta, an illegal immigrant, managed to save 59,000 while working as a dishwasher for 11 years. Two years ago, Zapeta was ready to return to Guatemala, so he carried a duffel bag filled with 59,000 -- all the cash he had scrimped and saved over the years -- to the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport. But when Zapeta tried to go through airport security, an officer spotted the money in the bag and called U.S. customs officials. \\"They asked me how much money I had,\\" Zapeta recalled, speaking to CNN in Spanish. He told the customs officials 59,000. At that point, U.S. customs seized his money, setting off a two-year struggle for Zapeta to get it back. Zapeta describes how he lost his money ». Zapeta, who speaks no English, said he didn't know he was running afoul of U.S. law by failing to declare he was carrying more than 10,000 with him. Anyone entering or leaving the country with more than 10,000 has to fill out a one-page form declaring the money to U.S. customs. Officials initially accused Zapeta of being a courier for the drug trade, but they dropped the allegation once he produced pay stubs from restaurants where he had worked. Zapeta earned 5.50 an hour at most of the places where he washed dishes. When he learned to do more, he got a 25-cent raise. After customs officials seized the money, they turned Zapeta over to the Immigration and Naturalization Service. The INS released him but began deportation proceedings. For two years, Zapeta has had two attorneys working pro bono: one on his immigration case, the other trying to get his money back. \\"They are treating me like a criminal when all I am is a working man,\\" he said. Zapeta's story became public last year on CNN and in The Palm Beach Post newspaper, prompting well-wishers to give him nearly 10,000 -- money that now sits in a trust. Robert Gershman, one of Zapeta's attorneys, said federal prosecutors later offered his client a deal: He could take 10,000 of the original cash seized, plus 9,000 in donations as long as he didn't talk publicly and left the country immediately. Zapeta said, \\"No.\\" He wanted all his money. He'd earned it, he said. Now, according to Gershman, the Internal Revenue Service wants access to the donated cash to cover taxes on the donations and on the money Zapeta made as a dishwasher. Zapeta admits he never paid taxes. CNN contacted the U.S. Attorneys office in Miami, U.S. Customs and the IRS about Zapeta's case. They all declined to comment. Marisol Zequeira, an immigration lawyer, said illegal immigrants such as Zapeta have few options when dealing with the U.S. government. \\"When you are poor, uneducated and illegal, your avenues are cut,\\" he said. On Wednesday, Zapeta went to immigration court and got more bad news. The judge gave the dishwasher until the end of January to leave the country on his own. He's unlikely to see a penny of his money. \\"I am desperate,\\" Zapeta said. \\"I no longer feel good about this country.\\" Zapeta said his goal in coming to the United States was to make enough money to buy land in his mountain village and build a home for his mother and sisters. He sent no money back to Guatemala over the years, he said, and planned to bring it all home at once. At Wednesday's hearing, Zapeta was given official status in the United States -- voluntary departure -- and a signed order from a judge. For the first time, he can work legally in the U.S. By the end of January, Zapeta may be able to earn enough money to pay for a one-way ticket home so the U.S. government, which seized his 59,000, doesn't have to do so.

Would the following phrase be considered positive or negative? cold , nervy and memorable .","completion":"The phrase \\"cold, nervy, and memorable\\" is a combination of words carrying different emotional connotations, making it difficult to categorize it as strictly positive or negative. Each of these words contains its own inferences, which we will analyze in depth below to determine the overall sentiment. 1. Cold: The adjective “cold” may have a few possible interpretations depending on the context in which it is used. In a positive sense, it could imply that something is cool, calm, and collected. However, it might also be interpreted negatively, as it could suggest being unemotional, unsympathetic, or unwelcoming. The word 'cold,' in general, leans more towards a negative connotation, as it often evokes feelings of discomfort, detachment, or aloofness. 2. Nervy: The term \\"nervy\\" is also ambivalent. On one hand, it can refer to someone or something that displays courage, boldness, or gutsiness, which would be considered positive qualities. On the other hand, it might also imply feelings of anxiety, agitation, or nervousness, which are generally regarded as negative emotions. The interpretation of \\"nervy\\" depends on the context in which it is used; it can be seen positively or negatively based on the situation and the perspective of the person reading or hearing this term. 3. Memorable: Lastly, the word \\"memorable\\" is generally considered as a positive adjective. It suggests that something has left a lasting impression or has a significant impact, making it worthy of being remembered. Events, experiences, or people described as memorable are those that stand out for their uniqueness or importance and are cherished or recalled fondly. Considering the varied emotional connotations of the individual words, the phrase \\"cold, nervy, and memorable\\" is not easily classified as either positive or negative. The sentiment conveyed will depend largely on the context in which these words are used and the way the reader or listener perceives them. It is crucial to carefully observe the situation and the surrounding details while interpreting the phrase to understand the intended meaning."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

For over forty years it was the home of Winston Churchill. He bought the property in September 1922 and lived there until shortly before his death in January 1965. In the 1930s, when Churchill was excluded from political office, Chartwell became the centre of his world. At his dining table, he gathered those who could assist his campaign against German re-armament and the British government's response of appeasement; in his study, he composed speeches and wrote books; in his garden, he built walls, constructed lakes and painted. During the Second World War Chartwell was largely unused, the Churchills returning after he lost the 1945 election. In 1953, when again Prime Minister, the house became Churchill's refuge when he suffered a devastating stroke. In October 1964, he left for the last time, dying at his London home, 28, Hyde Park Gate, on 24 January 1965. The origins of the estate reach back to the 14th century; in 1382 the property, then called Well-street, was sold by William-at-Well. It passed through various owners and in 1836 was auctioned, as a substantial, brick-built manor. In 1848, it was purchased by John Campbell Colquhoun, whose grandson sold it to Churchill. The Campbell Colquhouns greatly enlarged the house and the advertisement for its sale at the time of Churchill's purchase described it as an \\"imposing\\" mansion. Between 1922 and 1924, it was largely rebuilt and extended by the society architect Philip Tilden. From the garden front, the house has extensive views over the Weald of Kent, \\"the most beautiful and charming\\" Churchill had ever seen, and the determining factor in his decision to buy the house. In 1946, when financial constraints forced Churchill to again consider selling Chartwell, it was acquired by the National Trust with funds raised by a consortium of Churchill's friends led by Lord Camrose, on condition that the Churchills retain a life-tenancy.

Because of the money, visibility, and a promise that he can do his own television special, Kaufman accepts the role, turning his foreign man into a mechanic named Latka Gravas. Secretly he hates doing the show and expresses a desire to quit. Invited to catch a different act at a nightclub, Shapiro witnesses a performance by a rude, loud-mouthed lounge singer, Tony Clifton, whom Kaufman wants to guest-star on Taxi. Clifton's bad attitude is matched by his horrible appearance and demeanor. But backstage, when he meets Shapiro in person, Clifton takes off his sunglasses and reveals that he is actually Kaufman. Clifton is a \\"villain character\\" created by Kaufman and his creative partner, Bob Zmuda. Once again, the gag is on the audience. Kaufman's profile increases with appearances on Saturday Night Live, but he has problems with his newfound fame. When performing live, audiences dislike his strange anti-humor and demand that he perform as Latka. At one show, he deliberately antagonizes attendees by reading The Great Gatsby aloud from start to finish. Kaufman shows up on the Taxi set as Clifton and proceeds to cause chaos until he is removed from the studio lot. He relates to Shapiro that he never knows exactly how to entertain an audience \\"short of faking my own death or setting the theater on fire.\\" Answer:","completion":"The first name of the person who witnessed a performance by a rude singer is George. George Shapiro is the talent agent who signed Andy Kaufman as a client and later witnessed the performance by the rude singer, Tony Clifton, who was actually Kaufman in disguise."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Fraternity failed to seek medical help for nearly an hour, police claim. Freshman suffered 'major brain trauma' after being knocked unconscious.","completion":"Title: The Untimely Death of Chen Deng: A Tale of University Fraternity Negligence In a shocking turn of events last week, a promising young student named Chen Deng lost his life, allegedly due to fraternity negligence. According to the police report, the fraternity members allegedly failed to seek prompt medical help for nearly an hour after Deng's condition severely deteriorated. The event marked yet another reminder of the potential dangers hidden behind the fraternity culture in our universities. Chen Deng, a lively and enthusiastic freshman, tragically passed away after enduring 'major brain trauma', as confirmed by the medics who attended to him. The trauma was reportedly as a result of Chen being knocked unconscious, which plunged the fraternity house into chaos. However, what transpired afterwards calls for deep reflection on the response culture amongst fraternity brothers. The police claim that Deng was taken to the hospital by his fellow fraternity members. Yet, it is alleged that what is alarming is the fraternity's failure to act promptly when their fellow member’s health was clearly in a critical condition. The distressing delay stretched for nearly an hour, during which time Deng’s condition was progressively worsening. The subsequent investigation revealed that the fraternity body's response was not quick enough to save their fellow mate. An entire hour elapsed before Deng was finally brought to the hospital, thus delaying the necessary medical assistance that could potentially have prevented the situation from escalating to the horrific level it ultimately reached. This delay represents a catastrophic failure of the moral responsibilities held by, not just fraternity members, but by all students living in close proximity. This dark incident has shone a new spotlight on fraternity culture across college campuses. It raises pertinent questions about the safety measures in place, the efficiency of fraternity emergency response strategies, and the care given to students off-campus, particularly those involved in Greek life organizations. The degree of the fraternity’s negligence is undeniable. The lack of immediate emergency response shown towards Chen's situation was not only inadequate; it was perilous and ultimately fatal. This tragic event has devastated a family, robbed a young man of his dreams, and brought about deep-seated regret and disturbance within the university community. Equally shocking is the casualness with which fraternity practices are conducted that can lead to such grave harm, as with the incident that led to Chen's unconsciousness. As a result of this event, universities nationwide must re-evaluate their fraternity oversight policies, significantly increasing the supervision and monitoring of fraternity activities to safeguard the safety and lives of the students involved in such organizations. As we mourn the tragic loss of Chen Deng, it is pivotal to understand that this incident is not an isolated event. This unfortunate time calls for a much-needed dialogue regarding the upkeep and betterment of student safety within the fraternity culture. In its wake, Chen Deng’s untimely demise triggers reflections on fraternity practices and the cavalier attitudes that, unfortunately, sometimes accompany them. The incident also calls for a greater sense of fraternity responsibility towards the wellbeing of each member. In the spirit of brotherhood, students must be prepared to support one another, even in dire times. To prevent incidents like this from recurring in the future, it is of paramount importance for fraternity bodies and university authorities to work together. This includes devising a set of safety protocols, providing compulsory emergency response training to all fraternity members and encouraging a culture of prompt action in emergency situations within the fraternity culture. Remembering Chen Deng and his untimely death should serve as a powerful reminder to all of us that swift action can be life-saving. In the end, we all have a role to play, and we must question if we are doing enough to ensure student safety on our campuses. In the sea of university life, no more should a student feel forgotten, neglected, or unimportant."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Though female condoms typically cost around 4 per condom and can only be used once, you should practice using the condom on your own instead of using it for the first time right before sex. Though inserting the condom is easy once you get the hang of it, you should try it on your own at least once or twice to make sure that you can get it right when the time comes. Once you've determined that the condom is ready for use, just tear the arrow at the top of the package and remove the female condom. Using spermicides along with the female condom can further reduce your risk of pregnancy. Though the female condom will already be lubricated, extra lubricant can make it easier to insert and use the condom. To insert the female condom, you'll have to find a position that works for you. It's just like inserting a tampon -- you have to get comfortable and have access to your vagina before you can insert the condom. You can try squatting on the ground, laying down, or placing one foot on top of a chair. Hold the sides together similarly to how you would hold a pencil. Though the condom will be a bit slippery because of the lubricant, make sure you have a reasonably firm grip before you insert it. Insert it like a tampon. Push it up with your finger. Once it reaches the cervix, it will naturally expand and you won't be able to feel it anymore. Again, this is much like inserting a tampon -- if you can still feel it inside you, then you didn't put it in correctly. Make sure that the outer ring is hanging at least an inch outside the vagina. If it's hanging much further out, you may need to check if the inner ring is really inserted correctly. Once you've inserted the condom and are ready for sex, have your partner guide his penis into the outer ring that is hanging outside of your vagina. You can help guide his penis into the condom correctly. Make sure that his penis is actually going into the condom instead of touching one wall of your vagina as well as the condom. It's normal for the female condom to move from side to side once you're having sex. As long as the inner ring is still inserted and your man's penis is in the condom, you're good to go. If his penis has slipped out or the condom has come loose, you can comfortably reinsert it as long as the man hasn't ejaculated yet. Once the man ejaculates, you can remove and throw out the female condom. If you hear a loud noise because of the condom during sex, you can apply more lubricant.","completion":"The article provides a detailed guide on how to correctly use a female condom for safe sex, insisting on practicing its use and placement initially to familiarize oneself with the process which is compared with inserting a tampon; it suggests various positioning techniques, importance of right grip and confirmatory pointers to ensure correct placement including the condom's outer ring hanging outside the vagina. The text emphasizes proper guidance of the male partner's penis into the condom, addresses common observations like the condom's movement during sex, and outlines measures for situations such as slippage or loud noise, finally advising on its disposal post the male partner's ejaculation. The use of spermicides and extra lubrication are mentioned to enhance efficiency and ease of use, while the cost and single use nature of these condoms are mentioned briefly."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Speaking at the annual Shangri-La Dialogue defense conference, Modi called for the Indo-Pacific region to embrace freedom of navigation, territorial integrity, and respect for all nations, regardless of their size. \\"We will promote a democratic and rules-based international order in which all nations, small and large, count as equal and sovereign,\\" the Indian prime minister said. \\"We will work with others to keep our seas, space and airways free and open.\\" While those comments did not specifically mention China, Modi's remarks are seen as a reference to Beijing's increasingly assertive behavior toward its smaller neighbors in disputed areas of the South China Sea. Modi also implicitly criticized the United States. He slammed growing protectionism, presumably a reference to recent tariffs imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump. He also said nations should keep their commitments — a possible reference to Trump's decision to pull out of the Iran nuclear deal.

Although the team had a slow start to the 2008-09 season, United won the Premier League with a game to spare, making Ferguson the first manager in the history of English football to win the Premier League three times consecutively, on two separate occasions. Ferguson had now won 11 league titles at Manchester United, and the 2008-09 season title success put them level with Liverpool as league champions on a record 18 occasions in total. They also won the League Cup on penalties after a goalless Wembley draw with Tottenham. They contested the 2009 Champions League final against Barcelona on 27 May 2009 but lost 2-0. In 2009-10, Ferguson added another League Cup to his honours list as United defeated Aston Villa 2-1 in the Wembley final on 28 February 2010. However, his dreams of a third European Cup were ended a few weeks later when United were edged out of the competition in the quarter-finals by Bayern Munich on away goals. And their hopes of a record 19th league title were ended on the last day of the season when Chelsea beat them to the Premier League title, crushing Wigan Athletic 8-0 and rendering United's 4-0 win over Stoke City meaningless.

He is accused of knowingly using an aircraft to harass wildlife and pursuing a migratory bird.","completion":"Title: High-Flying Controversy: The Bizarre Case of Utah's 'Super Dell' Schanze Introduction Dell 'Super Dell' Schanze, a 45-year-old businessman from Utah, has recently been accused of using an aircraft to harass wildlife, as well as pursuing a migratory bird. Schanze, who is widely known throughout the state for his flamboyant personal style and his manic, attention-grabbing TV commericals, now finds himself in the spotlight for all the wrong reasons. This article will provide an in-depth examination of the allegations against Schanze and explore the potential implications of these bizarre charges. The Birth of 'Super Dell' Dell Schanze rose to prominence in Utah as the owner and spokesperson of a chain of computer stores called Totally Awesome Computers. Schanze's eccentric, high-energy TV commercials featured the businessman performing outrageous stunts, such as firing the computers from a cannon, to promote his products. As a result, Schanze's persona as the \\"Super Dell,\\" a superhero character who literally fights for the best computer deals, was born. While these commercials were undeniably successful in establishing Schanze as a household name throughout Utah, they also earned him a fair share of critics, many of whom argued that his antics were more annoying than entertaining. The Wildlife Harassment Allegations In recent years, however, the discussions surrounding Schanze have pivoted from his eccentric marketing style to a series of more troubling allegations. According to law enforcement officials, Schanze has been accused of knowingly employing an aircraft to harass wildlife and pursuing a migratory bird, which is, by law, a protected creature. The unorthodox businessman has vehemently denied these allegations, insisting that he has never taken part in any such activities. Instead, Schanze claims that the charges are a politically motivated attempt to tarnish his reputation, spurred on by his vocal criticism of the local government and certain regulatory agencies. Legal Ramifications Should Schanze be found guilty of these wildlife harassment charges, however, the consequences could be severe. Not only would the businessman risk losing public favor, but he could also face both significant fines and potential prison time. Typically, wildlife harassment is considered a highly illegal activity, particularly when it pertains to the harassment of protected species. Furthermore, Schanze could be banned from piloting an aircraft altogether, placing even more strain on the entrepreneur's already notorious public image. Public Opinion While the eventual legal outcome of this case has yet to be determined, it is clear that Schanze's reputation has been greatly impacted by these allegations. Many Utah residents have commented on the case, expressing dismay at the thought of a once-adored local hero abusing his power and prominence in such a reckless, harmful manner. Others, however, have remained steadfast in their support for Schanze, suggesting that the accusations are little more than an attempt to bring down a vocal critic of local government. Conclusion The case of Dell 'Super Dell' Schanze is undoubtedly a complex and compelling one, touching on broader questions of public perception, political persecution, and wildlife conservation.

Yet, even through October, Bermuda isn't ready to stop for the winter. During this month, world-class festivals on teh island keep things lively and the weather remains comfortable enough for Bermuda shorts and bathing suits. In October, Bermuda hosts two major festivals--the Bermuda Music Festival and the Bermuda Culinary Arts Festival. The 10thanniversary Bermuda Music Festival begins October 5 and features three days of performances at the Royal Naval Dockyard on Bermuda's West End. Featured main stage performers include Joss Stone, Pattie Labelle, and Al Green, and a second stage spotlights local Bermudian artists. General admission tickets start at 60 for on e day or 160 for a three-day pass. Starting October 21, the Culinary Arts Festival brings some of North America's top chefs to the island for four days of food and wine tastings, conferences and cooking competitions. Participating chefs include Todd English and Michael Lomonaco, among others. Three-day festival passes start at 649 per person, but you can also buy separate tickets for individual events. Even if you don't attend one of the festivals, there's still plenty to do. With mostly sunny days and temperatures averaging aroung 79 degrees, the weather is just right for participating in Bermuda's two favorite pastimes--golf and tennis. With fewer visitors on the island than during the summer, you may have an easier time getting the best times or a spot on the courts. It's also still warm enough to enjoy the island's pink sand beaches and go swimming, because the water keeps the summer's heat longer than the air. Of course, you can always shop in the city of Hamilton's upscale small goods arts and crafts shops.

While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Which of the following solutions is better for the following goal: To make a loop in a piece of copper wire, you can","completion":"To determine the best solution for making a loop in a piece of copper wire, the following steps will be taken: Step 1: Identifying potential solutions First, we need to identify the possible techniques available to make a loop in a piece of copper wire. Some potential solutions can be: a) bending the wire by hand, b) using pliers to form the loop, and c) using a specialized wire-bending jig. Step 2: Analyzing each solution Now that we have possible solutions, let's analyze them: a) Bending the wire by hand: Pros: Quick and straightforward, no special tools required. Cons: Difficult to create a consistent and precise loop shape, may not be effective for thicker wires, and may leave rough edges which could result in a weak loop. b) Using pliers to form the loop: Pros: Provides more control and precision than bending by hand, can effectively bend thicker wires, and can help create a smoother edge. Cons: May require some practice for first-time users, and can still be challenging to create a consistent loop shape. c) Using a specialized wire-bending jig: Pros: Offers maximum control and precision in shaping loops, can create consistent and repetitive loop shapes, and can handle a wide range of wire thickness. Cons: Requires purchasing a specialized tool. Step 3: Comparing solutions Considering the pros and cons above, we can compare and rank the solutions based on their effectiveness: 1. Using a specialized wire-bending jig appears to be the best solution because it offers maximum control, precision, and the ability to create consistent loops. However, it requires the purchase of a specialized tool. 2. Using pliers to form the loop comes in second place, as it provides more control than bending by hand but still may require practice for precise and consistent loops. 3. Bending the wire by hand is the least effective method, as it lacks precision and may result in rough edges or weak loops, especially for thicker wires. Conclusion: The best solution for making a loop in a piece of copper wire depends on the specific situation. If precision and consistency are important, and investing in a specialized tool is feasible, using a wire-bending jig is the best option. If only occasional loops are needed or there are budget constraints, the use of pliers may be a suitable compromise. Finally, if no tools are available and the loop is not required to be precise, bending the wire by hand may be the only option."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

MTA Chairman Joseph Lhota says 14 of the city's 23 subway lines are to be operating Thursday with service restoration to continue as the days go on. None of the trains are going into lower Manhattan, which is still dealing with a massive blackout. But commuters can at least be happy about the price. Gov. Andrew Cuomo waived fares through Friday. The subways carry 5.2 million riders daily. The Long Island Rail Road and Metro-North each were providing limited service. They have 300,000 daily riders. THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. Check back soon for further information. AP's earlier story is below. The cleanup of miles of New Jersey shorefront ripped apart by Superstorm Sandy has just begun, but New York City moved closer to resuming its normal frenetic pace by getting back its vital subways. New Yorkers began lining up at subway stops by 5 a.m. Thursday, an hour before the storm-crippled subways were to start running. The predawn commuters waiting at platforms included construction workers, shop owners and executives. The decision to reopen undamaged parts of the nation's largest transit system came as the region struggled to find its way back from a storm that killed more than 70 people and left more than 5 million without power. Two of the region's main airports opened Wednesday and officials promised that the third, LaGuardia Airport, would return to service Thursday. Actors and eager audiences brought darkened Broadway theaters back to life. And New Yorkers packed on to buses that returned for the first time to city streets since the storm, joining a throng of gridlocked traffic that navigated the city without working stop lights. Across the region, people stricken by the storm pulled together, in some cases providing comfort to those left homeless, in others offering hot showers and electrical outlets for charging cellphones to those without power. The spirit of can-do partnership extended even to politicians, who at least made the appearance of putting their differences aside to focus together on Sandy. \\"We are here for you,\\" President Barack Obama said in Brigantine, N.J., touring a ravaged shore. \\"We are not going to tolerate red tape. We are not going to tolerate bureaucracy.\\" Obama joined Republican Gov. Chris Christie, who had been one of the most vocal supporters of Republican presidential hopeful Mitt Romney, to tour the ravaged coast. But the two men spoke only of helping those harmed by the storm. That was already beginning Wednesday, when masses of people walked shoulder-to-shoulder across the Brooklyn Bridge to Manhattan for work, reversing the escape scenes from the Sept. 11 terror attack and the blackout of 2003. They reached an island, where many people took the lack of power and water and transportation as a personal challenge. On Third Avenue, people gathered like refugees around a campfire. But instead of crackling flames, their warmth came from more advanced technology: a power strip that had been offered to charge cellphones. At a fire hydrant on West 16th Street, 9-year-old Shiyin Ge and her brother, 12-year-old Shiyuan Ge, stood in line to fill up buckets of water. But unlike the adults, the two kids held plastic Halloween candy pails painted with grinning jack-o-lanterns. \\"There's no water in our house,\\" said Shiyin Ge, who had planned to dress up as a ladybug for Halloween. After suffering the worst disaster in its 108-year-old history, the subways were to roll again _ at least some of them. More than a dozen of the lines would offer some service, but none below Manhattan's 34th Street, a line of demarcation in the city separating the hardest-hit residents from those who escaped the brunt. Downtown Manhattan, which includes the city's financial district, Sept. 11 memorial and other tourist sites, was still mostly an urban landscape of shuttered bodegas and boarded-up restaurants, where people roamed in search of food, power and a hot shower. To get there from Brooklyn or Queens, commuters who would normally zoom beneath the East River in tunnels that flooded will have to take shuttle buses, adding to the enormous stress already being placed on gridlocked Manhattan streets. \\"We are going to need some patience and tolerance,\\" New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Wednesday. The airports and subways weren't the only transportation systems returning to the region. Suburban trains started running for the first time on Wednesday, and Amtrak's Northeast Corridor was to take commuters from city to city for on Friday for the first time since the storm. From West Virginia to the Jersey Shore, the storm's damage was still being felt, and seen. In New Jersey, signs of the good life that had defined wealthy shorefront enclaves like Bayhead and Mantoloking lay scattered and broken: 3,000 barbecue grills buried beneath the sand and hot tubs cracked and filled with seawater. Nearly all the homes were seriously damaged, and many had entirely disappeared. \\"This,\\" said Harry Typaldos, who owns the Grenville Inn in Mantoloking, \\"I just can't comprehend.\\" Most of the state's mass transit systems remained shut down, leaving hundreds of thousands of commuters braving clogged highways and quarter-mile lines at gas stations. Atlantic City's casinos remained closed. Christie postponed Halloween until Monday, saying trick-or-treating wasn't safe in towns with flooded and darkened streets, fallen trees and downed power lines. Farther north in Hoboken, just across the Hudson River from Manhattan, nearly 20,000 residents remained stranded in their homes, amid accusations that officials have been slow to deliver food and water. One man blew up an air mattress and floated to City Hall, demanding to know why supplies hadn't gotten out. At least one-fourth of the city's residents are flooded and 90 percent are without power. The outages forced many gas stations across the state to close, resulting in long lines of people looking to fuel cars and backup generators. Darryl Jameson of Toms River waited more than hour to get fuel. \\"The messed up part is these people who are blocking the roadway as they try to cut in line,\\" he said. \\"No one likes waiting, man, but it's something you have to do.\\" On New York's Long Island, bulldozers scooped sand off streets and tow trucks hauled away destroyed cars, while residents tried to find a way to their homes to restart their lives. Joanne and Richard Kalb used a rowboat to reach their home in Mastic Beach, filled with 3 feet of water. Her husband, exasperated by the futility of their effort, posted a sign on a telephone pole, asking drivers to slow down: \\"Slow please no wake.\\" Snow drifts as high as 5 feet piled up in West Virginia, where the former Hurricane Sandy merged with two winter weather systems as it went inland. Heavy snow collapsed parts of an apartment complex, a grocery store, a hardwood plant and three homes. The sixth person killed in the state was a candidate for the state House of Delegates, John Rose Sr., who was struck by a falling tree limb. His name will remain on the ballot on Election Day. A few more inches might fall in West Virginia, but meteorologists said Sandy's days are numbered. The National Weather Service said Wednesday that the last remnants of the storm are in the Appalachian Mountains, and will be gone by the end of the week. ___ Contributing to this report were Verena Dobnik, Eileen AJ Connelly, Leanne Italie, Karen Matthews and Lou Ferrara in New York; Samantha Henry in Hoboken, N.J.; Wayne Parry in Mantoloking, N.J., Katie Zezima in Seaside Heights, N.J.; Frank Eltman in Mastic Beach, N.Y., Larry Neumeister in Long Beach, N.Y., and Vicki Smith in Elkins, W.Va. ||||| Tweet with a location You can add location information to your Tweets, such as your city or precise location, from the web and via third-party applications.

In 1853, a crew led by U.S. Army Lieutenant Amiel Whipple surveyed along a sandy wash in the northern part of the Petrified Forest. So impressed was Whipple by the petrified wood along the banks of the arroyo that he named it Lithodendron Creek (Stone Tree Creek). Geologist Jules Marcou, a member of the Whipple expedition, observed that the petrified trees were from the Triassic.A slightly later route along the parallel was a wagon road, built between 1857 and 1860, that involved experimental use of camels as transport. In the late 19th century, settlers and private stagecoach companies followed similar east–west routes. Homesteaders who stayed in the area developed cattle ranches on the grasslands, and cattle grazed in the Petrified Forest until the mid-20th century.Also close to the 35th parallel was the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad. Its opening in the early 1880s led to the founding of towns like Holbrook and Adamana. Visitors could stop at the Adamana train station, book a hotel room, and take a tour of what was then called the Chalcedony Forest. Over the years, the line changed hands, becoming the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway, and then the BNSF. More than 60 BNSF trains, mostly carrying freight, pass through the park every day. U.S. Route 66, a former transcontinental auto highway developed in 1926 from part of the National Old Trails Road, ran parallel to the railroad tracks until it was decommissioned in 1985. The park has preserved within its boundaries a small grassy section of the road.

Eluding the pirates, Eloise and her servant Willory emerge and send a device that the king made, called a \\"Helpseeker,\\" to find heroes to save Alexander. In modern times, three misfits: the \\"yes man\\" George, the lazy Sedgewick, and the timid Elliot (Larry the Cucumber) are employees at a dinner theater. Although they want to be seen as heroes by their loved ones, as lowly cabin boys they think their dream is unattainable.

Detailed Instructions: Given a premise, an initial context, an original ending, and a new ending, the task is to generate the counterfactual context that is aligned with the new ending. Each instance consists of a five-sentence story. The premise is the first sentence of a story, and the second sentence, which is the initial context, provides more information about the story's context. The original ending is the last three sentences of the story. Also, you are given a new ending that can provide the new story with the same premise. You should write a counterfactual context to explain the small differences between the original and new endings. More specifically, a story context contains the general plot of the story. And a counterfactual context is a slight modification to the initial context.

Ai Kago (Jia Hu Ya Yi , Kago Ai), born February 7, 1988 in Yamatotokada, Nara, Japan, is a Japanese singer, actress, author, and former Guinness World Record holder. Kago began her career at the age of 12 as a member of the idol group Morning Musume. In the same year, she became a founding member of Minimoni. Throughout the second half of 2010, Kago became unhappy with the direction of her work. Around the same time, she began dating restaurant owner Haruhiko Ando, who acted as an in-between for her agency and herself. Since beginning a relationship with Ando, Kago cancelled several jobs at the last minute, causing her agency to suspend her activities. Despite this, she participated in a live performance and opened a separate blog without permission. Kago parted ways with R&A Promotions in November 2010 despite her contract ending in March 2013. As a response, in 2011, Kazuyuki Ito, president of Mainstream (an associate of R&A Promotions), declared that the agency planned on suing for 100 million yen in damages for contract violations. During that time, Kago's career was also derailed by her personal life. In September 2011, Ando was arrested for alleged extortion and claiming to have connections with the yakuza. In the same month, Kago was rushed to a nearby hospital after agency officials found her on the floor of her apartment with cuts to her wrists. Her life was reported to be not in danger, though there were speculations that it was a planned suicide. Following the incident, she and Ando registered their marriage, and Kago became pregnant. After spending 2012 out of the public eye with the birth of her daughter, Minami, Kago transferred to a new agency in 2013. Planning to revive her music career, she formed an idol group, which was later named Girls Beat!! The group would be crowd-sourced using lyrics, music, and costume ideas submitted by fans. Remi Kita and Ryona Himeno were recruited as the other two members after passing the auditions. Girls Beat!! released their first single, \\"Sekai Seifuku\\" on July 22, 2014. Their activities were abruptly put on hold when an arrest warrant was put out for Ando in October on suspicions of loaning money at illegal interest rates. Kago later filed for divorce, planning to continue activities once the divorce was finalized. Although Kago was eventually successful in doing so, in August 2015, her contract with her agency expired, though she continued activities with Girls Beat!! in November.

This famous doll, called Barbie, was created by Ruth Handler in 1959. Now Barbie is known everywhere. Before Barbie, all dolls were made to look like babies. People thought that this was a way to teach young girls how to become a good mother. Barbie was the first doll made to look like an adult instead of baby. From the beginning, Barbie was a modern career girl. There was a different Barbie for each job: nurse, teacher, police officer, race car driver, professional basketball player, pilot, as well as the very first female to fly in space. Barbie made it possible for young girls to dream about a future other than being a mother and a housewife. It showed girls that they had choices and could become anything they wanted to be. At the time, these ideas were very new and positive. The movement for equal opportunity for women had just begun and women wanted to have the same chance as men to do important work. However, Barbie's approval as a role model has not lasted. Today, many people criticize Barbie for making young girls too concerned about their appearance . These people complain that the beautiful, well-dressed Barbie seems to tell girls that while they can hope to have different career, it is more important for them to be beautiful and thin. The female figure that Barbie represents has also been criticized for being unrealistic . Young girls might think that Barbie's figure is beautiful and desirable .

Doménikos Theotokópoulos (Greek: Δομήνικος Θεοτοκόπουλος [ðoˈminikos θeotoˈkopulos]; October 1541 – 7 April 1614), most widely known as El Greco (\\"The Greek\\"), was a Greek painter, sculptor and architect of the Spanish Renaissance. \\"El Greco\\" was a nickname, a reference to his Greek origin, and the artist normally signed his paintings with his full birth name in Greek letters, Δομήνικος Θεοτοκόπουλος, Doménikos Theotokópoulos, often adding the word Κρής Krēs, Cretan. El Greco was born in the Kingdom of Candia, which was at that time part of the Republic of Venice, and the center of Post-Byzantine art. He trained and became a master within that tradition before traveling at age 26 to Venice, as other Greek artists had done. In 1570 he moved to Rome, where he opened a workshop and executed a series of works. During his stay in Italy, El Greco enriched his style with elements of Mannerism and of the Venetian Renaissance taken from a number of great artists of the time, notably Tintoretto. In 1577, he moved to Toledo, Spain, where he lived and worked until his death. In Toledo, El Greco received several major commissions and produced his best-known paintings. El Greco's dramatic and expressionistic style was met with puzzlement by his contemporaries but found appreciation in the 20th century. El Greco is regarded as a precursor of both Expressionism and Cubism, while his personality and works were a source of inspiration for poets and writers such as Rainer Maria Rilke and Nikos Kazantzakis. El Greco has been characterized by modern scholars as an artist so individual that he belongs to no conventional school. He is best known for tortuously elongated figures and often fantastic or phantasmagorical pigmentation, marrying Byzantine traditions with those of Western painting.

Lizards typically move on or between objects in their environment, making it easier to pinpoint the source of the rustling sound. Let's analyze the remaining options: - Garden: This is a broad term and could include trees, rocks, and bushes, but it is not specific enough to identify the source of the rustling sound. - Trees: While lizards can climb trees, the rustling sound wouldn't be easily noticeable by hikers. - Rocks: Lizards often move on or around rocks, but rocks themselves do not usually create a rustling sound when disturbed. - Bushes: This option is a good fit because bushes typically produce a noticeable rustling sound when something, such as a lizard, moves through them.

Generate a question about the following movie plot: Trelkovsky (Roman Polanski), a quiet and unassuming man, rents an apartment in Paris whose previous tenant, Egyptologist Simone Choule, attempted to commit suicide by throwing herself out the window and through a pane of glass below. He visits Choule in the hospital but finds her entirely in bandages and unable to talk. Whilst still at Choule's bedside, Trelkovsky meets Simone's friend, Stella (Isabelle Adjani), who has also come to visit. Stella begins talking to Simone, who becomes aware of her visitors. Initially showing some signs of agitation upon seeing them, Choule soon lets out a disturbing cry, then dies. It isn't clear which of the two has caused this reaction. Apparently unaware that Choule is now dead, Trelkovsky tries to comfort Stella but dares not say that he never knew Simone, instead pretending to be another friend. They leave together and go out for a drink and a movie (1973's Enter The Dragon), where they fondle each other. Outside the theatre they part ways. As Trelkovsky occupies the apartment he is chastised unreasonably by his neighbors and landlord, Monsieur Zy (Melvyn Douglas), for hosting a party with his friends, apparently having a woman over, making too much noise in general, and not joining in on a petition against another neighbor. Trelkovsky attempts to adapt to his situation, but is increasingly disturbed by the apartment and the other tenants. He frequently sees his neighbors standing motionless in the toilet room (which he can see from his own window), and discovers a hole in the wall with a human tooth stashed inside. He receives a visit and a letter from one Georges Badar (Rufus), who secretly loves Simone and has believed her to be alive and well. Trelkovsky updates and comforts the man and spends the night out with him. Gradually he changes his breakfast habits to those of Simone, and shifts from Gauloises to Marlboro cigarettes.

Unloved and neglected by her late parents, who had just been killed in an earthquake, she is a cold, unpleasant girl, unhappy in her new surroundings. Head housekeeper Mrs. Medlock informs Mary she will not be spoiled as she was in India and that her uncle, who spends extended periods of time away from the Manor, will likely not see her. Mary is ordered not to leave her room, but strange noises lead her to explore the mansion on her own. Mrs. Medlock eventually allows her to play outside to keep her from poking about the house. In the expansive grounds of the Manor, Mary discovers her late aunt's garden, which was locked and neglected since her accidental death ten years prior. Martha Sowerby, a maid, and her brother, Dickon, a nature-loving boy who can \\"talk\\" to animals, befriend Mary. Fascinated by the \\"secret garden,\\" Mary enlists Dickon to help her bring it back to life, gradually losing her sour persona and becoming a more friendly, happy child in the process. When finally introduced to her uncle, Mary is apprehensive, knowing he was responsible for locking up the secret garden. Fearful he would do it again, Mary evasively asks to plant seeds in an \\"unwanted\\" part of the Manor, to which Lord Craven grants permission before leaving the country for the rest of the year. Confident that the garden will remain a secret, Mary and Dickon continue their work. Hidden away in the gloomy mansion is Mary's cousin, Colin, who has been treated all his life like a fragile, sickly invalid. This has turned him into a demanding, short tempered, helpless boy who has never left his room or learned to walk.

Question: This is a correct answer to the following question about Tire. Yes or no? Answer: Most tires, such as those for automobiles and bicycles, provide traction between the vehicle and the road while providing a flexible cushion that absorbs shock. Question: what are tires made of Answer:","completion":"Tires are primarily made of rubber, along with other materials that enhance their performance, durability, and overall structure. The composition of a tire can be divided into five main components: 1. Rubber Compounds: Natural and synthetic rubber are the main components in tires. The rubber compounds are responsible for providing the tire's elasticity, flexibility, and ability to absorb shocks. Typically, a combination of both natural and synthetic rubber is used in various proportions to achieve the desired properties. 2. Reinforcing Agents: Carbon black and silica are added to the rubber compounds to improve the tire's strength, wear resistance, and overall performance. Carbon black serves to reinforce the rubber and enhance its resistance to abrasion, while silica helps reduce rolling resistance, which can result in improved fuel efficiency. 3. Steel belts: Steel belts are layers of steel cords embedded in the rubber layers of the tire. Their primary function is to provide additional strength, puncture resistance, and help maintain the tire's shape. Steel belts can be found in the tread area of radial tires, which is the most common type of tire used for automobiles today. 4. Fabric layers: These are made from synthetic fibers, like polyester, nylon, or rayon, and are responsible for providing reinforcement to the tire's structure and stability. Fabric layers are usually found in the sidewall and lower part of the tread. 5. Chemical additives: Various chemicals are used in the rubber compounds to provide specific properties, such as antioxidants and antiozonants to protect the rubber from deteriorating under environmental stress, and vulcanizing agents like sulfur, which aid in the cross-linking process of the rubber during manufacturing, making it stronger and more durable. In summary, tires are made predominantly from rubber compounds, with additional materials like carbon black, silica, steel belts, and fabric layers for reinforcement, as well as various chemical additives to enhance performance, durability, and resilience."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Article: After years of hearing drivers complain about scratches on their cars, Japan's Nissan Motor Company has officially announced the next big thing---a paint that not only resists scratches and scrapes, but actually repairs itself within a few days. The new material, developed by Nippon Paint Company, contains an elastic rubbery-like resin that is able to heal minor marks caused by car wash equipment, parking lot encounters, road debris or even on-purpose destruction. The automaker admits its results vary depending on the temperature and the depth of the damage, but adds this is the only paint like it in the world, and tests prove it works. Minor scratches, the most common type, are said to slowly fade over about a week. And once they're gone, there is no trace that they were ever there. The special paint is said to last for at least three years after it is first applied, but there is no word yet on whether more can be added after that period. Nissan claims car washes are the worst offenders for this type of damage, accounting for at least 80 percent of all incidents. But the complete auto-healing won't come without scratching your wallet. The vehicle maker notes the special paint adds about 100 U.S. to the price of a car. It plans to use its new chemical mixture only on its X - Trail SUVs in Japan for now, as it looks for a more widespread presentation. And while plans to offer the feature overseas haven't been made yet, if it's a hit there, you can be almost sure market forces will drive it to these shores, as well.

The premise you've provided states that if the auditor does not find any additional weaknesses in a company's account or operations, management will receive a good awareness rating, even if updates are required in some controls. The emphasis here is on the existence of weaknesses in a company's system or protocols. If none are found, then by this premise, the management's awareness is good. The hypothesis, on the other hand, suggests that the auditor may choose to give a specific rating based on a perception of the commitment and effort of the management, irrespective of the existence of weaknesses or required strengthening of control measures. This means that an auditor's personal discretion can influence the rating, bucking a strictly objectivity-based evaluation and incorporating a subjectivity-based one into it. The hypothesis makes a claim on the subjective judgment of an auditor, while the premise introduces an objective standard (the absence of additional weaknesses). These two things aren't necessarily contradictory, but they also don't inherently support each other based solely on the information provided. Thus, it is not possible to conclude definitively that if the premise is true, then the hypothesis also holds true. While it's certainly possible that an auditor could show discretion in line with the hypothesis within the context of the premise, there's not enough information in the premise alone to guarantee that outcome. It's also conceivable that an auditor, despite recognizing good faith effort on part of management, strictly adheres to the objective parameters of the evaluation, making the hypothesis false. Therefore, without making additional assumptions or having more detailed information connecting the premise and hypothesis, it's not possible to definitively say that the truth of the premise ensures the truth of the hypothesis."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Process: - Your thermostat senses that the room temperature has fallen below your thermostat setting - Your thermostat sends a signal to your heating system to provide heat for your home - When your oil burner is engaged, heating oil travels from the tank to the burner by way of a pump - Here the oil becomes a fine mist mixed with air - The fuel/air mixture is then injected into the burner where it is ignited in the combustion chamber - The warm air is disbursed through vents, hot water through baseboards, or by steam radiators - Perturbation hypothesis: suppose \\"The home isnt insulated well\\" happens, how will it affect more of the fuel air mixture is injected into the burner. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis, \\"The home isn't insulated well,\\" can indirectly affect the process. Insulation plays an essential role in maintaining the temperature of a home. If the home's insulation is inadequate, the heat generated by the heating system will be lost faster than it can be replaced, causing the room temperature to fall more rapidly. As a result, the thermostat will sense the room temperature falling below the thermostat setting more frequently, causing it to continuously send signals to the heating system to provide additional heat. This, in turn, will lead to the oil burner being engaged more often, resulting in more frequent instances of heating oil traveling from the tank to the burner and being transformed into a fine mist mixed with air. The increased engagement of the oil burner, due to poor insulation, will lead to more fuel/air mixture being injected into the burner over time. This will likely result in higher fuel consumption and increased energy costs for the homeowner. The perturbation has an indirect effect on the process as it doesn't impact the stages of the process directly but influences the frequency at which they occur."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Charles Darwin's book The Formation of Vegetable Mould through the Action of Worms (1881) presented the first scientific analysis of earthworms' contributions to soil fertility. Some burrow while others live entirely on the surface, generally in moist leaf litter. The burrowers loosen the soil so that oxygen and water can penetrate it, and both surface and burrowing worms help to produce soil by mixing organic and mineral matter, by accelerating the decomposition of organic matter and thus making it more quickly available to other organisms, and by concentrating minerals and converting them to forms that plants can use more easily. Earthworms are also important prey for birds ranging in size from robins to storks, and for mammals ranging from shrews to badgers, and in some cases conserving earthworms may be essential for conserving endangered birds. What was the first scientific study of how earthworms help soil?","completion":"The first scientific study of how earthworms help soil was conducted by Charles Darwin, a renowned naturalist and biologist. His book, titled \\"The Formation of Vegetable Mould through the Action of Worms\\" (1881), presented the pioneering scientific analysis of earthworms' contributions to soil fertility. In this groundbreaking work, Darwin explored the behavior of various types of earthworms, distinguishing between burrowers and surface dwellers, and their impact on soil characteristics and overall ecosystem health. Darwin observed that burrowing earthworms played a crucial role in loosening the soil, thereby improving its aeration and allowing water to penetrate more effectively. This, in turn, facilitated the growth of various plant species, ensuring the long-term productivity of the ecosystem. He also noted that both surface-dwelling and burrowing worms were instrumental in producing soil by promoting the mixing of organic and mineral matter. Earthworms help accelerate the decomposition of organic materials, making them more accessible to other organisms while also concentrating minerals and converting them into forms that plants can absorb and utilize. Through his meticulous observations, Darwin was able to shed light on the essential ecological functions performed by earthworms. These creatures are not only crucial to maintaining healthy and fertile soil conditions, but they also serve as a key food source for a diverse range of birds and mammals. Consequently, the conservation of earthworm populations holds significant importance for the preservation of endangered bird species and overall biodiversity. In summary, Charles Darwin's \\"The Formation of Vegetable Mould through the Action of Worms\\" (1881) was the first scientific study to examine the ways in which earthworms contribute to soil fertility. By highlighting the ecological importance of these organisms, Darwin laid the foundation for understanding the integral role earthworms play in sustaining healthy ecosystems and promoting soil fertility."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

To that end, he conducts two tests, test A an test B, on an organism. In test A he reduces catalysts from the organism, but in test B he induces catalysts in the organism. He needs to observe the outcomes of these tests. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Would test B see reactions taking place slower or faster than test A? Hint: Most chemical reactions within organisms would be impossible under the conditions in cells. For example, the body temperature of most organisms is too low for reactions to occur quickly enough to carry out life processes. Reactants may also be present in such low concentrations that it is unlikely they will meet and collide. Therefore, the rate of most biochemical reactions must be increased by a catalyst. A catalyst is a chemical that speeds up chemical reactions. In organisms, catalysts are called enzymes . Essentially, enzymes are biological catalysts. Answer:","completion":"Test B would see reactions taking place faster than test A. Step-by-step reasoning: 1. The hint provided states that most chemical reactions within organisms are hard to carry out under normal cellular conditions (such as low temperature and reactant concentrations). 2. To increase the rate of biochemical reactions, a catalyst is required. In organisms, these catalysts are called enzymes. 3. In test A, Mark reduces the catalysts (enzymes) in the organism. This means that fewer enzymes are available to speed up the reactions, thus making the reactions slower. 4. In test B, Mark induces catalysts (enzymes) in the organism. This means that more enzymes are available to speed up the reactions, thus making the reactions faster. 5. Comparing both tests, test B has more catalysts (enzymes) than test A. Therefore, test B would see reactions taking place faster than test A."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Here's a question and a few possible answers: Q: What is the legal consequence of killing likely to be? Possible A: being imprisoned, no longer live, dies, fine, feeling of guilt Why is \\"being imprisoned\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? A:","completion":"\\"Being imprisoned\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because it is a common and realistic legal consequence of committing a serious crime such as killing or murder in most societies. When someone commits a crime, especially one as severe as taking another person's life, it is generally understood that they will face punishment as determined by the legal system. Imprisonment serves several purposes in the context of such crimes, including retribution, deterrence, public safety, and rehabilitation. By imprisoning those who commit violent acts like murder, society attempts to deter others from engaging in similar behaviors and keeps criminals away from potential future victims. The other options provided in the possible answers are either less relevant or less likely: 1. No longer live: This might refer to the capital punishment, which is applied in some jurisdictions; however, it is not a universal legal consequence for killing and is less common in comparison to imprisonment. 2. Dies: The person who committed the killing is unlikely to die as a direct legal consequence (unless they face capital punishment, which, as mentioned earlier, is not a universally applied punishment). 3. Fine: Fines are generally reserved for minor offenses and would not be an appropriate or proportional punishment for a violent crime like killing. 4. Feeling of guilt: This is an emotional, not legal, consequence and might vary greatly depending on the individual. In a legal context, feelings of guilt are not considered as a formal consequence. Thus, among the given possible answers, \\"being imprisoned\\" is the one that aligns with human common sense because it effectively addresses the severity and implications of committing a killing and is a widely recognized legal outcome in most societies."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

'I think Raquel Welch and Cher did that, too,' she said of the unusual procedure, adding: 'It’s illegal in the U.S., but I had it done in Mexico. They break the floating rib in the back and push it in, so there's no scar.' Scroll Down for Video. My story: Amanda Lepore, one of the most famous transsexual fixtures on the New York party scene, has opened up about the emotional and physical obstacles she battled growing up. Perfect proportions: After having a sex change at the age of 19 the dancer, singer and party host invested in extreme plastic surgery. Following multiple nips and tucks, 5ft 2in Ms Lepore boasts a perfect hourglass figure measuring 38-22-38. Facially she has had lip injections, fillers, Botox,. a nose job, a forehead lift and her hairline lowered. Her inspirations included Jean Harlow, Marilyn Monroe and Jessica Rabbit. 'Rather than emulate the girls I grew up with who made fun of me, I decided I wanted to look like a movie star. It was like an escape,' the dancer, singer and party host recalled. Luckily no major alterations were required, as Ms Lepore said she had 'very girly features' to begin with and would often pass for a girl in her early teens. Asked. how much her cosmetic work has cost in total, the busty blonde declined. to provide an answer, merely stating: 'There is a reason I am labeled. ‘The Most Expensive Body On Earth’. \\"Amanda Lepore\\" short doc. 'It' girl: Ms Lepore pictured with Lady Gaga on one of her nights out in New York. One for the scrapbook! Paris Hilton, Ms Lepore and Nicky Hilton pictured in 2003. She says that her sex change from male to female, was the most painful procedure she’s had done. 'It didn’t hurt when I got it done at. the hospital,' she recounted. 'But they give you a dilator as part of the healing. process, which you have to keep in for extended periods of time to. stretch the vaginal opening. 'If I could have a crystal ball and see. what I look like now - you know, modeling, hanging out. with Daphne Guinness - I'd be like, \\"Wow, I can't believe this\\" 'It felt like a knife. It was the most. painful thing I had ever experienced.' In the late Eighties Ms Lepore moved from Cedar Grove, New Jersey, where she grew up, to New York. She left behind her father, an Italian-American chemical engineer, and her mother, a. German-American housewife who was schizophrenic and spent much time in. mental institutions. Although both found it difficult to. accept their daughter's transgender identity at first - refusing to take. her to ballet lessons and stopping her from growing her hair long -. they eventually supported her transition. Friends in high places: Ms Lepore with celebrity photographer David LaChapelle and Pamela Anderson. Just another night on the tiles: Ms Lepore - pictured here with Daphne Guinness, Lady Gaga and Terry Richardson last September - says she cannot believe her career success. Ms. Lepore's father withdrew her from public school - where she was already. isolated - hired a private tutor and even took her to a psychologist. who helped her obtain a hormone prescription. After moving to New York Ms Lepore. established her career as a nightlife figure, partying at night and. spending her days working in a nail salon, as a dominatrix, and later as. a cosmetics salesgirl for Patricia Field. 'I really associate glamor with being happy. If you put on high heels and lipstick or get a new outfit, you feel great' One evening while hosting at a bar in downtown Manhattan, she met celebrity photographer, David LaChapelle, and began collaborating with him. It was this partnership which ultimately helped her to achieve international acclaim as his muse. She has since appeared in fashion magazines, including French Playboy and Vogue, and scored cameos in music videos for artists including Elton John, The Dandy Warhols, and Grace Jones. Looking back on her career success, Ms Lepore previously told Interview Magazine: 'When I was in the hospital getting my sex change, I was just wishing I could be a pretty girl working in a mall. 'If I could have a crystal ball and see. what I look like now - you know, modeling, David LaChapelle, hanging out. with Daphne Guinness, singing with Lil' Kim, and traveling all over the. world, I'd be like, \\"Wow, I can't believe this.\\" 'I really associate glamor with being happy. If you put on high heels and lipstick or get a new outfit, you feel great,' Ms Lepore said. She is currently working on a new music album and getting her memoirs ready for publication. When it comes to fashion, Ms Lepore says she likes tight-fitting clothing that shows off her 'tiny waist.' And on the beauty front, she says she always does her hair and make-up herself because she's very particular about her look. 'I've had my boobs done and my bottom rib broken and pushed in - I think Raquel Welch and Cher did that, too' She likes to use a combination of foundation, concealer. blush, powder, topped off with a carefully applied brush of bright lipstick. 'Once I put my make-up on, it really doesn’t move. If I’m traveling, sometimes I will sleep with it on so that I don’t have to do it again - I’ll get off a flight and do whatever I'm doing with it on.' She has also been using a variety of creams to hide scars on her body after being involved in a car accident last year. The charismatic performer concluded on her made up look: 'I really associate glamor with being happy. If you put on high heels and lipstick or get a new outfit, you feel great.

Dynasty: He was the last recorded ruler of his dynasty, which suggests that the dynasty either lost power or was assimilated into another kingdom after his reign. 4. Deposition: Manava was likely deposed by Harshavardhana, the emperor of northern India, or Bhaskaravarman, the king of Kamarupa. This information implies that there might have been a conflict or political struggle during his reign which led to his downfall. 5. Reign duration: Manava ruled as king for only 8 months. This relatively short reign suggests that he faced challenges in consolidating and maintaining power during his rule. To summarize, from the given bio, we learn about Manava's royal lineage, succession to the throne, brief reign duration, likely deposition, and the end of his dynasty."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Here's a detailed description of how that works: After the glucose and oxygen are produced from the initial steps in photosynthesis, the plant needs to utilize these products to sustain its growth, repair, and reproduction. This is achieved through a process called cellular respiration. During cellular respiration, glucose and oxygen are converted into carbon dioxide, water, and energy (in the form of ATP - Adenosine Triphosphate). ATP acts as a universal energy currency for cells, enabling them to carry out various metabolic processes, including growth and reproduction. Cellular respiration occurs in the various cells and tissues of the plant, mainly in the cell organelles called mitochondria. The process can be divided into three main stages: glycolysis, the Krebs cycle, and the electron transport chain. 1. Glycolysis: This is an anaerobic process (does not require oxygen) that occurs in the cell's cytoplasm. During glycolysis, glucose (a 6-carbon molecule) is split into two molecules of pyruvate (3-carbon molecules). In this process, two molecules of ATP are consumed, but four molecules of ATP are generated. Therefore, the net gain of ATP in glycolysis is two molecules. 2. Krebs Cycle: Also known as the citric acid cycle or TCA cycle (Tricarboxylic Acid cycle), the Krebs cycle is an aerobic process (requires oxygen) that takes place in the mitochondria of cells. During the Krebs cycle, the two pyruvate molecules generated during glycolysis are converted into Acetyl-CoA (2-carbon molecules) which enter the cycle where they are broken down, producing carbon dioxide as a waste product. The energy released from this process is stored in the form of ATP, NADH (Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide), and FADH₂ (Flavin Adenine Dinucleotide). 3. Electron Transport Chain (ETC): The ETC is the final stage of cellular respiration. It is also an aerobic process and occurs in the inner mitochondrial membrane. During the electron transport chain, the electrons from the NADH and FADH₂ produced in previous stages are transferred through a series of protein complexes. These complexes use the electrons' energy to pump protons across the membrane, creating a gradient that helps generate a large amount of ATP. Oxygen serves as the final electron acceptor in this process; hence, oxygen is essential for cellular respiration. Upon accepting electrons, oxygen combines with protons to form water, which is another waste product of cellular respiration. In summary, the final step of the process you've described is the conversion of the glucose produced during photosynthesis into energy (ATP), carbon dioxide, and water through cellular respiration. This energy, in the form of ATP, is used by the plant for various metabolic processes, growth, and reproduction."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Kindergartners at PS 90 in Coney Island will not be allowed to sing “God Bless the USA” at graduation on June 20, after their principal, Greta Hawkins, proclaimed that “we don’t want to offend other cultures,” according to the teachers who witnessed it. But “Baby” by Justin Bieber remains on the program. A spokeswoman for the Department of Education told the New York Post that the lyrics of “God Bless the USA” were “not age-appropriate.” First off, the point of a patriotic song is not to avoid offending other cultures. Consider the lyrics of, well, every national anthem ever written. The French sing, loosely translated by Marseillaise.org, “Listen to the sound in the fields/The howling of these fearsome soldiers/They are coming into our midst/To cut the throats of your sons and consorts/To arms citizens/ Form your battalions/March, march/Let impure blood/Water our furrows!” The lyrics of “God Bless the USA” are not only age-appropriate, they involve very little watering of furrows with blood. And even if they did, it would still be a better song. “Baby,” meanwhile, runs as follows: “Baby, baby, baby, ooh. Baby, baby, baby, ooh. Baby, baby, baby, ooh — ” Well, you get the idea. There are also other lyrics in there about “She knows she got me dazing ‘cause she was so amazing.” These are not age-appropriate either: They are an insult to the intelligence of any self-respecting kindergartner.

The FBI has joined the ongoing investigation. Officers responding to a call about someone behaving erratically shot Olango. Video footage recorded in the aftermath shows the victim's sister, who claimed to have informed the police that her brother was unarmed, \\"mentally sick,\\" and required assistance from a \\"crisis communications team,\\" according to the Los Angeles Times. The San Diego Union-Tribune revealed that Olango, a 38-year-old head cook at a Hooters restaurant, came to the United States with his family after living as refugees in Uganda under horrific conditions. Despite his several encounters with the law and time spent in prison for drugs and weapons charges, friends say he was on the path to getting his life back on track. However, the death of a close friend on Friday reportedly sent him spiraling into a deep depression. As the investigation continues, the community and protestors are demanding answers and seeking justice for Alfred Olango and his family. The incident highlights ongoing concerns regarding law enforcement's interactions with those in mental health crises and reckons with racial biases in policing."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

She dreams of performing on stage one day, but due to her family's financial struggles, she has never owned a cello, and has had limited access to music lessons. However, Yoon-jin is determined to overcome these obstacles and follow her dream. Step 2: Set the stage for the main conflict One day, while wandering through the city, Yoon-jin discovers a quaint music store on a corner street.

It stresses freedom to navigate the oceans and disapproves of war fought in international waters. Today, this concept is enshrined in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), the third version of which came into force in 1994. Article 87(1) states: \\"The high seas are open to all states, whether coastal or land-locked.\\" Article 87(1) (a) to (f) gives a non-exhaustive list of freedoms including navigation, overflight, the laying of submarine cables, building artificial islands, fishing and scientific research. The safety of shipping is regulated by the International Maritime Organization. Its objectives include developing and maintaining a regulatory framework for shipping, maritime safety, environmental concerns, legal matters, technical co-operation and maritime security.UNCLOS defines various areas of water. \\"Internal waters\\" are on the landward side of a baseline and foreign vessels have no right of passage in these. \\"Territorial waters\\" extend to 12 nautical miles (22 kilometres; 14 miles) from the coastline and in these waters, the coastal state is free to set laws, regulate use and exploit any resource.

To elaborate further, the context mentions that the film is centered around Kermit Gosnell, an abortion doctor who has been reported to have killed hundreds of infants born alive during abortion procedures.

The Patriots punted on their first drive of the game, giving the Jets the ball at their own 3-yard line. After a 1-yard Thomas Jones run, Jets quarterback Clemens threw an interception to Eugene Wilson, who returned it for a touchdown. Clemens was hit by Seymour and suffered an ankle injury on the play and did not return to the game. Wilson also became the Patriots' 21st player to score a touchdown on the season, tying an NFL record set by the Denver Broncos in 2000 and Los Angeles Rams in 1987. On their ensuing possession, the Jets gained 49&#160;yards on an option play to running back Leon Washington, but then failed a fourth down conversion from the Patriots' 17-yard line. With 6:36 remaining in the first quarter, the Patriots began a drive that ended 17 plays later, in the 2nd quarter, on a 26-yard Gostkowski field goal. After a Jets punt, the Patriots moved the ball to their own 40-yard line when a Chris Hanson punt attempt was blocked by David Bowens and returned for a touchdown to cut the Patriots' lead to 10-7. On the Jets' next possession, Washington blocked a Graham punt attempt to give the Patriots the ball at the Jets' 3-yard line. A 1-yard Maroney touchdown run a play later gave the Patriots a 17-7 lead going into halftime. Gostkowski's extra point, his 67th of the season, broke Uwe von Schamann's single-season record of 66 with the Miami Dolphins in 1984. A Jets punt gave the Patriots the ball at their own 9-yard line early in the third quarter. After two Maroney rushes for a total of 5&#160;yards, a Brady pass on third down intended to Moss was intercepted by Jets cornerback Darrelle Revis. The Jets moved into the red zone, but were driven back on a Thomas Jones run for a 1-yard loss and a delay of game penalty. On third down, Pennington completed a 10-yard pass to Baker, who then fumbled. Wilson recovered it for the Patriots, but a subsequent exchange of punts kept the third quarter scoreless. Another Hanson punt began the fourth quarter, giving the Jets the ball from their own 15-yard line. The Jets then embarked upon a 17-play drive where Pennington completed 10 passes on 12 attempts, none for more than 14&#160;yards. The drive ended at the Patriots' 15-yard line, where the Jets cut the Patriots' lead to 17-10 on a 33-yard Mike Nugent field goal. The Patriots' ensuing drive began with two incompletions intended for Moss. On third down, Brady completed a 16-yard pass to Moss, and then a 46-yard pass to Moss to give the Patriots the ball at the Jets' 14-yard line. A 4-yard Maroney run, incompletion, and sack for a loss of 6&#160;yards set up a 33-yard Gostkowski field goal. The Jets' next possession ended in a 35-yard missed Nugent field goal, and the Jets failed to score on their final drive to give the Patriots a 20-10 win. It gave the Patriots a 14-0 record, tying them with the 1972 Miami Dolphins for the best record to start a season. The win also clinched home-field advantage throughout the playoffs for the Patriots.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. I can use this background: Cholesterol has been implicated in heart disease for decades. Atherosclerosis is a disorder of the arteries in which cholesterol and other materials are deposited on the interior of the arterial wall. These deposits lead to the formation of plaques that can restrict or even block the flow of blood through these blood vessels (see Figure below ). A decrease in the flow of blood can lead to high blood pressure and a lowered oxygen supply to the heart muscle. A complete blockage of blood flow to parts of the heart (a heart attack) can cause significant damage due to oxygen deprivation, in some cases leading to death.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize this article: Teaching your Bernese Mountain Dog proper leash etiquette is very important — a big dog like a Bernese could easily drag you down the street if she isn't trained. Start out by letting her get comfortable with her collar. Put it on when she's likely to be distracted, like when she's playing or eating food. If she tries to scratch it off or remove the collar, do not allow her to do so. Do not remove the collar until she's forgotten about it. Once your Bernese is used to wearing her collar, clip on a lightweight leash. Don't try to lead her or do anything with it — let her just drag it around the house (under your supervision) and sniff it. Once your dog feels comfortable with his collar and leash, take the leash and begin walking around the house with him. If he walks beside you and/or lets the leash be loose or slack, give lots of praise, pats, and treats. If he begins to pull, stop in your tracks. Do not pull him back to you and do not proceed — allow him to come back to you. When the leash is loose again, praise him and begin walking again. Never allow your puppy to pull you on the leash, as this teaches him that this is acceptable. By stopping the walk, he learns that pulling and straining will get him nowhere. If he wants to walk, he must do so without pulling. If your puppy does the opposite and sits down, do not yank on the leash to get him to keep moving. Instead, call him over to you, offering treats and rewards when he comes.

Summarize this article: BAD TIMING It’s hard to believe that it’s taken this long for The Disney Channel to feature a same-sex couple in one of its shows, but apparently, it has happened. The Disney Channel officially featured their first lesbian couple in an episode of Good Luck Charlie this week, and the whole situation is just so hilarious that they’ve plugged a laugh track over it because—you know—gay people are hilarious! As you can see in the clip above, parents Bob and Amy Duncan share confusion over who, exactly, is the mother of Taylor, a child whom Charlie has invited over for a playdate. While awaiting the arrival of their guests, Amy swears she’s met Taylor’s mother Susan. Duncan swears he’s met Taylor’s mother Cheryl. Haha! screams the laugh track, as Amy opens the door to reveal Taylor’s two lesbian moms. Faint giggles are heard as the lesbian mothers are introduced. Finally, a screeching LOL! in response to Duncan’s revelation that “Taylor has two moms!” Disney claims it “consulted child development experts and community advisors” to make sure the Miley Cyrus-approved same-sex parent plot was “relevant to kids and families around the world and to reflect themes of diversity and inclusiveness.” LOL! Wonder if those child development experts roared with laughter when Disney brought up lesbian moms? Sure, I understand that most sitcoms rely on laugh tracks to ease you through painfully boring dialogue, but is making a lesbian couple the punchline of (admittedly a harmless) joke the best way to “reflect themes of diversity and inclusiveness”? C’mon, Disney, I thought you were smarter than this. ||||| While you were busy reading your 27th think piece on Macklemore performing “Same Love” at the Grammys and Looking being boring, something actually kind of monumental happened: the Disney Channel featured its first gay couple on an episode of one of its original series. Good Luck Charlie, one of the network’s most popular original comedies, featured a lesbian couple on Sunday’s episode. The plot was refreshingly innocuous, but pointed enough to let it be known that it was, you know, kind of a big deal that a Disney Channel series aimed at young children was taking this step. The very sitcom-y premise: parents Bob and Amy Duncan set up a playdate for their daughter, Charlie, with her friend, Taylor and Taylor’s parents. Amy says the mother’s name is Susan. Bob swears he met her before…but her name is Cheryl. When they arrive, they find out that they were both right. Taylor has two mothers, and their names are Susan and Cheryl. Here’s the scene: It’s so painfully clear what will happen when Bob and Amy open the door—Oh my god! Two moms!—that you almost cringe in anticipation of a groan-worthy gag or borderline offensive punchline. But the actual joke was neither of those things! Bob facepalms his forehead. “Taylor has two moms,” he says, in a “duh!” manner signaling that’s there’s nothing else to be discussed about it. That it’s no big deal. That it’s fine. In fact, Disney was so bullish about this whole idea that Taylor having two moms was “fine” that it even put in the episode’s plot description that ran on TVGuide.com: “In the storyline, parents Amy and Bob Duncan (Leigh-Allyn Baker and Eric Allan Kramer) set up a playdate for preschooler Charlie (Mia Talerico) and one of her new friends. When the kid arrives, the Duncans learn that Charlie’s pal has two moms. That’s fine [emphasis ours], but the potential new friendship is put to the test as one mom chats with Amy, and the other is stuck listening to Bob's dull stories.” As amusing as it is that Disney felt the need to editorialize the plot description, it is good news that the company is, indeed, fine with showing a gay couple on the series. When it was announced back in June that they would be doing the episode, Disney’s spokesperson was happy to say just how fine they were with it, saying the plot was developed “under the consultancy of child development experts and community advisers. And like Disney Channel programming, it was developed to be relevant to kids and families around the world and to reflect themes of diversity and inclusiveness.” While Disney was fine—so fine!—with its decision to feature a gay couple, the anti-gay group One Million Moms, predictably, was not. Here’s a little bit of the hogwash 250-word “Calling all parents!” bulletin it put out encouraging a viewer and advertiser boycott of the show: “Just because something may be legal or because some are choosing a lifestyle doesn’t make it morally correct.” The move did have two very high-profile fans, though, in Evan Rachel Wood and former Disney princess herself, Miley Cyrus: There are, as there always are, reasons for some to be dissatisfied with the extent of Disney’s gesture, and some who may view it as empty. To begin with, it was a fringe storyline on the episode—not part of the main plot. There’s also the fact that these characters aren’t slated to appear in any more episodes of the series because—oh yeah—the next new episode of Good Luck Charlie will be its series finale. But you know what? That’s still fine. ||||| Last night's episode of Good Luck Charlie, \\"Down a Tree,\\" broke new ground for the Disney Channel with the inclusion of a lesbian couple, the network's first out characters in a series. In the episode, Amy and Bob Duncan set up a playdate for their daughter Charlie and one of her new friends, who just happens to have two moms. The couples come to find that they just don't get along when Bob bores one mom with work stories and the other continuously cuts Amy off, check out a clip below. The inclusion of a family with two moms is a historic move in the right direction for the network which has never before included out gay characters in their series and made-for-TV films. In an interview about the Good Luck Charlie episode, a Disney spokesperson said, \\"Like all Disney Channel programming, it was developed to be relevant to kids and families around the world and to reflect themes of diversity and inclusiveness.\\" During November 2012, the Disney Channel's social outreach campaign \\"Make Your Mark,\\" which encourages and inspires kids to make a difference in the world, featured a 14-year-old named Ben, an aspiring filmmaker who has two moms.

The network featured its first ever same-sex couple on the show Good Luck Charlie. After announcing the decision in June 2013, the channel finally delivered when lesbian mothers Susan and Cheryl dropped off their daughter Taylor for a play date with the main family's daughter Charlie. PHOTOS: Out and proud celebs Disney even added in some humor to the introduction when Charlie's parents Amy (Leigh-Allyn Baker) and Bob (Eric Allan Kramer) are confused about who Taylor's mom was before meeting the couple. \\"Taylor has two moms!\\" Bob declared after meeting the two women, proving he had been right in calling one of the moms Cheryl. \\"Wow, nothing gets past you, Bob,\\" his wife sarcastically replied. PHOTOS: Hollywood's gay power couples Actress Desi Lydic, who played mom Susan, tweeted to excited fans after the episode aired, \\"I'm so proud to be part of that episode! Go Disney! #equality.\\" The show has been on since 2010 and is currently in its fourth and final season. Last June, Disney channel producers spoke with TV Guide about the groundbreaking decision to include a same-sex couple on the children's show. \\"This particular storyline was developed under the consultancy of child development experts and community advisors,\\" a Disney Channel spokesperson told TV Guide. \\"Like all Disney Channel programming, it was developed to be relevant to kids and families around the world and to reflect themes of diversity and inclusiveness.\\" DISNEY CHANNEL/Bob D'Amico At the time of the announcement, former Disney star Miley Cyrus tweeted out in support of her former network's decision.

Life isn't bright sets & wardrobe & kids becoming superstars! This is INSPIRING.\\" But not everyone was as pleased as Cyrus was with the family-based programming. One Million Moms -- the same group who led a boycott on JCPennys for naming Ellen DeGeneres as an ambassador -- posted an official call to action on their website based on the historic episode. PHOTOS: Disney stars through the years \\"Disney has decided to be politically correct instead of providing family-friendly programming,\\" the group wrote. \\"Disney should stick to entertaining, not pushing an agenda. Conservative families need to urge Disney to avoid controversial topics that children are far too young to comprehend.

Mature issues of this nature are being introduced too early and too soon, and it is extremely unnecessary.\\" The Susan and Cheryl characters are not expected to appear on the series after the Jan. 26 episode. ||||| While Queen Latifah was marrying all manner of couples at the Grammys on Sunday night, the Disney Channel slipped its own milestone under the radar: the first appearance of a lesbian couple on one of its TV shows. Advertisement It happened on the sitcom Good Luck Charlie (which is apparently written for the whole family, not just kids). Charlie has a playdate with a new friend, Taylor, who—it turns out—has two moms. As you can see from the clip above, that's treated as no big thing. The problem is, according to TV Guide's synopsis, \\"the potential new friendship is put to the test as one mom chats with Amy, and the other is stuck listening to Bob's dull stories.\\" Disney explained the development of the episode back in June, when it was initially announced: Advertisement \\"This particular storyline was developed under the consultancy of child development experts and community advisors,\\" a Disney Channel spokesperson says. \\"Like all Disney Channel programming, it was developed to be relevant to kids and families around the world and to reflect themes of diversity and inclusiveness.\\" It's strange in this day and age to see lesbian parents treated as a little exotic. Plenty of kids (and probably plenty of kids watching the Disney Channel) are being raised by same-sex couples. Then again, I suppose you could read the little argument over Taylor's mom's name as a lesson in making assumptions. Plus, you're generally doing something worthwhile when it inspires One Million Moms to shit bricks. But Miley approves! Sponsored (h/t Joe. My. God) ||||| Alerting all parents! In a first for the Disney Channel, an episode in the next season of \\"Good Luck Charlie\\" will feature a family with two moms. The episode will air in early 2014 as part of \\"Good Luck Charlie's\\" final season. Because \\"Good Luck Charlie\\" is coming to a close, the characters are only expected to appear in one episode. However, one episode is bad enough, and the network repeatedly airs previews in commercials leading up to new episodes and also replays episodes in reruns. In the storyline, parents Amy and Bob Duncan (Leigh-Allyn Baker and Eric Allan Kramer) set up a playdate for preschooler Charlie (Mia Talerico) and one of her new friends. When the child arrives, the Duncans learn that Charlie's pal has two moms. Disney Channel understands the controversial nature of featuring a same-sex couple on one of its sitcoms and said it took extra care in crafting the episode. \\"This particular storyline was developed under the consultancy of child development experts and community advisors,\\" a Disney Channel spokesperson said. \\"Like all Disney Channel programming, it was developed to be relevant to kids and families around the world and to reflect themes of diversity and inclusiveness.\\" Just because something may be legal or because some are choosing a lifestyle doesn't make it morally correct. Disney should stick to entertaining instead of pushing an agenda. Disney decided to be politically correct versus providing family-friendly programming. Disney has a choice whether to produce a program with certain fictional characters; the storyline could be re-written or changed. Conservative families need to urge Disney to exclude confusing topics that children are far too young to comprehend. Media influences children tremendously. Gay-rights advocate Miley Cyrus, who got her start on the channel's hit series \\"Hannah Montana,\\" has praised the network for the decision. In a post on Twitter, she wrote, \\"I commend Disney for making this step into the light of this generation. They control so much of what kids think!\\" Unfortunately, children are now being exposed to same-sex marriage on a network that is designed for kids. This is the last place a parent would expect their children to be confronted with topics that are too complicated for them to understand. Issues of this nature are being introduced too early and too soon, and it is becoming extremely common and unnecessary. Families tuning in to watch a children's network may encounter a premature discussion on sexual orientation that is completely uncalled for. Disney claims it is not responsible for Gay Days held at the Magic Kingdom because it is out of its hands, but Disney cannot hide behind that excuse any longer and pretend it is not pushing an agenda. One Million Moms will hold Disney accountable for the content produced and marketed directly to young viewers over the Disney Channel Network, which they have complete control over. Take Action Please send Disney an email letter requesting they omit the scene in \\"Good Luck Charlie\\" featuring two moms or do not air this controversial episode at all. If producers keep this episode as originally planned, then conservative families will have no choice but to no longer watch Disney Channel Network in their homes so they can avoid the previews, commercials and reruns for this irresponsible episode. Families will not allow Disney Channel in their homes if they must protest the network veering away from family-friendly entertainment. |||||","completion":"The Disney Channel featured its first same-sex couple in an episode of \\"Good Luck Charlie\\" in 2014.

Movie plot title: The X Files Movie plot: The film opens in prehistoric times in a wordless sequence. A Neanderthal man stumbles upon what appears to be a large, primal, vicious alien in a cave (although the camera work uses zooms and flash-edits to keep the creature from being visualized fully). The two fight, and the caveman wins, stabbing the alien to death. However, fans of the show will recognize the black oil as it bleeds from the alien's wounds and soaks into the Neanderthal. After a fade to modern-day small-town Texas, a little boy (Lucas Black) falls down a hole in his back yard, and finds a human skull. As he picks it up, black oil seeps out from the ground beneath his feet, and black slivers move up his legs until they reach his head - his eyes go black. Shortly afterward, a team of firemen descend to rescue him. They are presumably lost to the same fate as the boy.In the summer of 1998, at the end of the show's fifth season, the X-Files were shut down, and Fox Mulder and Dana Scully were assigned to other projects. They are first seen assisting Special Agent in Charge (SAC) Darius Michaud (Terry O'Quinn), and his FBI team investigating a bomb threat to a Federal building in Dallas, Texas. When Mulder separates from the team to scout out the building across the street, he discovers the bomb in a first-floor vending machine. While Michaud remains to disarm the bomb, Mulder and Scully are able to evacuate the building and prevent hundreds of casualties before it explodes. It becomes clear to the viewer, (but not the agents,) that Michaud is making no effort to disarm the bomb, which ultimately explodes.(Several media commentators noted parallels between this and the real-life 1995 Oklahoma City Bombing.)[1][2]Mulder and Scully return to Washington, D.C., but instead of commending their roles in preventing the deaths of hundreds, they are instead chastised because four victims were still in the building: three firemen, and one little boy.

Kindness Does Not Equate To Weakness In Leadership Following World Kindness Day, it’s a time to reflect on being kind and, for those of us who lead organizations, a time to think about kindness in leadership. For many critics, kindness in leadership equates to weakness. However, in today’s age of open feedback available on the web both from customers and employees, being a kind leader is essential to success. Being a kind leader does not mean that you don’t fire people. It doesn’t mean that you don’t make tough decisions that will impact the bottom line. And it doesn’t mean that you won’t work harder than those who are unkind. It simply means that you are focused as much on the delivery of your message as you are on the message itself. Business leader and blogger Jon Mertz describes it has kind leaders having an “iron fist in a velvet glove.” Think about esteemed leader Colin Powell for just a minute. In his book It Worked For Me, he talks about the skill set needed to be a drill sergeant. While every soldier is taught to fear his or her drill sergeant, the best drill sergeants aim to also instill strength and confidence in their soldiers. By building that strength through kindness, the sergeant is better able to deliver the very tough decisions that they need to make. Do you have what it takes to be this type of leader? Here are three key elements of kind leadership. Be kind to your employees, but remember that your customers deserve kindness too. As a leader, I work really hard to be kind to my employees. One of my greatest accomplishments has been being named a top place to work in New York City. But there have been a few times when my employees have made mistakes at the expense of my clients. While I can be kind in my delivery of a message to my employees, I need to remember that being a good leader is about being kind to customers too. In the services industry, I am responsible for ensuring that my customers (and their customers) have an incredible experience working with us. Being kind to my clients means that I am protective of their end product. And if my employees are not delivering that, they know that I will very kindly tell them that they likely are not the right fit here. And this has been openly communicated to them so that they are never surprised when it happens–because another part of being a kind leader is making sure people always know where they stand. Act like a good dentist. I’ve been to a number of dentists throughout my life and have often been quite fearful of the experience. I’ve found that the very best dentists are the ones who tell me what’s going to happen next. “Carrie, now I’m going to use the polisher…Carrie, I’m going to use a Novocaine needle…Carrie, we’re all done.” When I know what to expect, I am much more apt to trust my dentist. It’s the same in leadership. Being kind is not necessarily singing a song about how wonderful everything is–in fact, it’s almost the opposite. It’s getting everyone on the same page and letting them know what to expect so that you’re all marching in the same direction and end up with the desired result (in the case of a trip to the dentist–it’s clean, pearly whites). Create a culture of ferocious kindness. One of my favorite companies that I’ve ever had the pleasure of working with is BELFOR—the worldwide leader in disaster recovery and property restoration. These guys are fierce–they focus on being the absolute BEST in their category. But they are also incredibly kind and build that into the company’s DNA. One of their mottos is: “Do the right thing, even when no one is watching.” You see this culture of kindness funnel through every aspect of the organization, whether it’s advertising or social media campaigns. And the kindness that Sheldon Yellen, BELFOR’s CEO, showed on the hit show Undercover Boss kept with this theme. BELFOR walks the walk and talks the talk–while simultaneously being focused on being number one in their category. The true magic comes when the ferocity to win and the commitment to be kind are both a part of your company DNA. And what happens when you are not kind? Well, the recent explosion of review sites, both from the consumer side and employee side, would indicate that unkind leaders will be revealed. Almost any time a prospective employee applies to my organization, that person lets me know that he or she has already checked Likeable Media on Glass Door, a review site for employers and employees. You should certainly be kind even when you think no one is watching–but realize that, in today’s day and age, people most definitely are watching your every move. Would you classify yourself as a kind leader? Do you think it’s important to be kind in today’s market? Share below. What is a short summary of the above article?","completion":"Kindness in leadership does not equate to weakness, it means remaining focused on both the message itself and on the delivery of the message. Kind leaders are essential for success in today's age of feedback available on the web from customers and employees. Three key aspects of kind leadership include being kind to employees as well as customers, being clear about expectations and what is to happen next, and creating a culture of ferocious kindness. Kind leaders walk the fine line of being gentle yet firm in their approach and are transparent with their intentions. As unkind leaders are increasingly exposed on review sites, it's crucial to maintain kindness in leadership in today's market."},{"prompt":"Extract the answer to the following question from the movie plot.

His wife tells him that everything in the world is second to his job including her. The two discover they are not alone; a young man (Donnie Wahlberg) appears brandishing a gun. He says that he doesn't want to be afraid anymore and accuses Crowe of failing him. Crowe recognizes him as Vincent Grey, a former patient whom he treated as a child for hallucinations. Grey shoots Crowe in the lower abdomen, and seconds later turns the gun on himself.The next fall, Crowe begins working with another boy, nine year-old Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment), who has a condition similar to Vincent's. Crowe becomes dedicated to this patient, though he is haunted by doubts over his ability to help him after his failure with Vincent. Meanwhile, his relationship with his wife begins to fall apart due to his focus on work.Once Crowe earns his trust, Cole eventually confides in him that he \\"sees dead people that walk around like regular people.\\" Though Crowe at first thinks Cole is delusional, he eventually comes to believe that Cole is telling the truth and that Vincent may have had the same ability. He suggests to Cole that he try to find a purpose for his gift by communicating with the ghosts, perhaps to aid them in their unfinished business on Earth. Cole at first does not want to, because the ghosts terrify him, but he soon decides to try it. One is an overworked wife abused by her husband who slit her wrists; another that tries to hurt Cole is only heard as a voice who starts calmly pleading to Cole to let him out of the dark cupboard because he's suffocating, then yells at Cole that he didn't steal \\"the Master's horse\\" and threatens to attack Cole if he doesn't obey.

The World Education Forum in Dakar was an important global event held in April 2000, where more than 180 countries gathered to discuss and create a comprehensive framework for ensuring access to quality education for children, youth, and adults around the world. At the end of the forum, the Dakar Framework for Action was adopted, which included six main goals intended to be achieved by 2015. These goals sought to improve various aspects of education, such as early childhood care, primary schooling, youth and adult learning, adult literacy, gender equality, and quality of education. In order to effectively implement these goals, it is important to continuously work on them systematically while also closely monitoring the progress and execution of national action plans.

Following the accession of James VII in 1685, Bruce gradually fell from favour, and was distrusted by the new regime. After the Revolution of 1688, and the accession of William of Orange as King, he was once again at odds with his Protestant rulers, and he refused to take up his seat in Parliament. As a staunch Episcopalian, Bruce was considered a potential Jacobite threat. In 1693 he was briefly imprisoned in Stirling Castle for refusing to appear before the Privy Council. He was incarcerated again at Stirling in 1694, and from 1696 in Edinburgh Castle. Bruce was expelled from parliament in 1702, his seat passing to his son John Bruce. Despite these imprisonments, he continued his architectural work, indeed the 1690s and 1700s were his most prolific years. Bruce was imprisoned at Edinburgh Castle again in 1708 and was only released a short time before his death, at the beginning of 1710.He was buried in the family mausoleum at Kinross Kirk. The ruins of the church still stand beside Kinross House, the mausoleum remains intact in the churchyard. Dating from 1675 it is probably by William Bruce in design, initially to house his parents. Bruce's surviving account books show purchases of books on music, painting and horticulture, as well as numerous foreign-language works, suggesting that William Bruce was a learned man. He studied horticulture extensively, and applied his knowledge of the subject in his own gardens at Kinross. He was a friend of James Sutherland of the Edinburgh Botanic Garden, and may have known John Evelyn and other English horticulturalists.

Build a movie plot around this: Whose location is identifying by Warlock? Maryland The answer to this question is:","completion":"Step 1: Establish the main characters and setting To build a movie plot around the statement \\"Whose location is identifying by Warlock? Maryland\\", we first need to establish the main characters and setting. In this plot, our main character will be a talented private investigator named Alex Hart. The antagonist is a powerful warlock named Damien Blackwood who has the ability to locate people using his dark magic. The story takes place in the state of Maryland. Step 2: Define the primary conflict The primary conflict in this movie plot involves Damien Blackwood using his magical abilities to locate and abduct individuals with supernatural potential as part of his plan to create an army to conquer the mortal world. Alex Hart is hired by a secretive organization to track down and stop Damien, as his dark actions have resulted in numerous missing persons cases in Maryland. Step 3: Set up key scenes and elements - Alex is introduced as a skilled private investigator with a reputation for handling unusual cases. - The secretive organization contacts Alex about the Warlock and explains the situation in Maryland. - Alex begins to investigate the mysterious disappearances in Maryland and begins to uncover clues that lead to Damien Blackwood. - Damien becomes aware of Alex's investigation and decides to turn the tables by attempting to locate and abduct Alex. - As Alex gets closer to discovering Damien's lair, he learns more about the motives of the Warlock and the organization that hired him. Step 4: Create a climax and resolution In the climax of the movie, Alex finally locates Damien's lair deep in the heart of Maryland's wilderness. He sets out to confront Damien and save the abducted individuals. During the confrontation, Alex is tested both mentally and physically against Damien's formidable magical powers. In the end, Alex prevails, either by outsmarting or overpowering Damien, or possibly by enlisting the help of the abducted individuals, who are able to use their newfound supernatural powers against the Warlock. With Damien defeated, the abducted individuals are freed. However, not all of the victims are willing to return to their normal lives, leading to a potential sequel where Alex must track down and help those who have chosen to use their powers for nefarious purposes. The answer to the question \\"Whose location is identifying by Warlock? Maryland\\" is that Warlock, Damien Blackwood, is identifying and abducting people with supernatural potential in the state of Maryland, and Alex Hart is tasked with putting an end to his dark plans."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

I can use this background: It would be very unadvisable to place a can of soup over a campfire without venting the can. As the can heats up, it may explode. The kinetic-molecular theory explains why. The air inside the rigid can of soup is given more kinetic energy by the heat coming from the campfire. The kinetic energy causes the air molecules to move faster and they impact the container walls more frequently and with more force. The increase in pressure inside may eventually exceed the strength of the can and it will explode. An additional factor is that the soup may begin boiling which will then aid even more gas and more pressure to the inside of the can. Now, I have a new situation: A team of hikers split into two groups. Group Jones hiked north and camped there overnight. Group George went east. Both groups made campfires and heated cans of soups.

The chain of events unfolded late in the evening on Sunday, January 26th, 2014 when Danny Dipietro was being driven home from hockey practice by his dad. That's when the young boy noticed an open garage and a figure that he believed was a dog outside an apartment near his house. Given the extremely cold weather, the young boy got a feeling that something was not right. But instead of dismissing it like most kids at his age would have, he insisted that his mother, Dawn, go to examine what was going on. Dawn tried to convince Danny that no one would leave a dog out in such cold weather, but he refused to take no for an answer. Dawn finally gave in and decided to take a walk to the area with the family dog and see if there was any truth to Danny's premonition . Sure enough, as she got closer to the apartment she noticed a garage that was wide open and a bent figure, waving madly.

A man disregards the warnings and is attacked while running to his car. A mentally unstable religious woman, Mrs. Carmody (Marcia Gay Harden), decides that this is the beginning of Armageddon. A shaken woman (Melissa McBride), against objections from the others, leaves the store to go home to her children and disappears. While investigating the store's generator, a bag-boy named Norm (Chris Owen) volunteers to go outside, but is snatched and pulled into the mist by a tentacle connected to an unseen monster. Norton heads outside with a small group to seek help, only to be attacked and killed, prompting the rest of the survivors to barricade the shop-front windows.

Poke holes under buckets, fill with water, and place next to tree. Justification: The best way to create a slow garden watering tool is to allow water to seep gradually and directly into the soil, ensuring that the water reaches the roots of the plants. By poking holes in the bottom of the bucket, the water will be released slowly into the soil, giving it enough time to penetrate and be absorbed by the roots. This method also helps to prevent water loss due to evaporation as the water is released directly into the soil rather than exposed to air.

Complete the next sentence: How to apply mulch Select an organic mulch to add nutrients to your lawn. Organic mulches include wood chips, straw, grass clippings, chopped leaves, and compost. When the mulch breaks down, it naturally adds nutrients to the underlying soil.","completion":"First, determine the area you want to cover with mulch and calculate the required amount of mulch needed to cover it. Step 1: Assess the area to be mulched Consider factors such as the type of plants, the local climate, and any specific needs of your landscape. Step 2: Choose the right type and depth of mulch Based on your assessment, select the appropriate organic mulch type from the options available. Determine the depth of mulch needed, typically 2-4 inches for most applications. Step 3: Prepare the area Clear the desired area of weeds, debris, and rocks. This will help ensure the mulch lays flat and prevents weed growth. Step 4: Apply a layer of landscape fabric (optional) If desired, lay a layer of landscape fabric over the area to provide a barrier against weeds while still allowing water and nutrients to pass through to the soil. Step 5: Spread the mulch Using a wheelbarrow, shovel, or rake, spread the mulch evenly over the landscape fabric or prepared area at the recommended depth. Step 6: Keep mulch away from plant stems and tree trunks Make sure to keep the mulch at least 1-2 inches away from plant stems and tree trunks to prevent rot and diseases. Step 7: Water the mulch After mulch is applied, water the area to help settle the mulch into place and stabilize it against wind and erosion. As time progresses, organic mulch will break down and continue to provide valuable nutrients to the soil, promoting healthy plant growth. Consider replenishing the mulch annually or as-needed to maintain its effectiveness."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Pope links prosperity with spreading 'spiritual desert' As he wrapped up a visit to Australia on Sunday, Pope Benedict XVI warned a crowd of 400,000 young people that a feeling of spiritual emptiness often accompanies material wealth. He urged them to avoid the pitfalls of prosperity as he led an outdoor mass for pilgrims who had gathered for the Roman Catholic church's six-day World Youth Day festival in Sydney. \\"In so many of our societies, side by side with material prosperity, a spiritual desert is spreading: an interior emptiness, an unnamed fear, a quiet sense of despair,\\" the pontiff said. The Pope referred to the modern worldâs âhard crust of indifferenceâ to God and said the world âwants to forget God, or even reject him in the name of a falsely conceived freedom.â He urged followers to throw off indifference and embrace a new age free from \\"shallowness, apathy and self-absorption,\\" which he said \\"deadens our souls and poisons our relationships.\\" âA new generation of Christians is being called to help build a world in which Godâs gift of life is welcomed, respected and cherished â not rejected, feared as a threat and destroyed,â the Pope told the crowd. The pope, 81, also announced that Madrid, Spain, would host the next World Youth Day in 2011 and told the pilgrims that he looks forward to being there in three years. The mass came a day after the pope made an apology for the sexual abuse of children by Australia's Roman Catholic clergy, keeping up efforts begun in the United States to publicly atone for what he called \\"evil\\" acts by priests and a \\"grave betrayal of trust.\\" Summary:","completion":"Pope Benedict XVI, during his visit to Australia, warned a crowd of 400,000 young people at an outdoor mass about the spiritual emptiness that often accompanies material wealth.

Faster moving turbulent water typically contains greater concentrations of dissolved oxygen, which supports greater biodiversity than the slow moving water of pools. These distinctions form the basis for the division of rivers into upland and lowland rivers. The food base of streams within riparian forests is mostly derived from the trees, but wider streams and those that lack a canopy derive the majority of their food base from algae. Anadromous fish are also an important source of nutrients. Environmental threats to rivers include loss of water, dams, chemical pollution and introduced species. A dam produces negative effects that continue down the watershed. The most important negative effects are the reduction of spring flooding, which damages wetlands, and the retention of sediment, which leads to loss of deltaic wetlands. Paragraph: Two rivers spring from the same mountain. Olt was a fast moving river, while Mures river was slow moving and deep. Both rivers are very important for the local economies. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which river had a food source mostly derived from algae?","completion":"Based on the given paragraph, the Mures river, which is slow-moving and deep, would have a food source mostly derived from algae. This is because wider streams and those that lack a canopy, like the Mures river, tend to derive the majority of their food base from algae rather than from trees in riparian forests which primarily support fast moving rivers like the Olt. Additionally, slower moving water typically has lower concentrations of dissolved oxygen, leading to less biodiversity and thus making algae the dominant food source."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

After John Dortmunder is released from his latest stint in prison, he is approached by his brother-in-law, Andy Kelp, about another job. Dr. Amusa seeks a valuable gem in the Brooklyn Museum that is of great significance to his people in his country in Africa, stolen during colonial times and then re-stolen by various African nations. Dortmunder and Kelp are joined by driver Stan Murch and explosives expert Allan Greenberg, concocting an elaborate plan to steal the gem. Although the scheme (and each subsequent one) is carefully planned—and keeps increasing in cost—something always goes awry, and the quartet has to steal the diamond again and again. First off, the diamond is swallowed by Greenberg when he alone gets caught by the museum guards during the initial heist. Dortmunder, Kelp, and Murch, at the urging of Greenberg's rotund father Abe, a lawyer, help Greenberg escape from state prison, but they then find he does not have the diamond.

Given the question: Build a movie plot around this: What are the strangers accused of? Of the death of another person or persons The answer is:","completion":"Step 1: Determine the genre of the movie In order to build a movie plot around the question, I need to first determine what genre the movie will be. Considering the theme of accusations involving the death of another person, I'll choose the thriller/mystery genre for this movie. Step 2: Develop main characters To create an interesting movie, strong and well-defined characters are key. In this case, I'll develop three main characters: a) A detective: The primary investigator of the mysterious death(s). b) A victim: The individual(s) who have died under suspicious circumstances. c) Strangers: Several individuals who become linked to the case and are accused of being involved in the death. Step 3: Set the scene and conflict The movie will open with the discovery of the victim's body in a small, close-knit town. The death appears to be suspicious and the detective is brought in to investigate. As the detective delves deeper into the case, he stumbles upon a group of strangers with seemingly no connection to the victim, but eventually become the prime suspects. These strangers just arrived in town, and their sudden appearance adds to the tension and suspicion surrounding the case. Step 4: Introduce the plot twist and complicating factors As the detective continues to build a case against the strangers, unexpected evidence comes to light that puts their guilt into question. This evidence may include conflicting alibis, a hidden motive involving another character in the story, or a previously unknown connection between the strangers and the victim. The detective must now question everything he initially believed and reevaluate his approach to solving the case. Step 5: Climax and resolution The climax of the movie occurs when the detective confronts the strangers directly, leading to a dramatic and tense encounter. Further evidence is revealed, and the detective is confronted with a difficult decision: Does he trust his intuition and pursue charges against the strangers, or does he let them go and continue searching for the truth? In the end, the detective must face his doubts and choose the path he believes will bring justice for the victims. Step 6: Wrap up the movie The movie concludes with the detective revealing the true culprit and solving the case, providing closure for the victims and their families. The strangers' lives are forever changed by the accusations. The detective learns a valuable lesson about trusting his instincts and the importance of thoroughly examining every piece of evidence. In summary, the movie plot revolves around a mysterious death, strangers accused of being involved, and a detective's quest for justice amidst a web of secrets and lies."},{"prompt":"What is the full name of the person who was buried in an unmarked grave in the choir before the dean's stall? Answer the above question based on the context below: By the reign of Henry VII the cathedral was complete, appearing much as it does today (though the fittings have changed). From 1508 to 1546, the eminent Italian humanist scholar Polydore Vergil was active as the chapter's representative in London. He donated a set of hangings for the choir of the cathedral. While Wells survived the Dissolution of the Monasteries better than the cathedrals of monastic foundation, the abolition of chantries in 1547 resulted in a reduction in its income. Medieval brasses were sold, and a pulpit was placed in the nave for the first time. Between 1551 and 1568, in two periods as dean, William Turner established a herb garden, which was recreated between 2003 and 2010.Elizabeth I gave the chapter and the Vicars Choral a new charter in 1591, creating a new governing body, consisting of a dean and eight residentiary canons with control over the church estates and authority over its affairs, but no longer entitled to elect the dean (that entitlement thenceforward belonged ultimately to the Crown). The stability brought by the new charter ended with the onset of the Civil War and the execution of Charles I. Local fighting damaged the cathedral's stonework, furniture and windows. The dean, Walter Raleigh, a nephew of the explorer Walter Raleigh, was placed under house arrest after the fall of Bridgwater to the Parliamentarians in 1645, first in the rectory at Chedzoy and then in the deanery at Wells. His jailor, the shoe maker and city constable, David Barrett, caught him writing a letter to his wife. When he refused to surrender it, Barrett ran him through with a sword and he died six weeks later, on 10 October 1646. He was buried in an unmarked grave in the choir before the dean's stall. During the Commonwealth of England under Oliver Cromwell no dean was appointed and the cathedral fell into disrepair.

A:","completion":"Lechenaultia and Corokia are native to two different countries. Starting with Lechenaultia, this plant genus belongs to the Goodeniaceae family and consists of about 33 species of perennial herbs and shrubs. Lechenaultia is endemic to Australia, which means it is native and found primarily in this country. Within Australia, Lechenaultia thrives in the diverse climates ranging from the arid regions of Western Australia to the temperate environments of the south-western part of the continent. Species of Lechenaultia are known for their aesthetic appeal due to their striking flowers, which come in various colors like blue, orange, yellow, and red. Some popular species in the genus include Lechenaultia biloba (blue leschenaultia), Lechenaultia tubiflora (orange leschenaultia), and Lechenaultia linarioides (yellow leschenaultia). Corokia, on the other hand, is a genus of flowering plants that belong to the Argophyllaceae family. Comprising of approximately 60 species of evergreen shrubs, Corokia is native to New Zealand. Species within this genus are easily identified by their distinctive zigzagging branches, small leaves, and star-shaped flowers (usually yellow or white), followed by clusters of bright, ornamental berries. Corokia species are commonly found in coastal and montane forests, shrublands, and along riverbeds in various parts of New Zealand. Some well-known species include Corokia cotoneaster (wire netting bush), Corokia buddleioides (kohuhu), and Corokia × virgata (wire corokia). In conclusion, Lechenaultia is native to Australia while Corokia is native to New Zealand. Both plant genera exhibit unique characteristics and contribute to the biological diversity of their respective countries."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Perfume intolerance or perfume allergy is a condition wherein people exhibit sensitivity or allergic reactions to ingredients in some perfumes and some other fragrances. Answer this question, making sure that the answer is supposed by the text: is it possible to be allergic to perfume?","completion":"Yes, it is possible to be allergic to perfume. Perfume intolerance, also known as perfume allergy, is a condition wherein individuals exhibit sensitivity or allergic reactions to certain ingredients present in some perfumes and other fragrances. This condition can affect people of any age, gender, and ethnicity and can manifest as a wide range of symptoms. Perfumes and fragrances are often complex mixtures of various synthetic and natural substances, which serve to create the desired scent. Some of these substances may cause sensitivity or allergy in certain people. The most common culprits for perfume allergy are substances such as alcohol, preservatives, dyes, and synthetic and natural fragrances, including essential oils. When someone with a perfume intolerance or allergy is exposed to a fragrance that contains an allergenic substance, their immune system may recognize it as a foreign substance and mount an immune response, causing an allergic reaction. This reaction can result in symptoms ranging from mild to severe, which can include: 1. Skin irritation: Redness, itching, and swelling of the skin upon contact with the perfume or fragrance. In some cases, this can lead to contact dermatitis, a condition characterized by chronic skin inflammation. 2. Respiratory symptoms: Inhalation of the perfume or fragrance may cause sneezing, nasal congestion, difficulty breathing, and wheezing. This could be particularly troublesome for people with asthma or other respiratory conditions. 3. Eye irritation: Exposure to the allergenic substances in a perfume may cause redness, itching, and teary eyes. 4. Headaches: Some individuals who are sensitive to perfume may experience headaches or migraines upon exposure to certain fragrances. 5. Other symptoms: Perfume allergy can also provoke hives (urticaria), exacerbation of eczema, as well as exacerbation of pre-existing respiratory conditions such as asthma. To manage perfume intolerance or allergy, it is important for affected individuals to identify and avoid the fragrances that trigger their symptoms. They should be cautious when using or purchasing personal care products, scented candles, air fresheners, and laundry detergents. Additionally, they can seek the advice of a medical professional, such as an allergist or dermatologist, to determine the specific allergenic substances and receive appropriate treatment for their symptoms. In some cases, a patch test may be conducted to pinpoint the specific allergens causing the reaction. In conclusion, it is indeed possible to be allergic to perfume. Perfume intolerance or perfume allergy represents a sensitivity or allergic reaction to certain ingredients found in perfumes and other fragrances. Identifying and avoiding the specific allergens, as well as seeking medical guidance, can help manage the symptoms and minimize discomfort for the individuals affected by this condition."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: Can the film be seen as an allegory of post-World War II Eastern European political systems? Title: Werckmeister Harmonies Movie plot: The film can be seen as an allegory of post-World War II Eastern European political systems - told as a black-and-white cinematic poem with 39 long, single-camera takes. It examines the brutalization of a society, its political systems and ethics through the metaphor of a decaying circus whale and its star performer. It is set in a desolate, isolated small town in Hungary during Soviet times. The film starts with JÃ¡nos Valuska, a simple person, conducting a poem and dance with drunken bar patrons. The dance is of the total eclipse of the sun, which disturbs, then silences the animals. It finishes with the grand return of the warm sunlight. One of the significant reoccurring characters in this plot is the subtle transitions between light and darkness. The first appearance of this motif is a lamp in the bar, moving to a door into the darkness. The circus arrives like a Trojan Horse in the darkness of night. A window is opened as a glimmer of hope and dressed to shut out the world. The antagonist is only ever seen as a shadow. JÃ¡nos' uncle GyÃ¶rgy is a composer, and therefore one of the intelligentsia. GyÃ¶rgy observes the imperfection and compromise of the musical scale (as defined by Andreas Werckmeister a historical theorist). GyÃ¶rgy proposes changes to the scale to make it more harmonious. This utopian approach to music represents a flawed, naive idealism that never can be achieved; it is not developed any further in the film or the book. It is just a statement indicating that human governance will always be flawed. GyÃ¶rgy's estranged wife tries to leverage her political and social status by giving GyÃ¶rgy a list of names to recruit for the \\"clean up the town movement\\" (with the blessing of the police chief). However, a stuffed smelly circus whale and its star performer, Prince, come to town in the silence and darkness of night. This is a metaphor for a bloated political system and the unseen Prince who represents the power of politically inspired, emotive dogma. JÃ¡nos philosophizes about God and the...

Write a summary based on this article: The Trump administration is moving toward handing back to Russia two diplomatic compounds, near New York City and on Maryland’s Eastern Shore, that its officials were ejected from in late December as punishment for Moscow’s interference in the 2016 presidential election. President Barack Obama said Dec. 29 that the compounds were being “used by Russian personnel for intelligence-related purposes” and gave Russia 24 hours to vacate them. Separately, Obama expelled from the United States what he said were 35 Russian “intelligence operatives.” [The luxurious, 45-acre compound in Maryland being shut down for alleged Russian espionage] In early May, the Trump administration told the Russians that it would consider turning the properties back over to them if Moscow would lift its freeze, imposed in 2014 in retaliation for U.S. sanctions related to Ukraine, on construction of a new U.S. consulate on a certain parcel of land in St. Petersburg. Two days later, the U.S. position changed. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson told Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak at a meeting in Washington that the United States had dropped any linkage between the compounds and the consulate, according to several people with knowledge of the exchanges. 1 of 21 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × Russian compounds in Maryland and New York shut down View Photos Two luxury retreats, in Centreville, Md., and Oyster Bay, N.Y., where Russian diplomats have gone for decades to play tennis, sail and swim, were shut down by the Obama administration in retaliation for Moscow’s alleged hacking in the presidential election.

[Inside the Oval Office with Trump and the Russians: Broad smiles and loose lips] In Moscow on Wednesday, Kremlin aide Yury Ushakov said Russia was “taking into account the difficult internal political situation for the current administration” but retained the option to reciprocate for what he called the “expropriation” of Russian property “if these steps are not somehow adjusted by the U.S. side,” the news outlet Sputnik reported. Senior Tillerson adviser R.C. Hammond said that “the U.S. and Russia have reached no agreements.” He said the next senior- level meeting between the two governments, below the secretary of state level, will be in June in St. Petersburg. Before making a final decision on allowing the Russians to reoccupy the compounds, the administration is examining possible restrictions on Russian activities there, including removing the diplomatic immunity the properties previously enjoyed. Without immunity, the facilities would be treated as any other buildings in the United States and would not be barred to entry by U.S. law enforcement, according to people who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive diplomatic matters. Any concessions to Moscow could prove controversial while administration and former Trump campaign officials are under congressional and special counsel investigation for alleged ties to Russia. [Comey may testify before Senate as early as next week on Trump interactions] Changes in the administration’s official posture toward the compounds come as Russian media recently suggested that Kislyak, about to leave Washington after serving as ambassador since 2008, may be proposed by the Kremlin to head a new position as U.N. undersecretary general for counterterrorism. (WUSA 9) Kislyak, who met and spoke during the campaign and transition with President Trump’s former national security adviser, Michael Flynn; Trump’s White House adviser and son-in-law, Jared Kushner; Attorney General Jeff Sessions; and others, is known to be interested in the post. His replacement as ambassador, Deputy Foreign Minister Anatoly Antonov, was confirmed last month by the Russian Duma, or parliament. Officials in Moscow said Russian President Vladi­mir Putin will officially inform Trump of the new ambassador when the two meet in July, at the Group of 20 summit in Hamburg. It will be Trump’s first meeting with Putin as president. The U.N. General Assembly must first approve establishment of the counterterrorism slot, part of a larger U.N. reorganization and the first new post at that level for decades. Russia will almost certainly claim the slot as the only member of the five permanent members of the Security Council without one of its nationals in a senior U.N. position. Jeffrey Feltman, a former senior U.S. diplomat, is undersecretary-general for political affairs; comparable jobs for peacekeeping, humanitarian affairs and economic affairs are held, respectively, by nationals from France, Britain and China. Secretary General António Guterres will decide who fills the new job, although both Russia and the United States are expected to make their views known. Kislyak has repeatedly rejected descriptions of him in the U.S. media as a spy. Asked whether U.S. intelligence considered him to be one, James R. Clapper Jr., the former director of national intelligence, told CNN on Sunday that “given the fact that he oversees a very aggressive intelligence operation in this country — the Russians have more intelligence operatives than any other nation that is represented in this country, still even after we got rid of 35 of them — and so to suggest that he is somehow separate or oblivious to that is a bit much.” [Russian ambassador told Moscow that Kushner wanted secret communications channel with Kremlin] The Russian compounds — a 14-acre estate on Long Island and several buildings on secluded acreage along the Corsica River on Maryland’s Eastern Shore — have been in Russian possession since the days of the Soviet Union. According to a Maryland deed in 1995, the former USSR transferred ownership of the Maryland property to the Russian Federation in 1995 for a payment of one dollar. Russia said it used the facilities, both of which had diplomatic immunity, for rest and recreation for embassy and U.N. employees and to hold official events. But U.S. officials dating to the Reagan administration, based on aerial and other surveillance, had long believed they were also being used for intelligence purposes. Last year, when Russian security services began harassing U.S. officials in Moscow — including slashed tires, home break-ins, and, at one point, tackling and throwing to the ground a U.S. embassy official entering through the front of the embassy — the Obama administration threatened to close the compounds, former Obama officials said. In meetings to protest the treatment, the Obama administration said that it would do so unless the harassment stopped, and Moscow dropped its freeze on construction of a new consulate to replace the one in St. Petersburg, considered largely unusable because of Russian spying equipment installed there. Russia had earlier blocked U.S. use of a parcel of land and construction guarantees in the city when sanctions were imposed after its military intervention in Ukraine and annexation of Crimea. The threat of closing the compounds was not pursued. In late December, after U.S. intelligence said there had been election meddling, and in response to the ongoing harassment in Moscow, Obama ordered the compounds closed and diplomats expelled. “We had no intention of ever giving them back,” a former senior Obama official said of the compounds. Trump, then at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, appeared to disparage the Obama administration sanctions, telling reporters, “I think we ought to get on with our lives.” Surprisingly, Russia did not respond. It later emerged that Flynn, in a phone conversation with Kislyak, had advised against retaliation and indicated that U.S. policy would change under the Trump administration. [Putin says he won’t deport U.S. diplomats] The Kremlin made clear that the compound issue was at the top of its bilateral agenda. Russia repeatedly denounced what it called the “seizure” of the properties as an illegal violation of diplomatic treaties. On May 8, the U.S. undersecretary of state for political affairs, Thomas Shannon, traveled to New York to meet with his Russian counterpart, Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov on what the State Department described as “a range of bilateral issues” and what Russia called “irritants” and “grievances.” Ryabkov brought up the compounds, while Shannon raised St. Petersburg and harassment, suggesting that they deal with the operation of their diplomats and facilities in each others’ countries separate from policy issues such as Syria and proposing that they clear the decks with a compromise. Russia refused, saying that the compound issue was a hostile act that deserved no reciprocal action to resolve and had to be dealt with before other diplomatic problems could be addressed. In an interview with Tass, Ryabkov said Moscow was alarmed that Washington “carries on working out certain issues in its traditional manner, particularly concerning Russia’s diplomatic property in the states of Maryland and New York.” Two days later in Washington, Tillerson told Lavrov that the United States would no longer link the compounds to the issue of St. Petersburg. Immediately after their May 10 meeting at the State Department, Tillerson escorted Lavrov and Kislyak to the Oval Office. There, they held a private meeting with Trump. The night before, the president had fired FBI Director James B. Comey, who was then heading an FBI investigation of the Russia ties. Comey, Trump told the Russians, was a “real nut job,” and his removal had “taken off” the ­Russia-related pressure the president was under, the New York Times reported. Later in May, the Justice Department appointed former FBI director Robert S. Mueller III as special counsel to oversee the federal investigation. In a news conference at the Russian Embassy after his meetings with Tillerson and Trump, Lavrov said of the compound closures, “Everyone, in particular the Trump administration, is aware that those actions were illegal.” “The dialogue between Russia and the U.S. is now free from the ideology that characterized it under the Barack Obama administration,” he said.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Deforestation rate remains alarming An average of 7.3 million hectares of forest, an area about the size of Sierra Leone or Panama, was destroyed annually in the last five years, theÂ Food and Agriculture Organisation(FAO)Â said on Monday. The lossÂ between 1990 and 2000 wasÂ 8.9 million hectares a year. Deforestation was most extensive in South America, where an average of 4.3 million hectares wasÂ lost annually over the last five years, followed by Africa with 4 million hectares, the Rome-based agency said whileÂ presenting The Global Forest Resources Assessment 2005 (FRA 2005). North America and Oceania saw smaller forest losses over the same period, while forest areas in Asia and Europe grew, the FAO said. \\"While good progress is being made in many places, unfortunately forest resources are still being lost or degraded at an alarmingly high rate,\\" said Hosny El-Lakany, the agency's assistant director-general for forestry. Forests now cover nearlyÂ four billion hectares or 30% of the world's land area. HoweverÂ 10 countries account for two-thirds of all forest area: Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, India, Indonesia, Peru, the Russian Federation and the US. Forests help offset increasingindustrial carbon emissionsOceania lostÂ 356,000 hectares a year betweenÂ 2000-2005, while North and Central America together lostÂ 333,000 hectares a year during the period. Forests help offset increasingindustrial carbon emissions Asia moved from a net loss of around 800,000 hectaresÂ a year in the 1990s to a net gain of one million hectares per year between 2000 and 2005, primarily as a result of large-scale afforestation reported by China. Forest areas in Europe continued to expand, although at a slower rate than in the 1990s. Primary forestsÂ with no visible signs of past or present human activitiesÂ account for 36% of total forest area, but are being lost or modified at a rate ofÂ six million hectares a year through deforestation or selective logging.

Major methodological flaws in the UN's report according to the Rainforest Foundation:- the UN figure for 'net' deforestation is grossly misleading, as it conceals the fact that most deforestation is taking place in the world's tropical rainforests, whereas most of the reforestation and natural re-growth of forests is taking place in the northern hemisphere, and much of this consists of plantations rather than forests; - the UN figure is based on a definition of forest as being an area with as little as 10% actual tree cover, which would therefore include areas that are actually savannah-like ecosystems and badly damaged forests; - areas of land that presently have no trees on them at all, but that are 'expected' to regenerate, are also counted as forests; - the UN includes in its data for existing areas of forest those that are covered by industrial tree plantations, which are actually lacking some of the key functions of true forests.However, the UK-based Rainforest Foundation said the FRA 2005 figures are misleading, inaccurate and understate the real extent of deforestation and damage to forests globally.

He said the new Forest Resources Assessment repeats the bad science of previous assessments, which have been widely criticised, and obscures the real extent of deforestation. Forests have multiple functions, including conservation of biological diversity, soil and water, supplying wood and non-wood products, providing recreation opportunities and serving as carbon sinks. While most forests are managed for multiple uses, FRA 2005 found that 11% are designated principally for the conservation of biological diversity - and such areas have increased by an estimated 96 million hectares since 1990. Around 348 million hectares of forests are used to conserve soil and water, control avalanches and desertification, stabilise sand dunes and protect coastal areas. Around 348 million hectares of forests are used to conserve soil and water, control avalanches and desertification, stabilise sand dunes and protect coastal areas. One-third of the world's forests are mainly used for production of wood, fibre and non-wood products, and more than half have production of these products as one of their management objectives. Forests are particularly important as carbon sinks: the amount of carbon stored in forest biomass alone is about 283 gigatonnes (Gt) of carbon, though it decreased globally by 1.1 Gt annually between 1990 and 2005. Carbon stored in forest biomass, deadwood, litter and soil together is roughly 50% more than the amount of carbon in the atmosphere. Summary:","completion":"The Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) has reported that an average of 7.3 million hectares of forest, equivalent to the size of Sierra Leone or Panama, was destroyed each year in the last five years. Deforestation was most extensive in South America, followed by Africa. While forest areas in Asia and Europe have grown, the FAO noted that forest resources are still being lost or degraded at an alarmingly high rate. Forests cover around 30% of the world's land area, with 10 countries making up two-thirds of all forest area. The Rainforest Foundation criticized the FAO's figures as misleading, inaccurate, and understating the real extent of deforestation and damage to forests across the globe."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

His father Tom (Van Quattro) reprimands him for being up so late and opening the door, sending him off to bed. Instead Derek watches from the stairs as his curious father opens the gift. Finding a musical orb shaped like Santa Claus in the box he activates it, causing it to strangle him with retractable cords; as Tom struggles he slips and falls onto a fireplace poker, his impaled body being found by his wife Sarah (Jane Higginson) a few moments later.Two weeks later, Sarah takes Derek, who hasn't spoken since his father's death, to a toy store owned by the elderly Joe Petto (Mickey Rooney) and his odd son Pino (Brian Bremer) not realizing they have been followed by Noah Adams (Tracy Fraim). After Derek rejects all the toys Joe shows him (and one called Larry the Larvae that Pino tries to give him) he and his mother leave, prompting Joe to begin angrily yelling at Pino, belittling him and blaming him for all the store's recent failures. While running from his father Pino bumps into Noah and drops the larvae toy, which Noah picks up and buys along with some other toys. At his home Noah begins taking apart the toys he bought from Joe when he is confronted by his angry landlord Harold (Gerry Black). Late paying rent Noah, to smooth things over, gives Harold the Larry the Larvae toy in exchange for a one day extension. While driving home Harold is killed when Larry the Larvae crawls into his mouth and bursts out his eye, causing his car to crash and explode.The next day, Sarah takes Derek to see Santa (portrayed by Noah, who takes his friend's shift) at the mall, finding another gift on the porch on the way out.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. One look at Fred Rooney, and you just know he's the good guy. A trace of childish innocence in his face gives the lanky Bethlehem lawyer a Jimmy Stewart-like quality of quiet trust. In black jeans and button-down shirt, he's a kind of folk hero in the south Bethlehem melting pot where he's crafted a law practice catering to working-class families - mostly Latino - in the shadow of the hulkish remnants of Bethlehem Steel. A two-hour drive away, at City University of New York Law School in Queens, Rooney spends several days a week helping upstart lawyers develop storefront practices that, like his, provide legal representation to folks who can't afford a 250-an-hour legal counselor. Kristin Booth Glen, the law school's dean, took one look at Rooney and knew he was the right person to head the innovative Community Legal Resources Network. ''Fred's so low-key, he's Midwestern in effect,'' says Glen, a former New York Supreme Court judge. ''He captivates people, he inspires loyalty.'' For bringing legal representation to the poor and a host of other social causes, including finding medical care for seriously ill children in Latin America, the Moravian College Alumni Association has chosen Rooney for its prestigious Haupert Humanitarian Award. The award, given to only a select few alumni, will be presented at 7:30 tonight at a reception on Moravian's Priscilla Payne Hurd campus. Moravian, where he was an undergraduate in the early 1970s, inspired Rooney's deep sense of social justice. The son of a Bethlehem Steel executive in New York, he came to the Bethlehem campus from an affluent upbringing on Long Island. The young Rooney might have set his sights on Washington, D.C., like his uncle, former U.S. Rep. Fred Rooney of Bethlehem. After all, politics run in the Rooney family. His brother, state Rep. T.J. Rooney of Bethlehem, is a power in the state Legislature and the Democratic Party. But on a trip to Colombia when he was a junior at Moravian, the child of privilege saw human suffering, malnutrition and poverty the likes of which he had never imagined. ''I couldn't understand why we live this way and they live that way,'' Rooney recalled. ''It's been the guiding light of my life ever since.'' After graduating in CUNY Law School's first class in 1986, he took a job with Lehigh Valley Legal Services. Do you have any questions?","completion":"Fred Rooney is a lawyer who embodies the qualities of a good-hearted, hardworking individual driven by social justice. Even as a lanky young man, he had a trace of childish innocence in his face, which made others find him trustworthy - much like the lovable character of Jimmy Stewart. Indeed, Fred Rooney is a bit of a modern-day folk hero, through the law practice that he has established in the south Bethlehem region. In his law practice, Rooney caters to working-class families, who are primarily Latino and often do not have the financial means to afford top-of-the-line legal representation. This is in stark contrast to his own upbringing, as the son of a Bethlehem Steel executive in New York and a member of an affluent Long Island family. Interestingly, it was during his undergraduate studies at Moravian College that he experienced the seeds of social justice which would later define his entire legal career. Rooney's dedication to helping those who cannot afford legal representation took him to the City University of New York Law School in Queens. It is here that he contributes to their innovative Community Legal Resources Network by guiding budding lawyers to establish their own storefront practices that cater to underprivileged communities. His humble and Midwestern-like demeanor, as observed by the dean of the law school, Kristin Booth Glen, captivates and inspires loyalty from others, making him the perfect candidate to head the network. Fred Rooney's commitment to social causes goes beyond the legal realm as he also focuses on finding medical care for children in Latin America who are suffering from serious illnesses. It is because of these selfless acts, along with his passion for bringing legal representation to the poor, that Moravian College alumni have chosen Rooney for the distinguished Haupert Humanitarian Award. While politics also run in the Rooney family, Fred's journey was completely different from his brother's and uncle's, choosing instead to devote his career to social justice after being deeply impacted by the suffering he had seen during a trip to Colombia during his time at Moravian College. Upon his graduation from CUNY Law School in 1986, Rooney's first job was at Lehigh Valley Legal Services. In conclusion, Fred Rooney is a passionate and inspiring lawyer who has dedicated his career to ensuring that those who cannot afford legal representation receive the help they need. His work not only in establishing his own law practice but also in guiding and mentoring aspiring lawyers to do the same underlines a commitment to social justice and compassion for the less fortunate. As a result, he is not only a legal luminary but also an inspiring example of humanitarianism in action."},{"prompt":"In this task, based on the given context word, you are asked to create a pair of sentences each containing a blank (_).

Chief to Step Down, Citing Return to Private Life The veterans’ agency drew embarrassing publicity last year under Mr. Nicholson when thieves took a laptop computer from the home of an employee that held personal data including the names, birth dates and Social Security numbers of millions of Navy and National Guard veterans discharged since 1975. The Federal Bureau of Investigation later determined that the information had not been compromised. Mr. Nicholson said Tuesday that the uproar over the theft resulted in a reorganization, and that this “has really changed the way we do business in this huge agency,” adding, “I feel very good about it.” Bob Wallace, executive director of Veterans of Foreign Wars, described Mr. Nicholson’s time on the job as “kind of rough.” “He came to the job with no real experience about what Veterans Affairs was about,” Mr. Wallace said. “I thought that was very positive because I thought that would mean he would ask a lot of questions and delve into things.” But Mr. Wallace said Mr. Nicholson’s unfamiliarity with how the department worked “overcame” him, adding that he “was gradually getting there” by the end of his tenure. Senator Daniel K. Akaka, Democrat of Hawaii and chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs, said Tuesday that he had to work with Mr. Nicholson “during some challenging times, including an underfunded V.A. during his early tenure in office” but that the secretary was “willing to work with the committee and the Congress on behalf of our nation’s veterans.” Senator Larry E. Craig of Idaho, the ranking Republican on that committee, said Mr. Nicholson “leaves behind a proud record of accomplishment for the nation’s 24.5 million veterans.” He said that Mr. Nicholson had also sought to improve care for veterans with brain injuries and post-traumatic stress disorder, had hired more outreach coordinators to ensure returning veterans get necessary treatments and had approved more than 80 new community clinics around the country. Bobby Muller, the president of Veterans for America, said his organization welcomed Mr. Nicholson’s resignation and called him a product of “political patronage.” Every year Mr. Nicholson has been secretary, Mr. Muller said, the department has had to request emergency supplemental financing from Congress to handle its wartime caseload. The department, with a staff of 235,000, operates 155 medical centers and more than 1,400 treatment centers, and in 2006 provided health care to almost 5.5 million people.

She was known for her delectable cakes and cookies that seemed to have some sort of magic in them – each bite was an explosion of delicious flavors that no one could resist. So, when the community center announced a charity bake sale, there was no question that she should contribute her best creations. As Linda rummaged through her pantry, she suddenly realized that her trusty, old mixer – a gift from her grandmother – had vanished. It was incredibly special to her, and its sentimental value was unmatched. She frantically searched the entire house, tearing apart cabinets and closets, but the mixer was nowhere to be found. Feeling disheartened, she mused that her magical baking prowess would be impossible without her beloved mixer. Meanwhile, Linda's husband Pete was going through a major midlife crisis. He had always fantasized about going on an adventure, somewhere far from the daily routine. As he looked around the humdrum of suburban life, a sudden urge awakened in him to take a trip – a glorious trip to Sin City, Las Vegas. But Pete knew that his sudden impulse could upset Linda, especially considering her busy schedule preparing for the charity bake sale. With Linda distracted in her search for the elusive mixer, Pete quietly assessed the perfect timing for his getaway. Before finalizing his plans, however, he decided to help his wife find the missing appliance. After hours of searching side by side, their efforts proved fruitless, and Linda's hope began to fade. Just when they were about to give up, Pete stumbled upon a garage sale sign posted in the neighborhood. It was one of the local eccentric's sales – Mr. Jackson, who was known for collecting valuable, one-of-a-kind items. Pete thought it would be prudent to check the garage sale before making any Vegas plans. After all, if they found the mixer there, he could be in Linda's good graces for years to come. The next morning, Pete and Linda ventured to Mr. Jackson’s garage sale. As they sifted through piles of vintage knick-knacks and dusty antiques, Pete slowly scanned for any sign of the missing mixer. Just as the couple was losing hope, Pete spotted something that caught his eye – a dusty, old-school mixer that resembled the long-lost appliance. He eagerly grabbed the mixer and presented it to Linda, who was teary-eyed and grateful for the incredible find. It seemed fate was on their side after all. With Linda's prized mixer back in her hands, she felt reinvigorated, knowing she could deliver the perfect baked goods for the charity event once more. Pete, having successfully helped his wife recover her cherished mixer, breathed a sigh of relief. As he hugged Linda and rejoiced in their small victory, he knew it was the perfect moment to propose his own adventure.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. By. Harriet Arkell. PUBLISHED:. 04:40 EST, 10 December 2012. |. UPDATED:. 05:54 EST, 10 December 2012. When archaeologists unearthed the well-preserved tomb of a second-century Roman general that had lain under muddy clay for 1800 years, their find was hailed as the most important ancient Roman monument to come to light for decades. The burial place of Marcus Nonius Macrinus, the general who advised Emperor Marcus Aurelius and fought Germanic tribes in the second century, was found at Saxa Rubra, north of Rome, in 2008, and boasted marble pillars and Latin inscriptions. But despite the joy of historians who pored over the important ancient mausoleum, Italian authorities say it may now have to be reburied as they cannot afford the preservation works necessary to keep it open. Beautifully preserved: The tomb of Marcus Nonius Macrinus lay under thick clay for nearly 2000 years before being excavated in 2008. Austerity measures mean cash for maintaining Italy's archaeological sites has been cut by 20 per cent since 2010, which means that unless a sponsor comes forward soon with the €2-3m (£1.6m-£2.4m) needed to preserve the ancient tomb, it will have to be be covered up. 'It is a painful choice but we cannot risk losing the monument,' Mariarosaria Barbera, Rome's archaeological superintendent, told the daily La Repubblica. 'The marbles can't face another winter [so] we must bury the site in order to preserve it.' Unlike Russell Crowe's character Maximus Decidus Meridius, Macrinus died a rich man after a long and successful career, and his extravagant tomb bears testament to that. With marble roof tiles, a panel carved with Latin script detailing his military career, which included a visit to Spain, and perfectly preserved carvings and friezes, the monument has lain under the thick clay of the nearby river Tiber, which has helped it stay in such good condition. Since it has been opened up, however, cracks have appeared in the stonework and the delicate letterwork has been discoloured by air pollution. 'The general who became a slave. The slave who became a gladiator. The gladiator who defied an emperor': Russell Crowe in the 2000 film, Gladiator. Darius Arya, an American. archaeologist who is campaigning to keep the monument open, said: 'This. is an extraordinary site, it blows you away. 'Burying these remains is a disaster - you wonder what is the point of archaeology.' Maria Grazia Vernuccio, of the heritage group Italia Nostra, told The Observer that cuts were threatening the condition of many historical sites including Pompeii and Villa Jovis, Emperor Tiberius' palace on Capri. She said: 'Over 40 per cent of Italy's archaeological sites are now closed due to lack of funds. Inspectors often cannot even get to the more remote sites in their cars because the ministry won't give them petrol and there is less money for guards to keep looters out.' Macrinus' tomb, which lies close to the ancient Via Flaminia which linked Rome to the Adriatic sea on the east coast, was attacked by looters shortly after it was uncovered in 2008. However the thieves were unable to carry the heavy piece of marble they wanted, and had to dump it nearby. As winter approaches, the filling-in work may begin any day soon. Daniela Rossi, the archaeologist who led the dig, said: 'There are more mausoleums waiting to be revealed along this stretch of the Via Flaminia. It's a gold mine we may never get to see.' Marcus Nonius Macrinus was born in Brescia, northern Italy. Born to a distinguished local family, Macrinus became a senator at around 25 and a consul 16 years later in around 154AD. Macrinus was a general and consul who led campaigns for Marcus Aurelius from 161AD to 180AD. He fought numerous battles against adversaries including the Germanic Quadi and Marcomanni tribes who invaded Italy. He became one of the Emperor's favourites and part of his inner circle, serving as proconsul in Asia.

The tomb was kept in good condition for nearly 2000 years because it was covered by thick clay. But now, the tomb is in danger of being damaged by weather and pollution. The Italian authorities don't have enough money to protect it, so they might have to cover it up again to keep it safe. The tomb is very important because it helps us learn about Roman history.

They tour a luxurious, four-story brownstone and are shown, among other things, the master bedroom which houses an interesting commodity: a panic room. Lydia Lynch (Ann Magnuson), the realtor, explains that the previous owner was a reclusive millionaire who built the hidden panic room as a safeguard against intruders. It's protected with four-inch walls and an impressive security system built in complete with a separate phone line and security cameras situated throughout the townhouse. However, despite Sarah's intrigue, Meg is apprehensive about the room. Still, pressured by the tight market and assured that the home will quickly close, Meg decides to move in right away. After some light unpacking and a pizza dinner, they settle in for the night. Meg checks her daughter's watch, designed to track her blood sugar and keep her type 1 diabetes in check, before retreating to her room to bathe and down a bottle of red wine, clearly distraught over the move and her recent divorce. She attempts to wire the phone system in the panic room but gives up and goes to bed as rain falls outside.Later that night, three men break into the house. Junior (Jared Leto), the grandson of the previous owner and Burnham (Forest Whitaker), an employee of the security system with which the panic room was fitted, intend to steal the 3 million in bearer bonds stored in a floor safe inside the panic room. Burnham is distressed to see, however, that Junior has recruited a buddy of his named Raoul (Dwight Yoakam) to assist in the heist. Burnham argues over Raoul's presence, saying that he knows nothing about him and the plan was for just two of them to quietly go in, get the money, and get out.

The primary focus is on the PM's rejection of these claims. Sentence 2: \\"China Premier Li rejects 'groundless' US hacking accusations\\" This sentence also indicates that China's Premier Li denies the hacking allegations made by the United States. However, there is a significant emphasis on the word 'groundless,' which implies that the accusations have no basis or lack substantial evidence. While both sentences convey the message that China's top official denies the US hacking allegations, there is an additional emphasis on the lack of evidence in the second sentence.

Even on Mindanao, where tens of thousands have been killed over five decades of armed conflict, the week-long battle for Marawi stands out as a fiasco. The army, though, now believes it unwittingly interrupted a plan by the Maute group to take over the city and sack it. Soldiers were following a tip-off that Isnilon Hapilon, leader of the notorious Abu Sayyaf Group and the most wanted insurgent leader in the Philippines, was in Marawi. They had gone in to try to capture him, and were surprised by the number of Maute group fighters inside the city. The result was a week of fierce clashes, air strikes, summary executions and tens of thousands of displaced people. So who are the Maute group? And why are they important on an island which is home to dozens of well-armed groups? A tradition of armed resistance to central government authority goes back centuries in Mindanao. The Spanish colonial administration barely maintained a presence on the island, and the US administration which replaced Spain fought brutal battles with the Moros, as the various Muslim clans of Mindanao are generally called. In the late 1960s the Moros rose up again against the government - after years of settlement by Christians from other parts of the Philippines had left Muslims a minority on Mindanao - under a new nationalist movement, the MNLF. That armed struggle, costing tens of thousands of lives, has continued more or less to the present day, with occasional breakthroughs - like the 1996 peace agreement with the MNLF leader Nur Misuari, and the more recent Comprehensive Agreement on Bangsamoro in 2014 with the MILF, once a breakaway group from the MNLF and now the largest armed organisation on the island. That deal is stalled, but is supposed to create an autonomous Moro state on Mindanao. President Rodrigo Duterte has promised to make peace on the island a priority, but his view of the 2014 deal is not clear as he talks about broader federalism for the Philippines. All those years of conflict have created a warrior culture among young men, and flooded Mindanao with weapons. Private armies and militias wield more power than the official security forces in many areas. They have also created fertile ground for radical Islam. Best known of the radical groups is Abu Sayyaf, founded in 1991 and named after a mujahideen commander in Afghanistan. It was linked to al-Qaeda through support given by Osama bin Laden's brother-in-law. It used to operate only in the far south-west, on the islands of Sulu and Basilan, and became known for a series of kidnappings of foreigners for ransom and for beheading their captives. US forces were deployed to the area in 2002 to help the Philippines military deal with Abu Sayyaf. Despite the deaths of many fighters and commanders, the group continues to fight, though it has now broken into rival factions over the decision in 2014 by Isnilon Hapilon to swear allegiance to so-called Islamic State (IS), and to declare himself the \\"amir\\" of a South East Asian caliphate. Who are the Abu Sayyaf group? But when Hapilon moved to Lanao del Sur, on the main island of Mindanao, apparently after being badly injured in a firefight at the end of last year, a new and potentially dangerous alliance emerged, bringing Abu Sayyaf together with three other small, hardline insurgent forces, who reject peace talks with the government and advocate a Salafi form of Islamic rule. The Maute group is one of them, and, say experts who monitor Islamic groups in the region, the most potent. It was founded five or six years ago by Omar and Abdullah Maute, natives of Lanao del Sur and members of the Maranao clan. They both studied in the Middle East: Omar at Al-Azhar University in Cairo, and Abdullah in Jordan. They both speak Arabic, unlike Isnilon Hapilon, and are well-versed in Salafi and jihadist ideology. They are believed to have many connections with IS supporters in the Middle East. The Maute brothers also have strong family ties to some of the top MILF leaders, which, until recently, gave them access to the resources and training areas of the mainstream insurgent group. They are believed to have formed a close relationship with a well-known Indonesian radical, Sanusi, who was killed by police at the Mindanao State University in Marawi in 2012. The Mautes probably started carrying out terrorist attacks in Mindanao in 2013. But they first grabbed national attention in the Philippines when they raided the prison in Marawi in August last year, freeing 23 inmates. They were then blamed by the authorities for a bomb attack in Davao, President Duterte's hometown, in September, which killed 14 people. They took over the town of Butig late last year, and again in January this year, and despite heavy losses, have continued to clash with the troops sent in to deal with them. Their apparent plan to take over Marawi, coinciding with the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, would have been a huge propaganda coup; their tenacious resistance to the army in Marawi may also now be used to attract more recruits. Perhaps more significantly, they have a number of foreign militants fighting with them, mainly from Indonesia and Malaysia. They are believed to have received training from a skilled Malaysian bomb-maker called Zulkifli \\"Marwan\\" Abdhir, who was killed by the police in 2015. Another Malaysian radical, Dr Mahmud Ahmad, is still thought to be with them. Sidney Jones, who runs the Institute for Policy Analysis of Conflict in Jakarta and is perhaps the best-informed expert on Islamic extremists in South East Asia, believes the Maute group now has overseas sources of funding, probably from Indonesia, she says, but possibly Syria. The Mautes, she says, are the brains behind the attempt to establish an alliance loyal to IS in Mindanao, not the self-styled \\"amir\\" Isnilon Hapilon, for whose capture the US is offering a 5m (Â£3.9m) reward. She believes the Philippines government has underestimated the strength of the Mautes, and their capacity to act as a crucible for terrorist actions across the region. Ms Jones says that today Indonesian militants are able to travel freely to the Philippines, on scheduled flights, to buy weapons in Mindanao. Her fear is that as IS is forced to retreat further in Syria and Iraq, the hundreds of Indonesian and Malaysian militants fighting there will come home, and be looking for new opportunities to wage jihad. The Maute group and its new alliance will offer an ideal partnership for them. \\"President Duterte's declaration of martial law is just a band-aid,\\" Ms Jones says. \\"The government has turned a blind eye to how these groups have united; it keeps downplaying the threat they pose. But these four groups together now have a geographic reach pro-IS groups in the Philippines have never had before.\\" It is worth remembering that the last time South East Asia faced a sustained terrorist threat, it also germinated in Mindanao. Jemaah Islamiyah, the group that carried out the devastating Bali bombing in 2002, which killed 202 people, most of them tourists, originated in Indonesia and Malaysia in the 1980s. But it learned its lethal bomb-craft from veterans of the Afghan war, mostly in training camps inside MILF-controlled areas. Today the MILF is more wary of hardline militants within its ranks as it pursues a still elusive final autonomy settlement with the government. The Mautes have been expelled from MILF areas in the past, and get little co-operation today. But while poverty and violence still afflict the southern Philippines, the radical groups will appeal to many young Muslims, and pose a significant threat to the mainstream MILF leadership, to other parts of the country vulnerable to terrorist bombings, and even to the wider region.

With the Raiders tied with both the Chargers and Chiefs atop the AFC West, the Raiders traveled to Kansas City with only four games left in the season. Looking to give themselves the tiebreaker with the Chiefs and stay above .500 on the season, the Raiders failed miserably. The defense allowed a field goal on the Chiefs' first possession to fall behind 3-0. The Chiefs extended the lead on the first play of the second quarter as Kareem Hunt scored from one yard out. Trailing 10-0, the Raider offense was only able to get one first down on their first three possessions. The Chiefs, scoring on their third straight possession, got another field goal to move their lead to 13-0. The Raiders began to move the ball on their ensuing possession, moving into Chiefs territory. However, Derek Carr was intercepted at the Chief 24 to end the drive. The Chiefs added another field goal on the ensuing possession, moving the lead to 16-0 with 1:45 remaining in the half. The Raiders quickly went three and out, giving the Chiefs, who had scored on their first four possessions, the ball with 1:14 remaining. The defense was able to keep the Chiefs from scoring as the half ended. The Chiefs began the second half with another field goal to take a 19-0 lead. A Raider three and out preceded the first punt of the game by the Chiefs. Looking to take advantage of the defense's first real stop of the game, Carr hit Johnny Holton on a 19-yard pass on the first play of the drive, but Holton fumbled and the Chiefs recovered. The Chiefs immediately turned the ball back over as Alex Smith was intercepted on the first play of the ensuing drive. However, the Raiders failed to convert on the turnover and punted to the Chiefs again. Four plays later Charcandrick West scored on a 13-yard run to extend the Chief lead to 26-0 and all but ending the game. After the teams exchanged punts, the Raiders finally scored with just under nine minutes left in the fourth quarter as Marshawn Lynch rushed 22 yards for a touchdown. Following a successful two-point conversion, the Raiders recovered an onside kick and Carr hit Jared Cook on a 29-yard pass to narrow the lead to 26-15. Electing not to attempt another onside kick, the Chiefs took over and were able to run nearly five minutes off the clock before punting to the Raiders with 2:39 remaining. The Raiders were able to move the ball, but Carr was intercepted in the end zone with 46 seconds left and the Chiefs were able to run out the clock. The 26-15 loss moved the Raiders to 6-7 on the season. The Raiders again struggled as the defense gave up 408 yards while the offense managed only 268, most of which occurred after the game had been decided.

Information: - The Pacific Northwest (in the United States, commonly abbreviated as PNW), sometimes referred to as Cascadia, is a geographic region in western North America bounded by the Pacific Ocean to the west and loosely, by the Rocky Mountains on the east. Though no agreed boundary exists, a common conception includes the U.S. states of Oregon and Washington and the Canadian province of British Columbia. Broader conceptions reach north into Alaska and Yukon, south into far northern California and east to the Continental Divide, thus including Idaho, Western Montana, and western Wyoming. Narrower conceptions may be limited to the northwestern US or to the coastal areas west of the Cascade and Coast mountains. The variety of definitions can be attributed to partially overlapping commonalities of the region's history, geography, society, and other factors. - In geography, a confluence is the meeting of two or more bodies of water. Also known as a \\"conflux\\", it refers either to the point where a tributary joins a larger river, (main stem), or where two streams meet to become the source of a river of a new name, such as the confluence of the Monongahela and Allegheny rivers in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania creating the Ohio River. - Portland is a seaport and the largest city in the U.S. state of Oregon and the seat of Multnomah County. It is in the Willamette Valley region of the Pacific Northwest, at the confluence of the Willamette and Columbia Rivers. The city covers and had an estimated population of 632,309 in 2015, making it the 26th most populous city in the United States. Approximately 2,389,228 people live in the Portland metropolitan statistical area (MSA), the 23rd most populous MSA in the United States. Its Combined Statistical Area (CSA) ranks 17th with a population of 3,022,178. Roughly 60% of Oregon's population resides within the Portland metropolitan area. - A combined statistical area (CSA) is composed of adjacent metropolitan (MSA) and micropolitan statistical areas (µSA) in the United States and Puerto Rico that can demonstrate economic or social linkage. The United States Office of Management and Budget defines a CSA as consisting of various combinations of adjacent metropolitan and micropolitan areas with economic ties measured by commuting patterns. These areas that combine retain their own designations as metropolitan or micropolitan statistical areas within the larger combined statistical area. - Carson Friedman Ellis ( born October 5 , 1975 ) is an artist living in Portland , Oregon .

Choices: - through germination - through cell respiration - through photosynthesis - through water uptake A:","completion":"A: Most growing plant cells expand through water uptake. For plant cells to grow and eventually expand, they need to undergo a process called cell enlargement, which is primarily driven by water uptake. Each cell in a plant has a central vacuole, a sort of storage within the cell that holds materials and wastes. Additionally, the vacuole is also important for plant growth as it sustains turgor pressure that prevents the plant from wilting. In growing plant cells, this central vacuole expands by taking in water, causing the cell to become larger. The process starts when water moves from an area of lower solute concentration (outside the cell) to an area of higher solute concentration (inside the cell), a movement facilitated by osmosis. When water enters the plant cell, it fills the central vacuole and induces a pushing pressure against the cell wall. The cell wall, which is flexible yet strong, expands but holds its shape due to its composition of cellulose and other materials. This pressure is then balanced by the rigidity of the cell wall, creating turgidity and causing the plant cell to become rigid and stand upright. Moreover, the growth of plant cells not only relies on the water uptake, but also on the synthesis and rearrangement of the component of the cell wall. During growth, new materials must be inserted into the cell wall to allow it to flex and expand, this process is controlled by enzymes and other proteins that are produced by the plant cell. As for the other choices, germination is the process by which plants emerge from seeds and begin growth, not how the cells themselves expand. Cell respiration is a set of metabolic reactions and processes that take place in the cells of organisms to convert biochemical energy from nutrients into adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and then release waste products. Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants and some other organisms use sunlight to synthesize foods with the help of chlorophyll pigments. However, all these processes, while crucial for overall plant development and survival, do not directly cause the expansion of individual plant cells. That role belongs to water uptake."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

The shot then changes to teenager Jill Johnson (Camilla Belle) who is going through a teenage crisis, having her boyfriend, Bobby (Brian Geraghty), cheat on her with her best friend Tiffany (Katie Cassidy), and going over 800 minutes on her cell phone, for which her dad, Ben (Clark Gregg), has her babysit for a wealthy family to pay the debt.

Tiffany visits but Jill, fearing getting into further trouble, asks her to leave. However, tree branches knocked down by the storm outside block the road.

Jill calls the police, who tell her they can trace the calls if she is able to keep him on the line for one minute. While waiting for the phone to ring, Jill sees someone in the guesthouse.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize this article in one sentence. A major part of keeping your relationship exciting when you’re apart is being able to look forward to when you will see one another again. Plus, having distance between the two of you makes every moment you do get to be together all the more special. Aim to see one another as much as you can. And, after each visit, you should set a date for when you will meet again. The time apart will be more exciting when you have a date in the future to get excited about. If the distance is too far, try to compromise. One person can visit the other the first time, and then vice versa for the next visit. You can also meet halfway in an interesting city for a mini-vacation. Doing this allows both of you to save on travel costs and times. The two of you can’t meet up on Fridays or Saturdays to see a movie or go to the park, but you can still have date night. Be sure to download a video call application such as Skype or Google Hangouts. These applications allow you to see your date in real-time, so you can pretty much do whatever you’d do on a regular date via a video call. One suggestion might include ordering takeout meals or cooking a meal and then eating at the same time by candlelight. Do whatever you two would normally do on a date night over the call. Distance can make the heart grow fonder, especially when you spice things up every now and then. A great way to keep your LDR smoking hot is to tend to your intimacy needs. You can send flirty pictures of yourself blowing kisses in sexy poses or send a teasing message telling your date how you’ve been thinking about him or her all day. Do what feels comfortable to you and your partner. Imagine how it will brighten your special someone’s day to receive a package in the mail from you. Of course, shipping can be expensive on large items, so be creative and do something that fits your budget. Examples of nifty gifts can be a handwritten love letter, a funny card, a framed photograph of you, some home-baked cookies, or a new CD. Consider what your date really likes and send a little something that says “I’m thinking of you.” It may even be a sign of a commitment if each of you gifts a personal item for the other to keep for a time. This might include a special shirt or an inexpensive piece of jewelry. Keeping the spark alive can also extend to your online profiles. Even if the two of you aren't together everyday, it can make things even more exciting to demonstrate your commitment to the world. You can set your statuses as \\"in a relationship\\" or share cute picture of your partner on your Facebook or Instagram pages. Be forewarned, social media can be a great way to express your affection for your long-distance love. Unfortunately, it can also be a source of tension. Set boundaries with your partner about what both of you expect on social media. Since each of you are likely to spend more time with friends than each other, your expectations need to be clear to minimize jealousy after your partner posts photos of him/herself at a wild party.

The trout was light, flavorful - I would consider ordering both again. We tried the flour-less chocolate cake with the beet ice-cream for desert - the chocolate was rich, but not overly sweet and the beet ice-cream was good.

The war ended in 1996, with a Chechen separatist victory establishing a de facto independent Chechnya. Barayev formed the Special Purpose Islamic Regiment, where he and his associates became infamous for their alleged part in a wave of lawlessness which swept the devastated country. Crimes include including brutal killings and kidnappings as well as suspected involvement in two failed attempts to assassinate the Chechen president Aslan Maskhadov, and the successful assassinations of the Chechen interior minister Nasrudi Bazhiyev, and Shadid Bargishev, head of the newly formed anti-abduction service. The group, based around the town of Urus-Martan, were linked to a series of high-profile crimes including the notorious murder of six foreign Red Cross employees shot dead in the hospital of Novye Atagi in September 1996, as well as the kidnappings of Yelena Masyuk, a Russian NTV journalist and personal friend of President Maskhadov, and Valenti Vlasov, Russian president Boris Yeltsin's envoy to Chechnya. Other high-profile hostages allegedly kidnapped by Barayev included the ORT journalists Roman Pereveztsyev and Vladislav Tibelius, an Italian journalist Mauro Galligani, British children-aid workers Camilla Carr and Jon James (during a failed operation to rescue them, the Chechen anti-kidnap unit commandos engaged in a deadly clash with \\"unknown terrorists\\", unofficially Salman Raduyev's men; they were eventually ransomed by Boris Berezovsky) and others. In 1997, Maskhadov signed a decree putting Barayev and his Special Purpose Islamic Regiment under the command of the Chechen interior ministry. Barayev, who also held the post of deputy commander of the National Guards, however refused to obey the order. When six of his men were detained in Ingushetia, Barayev attacked an Ingush police post and took hostages; one of them was killed and the rest were prisoner-swapped. Two more of his men were captured in Chechnya and made to confess to kidnappings on the state TV. His militia and some Islamist allies from Shariah Security forces fought with the Chechen government forces in a large-scale gun battle in the city of Gudermes in the summer of 1998. Between 50 and around 80 people were killed in the mutiny. The SPIR was not disarmed, but Barayev was stripped of his rank of Brigade General and declared as the \\"enemy of Ichkeria and the Chechen people\\". In December 1998, Barayev proclaimed the Supreme Council of Islamic Jamaats, dug trenches around Urus-Martan and threatened to attack targets across and outside of Chechnya if Maskhadov tried to fight them. A commonly accusation against Barayev regarded the late 1998 abduction and beheading of four foreign mobile phone engineers. It was claimed that the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (FSB) outbid the employers of kidnapped British engineers to get them decapitated by Barayev and his gang rather than be released; supposedly, the video and photographic materials of their executions fed the FSB anti-western propaganda efforts at beginning of Second Chechen War. A former Russian hostage Abdurakhman Adukhov told the BBC that Barayev told him it was actually Osama bin Laden who paid him 30m for the atrocity, outbidding the ransom offer of 10m.

Winston is chided by his wife Clemmie for their lack of money and is aware that as a 'man of destiny' his moment may have passed. At the same time he struggles in the House of Commons as a backbencher to get a hearing for his concerns about German re-armament under Hitler and the policy of appeasement. Churchill is also disappointed by the behaviour of his son Randolph Churchill (Tom Hiddleston), which leads to further arguments with Clemmie, who announces she is leaving to go on an extended overseas trip. Churchill is devastated and throws himself into his pet activities: painting, and building walls around the family house. Clemmie eventually returns, and the couple are reconciled. During the same period, a young official in the government, Ralph Wigram (Linus Roache) has become concerned about the growth of the German Luftwaffe (air force), and is convinced by his wife to leak information about it to Churchill. Shortly afterwards, Churchill uses Wigram's information to launch an attack on the appeasement policies of Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin (Derek Jacobi). In 1936, Wigram commits suicide.

Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise? Select from: [a]. yes. [b]. it is not possible to tell. [c]. no. And the answer is:","completion":"[c]. no. The hypothesis is not entailed by the premise provided. The premise depicts a scenario where people are facing hardships and experiencing job loss. The underlying tone of the given premise suggests that the job market is possibly weak or unstable, and that good and hardworking individuals are struggling to maintain and secure employment. This scenario appears to be a byproduct of the contemporary economic environment, which may include factors such as a sluggish economy, high unemployment rates, or a substantial shift in the types of jobs available. In contrast, the hypothesis asserts that the job market is currently strong, which implies a more robust and thriving employment landscape, with numerous opportunities available for job seekers. A strong job market is typically associated with low unemployment rates, increased job creation, and a positive economic outlook. This disconnect between the premise and hypothesis highlights a discrepancy, as the premise illustrates a struggling job market, while the hypothesis claims that the job market is robust and healthy. Therefore, the answer is [c]. no, as the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise given, given that the premise suggests a struggling job market, while the hypothesis indicates a strong job market.

Earlier this week, @naval (CEO and co-founder of AngelList) asked a question on Twitter: \\"The challenge of the next decade is not Artificial Intelligence, but Human Intelligence. Can we retrain the workforce as knowledge workers?\\"\\" At the heart of his question is an interesting observation. As automation and artificial intelligence replaces manual jobs, how do we retrain people in the new knowledge economy where information handling and management is in high demand? I thought I would share some experiences, observations, and recommendations based upon when I did this previously in my career. Back in 2004 I was peddling my wares as a journalist, writing for the tech press. I was living in the West Midlands in England and heard about a new organization in nearby Birmingham called OpenAdvantage. The premise was neat: open source was becoming a powerful force in technology and OpenAdvantage was set up to provide free consultancy for companies wanting to harness open source, as well as individuals who wanted to upskill in these new technologies. At the time in the West Midlands lots of industry was being automated and moved out to Asia, so lots of Midlanders were out of jobs and looking to retrain. This required, by definition, retaining the workforce as knowledge workers. OpenAdvantage was funded by the UK government and the University of Central England, had a decent war chest, and was founded by Scott Thompon and Paul Cooper (the latter of which I met when he heckled me at a talk I gave at a Linux User Group once. 🙂 ) So, I went along to their launch event and wrote a piece about them. Shortly after, Paul and Scott invited me back over to the office and offered me a job there as an open source consultant. I took the role, and this is where I cut my teeth on a lot of open source, community, and working with businesses. We had crazy targets to hit each month, so we ended up working with and training hundreds of organizations and individuals across a wide range of areas, and covering a wide berth of open source... Why were a lot of Midlanders out of work?

Choose your answer from: -- no. -- yes.","completion":"To determine if an elevator can lift Thor's hammer, we need to consider the rules surrounding lifting his hammer and the properties of an elevator. Step 1: Understanding the properties of Thor's hammer Thor's hammer, Mjolnir, can only be lifted by those who are deemed worthy by the enchantment placed on it by Odin. If someone is unworthy, they cannot lift it. Step 2: Evaluating if an elevator can be worthy An elevator is an inanimate object and does not possess the ability to be worthy or unworthy, as the concept of worthiness applies to beings with consciousness and morality. Step 3: Considering the condition of lifting Mjolnir If the elevator is simply moving between floors and Thor's hammer is placed on the elevator floor, technically it is not \\"lifting\\" the hammer in terms of overcoming the enchantment since it is not attempting to move Mjolnir with the purpose of wielding it. Conclusion: Based on the rules surrounding Mjolnir and the properties of an elevator, an elevator can move between floors with Thor's hammer resting on it, as the enchantment applies to worthiness and conscious beings. Now, let's evaluate if the two questions are inquiring about the same information: Question 1: \\"Can an elevator actually lift Thor's hammer?\\" Question 2: \\"Could an elevator lift Thor's Hammer?\\" Answer: The answer is -- yes.

The team, including fellow researchers and archaeologists, embarks on a journey to uncover ancient artifacts in a newly discovered ruin site near the island of Sicily. Upon arrival, Joyce stumbles upon a mysterious clue that leads to the discovery of an obscure ancient capsule – the Brazen Bull. The team realizes that the capsule is an ancient Greek torture device utilized by the influential tyrant, Phalaris, to silence his opponents. Legend has it that the victim would be placed inside the bull, and a fire beneath would slowly roast them alive. Act II: While the team attempts to understand the origin of this device, strange occurrences begin to unfold within the archaeological camp. Equipment begins to malfunction, and members of the team start to vanish inexplicably. As Joyce and her colleagues search for their missing peers, they're overwhelmed by a feeling of constantly being watched. One night, while examining the capsule, Joyce discovers a hidden compartment with a series of complex symbols etched upon it. As she begins to decode the cryptic message, the capsule suddenly closes around her, trapping her inside the Brazen Bull. Act III: Joyce's friends must put their knowledge of ancient artifacts to the test, attempting to break the intricate lock and save her from impending doom.

Ted Cruz of Texas urged voters in Kansas’ 4th District to support Ron Estes in Tuesday’s congressional special election. Cruz, a 2016 presidential candidate, rallied Monday afternoon with about 200 Estes supporters in a hangar stop near Eisenhower National Airport, the last major campaign event leading up to Tuesday’s election. He called on members of the crowd to vote and to take nine others with them to the polls. “Our enemy right now is complacency,” he said. Our enemy right now is complacency. U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, at a rally in support of Republican congressional candidate Ron Estes Estes, the Republican state treasurer, is locked in a hard-fought battle with Democratic civil rights attorney James Thompson for the seat vacated by former Rep. Mike Pompeo. Libertarian Chris Rockhold, a flight instructor, is also in the race. Cruz said Donald Trump’s victory in the November presidential election was an “overwhelming cry from the American people to change the path we’re on.” “That’s the mandate we’ve been given with a Republican president and both houses of Congress,” Cruz said. He said it’s important to send Estes to Congress to work toward repealing the Affordable Care Act, reforming tax policy and cutting regulation on business. He called Thompson “another knee-jerk vote for (House Minority Leader) Nancy Pelosi.” Cruz deflected a question about whether his presence indicated concern at the national Republican Party level about an Estes victory on Tuesday. “My being here is indicative that I think this race matters,” Cruz said. GOP boost Cruz’s visit was part of a full-court press by the national GOP to boost Estes’ campaign in the final days. “On Tuesday, Republican Ron Estes needs your vote and needs it badly,” President Trump told voters in an automated call on Monday, calling Estes “a conservative leader who’s going to work with me to make America great again.” More Videos 1:12 'Stranger Things' comes to College Hill for Halloween Pause 1:11 Bishop Carroll advances to 5A soccer semifinals 0:39 Denver Broncos' Jamaal Charles and Kansas City Chiefs' Charcandrick West exchange jerseys 4:11 Flying with QuikTrip 2:39 Fighting crime with pipettes and microscopes 3:00 Chiefs' Alex Smith after 29-19 win over the Broncos 1:21 Chiefs linebacker Justin Houston talks about stopping the Broncos offense 1:04 Kansas City Chiefs head to locker room after beating the Denver Broncos 0:31 More Shockers basketball players hawk queso 1:29 Retiree talks about working for Tyson Video Link copy Embed Code copy Facebook Twitter Email President Trump records robocall urging voters to back Estes Hear President Trump’s robocall urging voters to vote for GOP congressional candidate Ron Estes.

Cruz is a popular national GOP figure among Kansas Republicans, admired for his strong positions on social issues, especially his opposition to abortion. Last year, he was an easy winner over Trump in the Kansas Republican presidential caucus. Thompson said he’s not intimidated that Estes brought in Cruz to campaign for him. He said he thinks it shows the weakness of the Estes campaign. I love the fact that he can’t fight his own fights. James Thompson, Democratic congressional candidate, on Ron Estes “I love the fact that he can’t fight his own fights,” Thompson said. “He’s got the vice president making phone calls for him. He’s got the speaker (House Speaker Paul Ryan) who’s sent out a fundraising letter, and now he’s got Senator Cruz coming in, and I’m still here fighting the same fight I’ve been fighting all along. “I think it’s sad he can’t do debates, he can’t do his own fundraising and he can’t fight his own fight,” Thompson added. “So if he can’t do any of those things, why is he running in the first place?” Rally reactions Back at the airport, tax accountant Myron Ackerman, 62, was fairly typical of the crowd. He’s been active in conservative politics and said he once served as a campaign treasurer but never will again. “I’ve worked with Ron’s wife a lot for Americans for Prosperity,” he said. In November, Susan Estes left that organization, which was founded and funded by Koch Industries executives and advocates for low taxes and light regulation of business. “If her husband listens to Susan, I know he’s going to hear good things,” said Ackerman, whose biggest concerns are national security and the recent missile attack by the U.S. on Syria. “I hope it’s a good rally point for the party to get out and vote tomorrow,” added Jonathan Bender, an aircraft maintenance worker for Yingling Aviation, which hosted the event. He liked what he heard. “All of them (speakers at the rally) speak to my moral and ethical values. That’s why I align myself with the Republican Party,” he said. “Of course, the right to life, health care reform, gun control, those are all issues that are near and dear to me anyway.” Cruz drew some of his biggest applause when he pressed for a flat tax and for abolishing the Internal Revenue Service. In a statement he called “somewhat tongue-in-cheek,” he proposed padlocking the IRS building in Washington and sending its 90,000 employees to the southern border to deter illegal immigrants. He said if you walked across the desert to the border and found 90,000 IRS agents waiting, “You’d turn around and go home, too.” The 4th District seat has been open since late January, when Pompeo resigned from Congress to accept a position as director of the Central Intelligence Agency in the Trump administration. The election marks the first major electoral test since Trump won the presidential election in November and the first of four congressional elections to fill seats vacated by Trump appointees. ||||| WICHITA — President Donald Trump stepped Monday into an unusually competitive special congressional election in Kansas, recording a get-out-the-vote call on behalf of Republican candidate Ron Estes. The robocall from Trump came as the contest also pulled U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas to Wichita to campaign for Estes and amid a flood of out-of-state GOP money ahead of Tuesday’s election in the 4th Congressional District of southern Kansas. It was the first special congressional election since Trump’s election as president last year. \\"Republican Ron Estes needs your vote and needs it badly,\\" Trump said in the minute-long call. \\"Our country needs help. Ron is going to be helping us, big league.\\" The Associated Press obtained a recording of the call from a person close to the campaign who did not want to be identified because it was being released ahead of an official announcement. The person said it was recorded over the weekend. The Kansas Republican Party later tweeted that Trump’s call was going to \\"tens of thousands\\" of prospective voters. The vote in Kansas will be the nation’s first congressional election since Trump’s victory, and the contest in the heavily Republican district was watched across the nation for any sign of waning support from the president’s supporters. Trump won with 60 percent of the votes cast in the 17-county congressional district of south-central Kansas. Trump’s call came after the Estes campaign used a similar call recorded by Vice President Mike Pence, starting Saturday. His Democratic rival, James Thompson, is spending the final day of campaigning before Tuesday’s election talking directly to voters. Thompson’s campaign says he’s countering the visit by Cruz — who vied with Trump for the Republican presidential candidacy — by knocking on doors, going to diners and doing interviews. At stake is a House seat Republicans have held for more than two decades. The vacancy was created when Trump chose former U.S. Rep. Mike Pompeo as his CIA director. A raft of big GOP campaign donations and a last-minute ad buy last week of nearly 100,000 by the National Republican Congressional Committee also signaled GOP anxiety over the seat, flooding the local airways with negative advertising against Thompson, a civil rights attorney. Big out-of-state campaign donations have been flowing in the waning days of the campaign to the Republican’s coffers. The last-minute national GOP interest comes in a race in which Estes, the state’s treasurer, had been expected to coast easily to victory. After a missed candidate event last week, Thompson’s campaign noted that Estes has failed to show up in 10 candidate forums and debates during the campaign and attended just three others. \\"James Thompson is countering the Cruz visit by talking with voters — something Ron Estes has refused to do. Ron Estes is not raising his own money, he is not campaigning for himself and he is too afraid to go face voters himself,\\" said Chris Pumpelly, his campaign spokesman. Thompson’s campaign announced Monday that it hit 20,000 in total donors to its campaign, which has mostly come in as small dollar donations in the past 76 days. The Kansas Democratic Party contributed 3,000 to him, but the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has not put any money into the race that has now turned unexpectedly competitive in the deep red state. \\"James Thompson has done all of this on his own,\\" Pumpelly said. \\"He is interested in talking with voters, he is not going to be hiding behind any D.C. politicians like Ron Estes is.\\" Republicans have represented the district since Todd Tiahrt unseated veteran Democratic Rep. Dan Glickman in 1994. Pompeo won the state’s 4th District seat in 2010, when Tiahrt gave it up to run unsuccessfully for the U.S. Senate. Trump’s administration picks and a California Democratic appointment has created five openings in the U.S. House, where Republicans have a 237-193 edge. Republicans are defending four GOP-leaning seats — in Kansas, Georgia, Montana and South Carolina — while Democrats are protecting a seat in a liberal California district. ___ AP Political Writer John Hanna in Topeka, Kansas, also contributed to this report. ||||| Kansas has been reliably Republican in federal elections, but GOP operatives head into Tuesday uncertain of an easy victory when the deep-red state holds the first congressional election since President Donald Trump’s inauguration. Republican Ron Estes, the twice-elected state treasurer, faces Democrat James Thompson and Libertarian Chris Rockhold in the race to replace former Rep. Mike Pompeo, who gave up his seat in January to head the CIA. Pompeo, a Wichita Republican, won re-election in Kansas’ 4th Congressional District by 31 percentage points in November. The last time a Democrat won the district — which is home to Republican megadonor Charles Koch — was in 1992. But Republicans say they are in a tight race.

Trump and Vice President Mike Pence have recorded robocalls to urge voters in the Wichita area to vote for Estes. U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, the Texas Republican firebrand who won the state’s GOP presidential caucus last year, flew into Wichita for a rally Monday. An internal poll circulating among Republicans showed Estes up by only a single point as of last week. Trump’s call suggests the urgency of the situation. “Ron Estes needs your vote, and needs it badly,” the president says in the call to voters. An Estes loss — or even a win by only a slim margin — would likely be read nationally as a sign of a backlash against Trump in the heartland and be seen more locally as a renewed vitality for Kansas Democrats as they head into 2018 with the governor’s office and the rest of the state’s U.S. House seats up for election. SHARE COPY LINK Kansas officially picked Donald Trump for president on Monday (Dec. 19, 2016). Many GOP operatives have blamed the surprisingly competitive race on Estes’ campaign, which saw the Republican treasurer avoid some candidate forums and shoot an ad where he stood in a swamp and asked voters to help him drain it in a nod to one of Trump’s campaign slogans. Bob Beatty, a political scientist at Washburn University, said Estes’ swamp ad was problematic both because “the image is ripe for mockery” and because Estes, as a two-term state official, cannot credibly run as an outsider who is going to drain the swamp. Democrats have used the image of Estes standing in the swamp and superimposed Gov. Sam Brownback’s head on an alligator swimming alongside him. “You really stay away from situations where you can be mocked or become an internet meme, and obviously him standing in a swamp with gators is going to bring a lot of chortles to the opposition,” Beatty said. Barker said he’s received a lot of complaints about the campaign but that this was not uncommon in close races. “You start getting people on the side saying they should’ve done this or they’ve should’ve done that,” he said. Barker said the party has focused on turning out diehard Republican voters. “We always thought turnout would be 20 percent, maybe a little lower, so we focused on the voters that we had to get,” he said. Colin Curtis, Thompson’s campaign manager, said that Estes has “taken the district for granted and the people for granted. He expects these voters just to show up and blindly vote for him because he’s a registered Republican.” He said that Thompson, a civil rights attorney, has crisscrossed the district to meet with voters in diners and coffee shops, attend community forums and go door to door. “It’s definitely competitive. You can look at the early vote numbers. We’re neck and neck,” he said. Nearly 13,000 GOP voters had cast ballots in advance by mail or in-person compared to about 10,900 Democrats as of Monday morning, according to data provided by the Republican Party. Another 3,400 unaffiliated voters, who could tip the balance, had also cast ballots. Estes’ campaign manager, Rodger Woods, stressed the importance of turnout in the campaign’s final 24 hours in an email. “Turnout is vital in Special Elections and in the next 24 hours we are focused on getting our voters to the polls on April 11,” Woods said. “We feel confident that South-Central Kansas wants to elect a conservative problem solver who is committed to balancing the budget, repealing and replacing Obamacare and protecting the unborn.” Thompson’s supporters say their candidate’s hard work has energized grass-roots activists and made the race competitive unlike previous Democratic campaigns, which fell flat. Thompson’s unique biography — he was homeless as a child and served in the U.S. Army — has helped him appeal to voters. As an attorney, Thompson has sued the city of Wichita on behalf of people who have been shot by police, according to Djuan Wash, a Black Lives Matter activist who has served as the campaign’s director of African-American outreach. “I think that really excites people to have someone who has fought on behalf of the rights of the disenfranchised and abused,” Wash said. Estes has seen a flood of spending by national Republicans in the final days of the race, while Thompson’s campaign struggled to get the Kansas Democratic Party or the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee to devote significant financial resources. “There was potential here,” Curtis said. “We tried to make that selling point. We didn’t get buy-in initially.” The DCCC did not directly answer a question about the organization’s lack of spending in the race, but it did tout that it would be launching a phone campaign Monday to reach 25,000 households in Kansas to encourage voter turnout. Meredith Kelly, the DCCC’s spokeswoman, said it’s clear Thompson has “worked harder and smarter than his opponent, and national Republicans are feeling the pressure in their effort to hold onto this reliable seat.” Jesse Hunt, the press secretary for the National Republican Congressional Committee, said the organization was confident that Estes will “close strong in the final days” and that GOP voters will turn out to “help send Ron to Washington to help support President Trump and Republican leadership in Congress.” Curtis said the robocalls from Trump and Pence, Cruz’s appearance, and the late spending by the National Republican Congressional Committee were a sign of Republicans’ concerns. “You don’t sound the alarm if you think you’re safe,” he said. ||||| House Speaker Paul Ryan sent an email to Republican donors last week, urging them to support Kansas congressional candidate Ron Estes.

Given a task, you explain in simple steps what the task is asking, any guidelines it provides and how to use those guidelines to find the answer. In this task, you are given two phrases: Head and Tail, separated with <sep>. The Head and the Tail events are short phrases possibly involving participants. The names of specific people have been replaced by generic words (e.g., PersonX, PersonY, PersonZ). PersonX is always the subject of the event. You have to determine whether PersonX needs what is mentioned in the Tail before the Head or not. Here need is a precondition for PersonX to achieve the event. For example, in order for PersonX to give PersonY gifts, PersonX must first buy the presents. Classify your answers into \\"Yes\\" and \\"No\\". The phrase may also contain \\"___\\", a placeholder that can be an object, a person, and/or an action.

Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Summarize the following: Don’t try to dodge the issue if you cheated and your teacher caught you because it likely will not prevent you from getting into trouble. Instead, explain why you cheated. Be clear about why you made that choice. For example, if you didn't have time to study or couldn't grasp the material, be straightforward about it. You can say something like, \\"I made the choice to cheat because I didn't have time to study, which was in error. Next time, I will give myself more time to properly prepare.\\" Be clear about which assignment or test you cheated on. If it was just on one assignment, you will want to clarify that you did not cheat on other assignments. Be aware that your teacher will probably want to review your previous work or keep a closer eye on your future work to make sure cheating is truly a one-time incident. If you cheated because you were struggling in the class, tell the teacher you need some additional help in the subject. Be specific about which elements of the course material you don't understand. They may be able to recommend a tutor or some additional resources. You could say: \\"I am not sure I understand how to measure the surface area. This was one of the reasons why I cheated on the test. Do you know of any tutors who might be able to help me understand this topic?\\" If you received a failing grade for cheating on a test or assignment, ask for a makeup assignment or extra credit work to start salvaging your grade. Your teacher might be able to give you a make-up assignment or have you do more problems than other students so that you can catch up. Being apologetic may lessen the consequences and punishment from cheating, but you will need to be genuine. You will need to take personal responsibility to move on from the incident. Tell your teacher the cheating was out of character for you and not something you intend to do again in the future. Although you will still likely be punished for cheating or plagiarizing, being remorseful can help minimize the lasting effects to your academic reputation. You could say: \\"I am very sorry that I cheated on last week's test. I understand that this was a wrongdoing and that my actions have consequences that I will need to face. At the same time I also want to reassure you that this was a one-time incident and it will not happen again.\\"","completion":"If caught cheating, don't dodge the issue.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Premise: A man in a black suit, is standing in front of a group of people in white suits and black dresses. Hypothesis: The man is making a presentation. .Given the premise, can we conclude the hypothesis?","completion":"To determine the likelihood of the hypothesis being true, we must first analyze the premise and consider alternative possibilities or contexts for the given scene. The hypothesis suggests that the man in the black suit is making a presentation to the group of people. While this is a possibility, there are multiple factors to consider before arriving at a conclusion. 1. The attire of the group: The individuals are dressed in white suits and black dresses, which suggests a formal setting. Depending on the context, the formal nature of the attire could either support or contradict the hypothesis. For instance, if the setting is a business setting, the hypothesis could be more likely. However, if it is a wedding or a formal event, the likelihood of the hypothesis dramatically reduces. 2. Body language and positioning: To better assess the hypothesis, it is essential to know more details about the body language of the people involved. Are they seated, standing, or actively engaged with the man in question? The body language of the listeners might shed light on whether the man is genuinely making a presentation or perhaps playing a different role in the setting. For example, if the people are focused on the man, taking notes, or asking questions, it would strengthen the hypothesis. 3. Context of the scene: The context of the scene plays a crucial role in determining the validity of the hypothesis. Is this taking place in a business environment, a social gathering, or an academic institution? The surroundings could help to confirm or negate the hypothesis. For example, if the environment is a conference room or a classroom, the likelihood of the man making a presentation increases. In contrast, if the setting is an art gallery or a theater, the hypothesis might be less likely. In conclusion, without additional information regarding the context of the scene, body language, and the relationship between the man and the group, we cannot definitively conclude that the man is making a presentation. It is essential to consider alternative scenarios and take into account the factors mentioned above before confirming the hypothesis. Some other plausible interpretations of this scene could be: the man is an event host addressing the guests, a wedding officiant conducting a ceremony, or an artist explaining their creation during an exhibition opening. The hypothesis that the man is making a presentation is just one possibility among many, and further information is needed to make a more accurate assessment."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: As more and more books become movie adaptations , I can't help but think how this will affect English classes in America. Thinking back to my years in middle and high school -- ten years ago, I would be rewarded if I had read a number of classics. Today, a majority of those books are now also movies Life of Pi, The Great Gatsby, Much Ado About Nothing and Anna Karenina, to name a few. Even modern books such as The Hunger Games and Harry Potter have been adapted for the big screen. In discussion with my students, I often hear them say they are not going to read books because movies will come out soon, which makes me wonder what effect movie adaptations have on modern-day students. Will the Common Core State Standards (CCSS) encourage them to read books more carefully or to use movies to improve their understanding of the text? The CCSS requires students to provide text-based evidence when reading and discussing a book. By focusing on such evidence, teachers can pull specific details from a book that may have not made the final cut when the book was adapted for the big screen. For instance, after reading and watching The Hunger Games, there were a number of details from the book that were missing from the film -- many people were disappointed with Rue's meek movie role. A student who failed to read The Hunger Games would not quite understand Rue's impact on the games in the same way as someone who had read the book and remembered all the details that went into her death. I am not saying the CCSS will stop students from cutting corners, but I believe if teachers use the support the CCSS provides, it can be a great roadway to ensure all students are digging deep into texts and not just hitting the play button. Question: According to the text, it seems that the CCSS _ .

What is the answer to this question? when does monsoon season start in pakistan 2017?","completion":"The monsoon season in Pakistan in 2017 started in late June and lasted until mid-September. However, it's important to note that the monsoon season can vary slightly each year, so it is not always possible to predict the exact start and end dates with absolute certainty. The monsoon season in Pakistan is mainly characterized by heavy rainfall and high humidity, which are caused by the seasonal reversal of winds in the Indian Ocean. This leads to the development of a low-pressure area over the Indian subcontinent, and as the prevailing winds change direction, they pick up moisture from the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal, bringing extensive rainfall to Pakistan and surrounding regions. Pakistan's monsoon season can be divided into two main phases. The first phase typically begins in late June or early July, affecting mostly the southern parts of the country, such as Sindh and Balochistan provinces. The second phase is usually more intense and occurs between late July and mid-September, affecting the northern and central parts of Pakistan, including Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Azad Jammu and Kashmir, and Gilgit-Baltistan. During the monsoon season, Pakistan experiences torrential rains, which can often lead to severe flooding. The intensity of the rainfall varies from year to year, sometimes causing devastating floods and loss of life and property. In addition to the negative aspects, the monsoon season plays a crucial role in Pakistan's agriculture. It provides the necessary water for irrigation and helps in recharging groundwater levels, which are essential for the country's primarily agrarian economy. In summary, the monsoon season in Pakistan in 2017 started in late June and lasted until mid-September. While the dates may vary each year, the monsoon season is generally characterized by heavy rainfall and high humidity throughout the country, with the southern regions experiencing rains earlier in the season and the northern and central parts affected more towards the end of the season. Due to its pervasive influence on agriculture and potential for natural disasters, the monsoon season is closely monitored and forecasted by meteorologists and the relevant authorities in Pakistan."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is an article: HONG KONG – Hong Kong police battling activists for control of an underpass in the dead of night Wednesday sparked public anger after officers were seen kicking a handcuffed protester in the worst violence since street demonstrations for greater democracy began more than two weeks ago. Officers armed with riot shields, batons and pepper spray knocked activists to the ground, dragging dozens away, and tore down barricades protesters used as roadblocks around the underpass outside the government's headquarters. Outrage over their aggressive tactics exploded after local TV showed officers taking the protester around a dark corner and kicking him repeatedly on the ground. It's unclear what provoked the attack. Local Now TV showed him splashing water on officers beforehand. \\"Hong Kong police have gone insane today, carrying out their own punishment in private,\\" said pro-democracy lawmaker Lee Cheuk-yan. \\"Hong Kong's values and its rule of law really have been completely destroyed by police chiefs.\\" Police spokesman Steve Hui said seven officers who were involved have been temporarily reassigned, and that authorities will carry out an impartial investigation. Beijing, meanwhile, issued its harshest condemnations yet of the protests, calling them illegal, bad for business and against Hong Kong's best interests. The central government has become increasingly impatient with the demonstrations, the biggest challenge its authority since China took control of the former British colony in 1997. A front-page editorial Wednesday in the People's Daily, the ruling Communist Party's mouthpiece, condemned the protests and said \\"they are doomed to fail.\\" \\"Facts and history tell us that radical and illegal acts that got their way only result in more severe illegal activities, exacerbating disorder and turmoil,\\" the commentary said. \\"Stability is bliss, and turmoil brings havoc.\\" However, there were no signs that the central government was planning to become directly involved in suppressing the demonstrations, which have marshalled opposition to plans for a pro-Beijing committee to screen candidates in Hong Kong's first election to choose the city's chief executive in 2017. The protesters also want the current leader, deeply unpopular Leung Chun-ying, to resign. The demonstrations have posed an unprecedented challenge to the government, and it is unclear when and how the crisis will be resolved. Leung, who described the protests as being \\"out of control,\\" told reporters that officials are willing to talk to protesters, but reiterated that Beijing will not drop the election restrictions it imposed. He canceled a leader's questions session at the Legislative Council on Thursday, citing security risks. The police operation early Wednesday came hours after a large group of protesters blockaded the underpass, expanding their protest zone after being cleared out of some other streets. The protesters outnumbered the police officers, who later returned with reinforcements to clear the area. The underpass borders the city government headquarters and is close to the main protest zone straddling a highway on the opposite side of the complex. Demonstrators appeared to storm the short tunnel in reaction to police attempts over the past two days to remove barricades on the edges of the sprawling protest zone. Police said they had to disperse the protesters because they were disrupting public order and gathering illegally. Hui, the police spokesman, said five officers were injured in the commotion, and that police arrested 45 demonstrators during the clashes — none of whom were injured. But local television showed a video of a group of plainclothes police officers taking a man around the side of a building, pushing him to the ground and kicking him. Local legislators and activists identified the protester as Ken Tsang, a member of a pro-democracy political party. Tsang, through his lawyer Tanya Chan, alleged that officers also slapped him after he was taken to a police station. Activists circulated photos of bruises on his face and back. \\"Some of us were sleeping in the park when more than a hundred of them ran toward us with torches as if they're trying to blind us temporarily. We were not prepared for how aggressive they were,\\" said protester Simon Lam, 22. After initial attempts to disperse protesters with tear gas and pepper spray two weeks ago, police have adopted a different strategy of chipping away at the three protest zones by removing barricades from the edges of the occupied areas in the early morning, when the crowd numbers are usually lowest. But Wednesday's raid was the most violent so far, with police charging the protesters and dragging them away. One officer ripped a facemask off an activist before spraying him with pepper spray, according to a video on the South China Morning Post newspaper's website. Positions on both sides have been hardening since the government called off negotiations last week, citing the unlikelihood of a constructive outcome given their sharp differences. Beijing is eager to end the protests to avoid emboldening activists and others on the mainland seen as a threat to the Communist Party's monopoly on power. In language freighted with political symbolism, Zhang Xiaoming, director of the central government's liaison office in Hong Kong, was quoted as telling Hong Kong legislators at a banquet Tuesday that the protest movement \\"is a serious social and political incident.\\" Zhang said the movement challenged Beijing's authority and had caused the city to suffer huge economic losses. It had \\"hurt the basis of Hong Kong's rule of law, democratic development, social harmony, international image and its relations with the mainland,\\" he said. Zhang called for an end to the protests as soon as possible to avoid further losses to Hong Kong's citizenry. But Lam, the student protester, said he was bracing for more tensions as students' distrust of police grows. \\"Now there is a feeling we are not just here to fool around or just to sit peacefully. We are feeling more prepared. We have become more united in building defenses,\\" Lam said.

Premise: Hieroglyphic cartouches are also popular remembrances a jeweler can have your name made up into a cartouche of Egyptian letters in just a couple of days choose from gold or silver. Hypothesis: Hieroglyphic cartouches can be personalized. Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?","completion":"Yes, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise. In the context of the premise, a hieroglyphic cartouche represents a set of glyphs encased in an oval shape, usually containing a royal name or important titles in ancient Egyptian culture. They were worn or displayed as amulets, indicating one's rank or status. Today, they have become popular artifacts that allow personal expression as well as an appreciation for cultural history. The premise clearly states that hieroglyphic cartouches can be personalized. The assertion is made that a jeweler can create a cartouche with an individual's name transformed into Egyptian letters. This process typically takes a couple of days and the customer has the option to select either gold or silver. It is, thus, clear, that through this service, hieroglyphic cartouches are not only being produced but they're being personalized - tailored to the customer's name and choice of material. Thus, the hypothesis that hieroglyphic cartouches can be personalized is indeed affirmed by the information provided in the premise. It's an example of how modern practices merge with ancient traditions to create personalized jewelry that's symbolic, unique, and culturally resonant."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Box Among the given options, the most common object people usually tie a ribbon around as a present is a box. This is because a gift box, which typically houses a present, is most likely to be adorned with a ribbon to enhance the overall appearance and create an element of excitement for the recipient. Additionally, tying a ribbon around a box serves more than just an aesthetic purpose; it also helps secure the wrapping paper or other coverings around the package. Presentation is an important aspect of gift-giving, and ribbons can transform an ordinary box into a beautifully wrapped gift, conveying thoughtfulness and care. Ribbons can come in numerous colors, patterns, and textures, offering a myriad of choices for customizing the presentation depending on the occasion, recipient, or personal taste. While some of the other options provided could also potentially include the use of ribbons (such as floral arrangements and girl's hair), neither of these instances involves tying a ribbon around a present. A ribbon would be tied around a floral arrangement for presentation purposes, while a ribbon is used in a girl's hair primarily as a decorative accessory or as a way to secure a hairstyle. Although some people might tie a ribbon around a car or a typewriter as a surprise or unconventional gift, these options are less common and certainly not as popular as tying a ribbon around a box as a present."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Worst Economist in the World A thought: it has occurred to me that we could use an economics equivalent of Keith Olbermann’s “Worst Person in the World” award. KO does not, of course, mean that the person he goes after on any given night really is the worst person in the world; he just uses the title to highlight some especially awful action or statement. I’d encourage others to enter this game — and yes, I know that various paid trolls and others will award me the title five times a day if they can. But here’s what caught my eye: the WSJ’s Real Time Economics explaining (or rather, “explaining”) the risks from competitive devaluation: When one country devalues its currency, others tend to follow suit. As a result, nobody achieves trade gains. Instead, the devaluations put upward pressure on the prices of commodities such as oil. Higher commodity prices, in turn, can cut into global economic output. In one ominous sign, the price of oil is up 8.7% since August 27. Why do dollar commodity prices tend to rise when the dollar falls? Because other countries buy commodities too, so that a constant dollar price would mean a fall in terms of other currencies. To a first approximation, in fact, you’d expect commodity prices to remain constant, other things equal, in terms of a GDP-weighted basket of currencies around the world. So yes, a fall in the dollar tends to raise the price of oil in dollars — but it also tends to reduce the price of oil in euros. A fall in the euro tends to raise the price of oil in euros, but raise reduce it in dollars. [whoops!] So what would devaluations that raise commodity prices in terms of all currencies look like? I have no idea. There is, I think, a tendency to think of devaluations as reductions in the value of currencies relative to something external and eternal — and hence as making us all poorer. But the reality is that my depreciation is your appreciation, and vice versa; we can’t all devalue at the same time. But competitive devaluation is one of those things people just know is bad, and so critical thinking has a tendency to go out the window. What is a short summary of the above article?","completion":"The article discusses the idea of having an economics equivalent of the \\"Worst Person in the World\\" award and encourages others to participate in this game. The author then explains competitive devaluation and its perceived risks, such as increasing commodity prices like oil.

The measure, approved by a 256-167 vote, now goes to the Senate, which has until midnight Friday to approve it and avert the year’s third government closure. The massive bipartisan bill would keep the government funded until the end of September. Lawmakers had just hours to read the nearly 2,200-page bill released Wednesday night. Under Senate rules, a single senator can delay the vote but not stop it entirely. Senator Rand Paul has objected to the short time given to members to read the lengthy legislation. As of Thursday afternoon, the Senate was waiting to see how the vote would proceed, raising the prospect of another brief government shutdown. With midterm elections looming in November, the bill likely marks the final time Capitol Hill will consider major legislation this year. The measure would fulfill President Donald Trump’s vow to boost military funding but provides funding for limited parts of his immigration agenda. The bill, which the White House said Trump supports, would give Trump a huge budget increase for the military, including a 2.4 percent pay raise for military personnel. “Today marks the beginning of a new era for the United States military,” House Speaker Paul Ryan said in a statement Thursday. “This legislation fulfills our pledge to rebuild the United States military.” After extensive negotiations between Republicans and Democrats, the bill also provides 1.6 billion for physical barriers and 150 kilometers (93 miles) of a wall at the U.S.-Mexico border, short of the 25 billion Trump requested for the project he repeatedly touted on the campaign trail while pledging Mexico would pick up the cost.

Italian outrage over Roma drowning photos (CNN) -- Italian newspapers, an archbishop and civil liberties campaigners expressed shock and revulsion on Monday after photographs were published of sunbathers apparently enjoying a day at the beach just meters from where the bodies of two drowned Roma girls were laid out on the sand. Photographs of the dead Roma girls on a beach caused outrage in Italy. Italian news agency ANSA reported that the incident had occurred on Saturday at the beach of Torregaveta, west of Naples, southern Italy, where the two girls had earlier been swimming in the sea with two other Roma girls. Reports said they had gone to the beach to beg and sell trinkets. Local news reports said the four girls found themselves in trouble amid fierce waves and strong currents. Emergency services responded 10 minutes after a distress call was made from the beach and two lifeguards attended the girls upon hearing their screams. Two of them were pulled to safety but rescuers failed to reach the other two in time to save them. Watch why the photos have generated anger » The Web site of the Archbishop of Naples said the girls were cousins named Violetta and Cristina, aged 12 and 13. Their bodies were eventually laid out on the sand under beach towels to await collection by police. Photographs show sunbathers in bikinis and swimming trunks sitting close to where the girls' feet can be seen poking out from under the towels concealing their bodies. A photographer who took photos at the scene told CNN the mood among sunbathers had been one of indifference. Other photos show police officers lifting the bodies into coffins and carrying them away past bathers reclined on sun loungers. \\"While the lifeless bodies of the girls were still on the sand, there were those who carried on sunbathing or having lunch just a few meters away,\\" Italian newspaper La Repubblica reported. Corriere della Sera said that a crowd of curious onlookers that had formed around the bodies quickly dispersed. \\"Few left the beach or abandoned their sunbathing. When the police from the mortuary arrived an hour later with coffins, the two girls were carried away between bathers stretched out in the sun.\\" The incident also attracted condemnation from the Archbishop of Naples, Cardinal Crecenzio Seppe. \\"Indifference is not an emotion for human beings,\\" Seppe wrote in his parish blog. \\"To turn the other way or to mind your own business can sometimes be more devastating than the events that occur.\\" Recent weeks have seen heightened tensions between Italian authorities and the country's Roma minority amid a crackdown by Silvo Berlusconi's government targeting illegal immigrants and talk by government officials of a \\"Roma emergency\\" that has seen the 150,000-strong migrant group blamed for rising street crime. That has provided justification for police raids on Roma camps and controversial government plans to fingerprint all Roma -- an act condemned by the European Parliament and United Nations officials as a clear act of racial discrimination. Popular resentment against Romanies has also seen Roma camps near Naples attacked and set on fire with petrol bombs by local residents. In a statement published on its Web site, the Italian civil liberties group EveryOne said Saturday's drowning had occurred in an atmosphere of \\"racism and horror\\" and cast doubt on the reported version of events, suggesting that it appeared unusual for the four girls to wade into the sea, apparently casting modesty aside and despite being unable to swim. \\"The most shocking aspect of all this is the attitude of the people on the beach,\\" the statement said. \\"No one appears the slightest upset at the sight and presence of the children's dead bodies on the beach: they carry on swimming, sunbathing, sipping soft drinks and chatting.\\" CNN's Jennifer Eccleston contributed to this report.

Title: Bamboozled Movie plot: In a New York City residence, Pierre Delacroix (Damon Wayans) rises to begin his daily routine. Brushing his teeth, he gives us by voice over a definition of satire. He tells us that with the rise of the Internet, video and interactive games, his field as a television writer has seen a drop in popularity. Meanwhile, in a dilapidated building, squatter Womack (Tommy Davidson) wakes up his friend Manray (Savion Glover) for a day of work. This consists of travelling to the CNS (Continental Network System) building where Delacroix works, and Manray tap dancing to entertain the workers. They then collect money from the workers. The men see Delacroix walk by, and ask him for monetary help in the form of work of some kind.Delacroix walks into a staff meeting late and is immediately castigated by his boss, Thomas Dunwitty (Michael Rapaport). Dunwitty informs the staff that CNS has poor ratings. He says he wants them to write funnier material, and ends the meeting. In the privacy of his office, Dunwitty tells Delacroix that the material Delacroix's been writing for him seems like it's about white people with black faces. Dunwitty asserts that Delacroix is an \\"oreo\\" with his Harvard education, because he won't write a \\"n----r show.\\"The next day, Delacroix and his assistant Sloan Hopkins (Jada Pinkett Smith) talk. They've decided that Manray is the solution to his problem. Delacroix plans to write a show that will be so \\"offensive and racist,\\" it will prove his point that the network only wants to see black buffoons on the air. Delacroix simply hopes to be fired, so he can be let go of his contract with CNS. Manray and Womack ask at the receptionist's desk for a \\"Delapoint\\" and the men working there tell them to step outside. However, Sloan steps into the lobby, sees what's happening, and escorts Manray and Womack to Delacroix's office. Delacroix explains to them that he has an idea for a television pilot, and they can make money with it. His main request is that Manray changes his name to Mantan, in an apparent homage...

You must generate a detailed and long answer. In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Fleas and their eggs can easily hide in the grass and in areas of your yard where debris (e.g. leaves, etc.) has built up. To prevent fleas from being able to make a long-term home in these areas, keep your yard clean and your grass cut short. This is especially important in the areas of your yard where you dog hangs out the most. Diatomaceous earth (DE) is a calcium dust that’s ground from single-cell ocean organisms. Only use DE that’s been certified as “food grade.” You can mix some DE in water (in a watering can if you have one) and sprinkle the mixture on your grass, sidewalks, decks, paving stones, and even in your flower beds. Focus on areas of your yard where your dog hangs out the most. This mixture dries out flea eggs and makes it impossible for adult fleas to breathe, therefore killing them off. If you live in a moist and humid climate, you may need to apply this mixture every two months. If you live in a dry climate, you won’t need to apply as often, maybe once every three to four months. Make sure to wear a protective mask when handling the DE dust as it can irritate your lungs. You can buy DE online at shops like Amazon or at hardware/garden stores. Pest control companies may also sell it, as it’s used extensively to kill other types of pests as well. Water drowns fleas and flea eggs. You can use a garden hose to drown fleas and their eggs in your yard in areas where your dog frequents (e.g. kennel, dog run, favourite nap area, etc.). Just spray water in the area until it’s practically flooded. In order to kill fleas and their eggs inside your house, you need to keep up a regular cleaning routine around your house. Start by washing hard floors (e.g. wood, tile, etc.) as often as you can. Pay special attention to the cracks and gaps in the floors where fleas can hide. You should also vacuum your rugs and carpets every day to remove any fleas or eggs that may fall off you or your dog. To help keep fleas at bay, and to prevent you from needing to do too much work, it may be easier to simply remove and store away your area carpets or rugs during flea season. Give them a good cleaning before you store them and when you take them back out again. When doing your daily vacuuming routine on carpets and rugs, you may also want to run the vacuum over any furniture in the same rooms (e.g. couches, ottomans, pillows, etc.). If you use a vacuum with a bag, you can freeze the bag in-between uses to kill the fleas you vacuum up. Note that the fleas will stay alive inside the bag between vacuuming if you simply store the vacuum between uses. If small enough, wash your dog’s bedding in your washing machine every week with hot water and mild laundry detergent. If the bedding is too big for the washing machine, you can always soak it in a tub of water mixed with vinegar or hydrogen peroxide. Worst case scenario, if your dog’s bedding is too big for either washing method, make sure to vacuum it thoroughly. If the flea infestation is really bad, or if it’s over but you want to make sure you got every last flea, consider hiring a steam cleaning company to come to your home. Ask them to use just hot water to steam clean your floors, furniture, and your dog’s bedding. Make sure you move furniture in order to steam clean underneath too.","completion":"The article provides tips on preventing and eliminating fleas and their eggs from your yard and home by maintaining a clean environment through regular yard care and grass cutting, using diatomaceous earth to kill fleas, employing water to drown fleas in specific areas, maintaining a thorough indoor cleaning routine including washing floors and vacuuming carpets daily, removing and cleaning area rugs during flea season, vacuuming furniture, freezing vacuum bags to kill fleas, washing or soaking dog bedding regularly, and considering steam cleaning services if necessary."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The knife punctured the throat while deflecting off the bone, since the OPT: (i). throat was softer.; (ii). bone was softer.;","completion":"The knife punctured the throat while deflecting off the bone, since the: (i). throat was softer. In this sentence, the knife has been thrust towards an individual's throat, finding its way through the soft tissue. Since the throat is softer in comparison to the bone, its vulnerability to damage is higher. When referring to the throat in this context, it primarily refers to the soft tissue that is composed of muscles, cartilage, blood vessels, and other connective tissues. The throat not only plays a significant role in breathing, speaking, and swallowing but also houses various essential structures such as the larynx (voice box) and parts of the pharynx. Due to its softer nature, the throat can relatively easily be penetrated or damaged, as depicted in the sentence. On the other hand, bones are more rigid and robust structures in the body, mainly made up of collagen and calcium phosphate. The hardness of the bones is mainly due to the mineralized matrix present in them. Bones offer structural support, facilitate movement, protect delicate organs, and store essential minerals in the body. Given these facts, when the knife comes in contact with the throat and the bone, it is much easier for the softer throat tissue to be punctured. The bone, being harder and more resistant, deflects the knife rather than being directly damaged by it. In summary, the sentence implies that when a knife is forced towards an individual's throat, the knife effortlessly punctures the softer throat tissue but deflects off the bone without causing much harm to it, given the bone's harder nature."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Affirmed (February 21, 1975 - January 12, 2001) was an American Thoroughbred racehorse who was the eleventh winner of the United States Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing. Affirmed was also known for his famous rivalry with Alydar, whom he met ten times, including in all three Triple Crown races. Affirmed was the last horse to win the Triple Crown for a 37-year period, which was ended in 2015 by American Pharoah. Affirmed won fourteen Grade As a two-year-old, Affirmed won seven of his nine starts, with two placings, for earnings of 343,477 under regular rider Steve Cauthen, then a teenager. Notably, six of those starts were against his rival, Calumet Farm's Alydar, with Affirmed winning four and Alydar winning two. Affirmed won his first start in a maiden special weight race at Belmont Park on May 24, 1977. He followed up with a win in the Youthful Stakes on June 15 where he defeated Alydar by eight lengths. On July 6 in the Great American Stakes, Alydar evened the score with a 3 1/2 length win after mounting a powerful stretch drive. Affirmed was then shipped across country to Hollywood Park, where he won the Hollywood Juvenile Championship Stakes on July 23. He then shipped back to New York where he won the Sanford Stakes at Saratoga on August 17 by 2 1/2 lengths over the previously undefeated Tilt Up. In his next start on August 27 in the Hopeful Stakes, his main rival was Alydar, who was the even money favorite after winning four straight races. Affirmed stalked the early pace set by Tilt Up with Alydar in close contention. Around the far turn, Affirmed moved to the lead with Alydar closing ground on the outside. In mid-stretch, Alydar had closed to within a head but Affirmed pulled away in the final sixteenth of a mile to win by half a length. His time of 1:15 2/5 for 6 1/2 furlongs was a new stakes record. The two horses again faced off in the Belmont Futurity on September 10, with Affirmed going off as the narrow favorite. After a good start, Affirmed settled into second place behind longshot Rough Sea, while Alydar overcame a bad start to move into third place down the backstretch. Rounding into the stretch, Affirmed moved to the lead. Alydar responded and the two horses dueled head-to-head for the final furlong. Alydar appeared to be in the lead for much of the stretch drive before Affirmed rallied in the final stride to win by a nose. \\"He never gave up,\\" said Cauthen, \\"even when he was headed.\\" Alydar turned the tables in the Champagne Stakes on October 15, sweeping by Affirmed in the stretch to win by 1 1/4 lengths. The two faced off again in the Laurel Futurity on October 29, then one of the most prestigious races for two-year-olds in the country, with Affirmed winning by a neck.

Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","completion":"The premise given is: \\"That's what brought the name into your mind so pat.\\" The hypothesis postulated is: \\"That is why you completely forgot the name.\\" To thoroughly analyze whether the premise entails the hypothesis, let's break down the elements of each statement and examine their logical connection. The premise states that something specific (an event, situation, or stimulus) brought the name into your mind seamlessly and without effort. In this context, \\"so pat\\" probably implies that the event or trigger was particularly apt or fitting. It suggests that the retrieval of the name was relatively easy and immediate due to the strong association between the event and the name. The hypothesis, on the other hand, claims that this same retrieval process is the reason you completely forgot the name. This statement implies that despite the easy and immediate recall of the name initially, there came a point where the name was eventually forgotten. Now, let's evaluate the logical relationship between the premise and the hypothesis. To determine whether the premise entails the hypothesis, we must examine if the hypothesis necessarily follows from the premise. In other words, we need to see whether it is logically impossible for the premise to be true and the hypothesis to be false. In the given case, it is not necessarily impossible for the premise to be true while the hypothesis is false. The premise only mentions the ease with which the name was brought to mind, not that it led to its subsequent forgetfulness. Therefore, it is plausible that the initial recall of the name did not lead to forgetfulness in another context or at another point in time. It could even be the case that the name was remembered more firmly because of the strong association with the event. In conclusion, the premise, \\"That's what brought the name into your mind so pat,\\" does not entail the hypothesis, \\"That is why you completely forgot the name,\\" as the two statements do not necessarily confirm or depend on each other in a logically coherent manner. The premise is focused on the ease of the initial recall of the name, while the hypothesis revolves around the eventual forgetfulness of the same name. The connection between them is not strong enough to suggest that one is caused by the other, especially since the premise does not provide any information about the factors that led to the forgetfulness of the name."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

That's all that's needed to force a wide-ranging House debate — and votes — on border security and the immigration status of 700,000 undocumented young people brought to the U.S. as children. Since moderate Republicans opposed House leadership two weeks ago with a rare discharge petition to force a so-called \\"queen of the hill\\" debate (House rule based on the most votes) on immigration, the measure has steadily accumulated support within their own party. The petition needs 218 signatures to start that debate and — with the assumption that all 193 House Democrats will sign on — Republicans need just two more signatures. But that effort now goes on hold as Congress leaves town for an 11-day holiday recess, giving all sides breathing room to figure out what comes next. Many of the 23 Republican signers of the petition face tough re-election races in their districts this November. The debate over Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients has challenged lawmakers since last September, when U.S. President Donald Trump ended the program, calling on Congress to find a permanent legislative solution. Lawmakers will return to Washington facing an immediate deadline. Representative Jeff Denham, a California Republican who is one of the leaders of the petition effort, told reporters that June 7 would be the absolute last moment to allow the petition to mature before lawmakers run up against a seven-week summer recess. Denham said talks with House leadership and the House Freedom Caucus, a conservative voting bloc seeking significant security concessions in return for a citizenship path for DACA recipients, have been productive. \\"We've had an agreement in principle,\\" Denham said of a deal that would provide a 12-year path to citizenship for DACA recipients, known colloquially as Dreamers. \\"Now it's trying to put that information on paper.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. pick from the following. a). negative; b). positive; Short movie review: children 's entertainment , superhero comics , and japanese animation Did the critic thinking positively or negatively of the movie?","completion":"Based on the given information, it appears that the critic is thinking positively about the movie. They have mentioned children's entertainment, superhero comics, and Japanese animation, which are generally associated with elements that are well-loved and appealing to a wide audience. While the critic doesn't explicitly state their opinion, highlighting these specific aspects of the movie implies that they find them to be noteworthy and a positive aspect of the film. Children's entertainment, for one, suggests that the movie is lighthearted, innocent, and has a sense of wonder and creativity that can be enjoyed by young and old alike. This points towards the critic potentially appreciating the film's ability to entertain and captivate the imagination of a younger audience. Furthermore, the critic referenced superhero comics as an aspect of the movie, suggesting that they consider this another positive point. Superhero comics have a long history of thrilling readers with exciting adventures, larger-than-life characters, and intricate storylines. By the critic mentioning this genre, they indicate that the movie contains exhilarating action and heroic themes, which are generally seen as attractive features in movies. Lastly, the mention of Japanese animation highlights yet another element the critic seems to think favorably about. Japanese animation, or anime, is renowned for its unique visuals, storytelling techniques, and inventive concepts. By associating the movie with Japanese animation, the critic hints at a stylistic and narrative influence that elevates the movie from the standard fare. While the critic’s opinion isn't explicitly spelled out, the focus on these three positive aspects of children's entertainment, superhero comics, and Japanese animation leads to the conclusion that they viewed the movie in a positive light. The critic presumably sees the film as a successful and captivating fusion of these elements, crafting an enjoyable and engaging experience for the audience."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the full name of character with whom Elsa begins to identify with? Agent Bart Langner finds Elsa Brinkmann, a would-be actress who looks and sounds just like Lylah Clare, a flamboyant star who fell to her death in suspicious circumstances 20 years ago. He persuades arrogant director Lewis Zarkan, who had been married to Lylah, to see her. The two men then convince brash studio head Barney Sheean, who is equally struck, to back a picture with her as Lylah. Besides coping with the tyrannical Zarkan and easy access to alcohol and drugs, Elsa also has to contend with other hazards of Hollywood like malicious journalist Molly Luther and lesbian admirer Rossella. As filming continues, her identification with her rôle gets more intense. She also begins to fall in love with Zarkan, who is happy to sleep with her but his priority is to get his film finished. By the last day of shooting, her personality seems to have merged with that of the outrageous Lylah whose fatal fall, we learn, was prompted by the jealous Zarkan. To antagonise him, she first lets him find her in bed with the gardener. Then, as he directs her in a circus scene, she leaps to her death from the high-wire. The resulting publicity makes his film a huge success. Tragedy later comes when Zarkan himself is shot and killed by Rossella. A final sequence (in this case, a TV commercial for dog food that interrupts the film itself) suggests that the world of Hollywood is literally one of dog eats dog.

(CNN) -- Michael Clarke has big cricketing shoes to fill following the retirement of Ricky Ponting, but the Australia captain has already wiped out one of his predecessor's records. Clarke beat Ponting's leading mark of 1,544 runs scored in a calendar year by an Australian batsman, set in 2003, as he made 106 on day two of the second Test against Sri Lanka. The 31-year-old posted his 22nd Test century -- still 19 behind Ponting -- and his first in Melbourne as the home team reached 440-8 at stumps on Thursday for a lead of 284. \\"It is nice to get that monkey off my back and get my first hundred here,\\" Clarke, who overcame a hamstring injury to start the match, told reporters after taking his total for 2012 to 1,595.","completion":"\\"It's a great honor to break such a prestigious record held by Ricky Ponting, someone I've always admired and looked up to throughout my cricketing career,\\" Clarke continued. \\"However, I must give credit to my teammates for their unwavering support and hard work, as this achievement wouldn't have been possible without them. We still have a lot of work to do in this Test match and the series as a whole, so our focus must remain on performing consistently and striving for victory in every game.\\" The Australian team, known for their powerhouse performances, has certainly benefited from Clarke's leadership and extraordinary ability to rack up significant scores. His determination and skill on the field have been instrumental in turning crucial games in their favor, and his personal achievements have inspired his teammates to reach new heights. As the Australian cricket team and its millions of fans celebrate this milestone, they also acknowledge the legacy left behind by Ricky Ponting, whose leadership, skill, and commitment to excellence set the stage for players like Clarke to flourish. Ponting's 19-year international career saw him amass 13,378 Test runs, making him the second-highest run-scorer of all time, just behind India's Sachin Tendulkar. While it remains to be seen whether Clarke can match or surpass Ponting's overall tally, his already impressive achievements have firmly established him as one of the greats in Australian and international cricket. With Clarke at the helm, the Australian cricket team is confident about their prospects in the ongoing Test Series against Sri Lanka and other future challenges. As cricket lovers worldwide eagerly follow the unfolding events in the Test match, they can take a moment to appreciate the talent, dedication, and discipline that have enabled superstars like Michael Clarke to shatter records and etch their names into the annals of the sport.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Does the following review have a positive or negative opinion of the movie? at every opportunity to do something clever , the film goes right over the edge and kills every sense of believability","completion":"In analyzing the content of the given review, it seems that the reviewer expresses a negative opinion of the movie. Here are a few key phrases and explanations that support this conclusion: 1. \\"at every opportunity to do something clever\\": This phrase implies that the film had potential to be wise, innovative, or original in various aspects, such as storytelling, character development, or cinematography. However, the reviewer doesn't seem to think the movie capitalizes on those chances. 2. \\"the film goes right over the edge\\": Using the term \\"over the edge\\" reflects that the movie may have taken its attempts to be clever too far, likely resulting in a situation where it becomes difficult for the audience to remain invested or engaged. A film going \\"over the edge\\" can be seen as excessive or overly dramatic, which is often considered negative in the context of a review. 3. \\"kills every sense of believability\\": Any movie - whether it's a fictional story or based on real-life events - should maintain a certain level of believability, where it remains plausible and the audience can suspend their disbelief. When believability is \\"killed\\", it means that the film is no longer convincing, hindering the viewer's ability to immerse themselves in the story. A reviewer that notes the loss of believability is likely conveying their dissatisfaction with the film. Based on these phrases and the overall tone, it can be surmised that the review portrays a negative opinion of the movie. The reviewer believes that the film fails to take advantage of opportunities to be clever and instead opts for excessive choices that diminish its credibility and appeal to the audience, leading to a less enjoyable viewing experience."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: There are a lot of poems focused on the theme of death, grief, or sympathy that are appropriate for funerals. Think about whether the deceased person had any favorite poets or specific poems. Pick one that reflects the deceased person and their passions or personality. You could also write your own short poem about the person if you want to express your own emotions. If you don’t have room to include an entire poem, use 1 or 2 of the most meaningful lines from the piece instead. Choose a phrase that the person who passed away was known for, as long as it’s appropriate for the occasion. For example, you could use what Grandma Jane said every time she put a pie in the oven: “Everything tastes better with love!” Only use quotes or phrases that most people will be familiar with. Avoid inside jokes that only you know. If the famous phrase includes curse words or something inappropriate, or if it could offend someone in the audience, don’t include it. If you have something you want to say to the person who passed, use the eulogy as an opportunity to share it. Keep it to 2 to 3 sentences and make sure it contains a message that the rest of the audience can relate to. For example, now is not the time to tell Grandma Jane that you stained her good apron. Instead, say something like, “Grandma, I’ll miss your blueberry pie, but more than that, I’ll miss the way you used to hug me when I was sad or how your laugh was the best sound in the world. I can’t wait to see you again one day.” Look up towards the sky while you address the person to feel more connected to their spirit. If religion was a big part of their life and beliefs, incorporate it into your eulogy by ending with a quote from a spiritual leader or a passage from a religious text.

Answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the name of the band that achieved huge commercial success with its second album, Nevermind? The underground punk rock movement inspired countless bands that either evolved from a punk rock sound or brought its outsider spirit to very different kinds of music. The original punk explosion also had a long-term effect on the music industry, spurring the growth of the independent sector. During the early 1980s, British bands like New Order and the Cure that straddled the lines of post-punk and new wave developed both new musical styles and a distinctive industrial niche. Though commercially successful over an extended period, they maintained an underground-style, subcultural identity. In the United States, bands such as Hüsker Dü and their Minneapolis protégés the Replacements bridged the gap between punk rock genres like hardcore and the more melodic, explorative realm of what was then called \\"college rock\\".A 1985 Rolling Stone feature on the Minneapolis scene and innovative California hardcore acts such as Black Flag and Minutemen declared, \\"Primal punk is passé. The best of the American punk rockers have moved on. They have learned how to play their instruments. They have discovered melody, guitar solos and lyrics that are more than shouted political slogans. Some of them have even discovered the Grateful Dead.\\" By the mid-to-late 1980s, these bands, who had largely eclipsed their punk rock and post-punk forebears in popularity, were classified broadly as alternative rock. Alternative rock encompasses a diverse set of styles—including indie rock, gothic rock, dream pop, shoegaze, and grunge, among others—unified by their debt to punk rock and their origins outside of the musical mainstream.As American alternative bands like Sonic Youth, which had grown out of the no wave scene, and Boston's Pixies started to gain larger audiences, major labels sought to capitalize on the underground market that had been sustained by hardcore punk for years. In 1991, Nirvana emerged from Washington State's underground, DIY grunge scene; after recording their first album, Bleach for about 600, the band achieved huge...

Kitten Natividad, of Russ Meyer film fame, plays Chastity Knott, a woman who has found she has breast cancer, so she goes to South America to get some special fruit (Crockazilla?) that is supposed to have healing powers. After going down on some of this fruit (which appears to be plastic bananas on stalks) Chastity is endowed with some mystical magical powers that makes her a super-hero, specifically, The Double D Avenger. Note that she's also wearing a pair of panties as a mask. In writing, that all sounds pretty good. In execution, well, it leaves more than a little to be desired. It seems that Chastity owns a pub and a local strip joint is upset because she's taking away their business so some of the strippers (including Haji, also of Russ Meyer film fame) go after her to ruin her. Of course, Chastity fights back in the guise of the Double D Avenger.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the last name of Raisa's husband's superior?, using the article: In 1933, a child orphaned during the Ukrainian Holodomor runs away from his orphanage and is taken in by a Red Army unit and adopted by its kindly commander, who gives him the name Leo Demidov. In 1945, now a sergeant with the unit, Leo becomes an icon across the Soviet Union when he is photographed planting the Soviet flag atop the Reichstag during the Battle of Berlin. He becomes a Hero of the Soviet Union. In 1953, Leo, now married to Raisa and living in Moscow, is a captain in the Ministry of State Security, commanding a unit tasked with tracking down and arresting dissidents. They arrest a veterinarian, Anatoly Brodsky, and during the arrest, one of Leo's subordinates, the cowardly but ambitious Vasili Nikitin, shoots a farmer, Semyon Okun, and his wife in whose barn Brodsky has been hiding, orphaning their two young daughters. Angry, Leo strikes Vasili, who harbours growing resentment against Leo and the other officer in the unit, Alexei Andreyev; all three were in Berlin together in 1945. Vasili is in charge of Brodsky's interrogation and execution, and one of the names he gives to their superior, Major Kuzmin, is that of Raisa, a primary school teacher, several of whose colleagues have recently been arrested for dissident views. Kuzmin orders Leo to investigate his own wife. Meanwhile, Alexei's young son, Jora, is found dead near a railway yard. Although the initial pathology report shows injuries consistent with torture, the surgically precise removal of organs, and drowning, the authorities declare that he was hit by a train, as Stalin has decreed that murder is a capitalist disease; there is no murder in a communist paradise. Alexei is forced to accept the official conclusions to save himself and the rest of his family., what would be the answer ?

In the first sentence, it is mentioned that President Clinton presented his plan for overhauling Medicare, while the second sentence states that he wanted to cut Medicare funding greatly. While the two sentences are related because they both discuss President Clinton's approach to Medicare, they do not necessarily mean the same thing. Overhauling Medicare could imply a variety of changes to the current system, such as modifying payment structures, improving the quality of care, addressing inefficiencies, or simplifying administrative tasks. It does not explicitly suggest that Clinton aimed to cut Medicare funding greatly. While it is possible that decreasing funding could be a part of the broader overhaul plan, this information is not provided in the first sentence alone.

He makes amends with the men who cheated him out of the land, and tries to with Gracie. When the U.S. declares war in World War I, York tries to avoid induction into the Army as a conscientious objector because of his religious beliefs, but is drafted nonetheless.

The text refers to the reason behind the death of Jesus Christ, as mentioned in Christian theology. According to this belief, Jesus died on the cross as a means of taking the punishment that all sinners deserved, in order to offer forgiveness and eternal life to those who believe in Him. This act is known as atonement and signifies the ultimate sacrifice that Jesus made to reconcile humanity with God. In Christianity, it is believed that all humans are born with innate sinfulness, which began with the disobedience of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden. Due to this inherent sin, humanity became separated from God, who is divine and pure. This separation necessitates a way for humanity to find redemption and restore their broken relationship with God. Jesus, who is considered to be the Son of God and part of the Holy Trinity (the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit), was sent to earth in human form to offer a pathway to salvation. His role as the \\"Lamb of God\\" or sacrificial figure represents the forgiveness of sins. The crucifixion and subsequent resurrection of Jesus are considered by Christians as the ultimate demonstration of God's love, offering salvation to all who believe in Jesus. In summary, not only is the fact that Jesus died crucially significant in Christianity, but the reason behind His death is equally important. By bearing the punishment that all sinners deserve, Jesus provides a means for humanity to attain forgiveness, redemption, and everlasting life with God.

Question: Which individual studied the aspects of comics during the seventies that is referred to as now as \\"closure\\"? Context: European comics studies began with Töpffer's theories of his own work in the 1840s, which emphasized panel transitions and the visual–verbal combination. No further progress was made until the 1970s. Pierre Fresnault-Deruelle then took a semiotics approach to the study of comics, analyzing text–image relations, page-level image relations, and image discontinuities, or what Scott McCloud later dubbed \\"closure\\". In 1987, Henri Vanlier introduced the term multicadre, or \\"multiframe\\", to refer to the comics a page as a semantic unit. By the 1990s, theorists such as Benoît Peeters and Thierry Groensteen turned attention to artists' poïetic creative choices. Thierry Smolderen and Harry Morgan have held relativistic views of the definition of comics, a medium that has taken various, equally valid forms over its history. Morgan sees comics as a subset of \\"les littératures dessinées\\" (or \\"drawn literatures\\"). French theory has come to give special attention to the page, in distinction from American theories such as McCloud's which focus on panel-to-panel transitions. Since the mid-2000s, Neil Cohn has begun analyzing how comics are understood using tools from cognitive science, extending beyond theory by using actual psychological and neuroscience experiments. This work has argued that sequential images and page layouts both use separate rule-bound \\"grammars\\" to be understood that extend beyond panel-to-panel transitions and categorical distinctions of types of layouts, and that the brain's comprehension of comics is similar to comprehending other domains, such as language and music. The answer to this question is:","completion":"Pierre Fresnault-Deruelle studied the aspects of comics during the seventies that are now referred to as \\"closure\\"."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The person pays close attention to the precision of their cuts, making sure that each edge is straight and no jagged lines are present. After securing one side of the wrapping paper to the box, the person moves on to the other side. They patiently repeat the process, folding the paper tightly over the box and taping it down with more double-sided tape. They make sure to match the seams perfectly, so the wrapping appears seamless and even. Once the long sides of the box are completely wrapped, the person focuses on the shorter ends. They press the wrapping paper down along the crease where the short end of the box meets the long end, creating a crisp, distinct fold. They repeat the process for the remaining three corners. With all four corners defined, the person starts folding the wrapping paper on one short end of the box. They fold the top and bottom flaps down, making a neat triangle shape on both sides. Then, they bring the triangle flaps in toward the center of the box, ensuring that the points touch the previously folded edges. The person secures the flaps with double-sided tape, taking care once more to align the seams neatly. The individual then moves to the other short end of the box and follows the same procedure, folding the wrapping paper into triangle shapes and securing them with tape. They check to make sure the points of each triangle fold meet the edges of the box precisely, adjusting as necessary. Once the entire box is wrapped, the person steps back to admire their handiwork. The wrapping paper is tight and wrinkle-free, and all the seams line up perfectly. Satisfied with their work, the person moves on to adding some finishing touches. They gather a spool of ribbon and carefully cut a length of it, long enough to wrap around the box and form a decorative bow. Using a special technique, the person ties the ribbon around the box to create a beautiful and secure knot. They then take the time to form a perfect bow, fluffing out the loops and adjusting the ends until it looks just right. Finally, the person selects a coordinating gift tag and writes a heartfelt message for the recipient. They string the gift tag onto the ribbon and secure it with a small knot, making sure it hangs elegantly next to the bow. The person takes a moment to survey their masterpiece – a beautifully wrapped gift that is sure to delight its recipient. They carefully set the gift aside, ready to be placed under the tree or presented at the special event, confident it will bring joy and appreciation from the receiver.

Snakes are quite useful, but that doesn't seem to matter. Snakes help control the population of mice. Without snakes, perhaps we would find mice everywhere. Most of us, however, would rather see a mouse than a snake. The poison argument is a strong one. Some snakes are poisonous, and this causes people's death. However, the poisonous snakes are only a small number. We can't say all the snakes are bad just because of a few dangerous ones. And what do we do with the people who really like snakes? They like snakes even more strongly than we dislike them. These people learn about them, find them out, and watch them carefully. Why? The only reason I can think of is that these people are open-minded. They are able to put aside differences and welcome the snake as a friend. Whatever the reason for our like or dislike, snakes do something good in the circle of life. They would prefer to be left alone, and that is what we should do.

However, King moved the business back to Rogers the next year. The building then stood idle, becoming victim to vandalism. All of its windows were smashed and it became covered in graffiti. Eventually, it was nothing more than an empty, roofless, concrete shell.In 1944, both Missouri and Oklahoma Row were sold to Springdale businessmen Roy Joyce and Jim Barrack. Missouri Row was torn down and sold in small lots. The roof tiles were bought by a Little Rock law firm. By 1956, the building had collapsed, leaving only a small section standing.Oklahoma Row continued to provide lodging, although it was run and managed by several different people. In June 1946, Company G of the Arkansas State Guard held camp at Monte Ne for field training, using the hotel facilities. Access to Monte Ne improved a bit in August 1947 when the state highway department blacktopped 1.4 miles (2.25 km) of the Monte Ne road. In January, six Monte Ne men were arrested for grand larceny, charged with stealing doors from Oklahoma Row and 500 feet (152 m) of pipe from the swimming pool.

They're looking to party, but there isn't much going on. As if to emphasize the point, Joe's 8-track copy of \\"Hocus Pocus\\" by Focus is eaten by the tape deck. He then puts on \\"Don't Fear The Reaper\\" by Blue Öyster Cult, but Hubbs calls it a \\"pussy song\\" and orders him to take it out. Joe counters by saying: \\"If it's B.O.C. how can it be pussy?\\", but Hubbs doesn't want to hear it, and grabs Joe in a headlock until he complies.They make a stop to chat up the homely \\"Buffalo Chicks\\" and get the lowdown on the evening's parties. Then, cruising once again, they pass Tack, (played by Clifton Collins Jr. in one of his first film roles), who's trying to flag them down. Joe, at the urging of Hubbs, spits a loogey on Tack as Tack yells out \\"I got some chicks, man!\\". Hubbs shouts: \\"Tack's got some chicks?\\" and screeches to a halt to find out more. After failing to get Tack to reveal what he knows about the chicks, they reluctantly let him into the car. That's when Tack reveals that he has a \\"shitload of fine chicks\\" staying near \\"that Frankie Avalon place\\" down in Torrance Beach.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article: The 60s decade was a time of major social and cultural change, and the trends of the 1960s reflected that. People were embracing a bohemian lifestyle and the Hippie Movement was born. To get the look that the hippies created, start thinking about theatrical costumes, recycled clothing, ethnic fashions, Indian prints, bright colors and mismatched patterns. Check out your nearest resale shop to look for vintage clothes and other items that you can repurpose, just like hippies did. Paisley prints and psychedelic prints are also great choices. You can’t go wrong by pairing those two elements together. Jeans came in all colors of the rainbow and often featured embroidery or appliqued designs. Keep an eye out for those details or add them yourself. Look for blouses with long and flowy \\"bubble\\" sleeves. Gauzy fabrics work great, too. Wear a simple chiffon baby-doll dress with spaghetti-straps for a feminine look. Hippies frequently went barefoot, but sandals and flip-flops were also popular. If you have boots or clogs, those will also work perfectly. You could have fun with fresh flowers, but fake ones will work. Daisies were especially popular and they were often worn instead of jewelry. Weave the flowers flowers into your hair and secure them with bobby pins. Try a simple braid adorned with flowers or weave them into a wreath to wear on your head like a crown. Gypsy scarves, flower headbands, and leather moccasins are all great options. Peace sign pendants, beaded jewelry, large rings, and chain belts will also work. You could also try stacked silver bangles, woven leather bracelets, and hooped earrings. Thrift stores will be gold mines for these items. There was a wide variety of hairstyles in the 1960s, the most iconic being the very long, natural looking style that the hippies wore. Part it down the middle and allow it to hang loose and free. If you don’t have long hair, check out wigs at your local costume shop. The beehive hairstyle was also very stylish. The hippies usually went for a natural look and wore very little makeup. They did use face paint, however, especially for special events and festivals. Paint images of daisies, rainbows, and peace signs on your cheeks or forehead. Add some face glitter for a little sparkle. For those that did wear makeup, it was variable. However a pale mouth, large false eye lashes and exaggerated eye makeup will be instantly recognizable. For real life references of 60s makeup and hairstyles, look up pictures of icons like Twiggy, Brigitte Bardot, Janis Joplin, Edie Sedgewick, Jane Birkin and Marianne Faithfull. Summary:","completion":"This article talks about the 1960s, a time of big changes in how people dressed and lived. The Hippie Movement started then, and people wore very colorful clothes with fun patterns. They shopped for old clothes and reused them. They liked wearing jeans, flowy shirts, and simple dresses. For shoes, they wore sandals, flip-flops, or boots. Instead of jewelry, they liked wearing flowers in their hair. Peace signs and beads were popular too. People had many different hairstyles, like long hippie hair or the stylish beehive. They didn't wear much makeup, except sometimes face paint with fun symbols like daisies or rainbows. Famous people from that time, like Twiggy and Janis Joplin, can give you ideas on how people dressed and looked in the 1960s."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Q:This article: The village government is led by a mayor and four trustees, all unpaid officials elected at-large for two-year terms. The current mayor is Steven A. Vescio, elected in 2019. A full-time, appointed village manager handles day-to-day community affairs; the first was Max Vogel in 1967. Briarcliff Manor's government operates from the village hall, which houses the Justice Court and offices of the mayor and village manager. As of February 2014, there are 5,531 registered voters in Briarcliff Manor. As of 2017 the village's government employed 69 people full-time, including their building department, planning board, department of public works, the recreation department, the police department, the architectural review advisory committee, and the conservation advisory council. The village government administered a 2017–18 operating budget of approximately 28 million which predominantly went towards public works, police protection, debt service, and recreational facilities and services.Briarcliff Manor maintains a voting custom that dates to at least around 1905. In addition to its customary general election, held at the same day in every municipality in New York, the village has a nonpartisan caucus, a town meeting-style forum to determine officeholders. The system of the People's Caucus is largely unique to the village, and has been described as an extension of the New England town hall concept. The People's Caucus, officially formed in 1946, chooses candidates by majority vote two months before the village election, where the candidates usually run unopposed, turning the election into a formality. The caucus is open to citizens of 18 years or over who have lived in the village for at least a month; voter registration is not required. Voters and candidates do not declare party affiliations, instead candidates present their platforms in early January of each year, and weeks later the caucus meets again to vote.In the Westchester County Board of Legislators, the western portion of Briarcliff Manor (in Ossining) is... contains an answer for the question: Of what town is Steven A.

Chris Evans: Chris Evans is well-known for his role as Johnny Storm/The Human Torch in the 2005 film 'Fantastic Four' and its 2007 sequel 'Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer.' The movies were directed by Tim Story, and the cast also included Jessica Alba as Sue Storm/Invisible Woman, Michael Chiklis as Ben Grimm/Thing, and Ioan Gruffudd as Dr. Reed Richards/Mr. Fantastic.

Jordan: Michael B. Jordan took on the role of Johnny Storm/The Human Torch in the 2015 reboot 'Fantastic Four,' directed by Josh Trank. The film featured a younger cast, including Miles Teller as Dr. Reed Richards/Mr. Fantastic, Kate Mara as Sue Storm/Invisible Woman, and Jamie Bell as Ben Grimm/Thing. This adaptation took a darker and more serious tone compared to the previous films, focusing on the origins of the superhero team and how they acquired their powers. Unfortunately, the movie was a critical and commercial failure, with many criticizing its pacing, story, and lack of character development. The response to Jordan's portrayal of the Human Torch was mixed, with some appreciating his performance while others felt it didn't live up to expectations. In conclusion, Chris Evans played Johnny Storm/The Human Torch in the 2005 'Fantastic Four' and 2007 'Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer', and Michael B.

The entrance opened on the only addition to the original farmhouse, a smallish room where the receptionist sat at one of two desks. The area was called the secretarial pod. The entrance to Ray's office, both medication and technician area, was right behind the secretary's desk. To the left was another door, kept closed, which led down the hallway to the client sleeping rooms, the dining room and the kitchen. There was a phone right inside the front door (or the back door, depending upon who you asked). When Ray wanted to smoke, he would lean out the front door, propping it open with his back in such a way that he could see down the hallway if he propped that door open as well and answer the phone should it ring. Smoking was prohibited inside the building, a policy which grew increasingly unpopular with both the staff and the clients as the course of the year wore on. By December, Ray would have to do weekly fire drills around three a.m. as a way of politely reminding his anti-social and policy impaired population that any building more than a century old was actually little more than well formed kindling.

Write a summary based on this article: There are two groups of people that are excited about the new CNN/WMUR poll of Democrats in New Hampshire: Bernie Sanders fans and political pundits. Both are excited because this poll is a doozy of the blink-twice, ask-a-co-worker-if-you're-reading-the-numbers-correctly variety. Since the last CNN/WMUR poll in December, Sanders's then-large lead of 10 points has inflated to 27 points -- the sort of margin of victory that makes it hard for campaign staff to feel a lot of motivation to get out of bed in the morning. This is why Bernie Sanders's staff probably isn't excited about this bananas poll. They need to raise money and get voters to the polls in a few weeks, and if Sanders backers think that the guy is going to win by a landslide, it doesn't really make trundling off to a church basement in New Hampshire winter weather seem particularly urgent. Especially given that, as CNN reports, \\"the Vermont senator's support rests heavily on groups whose participation in New Hampshire primaries is less reliable -- notably younger voters and those who aren't registered Democrats.\\" Among registered Democrats, Clinton trails by 9 points. Among undeclared voters, who can vote in either primary, she trails by 45. If Sanders is up big because people who don't usually turn out are supporting him, and then there's not much impetus for them to turn out, that's not great news. Except Sanders's lead here is so big that even that wouldn't matter if it were true. And the poll suggests an enormous amount of support for Sanders. His favorability ratings are over 90 percent in the state, which is basically where Michael Jordan's favorability ratings would have been in Chicago in 1993. Clinton's favorability ratings are good, but lower here than nationally and, obviously, nowhere close to Sanders. (There are other details in the CNN/WMUR poll, such as that Clinton is the \\"least-trusted\\" candidate by a wide margin. In what's a two-person race which includes a guy who essentially has home field advantage versus someone much better-known, it's hard to know how useful that is as a metric.) We'd seen big leads in polls before, often linked to methodology. But this poll is different. You can see how it dramatically shifts the polling average in New Hampshire, as calculated by Real Clear Politics. Sanders is now over 50 percent support on average which, needless to say, is good news for him. But is this an outlier? It is a sign of a quickly shifting race? Is it sampling the wrong people? Is it dead-on? It's almost impossible to say. The only thing we can say with certainty is that nearly everyone hopes it's wrong except those of us who like it when interesting and unexpected things happen in politics and those of you who are excited about the prospect of President Bernie Sanders. ||||| Democratic presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders chat following the Democratic Candidates Debate hosted by NBC News and YouTube on Jan. 17, 2016 in Charleston, South Carolina.

T Andrew Burton—Getty Images Bernie Sanders is gaining on Hillary Clinton nationally, but she maintains a large lead, according to a recent poll . A Monmouth University poll released Tuesday shows that Clinton's lead over Sanders has dropped below 20 points. Clinton has the support of 52% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning voters across the country, while Sanders gets 37% support, which is up from 26% in December. Since then, Clinton's support has dropped among almost all of the major groups of Democratic voters. Her numbers among liberals inverted, going from a 57%-31% margin of support over Sanders in December to a deficit of 42%-51%. Support among women for Clinton has also declined, dropping to a smaller advantage now of 54%-35% over Sanders. Politics Newsletter Sign up to receive the day’s top political stories. View Sample SIGN UP NOW “With a shrinking margin, a strong showing by Sanders in Iowa and New Hampshire could cut Clinton’s national lead even more. However, he would still have to overcome Clinton’s demographic advantage in the ensuing contests,” said Patrick Murray, director of the Monmouth poll. “Sanders is aided by the fact that most Super Tuesday contests are open to independent voters – a group where he performs well. On the other hand, about two-thirds of the pledged delegates awarded on March 1 will be from states where black and Latino voters comprise anywhere from one-third to a majority of the electorate. It looks like the demographic dynamic that hurt Clinton in 2008 may be what helps her in 2016.” Where Clinton still holds a considerable advantage is with voters over the age of 50 and minorities. Older voters substantially favored Clinton to Sanders by a margin of 64% to 24%. Clinton's lead over Sanders with black and Latino voters remains solid and is growing, now standing at a 71%-21% margin, which is a 10 point increase for Clinton since December.

The new poll, mostly conducted before Sunday night's debate, found Sanders' support has grown by 10 points since a late-November/early December CNN/WMUR poll , which found Sanders holding 50% to Clinton's 40%. New Hampshire Democrats' views on the race are solidifying as well, with 52% saying they have definitely decided who they will support, up from 36% who felt that way in early December. Among those voters, Sanders holds an even broader 64% to 35% lead. But the Vermont senator's support rests heavily on groups whose participation in New Hampshire primaries is less reliable -- notably younger voters and those who aren't registered Democrats. There are some signs in the poll that the increasingly contested Democratic race is gaining attention among the state's undeclared voters, who are not registered as members of any party and are able to choose which party's primary they will participate in. In the December poll, 38% of undeclared voters who said they planned to vote said they would likely participate in the Democratic primary, a figure that is up to 48% in the new poll. Those undeclared voters are critical to Sanders' support: 70% in the new poll say they plan to vote for him, 25% Clinton. Among registered Democrats, it's 50% Sanders to 41% Clinton. Still, that represents an increase for Sanders among registered Democrats. The December poll found him trailing Clinton, 47% to 40%, among that group. Sanders' rise in the poll comes as New Hampshire voters' focus on national security has faded. The previous poll -- conducted in the aftermath of the terrorist attack in Paris and as the attack in San Bernardino, California, unfolded -- found 23% of likely Democratic voters calling foreign policy and national security their top issue. That faded to 13% in the new poll, while the share naming the economy and jobs their top priority has climbed from 18% to 26%. On the economy, New Hampshire voters now clearly give Sanders the edge over Clinton as the candidate more trusted to handle it: 57% say Sanders would best handle it vs. 33% for Clinton. That's a massive shift since last summer, just as Sanders' campaign began to gain traction. In that poll, 37% said they preferred Clinton on the economy, 28% Sanders, and 22% were unsure which candidate would best handle that issue. In the new poll, Clinton maintains a broad lead over Sanders as the more trusted candidate when it comes to ISIS, 55% Clinton to 26% Sanders, about the same as in early December. Sanders also has astonishingly high favorability ratings among those likely to vote in New Hampshire's Democratic primary, and is broadly seen as the candidate with the \\"personal characteristics and qualities that you think a president should have.\\" Overall, 91% say they have a favorable view of Sanders, while just 2% have an unfavorable opinion. That's improved since December, when 83% had a positive take on the neighboring state's senator. Almost 6-in-10 say they see Sanders as the more presidential candidate in the field, compared to 33% for Clinton. While Clinton is also viewed positively, her numbers lag well behind Sanders' ratings, with 65% saying they have a favorable impression of the former secretary of state. The poll suggests Clinton continues to be dogged by questions about her honesty, with the share saying she is the least honest in the field now at 55%, up from 46% in December. The CNN/WMUR poll was conducted by the University of New Hampshire Survey Center by telephone from January 13-18. The poll includes interviews with a random sample of 927 adult residents of New Hampshire, including 420 who say they plan to vote in the Democratic presidential primary. For results among the sample of likely Democratic primary voters, the margin of sampling error is plus or minus 4.8 percentage points. |||||","completion":"The latest CNN/WMUR poll has revealed that Bernie Sanders has taken a significant lead over Hillary Clinton in the Democratic race, with Sanders now holding a 27-point lead over Clinton in New Hampshire.

The poll also reveals that Clinton is now the \\"least-trusted\\" candidate by a wide margin, showing dropping support in major groups of her previous core supporters. Whilst Sanders' campaign continues to grow strength, there have already been warning signs in terms of voter turnout.

If you can't, please say \\"No I can't\\". Question: Who used to be a prostitute? Movie title: She's the One Movie plot: The film tells the story of two Irish Catholic Fitzpatrick brothers, Mickey (Edward Burns) and Francis (Mike McGlone) and the tribulations of love, family and betrayal. Mickey is a New York City blue-collared taxi driver, unhappy over an act of infidelity committed by Heather (Cameron Diaz), his ex-fiancÃ©e. Francis is a white-collared Wall Street stock investor, who unknown to his wife, Renee (Jennifer Aniston), is having an affair. During weekends, Mickey and Francis visit their parents who live on Long Island. Their mother is never seen on screen, while they have better time interacting with their father, Frank (John Mahoney), who always gives Mickey and Francis advice to live out their lives any way they can and to always go for what drives them to succeed. While driving his cab one day, Mickey picks up Hope (Maxine Bahns), an NYU art student with whom he becomes infatuated and impulsively marries after a few days. This causes consternation for his brother, largely because he was not asked to be best man at the wedding. Mickey moves in with Hope, but later becomes disillusioned with aspects of their lifestyle, including frequent power cuts in their ramshackle apartment. Francis is also having problems in his marriage. He is concerned that he is being unfair to Heather, his mistress, the same woman Mickey left, by continuing to stay with Renee. At the same time, Renee's Italian-American family, mostly her younger sister Molly (Amanda Peet), suggest the problem with Francis' lack of interest in her is that he may be gay, so she has Mickey and their father, Frank, confront him about it. He denies being gay, but admits to being unfaithful. Meanwhile, Francis' arrogance leads him to take potshots at his brother for the apparent lack of forward progression in his life with his wife, while Francis argues with Heather about her own sexual infidelity with a much older man referred to as \\"Papa\\". One day, Mickey picks up Heather in his cab and goes up to her apartment to retrieve a television that belonged to him... A:","completion":"In the movie \\"She's the One,\\" the character who used to be a prostitute is Heather, played by Cameron Diaz. Heather is an important character in the film as she has connections with both Fitzpatrick brothers. Initially, she was engaged to Mickey (Edward Burns) but committed an act of infidelity that led to their separation. Later, she becomes the mistress of Francis (Mike McGlone), Mickey's brother, who is married to Renee (Jennifer Aniston). Heather's past as a prostitute plays a role in the complex relationships and emotional turmoil among the characters in the movie. The film explores themes of love, loyalty, family, and betrayal, set against the backdrop of Irish Catholic family values and contemporary New York City life. Each character is facing their own relational struggles, with Mickey trying to navigate life after his impulsive marriage to Hope (Maxine Bahns), an NYU art student. On the other hand, Francis deals with the consequences of his infidelity, as his wife seeks answers for his lack of interest in her. The movie highlights the brothers' contrasting approaches to life and love. Mickey is portrayed as a relatable, working-class individual who is somewhat disillusioned by his past, but his impulsive nature drives him to take risks in search of happiness. Francis, in contrast, is a white-collar stock investor who represents a more calculating and selfish approach to life. His extramarital affair with Heather stems from his arrogance and unwillingness to be emotionally committed to his marriage. To decide whether it's worth investing in this film proposal, consider the potential for the movie to captivate audiences with its exploration of complex relationships, family drama, and the search for happiness in the midst of moral dilemmas. The movie's mix of a strong cast, including well-known actors such as Jennifer Aniston, Cameron Diaz, and Edward Burns, along with its unique blend of comedy and drama, offers a compelling narrative that could resonate with viewers. Additionally, assess the credentials of the people involved in the project, including the director, producer, and screenwriter, to determine if they have a track record of creating successful films. Evaluating the potential success of \\"She's the One\\" should also include researching the current market for similar films, exploring distribution channels, and estimating production budgets to ensure a solid return on investment."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

A:","completion":"In the given dialogue, we have two speakers, M and W, discussing Bob's arrival time. Here is the conversation again with the two speakers' statements: M: Bob is supposed to arrive by 8:00. W: His wife said he had left home at 7:50, so he won't be here before 8:30. To answer the question, we need to focus on the information provided by the speakers, specifically what each statement tells us about Bob's expected arrival time. Starting with the first statement made by M, we learn that Bob is supposed to arrive by 8:00. This means that his scheduled or expected arrival time is 8:00. The second statement made by W provides more context about Bob's departure time and a revised expectation for his arrival. According to W, Bob's wife said he left home at 7:50. W then deduces that he won't arrive before 8:30. This detail about the possibility of a later arrival time does not change the original expectation about when Bob is supposed to arrive; it simply indicates that he may not arrive on time.

When she is sent home to Baltimore, Dinah's understanding father, Dr. Andrew Sheldon, an Episcopalian pastor, easily forgives his headstrong daughter this latest calamity, but her mother Lily encourages her to be more conventionally feminine.

Out of gratitude, Dinah offers to write a speech for Tom on equality, which he is scheduled to deliver the next night at the Forum Society's Spring Dance. While preparing the speech, which is a modified version of one of her own debates, Dinah learns that her exit from jail was witnessed by two women, who then relayed the information to Dan Fletcher, Andrew's Scottish vestryman. Dan is upset by the scandal because Andrew has just become a candidate for the new bishop's post, and suggests that he punish Dinah. Instead, the less ambitious Andrew encourages Dinah's dreams by confessing that, as a youth, he had a short career as a ballroom dancer but gave it up to protect his father's reputation.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Last weekend a Texas couple apparently discovered that the electronic \\"baby monitor\\" in their children's bedroom had been hacked. According to a local TV station, the couple said they heard an unfamiliar voice coming from the room, went to investigate and found that someone had taken control of the camera monitor remotely and was shouting profanity-laden abuse. The child's father unplugged the monitor. What does this mean for the rest of us? How secure are consumer electronic systems, now that they're all attached to the Internet? The answer is not very, and it's been this bad for many years. Security vulnerabilities have been found in all types of webcams, cameras of all sorts, implanted medical devices, cars, and even smart toilets -- not to mention yachts, ATM machines, industrial control systems and military drones. All of these things have long been hackable. Those of us who work in security are often amazed that most people don't know about it. Why are they hackable? Because security is very hard to get right. It takes expertise, and it takes time. Most companies don't care because most customers buying security systems and smart appliances don't know enough to care. Why should a baby monitor manufacturer spend all sorts of money making sure its security is good when the average customer won't even notice? Five scary hacks. Even worse, that consumer will look at two competing baby monitors -- a more expensive one with better security, and a cheaper one with minimal security -- and buy the cheaper. Without the expertise to make an informed buying decision, cheaper wins. A lot of hacks happen because the users don't configure or install their devices properly, but that's really the fault of the manufacturer. These are supposed to be consumer devices, not specialized equipment for security experts only. This sort of thing is true in other aspects of society, and we have a variety of mechanisms to deal with it. Government regulation is one of them. For example, few of us can differentiate real pharmaceuticals from snake oil, so the FDA regulates what can be sold and what sorts of claims vendors can make. Independent product testing is another. You and I might not be able to tell a well-made car from a poorly-made one at a glance, but we can both read the reports from a variety of testing agencies. 'Smart homes' are vulnerable, say hackers. Computer security has resisted these mechanisms, both because the industry changes so quickly and because this sort of testing is hard and expensive. But the effect is that we're all being sold a lot of insecure consumer products with embedded computers. And as these computers get connected to the Internet, the problems will get worse. The moral here isn't that your baby monitor could be hacked. The moral is that pretty much every \\"smart\\" everything can be hacked, and because consumers don't care, the market won't fix the problem. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bruce Schneier. Summarize the highlights of this article.","completion":"Recently, a couple in Texas found out that their baby monitor was hacked and someone was controlling it from outside. This shows that electronic systems connected to the internet, like cameras, smart appliances, and even cars, can also be hacked because their security is not very strong. Most companies don't spend a lot on good security because most people buying these things don't know how important security is. To help protect these devices, there could be government rules or special testing, like how we have rules and tests for medicines and cars. Until that happens, many \\"smart\\" devices will not be very safe from hackers."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

The following day her publicist confirmed that the track was entitled \\"Space Odyssey\\" and had been produced in collaboration with Rusko to protest a travel piece about Sri Lanka printed in The New York Times. The track made it onto the final album under the revised title \\"Space\\". The same month, she filmed a short film for the song \\"Born Free\\". At the end of April the track was released as a promotional single, and the short film accompanying the song was released. The film, directed by Romain Gavras, depicts a military unit rounding up red-headed young men who are then shot or forced to run across a minefield. The film, which also features nudity and scenes of drug use, caused widespread controversy and was either removed or labelled with an age restriction on YouTube. In the weeks following the release of the film, M.I.A. was the most blogged about artist on the Internet, according to MP3 blog aggregator The Hype Machine.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: I’m sitting at the airport on a Sunday morning waiting for my flight to Las Vegas for the now-annual pilgrimage to the NamesCon conference. A few years ago, Vegas was one of my “bucket list” places – one of those iconic cities that one should visit at least once in their life. For me, once was enough. This is now my 4th (I think?) trip to Vegas, and while the city has a lot to offer, it’s just not my cup of tea. For one thing, I’m not a gambler, like at all. I don’t have anything against it, I just don’t enjoy it. It either feels pointless or stressful to me. The city itself makes me a little sad – in some cases, it reeks of desperation. Last time I was there, my cab driver entertained me with stories of how she was working 3 jobs to save up enough to join some mega-massive bingo game. She won a small jackpot a few years back and that allowed her to work only one job for a few months. She was hoping to win again so she could cut back to 1 or 2 jobs. I wondered how many people do similar things – gambling their money away, in big or small chunks, in the hopes of that big score and in the process, putting themselves in a not-great financial situation. I suppose as long it makes them happy, then it’s all OK, but I can’t help but think someone like my cab driver might be happier overall if she only worked 1 job instead of 3, instead of working extra jobs to save up money to gamble her way to financial freedom. But that’s for her to decide, not me. The juxtaposition of extreme and in-your-face wealth and the homeless people on the Strip also makes me sad. It’s difficult to see people begging for food and sleeping on the street while all around you, millions of dollars are poured into creating a massive playground with every type of indulgence possible. But I’m the first to say that I’ve enjoyed staying in some of the nicer hotel properties there and eating several excellent meals at some of the finer restaurants in the area, so I’m not exactly helping to solve the problem.

Cohen advises Kaylan to show up to the draft board intoxicated from drug use, not to bathe or sleep, and to behave so obnoxiously that the Army will not draft him, leading Kaylan and Volman to engage in a sleepless night of marijuana smoking before their draft review, which they fail due to being high while taking the tests, and Kaylan pretending to be homosexual in front of the physician and expressing psychotic views to the psychiatrist. Because they avoid the draft, the Turtles fly to England where Graham Nash and Donovan play them an advance reel to reel recording of the unreleased Beatles album Sgt.

He plans to steal 2 million from the money-counting room of a racetrack during a featured race. He assembles a team consisting of a corrupt cop (Ted de Corsia), a betting window teller (Elisha Cook Jr.) to gain access to the backroom, a sharpshooter (Timothy Carey) to shoot the favorite horse during the race to distract the crowd, a wrestler (Kola Kwariani) to provide another distraction by provoking a fight at the track bar, and a track bartender (Joe Sawyer).

With the first one, I was hired by and worked for the family. I picked the teen up from school every day and took care of him until he was in bed for the night. When he passed away, I took a job with the local school district. My client at the school had spastic quadriplegia. He could talk and was actually very smart, but he had no control over his arms or legs. He couldn’t walk. He was never going to walk. The law requires that special education students be put in the least restrictive classroom environment possible. Since this kid was smart and could communicate well, and wasn’t a discipline problem, he had all regular classes. His only accommodation was a one-on-one aide (me), and he was allowed to be late to classes without consequence because we sometimes had to stop in a special room, get him out of his chair, and stretch his legs a little. Basically ten minutes of physical therapy, two or three times per day. Anyway, since this kid was legally required to take all the classes a normal student his age would take, he had to take Physical Education (gym). And, legally, his aide (me) had to accommodate his participation in every class as much as possible, including gym. Most gym classes began with the students doing laps around the track, then participating in a team sport. He couldn’t do the team sport, but, according to the lawyers involved, he should participate in the “laps around the track” part of gym. So I had to push this kid in a wheelchair around the track for about 15 minutes each day, until the other kids were all done and off doing the next activity. Then he and I were able to leave gym class and go do some physical therapy in his own little room just for that. Because, you know… lawyers and rules.

That's because some parts are just so silly or strange. 3. The acting is a bit like watching a school play. They say stuff and do things that real people wouldn't, which can make it more confusing but also funny. 4. The story doesn't always make sense, like trying to read a book with pages missing. This is another reason some people like to laugh at it. 5. Even though there's a lot wrong with it and it can be very confusing, the movie has become very popular.

Sentence 2: There is no advantage to this approach. If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","completion":"The two sentences present opposing views on the advantage of recognizing an approach as an application of case study methods. To assess whether the second sentence is true in the context of the first sentence being true, it is necessary to analyze the claims made in the first sentence and compare them with the statement made in the second sentence. First, let's break down the claims made in the first sentence: 1. Recognizing an approach as an application of case study methods has advantages. 2. Some aspects of the method, such as the close yoking of data collection and analysis, may not be widely used currently. 3. Applying these aspects in a way that increases timeliness without reducing quality could be advantageous. The first sentence suggests that there are benefits to applying case study methods to a particular approach, particularly by encompassing some methodological aspects that may not be widely used. The primary advantage mentioned here is the potential to increase timeliness without sacrificing quality. Now let's analyze the statement made in the second sentence: \\"There is no advantage to this approach.\\" This sentence directly challenges the claims made in the first sentence, stating that there are no benefits to the approach being discussed. Now, considering the question of whether the second sentence is true if the first sentence is true, we can conclude that the two sentences are contradictory. If the first sentence is true and there are advantages to recognizing an approach as an application of case study methods, then the second sentence, which claims that there are no advantages, cannot also be true. The two sentences convey opposite opinions on the advantages of the specific approach, making it impossible for both to be simultaneously true. Therefore, if the first sentence is true, the second sentence cannot be true."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Inigo Lopez de Loyola (sometimes erroneously called Inigo Lopez de Recalde) was born in the municipality of Azpeitia at the castle of Loyola in today's Gipuzkoa, Basque Country, Spain. He was baptized Inigo, after St. Enecus (Innicus) (Basque: Eneko; Spanish: Inigo) Abbot of Ona, a medieval Basque name which perhaps means \\"My little one\\". It is not clear when he began using the Latin name \\"Ignatius\\" instead of his baptismal name \\"Inigo\\". It seems he did not intend to change his name, but rather adopted a name which he believed was a simple variant of his own, for use in France and Italy where it was better understood. In 1539, with Saint Peter Faber and Saint Francis Xavier, Ignatius formed the Society of Jesus, which was approved in 1540 by Pope Paul III. Ignatius was chosen as the first Superior General of the order and invested with the title of Father General by the Jesuits. Ignatius sent his companions as missionaries around Europe to create schools, colleges, and seminaries. Juan de Vega, the ambassador of Charles V at Rome, met Ignatius there. Esteeming Ignatius and the Jesuits, when Vega was appointed Viceroy of Sicily, he brought Jesuits with him. A Jesuit college was opened at Messina, which proved a success, and its rules and methods were afterwards copied in other colleges. In 1548 Ignatius was briefly brought before the Roman Inquisition for examination of his book of Spiritual Exercises. But he was released and the book was finally given papal permission to be printed. It was published in a format such that the exercises were designed to be carried out over a period of 28-30 days. Ignatius, along with the help of his personal secretary Juan Alfonso de Polanco wrote the Jesuit Constitutions, adopted in 1553. It created a centralized organization for the order, and stressed absolute self-denial and obedience to the Pope and to superiors in the Church hierarchy, using the motto perinde ac cadaver - \\"as if a dead body\\", i.e. that the good Jesuit should be as well-disciplined as a corpse. But his main principle became the Jesuit motto: Ad maiorem Dei gloriam (\\"for the greater glory of God\\"). During the years 1553-1555, Ignatius dictated his autobiography to his secretary, Father Goncalves da Camara. This autobiography (\\"Autobiografia de San Ignacio de Loyola\\" in Wikisource in Spanish) is a valuable key for understanding his Spiritual Exercises. It was kept in the archives of the Jesuit order for about 150 years, until the Bollandists published the text in Acta Sanctorum.

Summarize this article: The seven women and five men who found Casey Anthony not guilty of the murder of her 2-year-old daughter Caylee declined to discuss the verdict that stunned court watchers. Judge Belvin Perry, who presided over the trial, ordered that the jurors' names be barred from being made public until further notice. \\"We are not releasing their names at this time. They are asking you to respect their privacy,\\" Karen Levey, the director of due process services for the Orange County circuit court, told a swarm of reporters waiting to hear from the jurors. \\"They are just not interested...a universal, unequivocal no.\\" Levey said that Orange County sheriff officers would be transporting the 12 jurors back to their hotel, where they have been sequestered for more than six weeks. The five alternate jurors also declined to speak publicly about the case. Casey Anthony, who faced the possibility of the death penalty, was found not guilty of murdering Caylee. The jury declined to convict her of either first degree murder or aggravated manslaughter of a child. The jurors found Anthony, 25, guilty on four counts of providing false information to law enforcement, which are misdemeanors. It's possible she could be released from prison later this week. The jury has been a serious group with some taking notes, others focused with laser-like intensity throughout testimony which has ranged from the dramatic to the tedious. Due to the intense media coverage of the crime in the Orlando area over the last three years, the jurors were selected from a pool in nearby Pinellas County in early May, and bused to Orlando for the duration of the trial. They have been sequestered and living out of an Orlando hotel since the trial began more than a month ago on May 20.

At least three are mothers, and one has two children who are Casey Anthony's age. In addition to the dozen jurors who will decide Casey Anthony's fate, there are three men and two women alternatives, but surprisingly none of the juors have dropped out despite the lengthy trial and the sequestered conditions. The profile of the jury was compiled from voir dire interviews during jury selection. Juror #1 The 65-year-old woman is a retired nurse and volunteer counselor. She is married with two grown children, and her medical background may give her a better understanding of the scientific evidence. In particular, she's familiar with the smell of decomposing bodies. \\"I value life\\" she said while discussing the death penalty. \\"I also value the criminal justice system.\\" Throughout the trial, she has stayed focused on the testimony, rarely scanning around the courtroom. Juror #2 A black male in his mid-30s, this juror works in IT, which might make him a good resource when the jury has to discuss computer searches. He is married with two children under 10. He said he was raised by a single mom \\"like Casey.\\" He knows about the case, but told the court, \\"If I had to return a verdict right now, I would say not guilty.\\" He admits to some misgivings about the death penalty. \\"God is the one who makes the final judgment,\\" he said, adding that he could vote for it \\"if I really believe it needs to be done.\\" Juror #3 This 32-year-old nursing student at St. Petersburg College has the least prior knowledge of the case. \\"I know my ignorance works in my favor at this point,\\" she chirped, admitting she would like to serve on the jury. Now that she's on the jury, she often wears a perturbed look while listening to testimony. A weaver in her spare time, she has no children of her own, but has a pet rat terrier. Juror #4 Court watchers were surprised when this potential defense-leaning juror made the panel. She is deeply religious and told the court, \\"I don't like to judge people\\" and \\"I just don't like to point my finger at anyone.\\" She said she \\"thinks\\" she can impose the death penalty. A black woman in her 40's, she has no children and lives alone. She wrote occasional notes early on, but her note-taking pace seems to have increased as the trial nears its conclusion. Her face betrays nothing of her reaction to the case so far. Juror #5 With her long grey hair, glasses and a generally stern look about her, this 57-year old white woman constantly looks across the room in the direction of Casey Anthony and her lawyers. A retired nurse's aide, she has three children and is the only juror with a criminal record (a 1998 DUI arrest). Her stance on the death penalty is measured: \\"I guess I believe in the death penalty? I'd have to know a lot of facts before I really considered it.\\" Juror #6 The 33-year-old restaurant equipment salesman is married with two children (ages 6 and 21 months). He earned a business degree from the University of Florida and is an avid chef who has twice cooked on television. In voir dire, he said the understood Casey Anthony's defense has no need to prove anything, and wouldn't hold it against her if she didn't testify. He also said he'd have no trouble imposing a death sentence. \\"If the law dictated it, I would be able to follow it,\\" he said. In court, he looks relaxed and attentive, although he rarely takes a note these days. Juror #7 Professing \\"just some, not a lot\\" of knowledge of the case, the 41-year-old white female divorcee said she would be able to send Casey Anthony to death if the facts warranted. \\"It would be, gosh, a solemn decision,\\" she said. She is a victim of crime herself, having suffered a home invasion by a knife-wielding intruder, but was not injured. The intruder was later arrested and pleaded guilty. Her father was an attorney. She sits up straight in her jury seat, facing the witness box ? and never seems to look out at the gallery. Juror #8 The daughter of a New Jersey police officer, this 55-year-old Verizon service representative has two sons in their 20s, the same age as Casey Anthony. Neither of her sons has had any legal trouble, but said \\"sometimes they're not angels. Being a mother, I would want someone to take all the facts\\" if they ever had to stand trial. Given the right set of facts, \\"I have no problem voting for the death penalty.\\" Like juror #7, she sits turned toward the witness, but has slouchier posture. Juror #9 Perhaps the most attentive juror of them all, this 53-year-old former logger from Indiana watches the proceedings with a fervor befitting a man who watches PBS and the History Channel in his spare time. His nephew is a deputy in Manatee County, but he's not necessarily a pro-prosecution juror. \\"Our system is that you are innocent until you are proven guilty,\\" he told the court. \\"I believe in that.\\" He is perky and friendly. He often smiles at the deputies. Juror #10 The panel's second Verizon employee, a 57-year-old male retention specialist, has never married and has no children. In court, he's inscrutable, focused on the proceedings, rarely glancing elsewhere. In voir dire, he claimed to enjoy reading, but hadn't kept up with the case. \\"I don't really know any of the details, and I do believe everyone is innocent until proven guilty,\\" he said. He once trained to be a corrections officer, but never applied for a job in the field. He's had familial legal troubles himself: his sister and her boyfriend committed a violent crime against his father. Juror #11 This single 33-year-old high school gym teacher reminds many in the gallery of Johnny Depp and Matt LeBlanc. During compelling testimony, he leans forward to the edge of his seat, knees apart, elbows on knees, with his hands clasped. He was selected for the jury even though he had \\"formed an opinion of guilt\\" because he said he could set it aside and \\"keep my mind open.\\" He characterized the death penalty as \\"a necessary option.\\" This juror seems to have a voracious curiosity for everything in court ? especially the gallery and balcony, which he often scans during the numerous sidebars. Juror #12 \\"Not a modernized person\\" is how this 60-something mother of two adult children (and one grandchild) described herself in voir dire. She doesn't own a computer, doesn't have cable TV and is \\"not that into\\" newspapers. Unsurprisingly, she had little knowledge of the case before these proceedings, although she did hear about it when news first broke. She works part-time as a cook at Publix supermarket and enjoys legal dramas. Asked for a number to represent her support of the death penalty, she stated, \\"the highest number, 10.\\" In court, she has a laser focus on the testimony before her. ||||| The verdict in the State of Florida vs. Casey Anthony murder trial coincided with a spike in online news traffic. Content delivery network Akamai tells us that it saw a spike in its Net Usage Index for News around the time of the verdict. As the verdict was announced, news site pageviews jumped from about 2 million to nearly 3.3 million a minute — nearly all of that coming from the U.S. CNN saw an online traffic spike as well. The network tells us that more than 1 million users were watching CNN.com/live between 2:00 p.m. and 3:00 p.m. This was 30 times higher than the prior four-week average. CNN.com (which syndicates Mashable content) also experienced a surge in regular web traffic, with 12 million pageviews — four times the four-week average — on the site during the hour the verdict was announced. Twenty-five-year-old Anthony was found not guilty of the murder of her 2-year-old daughter. Anthony's trial lasted nearly six weeks, but the case itself has been a big part of cable news for the past three years. The Anthony trial was streamed online as much as broadcast on cable TV. This allowed individuals to tune in from work and to comment using social media in real time. ||||| Outraged Facebook users are posting at a rapid-fire pace about the “not guilty” decision by the jury in the Casey Anthony trial. Posts challenging the verdict are going up faster than we can even count, meaning at least ten of them per second– and this is within minutes of the “not guilty” decision. Many of these posts include expletives, all capital letters and numerous exclamation marks. Some share videos, like the one embedded below, explaining how Casey Anthony was found not guilty of murdering her daughter; she pled guilty to supplying false information to law enforcement. And we’ve yet to see a post say anything in agreement with the jury’s verdict — have you? Readers, what are your friends posting about the case? |||||","completion":"The jury in Casey Anthony's murder trial comprised seven women and five men, and they found her not guilty of murdering her 2-year-old daughter, Caylee. The jurors unanimously declined to discuss the verdict, and their names were withheld from the public. Casey Anthony faced the possibility of the death penalty but was instead found guilty on four counts of providing false information to law enforcement, which are misdemeanors. The jury had been sequestered for over six weeks during the trial. The case saw a spike in online news traffic and sparked outrage on social media after the \\"not guilty\\" verdict was announced."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

In this final, Liverpool played against Tottenham Hotspur, another English football club. The match took place at the Wanda Metropolitano Stadium in Madrid, Spain. The 2018-2019 UEFA Champions League season had seen Liverpool advance all the way to the final after successfully navigating through various group stage matches, a round of 16, quarterfinal, and semifinal contests. In the final, Liverpool secured their victory with a score of 2-0 against Tottenham Hotspur. The goals were scored by Mohamed Salah, who scored a penalty in the 2nd minute, and Divock Origi, who sealed the win with a goal in the 87th minute. This victory marked Liverpool's sixth European Cup/Champions League title (previously winning 1977, 1978, 1981, 1984, and 2005). Jurgen Klopp, the Liverpool manager at the time, finally claimed his first Champions League trophy after previously losing two finals with Borussia Dortmund in 2013 and Liverpool in 2018.

The trouble is that when we are at work we are terribly unproductive; we produce less per hour than our main economic rivals. The difference is pretty dramatic, we produce on average 30% less per hour than workers in Germany, the US and France - we even produce 10% less than the average Italian. Leaving aside the fact that those bare statistics should undermine any stereotypes we have about Italian or French workers, they really matter because the more productive we are, the more money we can earn, as individuals and as a country. Professor John Van Reenen, head of the Centre for Economic Performance at the LSE, makes the point rather graphically: \\"By Thursday lunchtime the other countries have produced as much as it takes us to produce by Friday afternoon when we knock off work. \\"So basically we could take every Friday off if we could be as productive as those other countries and earn the same amount of money.\\" I don't know about you, but I think taking every Friday off is quite appealing, another way of looking at it is we keep working the same hours and increase our wages by 30%. But the big question is: why exactly we are so unproductive? Economists have identified three main reasons. For a start, we do not invest enough - our companies don't spend enough on the latest technology or on research and development. For instance in Germany there are 1,034 R&D staff for every 100,000 people, in the UK there are 883. Nor do we have the best railways, roads and airports in the world. We all know about the arguments over whether Heathrow should have a third runway or not, it has been going on for years, but Charles de Gaulle airport outside Paris has had four runways for years. The second major factor is that our companies are not well managed, we are it seems a nation of David Brents - the self satisfied but useless office manager in the sitcom The Office. Bad management alone accounts for a quarter of the difference between our productivity and our rivals'. There are plenty of internationally successful and cutting edge companies in the UK, but they are outnumbered by a long tail of businesses with pretty mediocre managers. In particular, family owned and run businesses seem to be badly managed. In a sense this is fairly obvious, after all what are the chances that the best person to run a business should just happen to be the eldest son of the last manager? As Warren Buffet once put it: \\"Would anyone say the best way to pick a championship Olympic team is to select the sons and daughters of those who won 20 years ago? Giving someone a favoured position just because his old man accomplished something is a crazy way for a society to compete.\\" In Germany where there is a even larger section of small and medium sized family owned businesses, the so called Mittelstand, they tend to be run by professional managers. The final point is that not only are our workers poorly managed, they are also in comparison with many of our rivals, poorly educated and poorly trained as well. This explains why French or US workers get more from the equipment they use than British ones. BMW's mini plant in Oxford apparently struggles to find qualified operators for its machinery and attempts to improve their training with internal qualifications have failed to close that gap. Of course, some companies do invest heavily and are well managed but they still have to wrestle with skills shortages and bad infrastructure. Jaguar Land Rover has had billions poured into it since it was taken over by Tata Motors. But JLR is still not as competitive as its continental rivals says Professor Lord Bhattacharyya, head of the Warwick Manufacturing Group, part of Warwick University: \\"Productivity is not just about the amount of money they spend on R&D or technology. One of the most modern plants is engine manufacturing at Wolverhampton. A state-of-the-art facility, but they are still not as competitive as German engine plants.\\" Lord Bhattacharyya blames low skills and bad infrastructure as well as the fact that nearly all the key component suppliers are now based outside the UK. It all points to a worrying problem, to really deal with low productivity we will have to improve education, skills, investment, infrastructure and management. Just solving one or two factors is probably not going to be enough. It seems we might just have to get used to those long hours.","completion":"UK workers are 30% less productive per hour than those in Germany, the US and France, and 10% less productive than Italians, which can be attributed to underinvestment in technology and infrastructure, poor management and lower levels of education and training among employees."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

With great enthusiasm, he talked about how he finds issues, approaches them, and writes about them, which tells me he is one of your best. I'm sure you would hate to lose him. Surprisingly, your reporter is not unhappy. In fact, he told me he really likes his job. He has a great assignment , and said you run a great paper. It would be easy for you to keep him, he said. He knows that the paper values him. He appreciates the responsibility you've given him, takes ownership of his profession, and enjoys his freedom. So why is he looking for a way out? He talked to me because he wants his editors to demand so much more of him. He wants to be pushed, challenged, coached to new heights. The reporter believes that good stories spring from good questions, but his editors usually ask how long the story will be, when it will be in, where it can play, and what the budget is. He longs for conversations with an editor who will help him turn his good ideas into great ones. He wants someone to get excited about what he's doing and to help him , exploring the best ways to report it. He wants to be more valuable for your paper. That's what you want for him, too, isn't it?

No, they do not have the same meaning. However, they do share a common thread of concern for other people's well-being. I will break down each question to provide a clearer understanding. 1) \\"I hate my dad. Should I feel bad if he loses his job?\\" In this question, it appears that you have strong negative feelings toward your father. Your emotions may be affecting your sense of empathy and creating a struggle within yourself over whether you should feel bad if your dad loses his job. Losing a job can be a difficult and stressful experience for anyone, regardless of your relationship with them. It is important to consider why you may have these destructive emotions towards your father – whether it's a result of past negative interactions or experiences. To resolve this internal conflict, you may want to explore these feelings further and attempt to empathize with your dad's situation. You do not necessarily have to feel overly emotional or provide support immediately after losing his job, but it may be valuable to view him and his situation with a sense of understanding and empathy. 2) \\"Should I contact my ex about losing his job? Multiple people have contacted me about checking on him, but I don't think it is my place. I care about his general well-being, but he pushed me out of his life, so I don't feel like it's my responsibility anymore to make sure he is okay. Am I being selfish?\\" In this question, you seem to be in a dilemma about whether it is appropriate or your responsibility to reach out to your ex-partner who has recently lost his job. It is clear that you still care about him and his well-being to some extent, but his actions, such as pushing you away, have led you to believe that it may not be your place to check up on him. Striking a balance between showing concern and respecting the boundaries of a past relationship can be difficult. It is common to feel torn between wanting to help someone but not wanting to overstep. Considering the context, it would not be selfish to choose not to reach out to your ex, especially if he has made it clear that he wants distance between the two of you. However, it could be helpful to express your concern to one of the mutual friends or people who contacted you, so they can relay the message or provide him with support. This way, you are acknowledging your ex's feelings and situation but also respecting the boundaries of your past relationship. In conclusion, both questions touch upon the theme of concern for another person's well-being, but they address different situations and emotional contexts. Recognizing the unique circumstances and relationships that influence each question will provide a deeper understanding of your feelings and help you make informed decisions that align with your values and personal boundaries."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the correct answer to the question from the following choices? Pick your answer from: i. drumlin. ii. delta. iii. glacier. iv. moraine.","completion":"The correct answer to the question is iii. glacier. A glacier is characterized as a persistent mass of moving ice and snow. This vast and dense accumulation primarily forms where the snowfall in an area outweighingly surpasses its melting, subsequently compressing over many years to create large, thickened ice masses. With the sheer weight of that dense ice mass and the influence of gravity, the glacier slowly moves or flows – much like a very slow river – shaping the Earth's surface in a multitude of ways as it moves. Glaciers are found in mountain ranges of every continent except Australia, although they are rapidly melting due to global warming. They are also found in the polar regions where temperatures remain low. Glaciers play a crucial role in fresh water storage; nearly 70% of the world's fresh water is held in glaciers. To clarify the other choices: A drumlin (i) is a oval-shaped hill, often found in groups, that is made up of glacial till. Till is the sediment left behind by a moving glacier. The presence of drumlins indicates a past glacial activity. A delta (ii) is a landform that forms at the mouth of a river where the river flows into an ocean, sea, estuary, lake, or reservoir. Deltas are formed from the sediment carried by the river and deposited at the mouth of the river. A moraine (iv) is accumulated debris (like soil and rock) directly deposited on the ground by a glacier. It's another landform that shows the historical path of a glacier, but this isn't the same as a large buildup of moving ice and snow. So, amongst the given options, a glacier fits the definition of a large buildup of moving ice and snow."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

A:","completion":"Hermann Scheer, born on April 29, 1944, and died on October 14, 2010, was a notable figure in German politics and global renewable energy efforts. This biography emphasizes several key aspects of Scheer's life and career which provide valuable insight into his beliefs, accomplishments, and contributions. In terms of his political career, he was a member of the Social Democratic Party serving in the German Bundestag, which is the German federal parliament. This indicates that Scheer was not only politically active but also held a significant position within one of Germany’s largest political parties. His party affiliation also suggests that he likely supported principles of social democracy such as social justice, human rights, and economic fairness. Scheer's significant roles within renewable energy organizations are also highlighted in this biography. As the president of EUROSOLAR, the European Association for Renewable Energy, and general chairman of the World Council for Renewable Energy, Scheer held important leadership positions in major organizations in the field of renewable energy. These roles demonstrate his influence in promoting renewable energy at both regional and global levels. The fact that Scheer was awarded the Right Livelihood Award in 1999 for his work in promoting solar energy worldwide signifies that his commitment to renewable energy and sustainable development was widely recognized and appreciated. This distinguishes Scheer as a leading advocate for renewable energy. Furthermore, Scheer's strong belief in the potential of renewable energy as the key solution to various environmental, social, economic, and political challenges is strongly highlighted. He believed that the current patterns of energy supply and usage are problematic, and renewable energy presents the only realistic alternative. He was convinced that solar radiation could feasibly replace conventional fossil and nuclear energy systems worldwide, which indicates his visionary and ambitious stance on renewable energy potential. Scheer's insight into the main challenges for shifting to a renewable energy economy is also of note. He identified political issues as the main barrier, rather than technical or economic limitations. This viewpoint underscores his understanding of the interconnectedness of politics and sustainable development. Notably, in 1999, Scheer was one of the initiators of the German feed-in tariffs, which significantly contributed to the rise of renewable energies in Germany in the subsequent years. This demonstrates Scheer's tangible policy influence in expanding renewable energy adoption in Germany."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Registration fees for Illinois lawyers could jump as much as 49 a year if lawmakers adopt two separate measures to bolster pro-bono services and support for lawyers with drug and alcohol problems. The Illinois Supreme Court is pushing for legislation that would allow it to dedicate money raised through the fee hikes to legal services to the poor. The justices are floating a 42 increase to shore up financing for pro-bono work, as the normal funding mechanism for legal services has fallen short in recent years. Currently, support for non-profit legal aid groups comes from interest generated on the Lawyers' Trust Fund, which pools clients' money that attorneys hold for such matters as escrow funds. But low interest rates and a sagging economy mean there is less money being generated. After hours of discussion, the high court agreed that raising the registration fees would be the best way to address the declining revenues, Chief Justice Moses W. Harrison II said. The judges were reluctant to raise those fees but eventually decided that supporting probono services was important enough \\"and lawyers had a responsibility to contribute\\" to the cause, Harrison said. Last year, the high court raised the base fee for active attorneys to 180 from 140. Lawyers in their first three years of practice or who are inactive pay 90, and retired lawyers pay nothing. Legislation circulated by the high court's lobbyist specifies that the hike would apply to attorneys \\"paying full annual registration fees.\\" In 2001, there were 57,392 active attorneys in Illinois and 74,311 on the full roll, according to the Attorney Registration and Disciplinary Commission. The hike would raise roughly 2.4 million. Last year, interest on the trust fund totaled 4.5 million, but service and handling fees consumed 538,000 of that amount. This year's returns are projected to be anywhere between 700,000 and 1 million short of that mark, said Ruth Ann Schmitt, the executive director of Lawyers Trust Fund of Illinois. Harrison said the fee hikes are designed only to counter the shortfall in interest income, not add to the total amount available. \\"Our legal services are already stretched to the breaking point,\\" Schmitt said. \\"We have a tough time raising enough money to properly fund services that our clients need.\\" Neither the Illinois State Bar Association nor The Chicago Bar Association has taken a stance on the proposed hikes. <sep>As of 2001 , how many attorneys where on full role and how much money would the hike generate?<sep>57,392 on the full roll- raise 1 million","completion":"No"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Title: Let's Go to Prison Movie plot: John Lyshitski (Dax Shepard) has spent most of his life being a slimeball, thanks to Judge Nelson Biederman III, who has been giving him hard sentences ever since he stole a car at the age of eight. Now he wants revenge, but finds that the judge died an all too peaceful death three days previous to Johns release from prison.He turns his attention to Nelson Biederman IIIs obnoxious son, Nelson Biederman IV (Will Arnett). At a dedication ceremony for Nelson III, John hops into Nelson's BMW, steals his change, spits in his coffee and uses up his inhaler. In the BMW after the ceremony, Nelson IV yells at his attorney (who has the speakerphone on in the fully occupied board room), starts to sing, and when he goes for the inhaler, finds it empty. He stops at a pharmacy, panicked, and starts knocking items off the shelf in an attempt to find a replacement inhaler. The pharmacy owners think he's another junkie robber, and that the inhaler he finally finds is a tiny pistol, and call the police. Nelson ends up convicted on that robbery and demands that the Biederman foundation call the governor to dismiss his charges. Even though the governor owes the foundation a favor, the board of directors decide to let Nelson go to prison as they have grown tired of his asinine deportment. John is not satisfied with Nelson just going to prison, however, so John decides to join him in prison by selling marijuana to undercover police officers. At his sentencing he pleads guilty to the same judge Nelson IV had, and asks for the same sentence (3-5) at the same prison. After negotiating with the judge and bribing a few guards, he ends up as Nelsons cellmate, and here he pretends to be his friend, all in an attempt to give him the wrong advice on surviving life in prison.Somehow, Nelson gets himself out of a numerous array of jams, even discovering that he's gay and meeting the love of his life, gang leader Barry (Chi McBride), a hulking, burly gay caballero with the heart of a dashing romantic hero beating within his massive, hairy...

Write some highlights for the following article: TV's newest crime thriller, \\"The Bridge,\\" is taking viewers to a volatile place most have only seen on the news: The U.S.-Mexican border. FX goes beyond the headlines with a series that aims to give a new twist to the serial killer storyline by setting it against the backdrop of a tumultuous border town. Named after the Bridge of the Americas that connects El Paso, Texas, and Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, the show explores the real-world tensions along the border through the story of two detective agents -- one from the United States and one from Mexico -- who must work together to hunt down a serial killer who is terrorizing citizens on both sides. The series is an adaptation of a Scandinavian drama called \\"Bron,\\" and is brought to life for the American audience by creators Meredith Stiehm (\\"ER,\\" and \\"Cold Case\\") and Elwood Reid (\\"Cold Case\\" and \\"Hawaii 5-0\\"). Like \\"Bron,\\" \\"The Bridge's\\" pilot episode opens with a gruesome murder and a body splayed in the middle of the bridge joining both nations. This time, however, the murder involves an American judge with anti-immigrant ties. El Paso detective Sonya Cross (Diane Kruger) and Chihuahua state police detective Marco Ruiz (Demian Bichir) form an unlikely pair of agents whose investigation and relationship examines the hot topic of immigration while shedding light on the varying cultural experiences of both border towns. The series also addresses the powerful drug cartels and rampant corruption plaguing Mexican police. Filmmaker Gerardo Naranjo, known for his critically-acclaimed drug trafficking film \\"Miss Bala,\\" directed the pilot episode and told CNN the drama's authentic take on the U.S.-Mexican border is what sets it apart from other productions. For example, the series embraces dialect as an important component of the story. Much like the real-life fluidity of language alongside the border, \\"The Bridge\\" incorporates Spanish when set in Ciudad Juarez and adds English subtitles. There is even the occasional use of a mix of both languages (aka Spanglish). Aside from being a Mexican national, Naranjo brought a wealth of border knowledge to the director's chair. He spent close to three years interviewing criminals and researching the conflict in preparation for 2011's \\"Miss Bala.\\" \\"We tried to be as honest as possible,\\" Naranjo said. \\"It is not about making Mexico look good or bad, it is about what is the truth. Many people who are ignorant of Mexican issues are going to learn about certain realities through our show.\\" At the New Generation Latino Consortium Media, Marketing and Entertainment Conference (NGLC) in early June, Bichir echoed the sentiment. \\"I had a conversation with my producers and writers and that was the first thing that got me hooked on it -- the promise of it being real,\\" he said. The show's premiere coincides with a real event currently brewing in Washington. With the passage of a bill in the U.S. Senate earlier in the month that aims to overhaul immigration laws for the first time since 1986, the immigration debate re-entered the public discourse. Crucial to the passage of the bill was an amendment to strengthen border security by adding 20,000 more border agents and 700 miles of fence along the boundary with Mexico. \\"The Bridge's\\" setting alongside the El Paso-Ciudad Juarez border allows the show to seamlessly navigate between both the entertainment and political world. Given this political relevancy and the Latino undertones of the drama, FX took the opportunity to launch a hyper-targeted campaign in an effort to cater to the 48 million TV viewers Nielsen says identify as Latinos. \\"When we first starting thinking about the show, we knew we had a huge potential opportunity with the Hispanic audience,\\" Sally Daws, FX's senior vice president of marketing, told CNN. \\"We understand that the Hispanic market is huge, represented by many cultures and nations of origin. We did our best to utilize materials that spoke in a relevant way to that audience.\\" Naranjo hopes that \\"The Bridge's\\" ability to cross multiple borders of language and culture will help spark a national debate about not only the U.S.-Mexican border, but the commonalities shared between the characters -- regardless of their cultural background. 'The Bridge' is a great bet,\\" Naranjo said to CNN. \\"I hope that this show can begin a good type of controversy and a good conversation.\\" \\"The Bridge\\" premieres July 10 PM ET on FX.","completion":"1. \\"The Bridge\\" is a new crime thriller series exploring the U.S.-Mexican border, going beyond just the headlines to offer a deeper look into this volatile area. 2.

This is a trio of tales, \\"Shakti\\", \\"Devi\\", and \\"Kali\\", about an experimental commune (or some such thing) called the Taylor-Eriksson group, which took people on journeys inside themselves and into the realm of the unknown, and left a bit of damage here and there, I'd say. Many years later some of that damage is still lurking and waiting for the right moment to show itself. Shakti tells the tale of a woman whose husband died mysteriously, in fact, he was torn apart, and the suspect was a man that may not have existed. Seems this woman is able to project some inner demon, or so finds out the sister of the man who was killed when she attempts to talk to this woman while posing as a reporter. Devi tells the tale of a young man who wants to \\"jump out of his skin\\". He's a skinhead, a speed freak, and is sent to see a psychiatrist who just happens to be a former member of this commune, which results in the good doctor helping the young man to realize his desire. This is probably the best of the three segments. Kali tells the tale of a healer, who attempts to \\"heal\\" this woman who was a part of this commune and lets loose some kind of demon that has lived in this woman, but one wonders if he did it or if SHE loosed it because it could not survive in her any longer. All three of these tales are pretty creepy and suspenseful because you're never really sure what to expect, and the premise and the settings are so unlike those of conventional horror films that it adds to the strangeness. This has a sort of low-budget look and feel to it but it also manages to conjure up a pretty creepy atmosphere throughout, much to its credit. I watched this with my mouth hanging open a good portion of the time and when the real scares (and gore) came it hit pretty hard.

(CNN) -- The failure of the P5+1 (the United States, United Kingdom, France, China, Russia plus Germany) to reach agreement with Iran Saturday in Geneva is a good thing if it allows the United States and Israel to sort out what really divides them on the Iranian nuclear issue before negotiations resume in coming days.

On June 15, 2007, the Jaguars released veteran strong safety Donovin Darius, who had seen diminished playing time in previous years due to mounting injuries. On August 31, 2007, the Jaguars announced that long time back-up quarterback David Garrard would start for the team, ahead of former first round draft pick Byron Leftwich, who was released in the teams final roster cuts. Garrard led the Jaguars to an 11–5 record and a wild card spot in the 2007–08 NFL playoffs. The Jaguars defeated the 2007 Pittsburgh Steelers season 31–29 to win their first playoff game in almost eight years and their first road playoff win since 1997. It was also the first time in the 50+ year history of the Steelers that they had been beaten twice at home by the same team in the same season. However, in the divisional round, the Jaguars fell to the then-undefeated 2007 New England Patriots season; the teams were tied at halftime, but the Patriots pulled ahead and won 31–20. Tom Brady completed 26 of 28 passes in this game, being pressured by the Jaguars defense only once, on the first play. This game, more than any other, gave the Jaguars front office a strong desire to upgrade the pass rush during the offseason.

Answer the above question based on the context below: On February 7, 2012, Metallica announced that it would start a new music festival called Orion Music + More, which took place on June 23 and 24, 2012, in Atlantic City. Metallica also confirmed that it would headline the festival on both days and would perform two of its most critically acclaimed albums in their entirety: The Black Album on one night, and Ride the Lightning on the other. In a July 2012 interview with Canadian radio station 99.3 The Fox, Ulrich said Metallica would not release its new album until at least early 2014. In November 2012, Metallica left Warner Bros. Records and launched an independent record label, Blackened Recordings, which will produce the band's future releases. The band has acquired the rights to all of its studio albums, which will be reissued through the new label. Blackened releases will be licensed through Warner subsidiary Rhino Entertainment in North America and internationally through Universal Music. On September 20, 2012, Metallica announced via its official website that a new DVD containing footage of shows it performed in Quebec in 2009 would be released that December; fans would get the chance to vote for two setlists that would appear on the DVD. The film, titled Quebec Magnetic, was released in the U.S. on December 10, 2012.In an interview with Classic Rock on January 8, 2013, Ulrich said regarding the band's upcoming album, \\"What we're doing now certainly sounds like a continuation [of Death Magnetic]\\".

What is the best way to: How to Make Key Lime Tartlets","completion":"Alright, making Key Lime Tartlets is kind of like building a small tasty tower, using different fun parts. You need the following flavors for your towers - this is what we call ingredients: 1. For the tower base, you need cookies crumbs (about 1.5 cups), some sweetness you know, like sugar (1 tablespoon), and a bit of melted butter to make them stick together (5 tablespoons). 2. Then, for the flavor-tower itself, or what we call \\"filling,\\" you need key lime juice (1/2 cup), sweet condensed milk (1 can), zesty lime zest (1 tablespoon), and two large eggs. 3. Lastly, for the very top of the tower, we use whipped cream and lime slices for decoration. Now, let's start building our flavor-towers: 1. First, we make the bases: Take your cookie crumbs, sugar, and melted butter, mix them well, and press them into mini muffin tins. It's just like playing with sand - we're making little castles. Then we need to bake these at 350 degrees in the oven for about 10 minutes. 2. Now for the tower: Marsh your eggs, add the lime juice, sweet condensed milk, and lime zest to them, keep stirring until they are all friends. Fill this on top of your cookie bases. It should just touch the top. These need to go back into the oven for about 15 minutes at the same 350 degrees. 3. All that's left is to decorate the top of our towers: After your tartlets are cool, you can add a dollop of whipped cream on top, and a little lime slice. Try to wait until everyone can try them together. And remember, if you do your best, then they're sure to be yummy regardless of how they end up looking!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Is the premise \\"A man smiling into the camera, wearing a hat with sunglasses on top.\\" true if \\"A man is sun coverings is outside.\\"?","completion":"The statement \\"A man is sun coverings is outside.\\" is somewhat difficult to decode, but it seems like it could be suggesting that a man is wearing items to protect himself from the sun while outside. Such items could potentially include a hat and sunglasses. However, from this statement alone, it's impossible to definitively confirm the premise \\"A man smiling into the camera, wearing a hat with sunglasses on top.\\" Provided the term \\"sun coverings\\" includes both a hat and sunglasses, this part of the premise can be met. The man's location 'outside' matches the premise as well. But there are some details missing in the given statement, which are not allowing us to fully confirm the premise. Firstly, the given statement does not tell us whether the man is smiling or not. This detail is crucial to confirm the premise as it specifically mention a man 'smiling into the camera'. It is entirely possible that the man is not smiling or there is no camera for him to smile into. Secondly, the statement does not provide us enough information about his interaction with a camera. Being outside and wearing sun coverings does not inherently mean that he is engaging with a camera, let alone smiling into it. It's possible, but we simply don't know based on the statement given. Thirdly, the phrase \\"sunglasses on top\\" in the premise could be interpreted in a couple of ways – it could imply that the sunglasses are on top of the man's head, or that they're mounted on the brim of his hat, or simply that he's wearing them. From the given statement, we have no way to ensure any of these conditions are true. In summary, while the statement implies that the man might be wearing a hat (possibly with sunglasses) while he's \\"outside,\\" we're missing too many important details to entirely confirm the premise. We ideally need more information about if he's smiling, if there's a camera and where the sunglasses are positioned to determine the truth of the premise \\"A man smiling into the camera, wearing a hat with sunglasses on top.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The sentence in German \\"Die ZOW läuft damit zeitgleich zur Shenzhen International Furniture Exhibition (SIFE), die jedes Jahr im März die Entscheider der Möbelbranche in der südchinesischen Wirtschaftsmetropole versammelt.\\" translates in English as \\"The ZOW therefore runs concurrently with the Shenzhen International Furniture Exhibition (SIFE), which gathers decision-makers in the furniture industry every March in the southern Chinese economic metropolis.\\" ZOW in this context seems to be an event or fair, possibly in related industries, that is scheduled at the same time as the Shenzhen International Furniture Exhibition (SIFE). SIFE is evidently a major event in the furniture industry, attracting decision-makers in the industry and held annually every March. It takes place in Shenzhen, a major city in southern China that is often referred to as an economic metropolis due to its significant influence on the Chinese and global economy. Scheduling ZOW concurrently with SIFE is likely strategic. Industry decision-makers attracted by SIFE would already be gathered, thus increasing the exposure and potential audience for ZOW, and consolidating travel plans for professionals interested in both events.

Background: Foals are a rock band from Oxford, England formed in 2005, consisting of lead vocalist and lead guitarist Yannis Philippakis, drummer and percussionist Jack Bevan, rhythm guitarist Jimmy Smith, and keyboardist Edwin Congreave. They are currently signed to Warner Bros. Records, and have released four studio albums: Antidotes (2008), Total Life Forever (2010), Holy Fire (2013), What Went Down (2015), one video album, six extended plays and nineteen singles. The band have toured internationally and have featured at Glastonbury, Coachella and Roskilde festivals. Context: Holy Fire was released in both the UK and the US on 11 February 2013. The album's lead single, \\"Inhaler\\", received its first radio play on 5 November 2012. They played the song \\"My Number\\" for the first time on Later... with Jools Holland. Holy Fire was produced by Flood and Alan Moulder, who have worked with many artists, including Nine Inch Nails, The Smashing Pumpkins and My Bloody Valentine. The album was recorded at Assault & Battery studios in London. Yannis Philippakis stated that the recording process had some unconventional moments: \\"At one point we even made these poor studio interns collect bones. We were inspired by voodoo, these Haitian rhythms. We collected some ourselves, from butchers in Willesden High Road. Mainly cows, I think often they had gristle and cartilage on them, mainly cow and occasionally sheep. We had to order these big pots because one of the shoulder blades was too big! We boiled the flesh away so we could use them as percussion! We wanted to get primitive!\\" According to The Guardian: \\"Their producers, Flood and Alan Moulder, even tricked them by recording their rehearsal in order to capture a more uninhibited sound.\\" In late November to mid-December, Foals toured the UK for an album preview. The tour was supported by Petite Noir (a close friend of Philippakis'). In summer 2013, they attended a number of festivals and headlined Latitude Festival in Suffolk in July. The band have recently played a World and UK tour, which ended with two sell out shows at Alexandra Palace in February. The two shows were in stark contrast compared to playing the same venue 7 years earlier to an almost empty room while supporting Bloc Party, a sentiment which lead singer Philippakis did not fail to mention during the live shows. Holy Fire was nominated for the Mercury Prize in 2013. Q awarded Foals with the Best Live Act award the same year while \\"Inhaler\\" received the Best Track award from NME. Not only this, but in a reader-nominated \\"Best Album of 2013\\" poll, Holy Fire topped the list; as did single \\"My Number\\" in a \\"Best Song of 2013\\" poll, beating NME favourites Arctic Monkeys, amongst other acclaimed bands. Question: what was significant about Holy Fire? Answer:","completion":"\\"Holy Fire\\" holds a significant place in Foals' discography and career trajectory for multiple reasons. Firstly, it marked a shift in the band's sound towards a style that was more experimental and ambitious. This can be partly credited to the involvement of producers Flood and Alan Moulder, who are known for their work with other successful alternative and indie rock bands. Their influence led to unconventional recording methods, as described by Yannis Philippakis, such as the use of animal bones for percussion. This experimental approach helped Foals to push their music in a new and creative direction and marks \\"Holy Fire\\" as a turning point in the band's sound. Secondly, the album proved to be a commercial and critical success. It was released in both the UK and the US, indicating the band's growing international influence. The lead single \\"Inhaler\\" received significant airplay and won the Best Track award from NME, and \\"My Number\\" was also recognized in a reader-nominated \\"Best Song of 2013\\" poll. The album itself topped the same poll for \\"Best Album of 2013\\". In addition, \\"Holy Fire\\" was nominated for the prestigious Mercury Prize, which acknowledges the best album from the UK and Ireland each year, highlighting the positive critical reception the album received. Thirdly, \\"Holy Fire\\" was also a significant moment in Foals' live performance history. They toured extensively in the UK and appeared at various international festivals, including headlining at Latitude Festival in Suffolk. They even managed to sell out two shows at Alexandra Palace, a feat which was particularly meaningful for the band given their previous experience of playing to an almost empty room at the same venue seven years prior. This marked a triumphant moment for Foals and a testament to their growing popularity. Finally, the creation and success of \\"Holy Fire\\" attest to the band's willingness to take creative risks, adapt their sound and experiment with non-traditional recording methods, all of which have helped them to maintain relevance and interest in today's ever-evolving music industry. This has not only marked a significant milestone in the band's career but also affirmed their position as innovators within the indie rock genre."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The author of the tweet has conveyed their feelings and situation using casual language and by exaggerating the potential consequences. The first part of the tweet, \\"super tired,\\" indicates that the author is experiencing a strong feeling of fatigue or exhaustion. This showcases weariness, which could be interpreted as a negative sentiment. The author is likely overwhelmed by activities, work, or events throughout the day, leading to this state of tiredness. In the second part of the tweet, \\"i better go the bed soon or i might get sick,\\" the author expresses a mild concern due to their understanding of the potential detriment to their health if they do not rest. By using the conditional statement \\"if I don't go to bed soon,\\" they are implying that getting enough sleep is crucial to maintaining their health and avoiding illness. The sentiment here is subtle and concerned, but not overly anxious. The final part of the tweet, \\"nooooooo,\\" is an exaggerated response to the possibility of getting sick. The extended \\"o\\" sound is often used to emphasize distress, but the sentiment here has a hint of humor to it. The author is partly expressing genuine concern about their health while also poking fun at themselves for potentially neglecting self-care.

Patricia knew nothing about how to use makeup so Mary taught them because","completion":"Patricia knew nothing about how to use makeup, so Mary taught them because she recognized that Patricia had lacked confidence in her appearance for a long time, and as a close friend, Mary wanted to help her regain her self-esteem and empower her to embrace her unique beauty. As they started their makeup lessons, Mary began by sharing the basics of skincare, explaining the importance of prepping the skin before makeup application and the necessity of maintaining a healthy daily cleansing routine. She emphasized the significance of using gentle cleansers, toners, and moisturizers according to Patricia's skin type, describing the numerous benefits associated with regular exfoliation, including the removal of dead skin cells and the promotion of cell renewal. Next, Mary introduced Patricia to color science and makeup theory. She discussed the concept of the color wheel and its use for makeup application, illustrating the difference between complementary and analogous colors, and highlighting the best ways to select eyeshadow shades that would enhance Patricia's natural eye color and bring more depth to her features. As they continued to explore, they delved into the many techniques for blending and contouring makeup to achieve various looks, such as natural, dramatic, or avant-garde styles. In the course of their lessons, Patricia gradually began to recognize her facial features' uniqueness and appreciate the endless possibilities that makeup could provide to accentuate and complement her individual characteristics. They experimented with various lip colors, from bold matte lipsticks to shimmering glosses, finding those that suited her complexion and personality best. Moreover, Mary wanted Patricia to feel comfortable with makeup application, so she made sure to teach her the correct order of applying makeup products, starting with primer and foundation, followed by concealer, and moving on to powder, blush, and highlighter. As Patricia became more adept in applying makeup, Mary taught her how to accentuate her eyes by using eyeshadow, eyeliner, and mascara in ways that enhanced their shape and size, making them appear more expressive and captivating. Mary also emphasized the importance of using high-quality makeup brushes for a smoother and more professional application. She explained how different brush sizes and shapes were used for different purposes, guiding Patricia through the selection process and teaching her the proper techniques for maintaining and cleaning her brushes to ensure the longevity of the products. While helping Patricia explore the world of makeup, Mary also managed to instill in her friend the value of self-care and nurturing a positive self-image that went beyond cosmetics. As Patricia's confidence grew, she began to understand that external appearances were only part of the equation - true beauty came from within, and it was essential to cultivate self-love, acceptance, and compassion for herself just as much as she did for others. Over time, the bond between Mary and Patricia only grew stronger, with makeup becoming not just a shared passion but also a symbol of their friendship built on trust, understanding, and genuine care for one another's well-being. Through the transformative power of makeup, they discovered the significance of allowing their natural beauty and inner light to shine through, inspiring others around them to do the same."}]`),P={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:W},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:B,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const i=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return i?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.prompt&&e.prompt.toLowerCase().includes(i)||e.completion&&e.completion.toLowerCase().includes(i)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(i=>setTimeout(i,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},Y={class:"search-container"},H={class:"card-container"},R={key:0,class:"empty-state"},j=["disabled"],D={key:0},q={key:1};function E(i,e,h,m,n,s){const p=f("PoemCard");return a(),o("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",Y,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>n.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,n.searchQuery]]),n.searchQuery?(a(),o("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>n.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",H,[(a(!0),o(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,g)=>(a(),k(p,{key:g,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),o("div",R,' No results found for "'+d(n.searchQuery)+'".
