I know that the answer to the question \\"According to the rules, what does a player need to remember if they want to block another player from getting through?\\" is in \\"There are many rules to contact in this type of football. First, the only player on the field who may be legally tackled is the player currently in possession of the football (the ball carrier). Second, a receiver, that is to say, an offensive player sent down the field to receive a pass, may not be interfered with (have his motion impeded, be blocked, etc.) unless he is within one yard of the line of scrimmage (instead of 5 yards (4.6 m) in American football). Any player may block another player's passage, so long as he does not hold or trip the player he intends to block. The kicker may not be contacted after the kick but before his kicking leg returns to the ground (this rule is not enforced upon a player who has blocked a kick), and the quarterback, having already thrown the ball, may not be hit or tackled.\\". Can you tell me what it is?","completion":"According to the rules, if a player wants to block another player from getting through, there are several key points they must remember and adhere to: 1. The only player who can be legally tackled is the one currently possessing the football, also known as the ball carrier. 2. A receiver, an offensive player tasked with receiving a pass, cannot be interfered with or have their motion impeded unless they are within one yard of the line of scrimmage. This is in contrast to American football, where the limit is 5 yards. 3. Any player may block another player's passage as long as they do not hold or trip the player they intend to block. It is essential to adhere to this rule to avoid penalties. 4. The kicker must not be contacted after the kick and before their kicking leg returns to the ground. However, this rule does not apply to a player who has successfully blocked a kick. 5. The quarterback, after having thrown the ball, must not be hit or tackled. This rule is in place to protect the quarterback from injuries and unnecessary contact. In summary, to block another player from getting through according to the rules, a player must ensure they only tackle the ball carrier, do not interfere with receivers unless within the appropriate distance, avoid holding or tripping during blocks, respect the protected status of the kicker and quarterback, and conform to all other relevant rules and regulations of the game."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Question: What other threat did the Spanish face at the time of the independence war in the Americas back in the 1800s? Context: The decolonization of the Americas was the process by which the countries in the Americas gained their independence from European rule. Decolonization began with a series of revolutions in the late 18th and early-to-mid-19th centuries. The Spanish American wars of independence were the numerous wars against Spanish rule in Spanish America that took place during the early 19th century, from 1808 until 1829, directly related to the Napoleonic French invasion of Spain. The conflict started with short-lived governing juntas established in Chuquisaca and Quito opposing the composition of the Supreme Central Junta of Seville. Answer:","completion":"The other threat the Spanish faced at the time of the independence war in the Americas back in the 1800s was the Napoleonic French invasion of Spain."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Given the background: Gibberellins are hormones that cause the plant to grow. When gibberellins are applied to plants by scientists, the stems grow longer. Some gardeners or horticulture scientists add gibberellins to increase the growth of plants. Dwarf plants (small plants), on the other hand, have low levels of gibberellins ( Figure below ). Another function of gibberellins is to stop dormancy (resting time) of seeds and buds. Gibberellins signal that it’s time for a seed to germinate (sprout) or for a bud to open. and the situation: Jeffrey is an avid grower of plants and he currently has some daisies and roses in his bedroom. Jeffrey's friend Robert gives Jeffrey a bottle of gibberellins one day and tells Jeffrey to pour some of the bottle onto the daisies. Jeffrey doesn't question this, because he is very trusting of his friend Robert, and pours the gibberellins onto the daisies, but not onto the roses.

Options are: (A). testes; (B). ovaries; (C). scrotum; (D). fallopian tube;...A:","completion":"The correct answer to this question is (A). testes. The testes are the primary male reproductive organs in humans that produce male gametes, which are known as sperm. Sperm are essential for reproduction, as they are responsible for fertilizing the female's egg during the process of sexual reproduction. The testes are located within the male's scrotum, which is an external sac that hangs below the penis. This structure helps to maintain the testes at a temperature that is slightly lower than the rest of the body, which is necessary for the production of healthy sperm. The other options provided in the question pertain to either female reproductive organs or related structures: (B). Ovaries: These are the primary female reproductive organs, responsible for producing female gametes, known as eggs or ova. Additionally, ovaries produce essential hormones such as estrogen and progesterone, which regulate the menstrual cycle and maintain pregnancy. (C). Scrotum: As mentioned earlier, the scrotum is an external sac that houses the testes. It assists in regulating the temperature of the testes to optimize sperm production. (D). Fallopian Tube: The fallopian tubes are part of the female reproductive system. There are typically two fallopian tubes, connecting the ovaries to the uterus. After ovulation, the released egg travels through the fallopian tube, where it may encounter sperm and become fertilized. The fertilized egg then continues its journey to the uterus, where, if successful, it will implant and develop into a fetus. To summarize, the testes are the structure responsible for producing male gametes, or sperm, in humans. The other options (ovaries, scrotum, and fallopian tube) are either part of the female reproductive system or serve a different function in the male reproductive system."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Process: - Plants start growing on or near the rocks - The roots of the growing plants start to break up the rock - The plant acids dissolve the rock - The rock is broken down into smaller pieces - Erosion begins. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose less roots break up rocks happens, how will it affect MORE or FASTER erosion of rocks. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process?","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis in question supposes that fewer roots break up rocks and aims to discuss its effect on the rate of erosion. To analyze this, we must consider each step of the process and evaluate both direct and indirect influences on erosion rate. Let's examine the process and assess the possible impacts of this perturbation. 1. Plants start growing on or near the rocks: In this stage, plants find their way to rocks and begin to grow. If there are fewer roots breaking up rocks, it could be due to fewer plants growing in the area or plants with weaker or less invasive rooting systems. This change might lead to slower erosion in the initial stages, as fewer roots penetrate the rocks and the erosion process begins. 2. The roots of the growing plants start to break up the rock: With less roots breaking up the rock, the physical stress exerted on the rock structure is reduced. This can lead to a less effective rock degradation process, as the roots play a crucial role in mechanically breaking apart the rock. The overall effect would be a slower rate of erosion due to the reduced pressure on the rock's surface. 3. The plant acids dissolve the rock: If there are fewer roots breaking up rocks, it is probable that the overall production of plant acids and other biochemical weathering agents would decrease as well. This would further slow down the erosion process, as the chemical breakdown of rocks would be impaired. 4. The rock is broken down into smaller pieces: With fewer roots breaking up rocks and lower plant acid production, rocks will take longer to break down into smaller, more easily erodible fragments. With lesser small pieces, there would be fewer materials available for natural forces to transport, thus reducing erosion. 5. Erosion begins: The combined impacts of fewer roots breaking up rocks, decreased plant acid production, and slower rock fragmentation would result in slower rock erosion. Both physical and chemical processes would be less efficient, leading to a less rapid degradation of the rocks. In conclusion, the supposed perturbation of fewer roots breaking up rocks would have both direct and indirect effects on the process of rock erosion. The overall result would be slower erosion due to the reduction in physical forces and chemical factors that contribute to rock degradation. It is important to note that while this perturbation would slow down the erosion process initially, over time, other erosion forces and processes may still contribute to the gradual breakdown of rocks. Natural factors like wind, precipitation, and freeze-thaw cycles, along with the presence of microorganisms or other plant species with more aggressive root systems, may still lead to rock erosion – albeit at a potentially slower rate."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Identify the most salient words in this sentence: football player reacts after failing to stop the penalty of football player","completion":"The most salient words in the sentence \\"football player reacts after failing to stop the penalty of football player\\" are \\"football player\\", \\"reacts\\", \\"failing\\", \\"stop\\", and \\"penalty\\". Let's break down why these words are particularly significant. 1. \\"Football player\\": This term is crucial as it gives us information about who the sentence is about and the context i.e., the world of football. In this sentence, there are two instances of the term, likely referring to two different individuals - the one who failed to stop the penalty and another one who executed the penalty. 2. \\"Reacts\\": This word represents an emotional response or an action, which is a significant aspect of the sentence. It communicates the football player's response to a certain situation, suggesting that something notable has occurred. 3. \\"Failing\\": This term is vital because it indicates that an objective - in this case, stopping the penalty - was not achieved. It describes the nature of the reaction from the football player and provides insight into the cause of the situation. 4. \\"Stop\\": The word refers to the defensive action the football player attempted, so it's central to the meaning of the sentence. It provides information about the type of action that was intended but ultimately not accomplished, presenting a main theme of the situation. 5. \\"Penalty\\": This word gives us the specific context for the described failure and reaction. In football, a penalty is a significant event and often a game-changer. It implies that the stakes are high, grounding the sentence's drama in the high-intensity environment of a football match. These words are the most salient because they carry the most semantic weight and provide the essential information to comprehend the situation.

We'll subtract 209g from both sides. 266g - 209g = 209g - 209g + 2622 57g = 2622 (since 266g - 209g = 57g and 209g - 209g = 0) Step 3: Now, to find the value of g, we simply divide both sides by the coefficient of g, which is 57. 57g / 57 = 2622 / 57 g = 46 (since 2622 / 57 = 46) So the solution to the equation is g = 46."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Question: What game does Homes invite Moriarty to play on the balcony? Movie title: Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows Movie plot: In 1891, Irene Adler delivers a package to Dr. Hoffmanstahl; payment for a letter he was to deliver. Hoffmanstahl opens the package, triggering a hidden bomb that is prevented from detonating by the intervention of Sherlock Holmes. Holmes takes the letter while Adler and Hoffmanstahl escape. Holmes finds Hoffmanstahl assassinated moments later. Adler meets with Professor Moriarty to explain the events, but Moriarty poisons her, apparently killing her â deeming her position compromised by her love for Holmes. Later, Dr. Watson arrives at 221B Baker Street, where Holmes discloses that he is investigating a series of seemingly unrelated murders, terrorist attacks and business acquisitions around the globe that he has connected to Moriarty. After meeting up with his brother Mycroft at Watson's bachelor party, Holmes meets with Gypsy fortune-teller Simza, the intended recipient of the letter he took from Adler, sent by her brother Rene. Holmes defeats an assassin sent to kill Simza, but she flees before Holmes can interrogate her. After the wedding of Watson and Mary Morstan, Holmes meets Moriarty for the first time. Voicing his respect for Holmes' perseverance, Moriarty informs Holmes that he murdered Adler. Holmes subtly requests Watson and Mary be left alone now that Watson is no longer working with him, but Moriarty indicates he will kill them anyway. Holmes vengefully vows to defeat him. Moriarty's men attack Watson and Mary on a train to their honeymoon. Holmes, having followed the pair to protect them, throws Mary from the train into a river below where she is rescued by Mycroft. After defeating Moriarty's men, Holmes and Watson travel to Paris to locate Simza. When she is found, Holmes tells Simza that she has been targeted because Rene is working for Moriarty, and may have told her about his plans.

A broad operational definition is sometimes used to encompass the complexity of these diverse phenomena, where a gene is defined as a union of genomic sequences encoding a coherent set of potentially overlapping functional products. This definition categorizes genes by their functional products (proteins or RNA) rather than their specific DNA loci, with regulatory elements classified as gene-associated regions. Try to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply \\"unanswerable\\"): What does the typical definition of a gene categorize genes by?","completion":"The typical definition of a gene categorizes genes by their specific DNA loci or deoxyribonucleic acid sequences, which are the molecular units of heredity responsible for encoding the information necessary to produce functional molecules, such as proteins or RNA (ribonucleic acid). Traditionally, a gene is considered as a segment of a DNA molecule that contains the necessary information and series of nucleotides (adenine, guanine, cytosine, and thymine) to code for the synthesis of a single functional protein or RNA product. This information is transcribed into mRNA (messenger RNA) and then translated into amino acids, which are the building blocks of proteins. This traditional definition of a gene, based on specific DNA sequences, has evolved as our understanding of the complex nature of genomic organization and regulation has deepened. The broader operational definition mentioned in the description recognizes the fact that a single gene might encompass different genomic sequences encoding a coherent set of functional products, including proteins and RNA molecules. This definition acknowledges that genes can produce multiple functional products through mechanisms such as alternative splicing, overlapping reading frames, or post-transcriptional modifications. Thus, the typical definition of a gene primarily categorizes genes by their DNA loci – or specific sequences on the chromosomes – responsible for encoding functional products such as proteins or RNA. However, the broader operational definition considers genes as unions of these genomic sequences and encompasses the diverse and complex phenomena associated with generating multiple functional products from a single genetic locus."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

After being identified, he was dragged away by an SAS trooper, who allegedly intended to take him back into the building and shoot him. The soldier reportedly changed his mind when it was pointed out to him that the raid was being broadcast on live television. It later emerged that the footage from the back of the embassy was coming from a wireless camera placed in the window of a flat overlooking the embassy. The camera had been installed by ITN technicians, who had posed as guests of a local resident in order to get past the police cordon, which had been in place since the beginning of the siege. Nejad was arrested, and was eventually tried, convicted, and sentenced to life imprisonment for his role in the siege. He became eligible for parole in 2005. As a foreign national, he would normally have been immediately deported to his home country but Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights, incorporated into British law by the Human Rights Act 1998, has been held by the European Court of Human Rights to prohibit deportation in cases where the person concerned would be likely to be tortured or executed in his home country. Nejad was eventually paroled in 2008 and granted leave to remain in the UK, but was not given political asylum. The Home Office released a statement, saying \\"We do not give refugee status to convicted terrorists.

After 27 years in prison, Nejad was deemed no longer to be a threat to society, but Trevor Lock wrote to the Home Office to oppose his release.

Make sure you don't sit by the windows here - you will be pestered by fruit flies your entire meal. This place has tons of them and it is disgusting. They are the worst in the corner window seats. I wish this place would do something about them... What is the sentiment of this review?","completion":"The sentiment expressed in this review is largely mixed with a slightly negative bias. Initially, the reviewer presents a more negative outlook. By describing the sushi as 'average', the person indicates that while the overall quality of the sushi is acceptable, it fails to exceed the reviewer's expectations or stand out when compared to other sushi restaurants. However, the reviewer then shifts to a slightly more positive perspective by praising a specific dish, the Cougar Rolls. The descriptive terms 'very different' and 'delicious' imply a level of uniqueness and a satisfying flavor characteristic of this particular roll, demonstrating that the reviewer appreciates this specific element of the restaurant's offerings. The sentiment veers back to negative when discussing the service, which the reviewer describes as 'just okay'. This suggests the establishment's service is mediocre and does not impress the reviewer, creating a sense of dissatisfaction. Moreover, the expression of revulsion regarding the fruit fly issue, identified as 'disgusting', exacerbates the negative sentiment. This issue bothers the reviewer to the point of strongly advising others to avoid seating by the windows, particularly the corner window seats. It can, therefore, be inferred that the cleanliness or maintenance standard of the establishment is a significant concern for the reviewer. The sentiment intensifies in negativity as the reviewer expresses wishfulness towards the end, indicating a desire for the restaurant to remedy the fruit fly problem. This further compounds the dissatisfaction felt by the reviewer, concluding the review on a rather negative note. In conclusion, while the sentiment expressed in the review contains elements of both positive and negative perspectives, there is a slight negative bias due to the recurring issues of mediocre service and the persistent fruit fly problem."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Today, he is seeing two patients, patient A and patient B. Patient A has thyroid cancer, but patient B does not have thyroid cancer. John is trying to see the difference between these two patients' reports. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which patient would have an overactive thyroid gland, patient A or patient B? Hint: For example, a radioactive isotope of iodine (I-131) is used in both the diagnosis and treatment of thyroid cancer. The thyroid will normally absorb some iodine to produce iodine-containing thyroid hormones. An overactive thyroid gland will absorb a larger amount of the radioactive material. If this is the case, more and more radioactive iodine can be administered, where it will cluster in the diseased portion of the thyroid tissue and kill some of the nearby cells. Cancer treatments often cause patients to feel very sick, because while the radiation treatment kills the unwanted cancer cells, it causes damage to some healthy cells in the process. The answer is:","completion":"Patient A would have an overactive thyroid gland. Since patient A has thyroid cancer, their thyroid gland is likely to absorb a larger amount of radioactive material, such as I-131, which is used in the diagnosis and treatment of thyroid cancer.

Movie plot title: A Christmas Carol Movie plot: In a prologue, Ebenezer Scrooge (Patrick Stewart) buries his business partner, Jacob Marley, in a rural churchyard. The funeral is poorly attended. Time is shown passing (as the sign outside Scrooge's business grows rusty). It is Christmas Eve, and Scrooge's nephew, Fred, visits the counting house to wish his uncle a merry Christmas. Scrooge believes Fred's marriage is unsuitable, and they argue about it. Fred departs, and two gentlemen arrive seeking donations for the poor. Scrooge denounces such charitable efforts, and the men depart. Scrooge agrees to give his clerk, Bob Cratchit (Richard E. Grant), the day off on Christmas but demands that Cratchit arrive \\"all the earlier\\" the following day (December 26). Scrooge arrives at his home and has visions of Jacob Marley's face appearing in his door knocker and the tiles around his fireplace. Marley's ghost (Bernard Lloyd) appears and convinces Scrooge of his supernatural nature. Marley tells Scrooge that the uncharitable are tormented after death, and he has come to warn Scrooge as well as tell him that Scrooge will be visited by three ghosts over the next three nights. The ghosts will try to convince Scrooge to reform. At midnight, Scrooge is visited by the Ghost of Christmas Past (Joel Grey). They visit Ebenezer Scrooge as a child, who is forced to spend his holidays at school due to his father's rejection. Scrooge's sister, Fran, arrives to tell Scrooge he is welcome at home again. The ghost then takes Scrooge to the business of his mentor, Albert Fezziwig (Ian McNeice). A young Scrooge (Kenny Doughty) is shown enjoying Fezziwig's Christmas party, and his romance with a young girl, Belle (Laura Fraser), is introduced. The ghost then shows Belle breaking off her engagement to Scrooge because Scrooge has become obsessed with money. The ghost takes Scrooge home, and in anger Scrooge snuffs out the spirit's light. Scrooge wakes in bed, thinking it is 2 A.M. on the following night. A light from the next room draws him toward the Ghost of Christmas Present... The answer to this question is:","completion":"Ebenezer Scrooge remembers Jacob Marley because Marley was his business partner and close associate. They worked together in the same counting house before Marley's death. The connection between them was not only professional, but also personal, as they shared similar beliefs about wealth and their lack of generosity and empathy for others. Even though Marley is deceased, he continues to have a significant impact on Scrooge's life as he returns as a ghost to warn Scrooge of the consequences he will face if he does not change his miserly ways."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The goal is to divide all the numbers in the list by a constant such that the sum of the resulting list is 1. The output should be rounded to 3 decimals. [8.925, 8.046, 244.754, 5.532, 34.244, 193.309] A:","completion":"First, we need to understand the given problem and its requirements. We are given a list of numbers and asked to divide each of them by a constant such that the sum of the resulting list is 1. This means that we must find a normalization factor that, when used as the divisor for all elements in the list, makes the total sum of the resulting list equal to 1. To find that constant (the normalization factor), we can follow these steps: 1. Calculate the sum of all the elements in the list. 2. Divide 1 by the sum obtained in step 1. This value is our normalization factor. 3. Divide each individual element in the list by the normalization factor and round the result to 3 decimals. Now let's apply these steps to the given list: List: [8.925, 8.046, 244.754, 5.532, 34.244, 193.309] Step 1: Sum = 8.925 + 8.046 + 244.754 + 5.532 + 34.244 + 193.309 ≈ 494.81 Step 2: Normalization factor = 1 / Sum = 1 / 494.81 ≈ 0.002021 Step 3: Divide each element by the normalization factor and round to 3 decimals: - 8.925 * 0.002021 ≈ 0.018 (rounded to 3 decimals) - 8.046 * 0.002021 ≈ 0.016 (rounded to 3 decimals) - 244.754 * 0.002021 ≈ 0.494 (rounded to 3 decimals) - 5.532 * 0.002021 ≈ 0.011 (rounded to 3 decimals) - 34.244 * 0.002021 ≈ 0.069 (rounded to 3 decimals) - 193.309 * 0.002021 ≈ 0.391 (rounded to 3 decimals) So the result is a new list with the following elements: [0.018, 0.016, 0.494, 0.011, 0.069, 0.391] In conclusion, we derived the answer by understanding the problem definition, breaking it down into actionable steps, and applying these steps to the given list."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Afterwards, a shunned cheerleader named Bambi is seen fawning over Grange's locker before the on-field celebration pours into the locker room. As a group of cheerleaders are cleaning up the field after the game, all five are skewered with a javelin thrown by an unknown assailant. The bizarre murder makes headlines, as does a subsequent murder involving exploding pompons. As a result, the college's summer cheerleading camp is closed down. In 1982, the camp reopens with Bambi as the instructor. After arriving on campus, she meets Pepe the maintenance man and his mother Salt, both of whom warn her against reopening the camp as they believe it to be cursed with death, but Bambi is undeterred. At a bus station, a young woman named Candy (labeled Victim #1) prepares to board a bus to the cheerleading camp but her religious fanatic mother tries to dissuade her. As they quarrel, red beams of light suddenly streak from Candy's eyes and levitate her mother into the air. As she hangs suspended, Candy tells her that she just wants to be normal and marches away to catch the bus.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the full name of the person that thought they had purchased an oil sketch prepared by Velázquez?, using the article: In 1692, the Neapolitan painter Luca Giordano became one of the few allowed to view paintings held in Philip IV's private apartments, and was greatly impressed by Las Meninas. Giordano described the work as the \\"theology of painting\\", and was inspired to paint A Homage to Velázquez (National Gallery, London). By the early 18th century his oeuvre was gaining international recognition, and later in the century British collectors ventured to Spain in search of acquisitions. Since the popularity of Italian art was then at its height among British connoisseurs, they concentrated on paintings that showed obvious Italian influence, largely ignoring others such as Las Meninas.An almost immediate influence can be seen in the two portraits by Mazo of subjects depicted in Las Meninas, which in some ways reverse the motif of that painting. Ten years later, in 1666, Mazo painted Infanta Margaret Theresa, who was then 15 and just about to leave Madrid to marry the Holy Roman Emperor. In the background are figures in two further receding doorways, one of which was the new King Charles (Margaret Theresa's brother), and another the dwarf Maribarbola. A Mazo portrait of the widowed Queen Mariana again shows, through a doorway in the Alcázar, the young king with dwarfs, possibly including Maribarbola, and attendants who offer him a drink. Mazo's painting of The Family of the Artist also shows a composition similar to that of Las Meninas. Francisco Goya etched a print of Las Meninas in 1778, and later used Velázquez's painting as the model for his Charles IV of Spain and His Family. As in Las Meninas, the royal family in Goya's work is apparently visiting the artist's studio. In both paintings the artist is shown working on a canvas, of which only the rear is visible. Goya, however, replaces the atmospheric and warm perspective of Las Meninas with what Pierre Gassier calls a sense of \\"imminent suffocation\\". Goya's royal family is presented on a \\"stage facing the public, while in the shadow of the wings the painter, with a grim..., what would be the answer ?

In 1853, a crew led by U.S. Army Lieutenant Amiel Whipple surveyed along a sandy wash in the northern part of the Petrified Forest. So impressed was Whipple by the petrified wood along the banks of the arroyo that he named it Lithodendron Creek (Stone Tree Creek). Geologist Jules Marcou, a member of the Whipple expedition, observed that the petrified trees were from the Triassic.A slightly later route along the parallel was a wagon road, built between 1857 and 1860, that involved experimental use of camels as transport. In the late 19th century, settlers and private stagecoach companies followed similar east–west routes. Homesteaders who stayed in the area developed cattle ranches on the grasslands, and cattle grazed in the Petrified Forest until the mid-20th century.Also close to the 35th parallel was the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad. Its opening in the early 1880s led to the founding of towns like Holbrook and Adamana. Visitors could stop at the Adamana train station, book a hotel room, and take a tour of what was then called the Chalcedony Forest. Over the years, the line changed hands, becoming the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway, and then the BNSF. More than 60 BNSF trains, mostly carrying freight, pass through the park every day. U.S. Route 66, a former transcontinental auto highway developed in 1926 from part of the National Old Trails Road, ran parallel to the railroad tracks until it was decommissioned in 1985.

Serato is an Italian chef and the founder of Caterina's Club, a nonprofit that provides dinner seven days a week to more than 300 children at the Boys & Girls Club in Anaheim, California. CNN asked Serato for his thoughts on being chosen as one of the top 10 CNN Heroes of 2011. CNN: Where were you when you got the call that you'd been selected as a top 10 CNN Hero? Bruno Serato: I was home, getting ready to go to work after talking to my mom in Italy over Skype. I can't express the feelings I had at that moment. I was so happy. I was in tears. I wanted to scream like Tarzan! It was amazing news. CNN: What do you hope this recognition will mean to Caterina's Club? Serato: This gives me hope that I can make Caterina's Club a leader in resolving children's hunger in America. I do believe that, all together, we can make a big difference. If restaurants and chefs across America worked with their local Boys & Girls Clubs and followed our program, we could feed millions of children. I feel like I'm a voice on this Earth and my mission is to tell people: \\"Let's step forward. Don't just talk about it. Do something about it.\\" We can make this a better place to be and fight the poverty in our country. CNN: How will you use the 50,000 award that you receive for being selected as a top 10 CNN Hero? Serato: It will help me to keep doing what I do and serve more children in need. I also hope to travel to promote the program and make more people aware of our national \\"motel kids\\" problem. CNN: What do you want people to know most about your work? Serato: In America, in our own backyards, we have kids who go to bed hungry. If we do something about it, we will have no hungry children in America. If you give up one cup of coffee a day, you can feed 10 kids. One bag of pasta costs a few dollars, and that can serve 10 kids. If I can feed more than 300 kids alone, all together we can feed millions. Read the full story on CNN Hero Bruno Serato:.

Question: Information: - The Duchy of Normandy grew out of the 911 Treaty of Saint-Clair-sur-Epte between King Charles III of West Francia and Rollo, leader of the Vikings. From 1066 until 1204 it was held by the kings of England, except for the brief rule of Robert Curthose (10871106) and Geoffrey Plantagenet (11441150). Normandy was declared forfeit by Philip II of France in 1202, and seized by force of arms in 1204. It remained disputed territory until the Treaty of Paris of 1259, when the English sovereigns ceded their claim, except for the Channel Islands. - Normandy (pronounced , Norman: \\"Normaundie\\", from Old French \\"Normanz\\", plural of \\"Normant\\", originally from the word for \\"northman\\" in several Scandinavian languages) is one of the regions of France, roughly corresponding to the historical Duchy of Normandy. - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight. - Great Britain, also known as Britain , is a large island in the north Atlantic Ocean off the northwest coast of continental Europe. With an area of , Great Britain is the largest European island and the ninth-largest in the world. In 2011 the island had a population of about 61 million people, making it the world's third-most populous island after Java in Indonesia and Honshu in Japan. The island of Ireland is situated to the west of it, and together these islands, along with over 1,000 smaller surrounding islands, comprise the British Isles archipelago. - France is divided into 18 administrative regions, including 13 metropolitan regions and 5 overseas regions. The 13 metropolitan regions (including 12 mainland regions and Corsica) are each further subdivided into 2 to 13 departments, while the overseas regions consist of only one department each and hence are also referred to as \\"overseas departments\\". The current legal concept of \\"region\\" was adopted in 1982, and in 2016 what had been 27 regions was reduced to 18. - Brittany ( pronounced or ; Gallo: \\"Bertaèyn\\", pronounced ) is a cultural region in the north-west of France. Covering the western part of Armorica, as it was known during the period of Roman occupation, Brittany subsequently became an independent kingdom and then a duchy before being united with the Kingdom of France in 1532 as a province governed as if it were a separate nation under the crown. Brittany has also been referred to as \\"Less\\", \\"Lesser\\" or \\"Little\\" Britain (as opposed to \\"Great Britain\\"). It is bordered by the English Channel to the north, the Celtic Sea and the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Bay of Biscay to the south. Its land area is 34,023 km² . - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union. - The Jurisdiction of Guernsey is a possession of the Crown in right of Guernsey in the English Channel , off the coast of Normandy . The jurisdiction embraces not only all ten parishes on the island of Guernsey , but also the much smaller inhabited islands of Herm , Jethou and Lihou together with many small islets and rocks . The jurisdiction is not part of the United Kingdom , however defence and most foreign relations are handled by the British Government . The whole jurisdiction lies within the Common Travel Area of the British Isles and is not a member of the European Union , but has a special relationship with it , being treated as part of the European Community for the purposes of free trade in goods . Taken together with the separate jurisdictions of Alderney and Sark it forms the Bailiwick of Guernsey . The two Bailiwicks of Guernsey and Jersey together form the geographical grouping known as the Channel Islands . - The English Channel (\\"the Sleeve\\" [hence ] \\"Sea of Brittany\\" \\"British Sea\\"), also called simply the Channel, is the body of water that separates southern England from northern France, and joins the southern part of the North Sea to the rest of the Atlantic Ocean. - Lihou is a small tidal island located just off the west coast of the island of Guernsey, in the English Channel, between Great Britain and France. Administratively, Lihou forms part of the Parish of St. Peter's in the Bailiwick of Guernsey, and is now owned by the Parliament of Guernsey (officially known as the States of Guernsey), although there have been a number of owners in the past. Since 2006, the island has been jointly managed by the Guernsey Environment Department and the Lihou Charitable Trust. In the past the island was used by locals for the collection of seaweed for use as a fertiliser, but today Lihou is mainly used for tourism, including school trips. Lihou is also an important centre for conservation, forming part of a Ramsar wetland site for the preservation of rare birds and plants as well as historic ruins of a priory and a farmhouse. - Jethou is a small island that is part of the Bailiwick of Guernsey in the Channel Islands. It is privately leased, and not open to the public. - The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest of the world's oceans with a total area of about . It covers approximately 20 percent of the Earth's surface and about 29 percent of its water surface area. It separates the \\"Old World\\" from the \\"New World\\". - The Bailiwick of Guernsey is one of three Crown dependencies of the United Kingdom. - The Channel Islands (Norman: \\"Îles d'la Manche\\", French: \\"Îles Anglo-Normandes\\" or \\"Îles de la Manche\\") are an archipelago in the English Channel, off the French coast of Normandy. They include two Crown dependencies: the Bailiwick of Jersey, consisting of Jersey, the largest of the islands; and the Bailiwick of Guernsey, consisting of Guernsey, Alderney, Sark and some smaller islands. They are considered the remnants of the Duchy of Normandy, and although they are not part of the United Kingdom, it is responsible for the defence and international relations of the islands. The Crown dependencies are not members of the Commonwealth of Nations nor of the European Union. They have a total population of about 168,000, and the bailiwicks' respective capitals, Saint Helier and Saint Peter Port, have populations of 33,500 and 16,488, respectively.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Given those answer options, answer the question: Q: An electron in an atom is completely described by four of what? A: A:","completion":"An electron in an atom is completely described by four quantum numbers. These quantum numbers are essential for understanding the electron's behavior, position, and energy within the atom. They are integral to the study of atomic structure, molecular bonding, and the understanding of chemical reactions and physical properties of substances. The four quantum numbers are as follows: 1. Principal Quantum Number (n): The principal quantum number, denoted by the symbol 'n', refers to the main energy level or shell in which an electron resides. It represents the average distance of the electron from the nucleus. As n increases, the electron's energy gets higher and its average distance from the nucleus also increases. The value of the principal quantum number is always a positive integer (n = 1, 2, 3, ...). 2. Azimuthal Quantum Number (l): The azimuthal quantum number (also known as orbital angular momentum quantum number or simply angular quantum number), represented by the symbol 'l', describes the shape of the subshells (or orbitals) within a given main energy level. Each energy level consists of one or more subshells, which accommodate distinct types of orbitals (s, p, d, f…). The value of l ranges from 0 to (n-1) for any given principal quantum number n, with l = 0 corresponding to the s subshell, l = 1 to the p subshell, l = 2 to the d subshell, and l = 3 to the f subshell. 3. Magnetic Quantum Number (m_l): The magnetic quantum number, symbolized as 'm_l', is associated with the orientation of the orbital in space. It is directly linked to the azimuthal quantum number and can take on any integer value ranging from -l to +l, where 'l' is the angular quantum number. Each value of m_l corresponds to a specific orientation of the orbital in three-dimensional space, and hence the number of possible values for m_l indicates how many orbitals there are in a particular subshell. 4. Spin Quantum Number (m_s): The spin quantum number, denoted by 'm_s', defines the intrinsic angular momentum or \\"spin\\" of the electron within its orbital. Electrons can either have a spin of +1/2 (spin-up) or -1/2 (spin-down). The spin quantum number is crucial in determining the behavior of electrons in the presence of a magnetic field and is fundamental to understanding electron pairing within orbitals, which is governed by the Pauli Exclusion Principle. This principle states that no two electrons in an atom can have the same four quantum number values; in other words, two electrons sharing the same orbital must have opposite spins. In summary, an electron's position, behavior, and energy within an atom can be completely described by these four quantum numbers: principal quantum number (n), azimuthal quantum number (l), magnetic quantum number (m_l), and spin quantum number (m_s). These numbers are critical to understanding atomic structure, chemical bonding, and the properties of substances."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

National Football League owners unanimously endorsed what they called a 'revised and strengthened' Personal Conduct Policy in the wake of several domestic violence incidents involving players. 'With considerable assistance from the many people and organizations we consulted, NFL ownership has endorsed an enhanced policy that is significantly more robust, thorough, and formal,' NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said. The NFL has come under fire over the last six months as it struggled with a personal conduct policy widely seen as too lenient. With big-money NFL sponsors watching closely, Goodell embarked on a mission to strengthen the policy. NFL commissioner Roger Goodell has endured a turbulent year off the field with a raft of unsavoury incidents. High-profile players Adrian Peterson, Ray Rice and Greg Hardy have been convicted of domestic abuse over the past few months and the NFL has stumbled in some of its attempts to punish the players. A special counsel for investigations and conduct will 'decide the discipline for violations' of the new policy, said Goodell, who will still hear appeals but may appoint an independent panel to assist him. 'The policy is comprehensive. It is strong. It is tough. And it is better for everyone associated with the NFL,' Goodell said. The players union was not happy it was not part of the process in formulating a new policy. 'Our union has not been offered the professional courtesy of seeing the NFL's new personal conduct policy before it hit the presses,' the NFL Players Union said in a statement. 'Their unilateral decision and conduct today is the only thing that has been consistent over the past few months.' Among the changes are a 'more extensive' list of prohibited conduct and NFL-funded counseling and services for victims, families, and violators, Goodell said. Ray Rice (right) is free to play in the NFL after knocking out his then-fiancee Janay (centre) in a casino lift. The new policy was unveiled at a regularly scheduled owners meeting in Irving, Texas, outside Dallas. Arizona Cardinals owner Michael Bidwill will serve as chairman of a nine-owner committee that will oversee the new policy, Goodell said. Two former players with ownership stakes also will serve on the committee, Warrick Dunn of the Atlanta Falcons and the Pittsburgh Steelers' John Stallworth. After the criticism erupted over the summer, Goodell retained four women, including Lisa Friel, the former head of the Manhattan district attorney's sex-crimes unit, to shape the NFL's policies relating to domestic violence and sexual assault. 'We now have a layered evaluation process to take into account a diversity of expert views,' Goodell said. Adrian Peterson disciplined his four-year-old son with a switch and is currently banned by the NFL. Summarize the highlights of this article.","completion":"The people who own the National Football League (NFL) agreed to create a new and improved behavior rule for their football players. This is because some players were violent towards their families, and the old rules were not strong enough to deal with that. The new rule aims to make sure players stay out of trouble and act nicely. The players' group wanted to be involved in making the new rule, but they were not happy that they did not get a chance to see it before everyone else. The new policy will also offer help to those who have been hurt by the players or their families. This decision was made at a big meeting in Texas, and some important people will watch over the new rules."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

If not, let me know by writing \\"Not answerable\\". Plot title: Can't Stop the Music Movie plot: Songwriter Jack Morell (Steve Guttenberg)-a reference to Village People creator Jacques Morali-gets a break DJing at local disco Saddle Tramps. His roommate Sam Simpson (Valerie Perrine), a supermodel newly retired at the peak of her success, sees the response to a song he wrote for her (\\"Samantha\\") and agrees to use her connections to get him a record deal. Her connection, ex-boyfriend Steve Waits (Paul Sand), president of Marrakech Records (a reference to Village People record label Casablanca Records), is more interested in getting back with her than in Jack's music (and more interested in taking business calls than in wooing Samantha), but agrees to listen to a demo. Sam decides Jack's vocals won't do, and recruits neighbor and Saddle Tramps waiter/go-go boy Felipe Rose (the Indian), fellow model David \\"Scar\\" Hodo (the construction worker, who daydreams of stardom in the solo number \\"I Love You to Death\\"), and finds Randy Jones (the cowboy) on the streets of Greenwich Village, offering dinner in return for their participation. Meanwhile, Sam's former agent Sydney Channing (Tammy Grimes) orders Girl Friday Lulu Brecht (Marilyn Sokol) to attend, hoping to lure the star back. Ron White (Bruce Jenner[a]), a lawyer from St. Louis, is mugged by an elderly woman on his way to deliver a cake Sam's sister sent, and shows up on edge. Brecht gets Jack high, which unnerves him when her friend Alicia Edwards brings singing cop Ray Simpson, but Jack records the quartet on \\"Magic Night\\". Ron, pawed all night by the man-hungry Brecht, is overwhelmed by the culture shock of it all and walks out. The next day, Sam runs into Ron, who apologizes, proffers the excuse that he's a Gemini, and follows her home. Spilling leftover lasagna on himself, Sam and Jack help him off with his trousers before Jack leaves and Sam and Ron spend the night. Newly interested in helping, Ron offers his Wall Street office to hold auditions. There, Glenn M. Hughes, the leatherman climbs atop a piano for a rendition of \\"Danny Boy\\", and he and Alex... My question: What is Ron's most likely profession? The answer is:","completion":"Based on the given plot, Ron White's most likely profession is a lawyer.

By this time, complaints about his supposed indecency were beginning to resurface. All but one of the 15 paintings Etty exhibited at the Royal Academy in the 1820s had included at least one nude figure, and Etty was acquiring a reputation for using respectable themes as a pretext for nudity.For the 1828 Summer Exhibition Etty exhibited three pictures; The World Before the Flood, Venus, the Evening Star and Guardian Cherubs. (The latter was a portrait of the children of Welbore Ellis Agar, 2nd Earl of Normanton, and was the only non-nude painting exhibited by Etty at the RA in the 1820s.) Although similar to his earlier works, they were technically more accomplished. Both The World Before the Flood and Venus attracted positive reviews in the press and were sold during their exhibition for substantial sums, although the purchase by the Marquess of Stafford of The World Before the Flood—a work containing scantily clad figures of both sexes—drew a pointed comment in The Gentleman's Magazine that it \\"will serve to accompany the private Titians of that nobleman\\". Despite the increasing number of complaints in the press about his use of nudity, respect for Etty from his fellow artists continued to rise, and in 1828 the British Institution awarded him £100 in recognition of his talent. As soon as the 1828 Summer Exhibition was over, Etty stopped work on other projects to concentrate on a diploma piece, without which he could not become a Royal Academician. This piece, Sleeping Nymph and Satyrs, was presented to the Academy in October, and in December 1828 Etty became a Royal Academician.

As part of this year's examination, both men had their arterial walls examined to identify the presence of plaques. The doctor discovered that Jake had a high amount of plaques present on the interior of his arterial wall. Ryan, on the other hand, had no plaques present. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Who is more likely to have lowered oxygen supply to their heart muscles? Hint: Cholesterol has been implicated in heart disease for decades. Atherosclerosis is a disorder of the arteries in which cholesterol and other materials are deposited on the interior of the arterial wall. These deposits lead to the formation of plaques that can restrict or even block the flow of blood through these blood vessels (see Figure below ). A decrease in the flow of blood can lead to high blood pressure and a lowered oxygen supply to the heart muscle. A complete blockage of blood flow to parts of the heart (a heart attack) can cause significant damage due to oxygen deprivation, in some cases leading to death. Answer:","completion":"Based on the given information, Jake is more likely to have lowered oxygen supply to his heart muscles. This is because the doctor discovered a high amount of plaques present on the interior of his arterial wall. These plaques formed due to cholesterol and other materials deposited on the artery walls can restrict or even block the flow of blood through the blood vessels, leading to high blood pressure and a lowered oxygen supply to the heart muscle.

The Buggles were an English new wave band formed in London, England in 1977 by singer and bassist Trevor Horn and keyboardist Geoffrey Downes. They are best known for their 1979 debut single \\"Video Killed the Radio Star\\" that topped the UK Singles Chart and reached number one in 15 other countries. The duo released their first album, The Age of Plastic, in January 1980 with \\"Video Killed the Radio Star\\" as its lead single. Soon after the album's release, Horn and Downes joined the progressive rock band Downes claimed the group's name derived as a pun on the rock band the Beatles, saying: \\"It was originally called the Bugs ... studio insects--imaginary creatures who lived in recording studios creating havoc. Then somebody said as a joke that the Bugs would never be as big as The Beatles. So we changed it to the Buggles.\\" Horn later spoke of its name: \\"I know the name's awful, but at the time it was the era of the great punk thing. I'd got fed up of producing people who were generally idiots but called themselves all sorts of clever names like the Unwanted, the Unwashed, the Unheard ... when it came to choosing our name I thought I'd pick the most disgusting name possible. In retrospect I have frequently regretted calling myself Buggles, but in those days I never really thought much about packaging or selling myself, all that really concerned me was the record.\\" Horn began his career producing jingles and punk rock groups. Downes was a keyboardist in She's French and graduated from Leeds College of Music in 1975, after which he moved to London for keyboard work. The two first met in 1976 at auditions for Tina Charles' backing band and worked with her producer, Biddu, whose backing tracks had an influence on their early work as the Buggles. Horn met musician Bruce Woolley while playing the bass guitar in the house band at the Hammersmith Odeon. Both expressed an interest in Kraftwerk and Daniel Miller, leading them to read Crash by J.G. Ballard. Said Horn, \\"\\"We had this idea that at some future point there'd be a record label that didn't really have any artists--just a computer in the basement and some mad Vincent Price-like figure making the records ... One of the groups this computer would make would be the Buggles, which was obviously a corruption of the Beatles, who would just be this inconsequential bunch of people with a hit song that the computer had written ... and would never be seen.\\" In 1977, Horn, Downes and Woolley got together and began recording a selection of demos in a small room above a stonemason shop in Wimbledon, south west London, including \\"Video Killed the Radio Star\\", \\"Clean, Clean\\" and \\"On TV\\". Though unsure on what they wished to do with them, Downes remembered that \\"we knew even then ... there was some distant goal that had to be reached\\", and proceeded to re-record the songs at a 16-track recording studio in north London. Initial searches for the right record label to record and release an album failed, but Horn, having begun a relationship with Jill Sinclair, a co-founder of Sarm East Studios, managed to secure plans for a potential deal. However, the demo of \\"Video Killed the Radio Star\\" caught the attention of producer Chris Blackwell of Island Records and, on the day Horn and Downes were due to sign with Sarm East, Blackwell offered them a more lucrative deal, which they accepted. Downes claimed Island rejected them three times before a final deal was agreed upon.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: What relevance does Bruce Woolley have to the group?","completion":"Bruce Woolley is relevant to the group because he met Trevor Horn while playing bass guitar in the house band at the Hammersmith Odeon.

She would check them with marks, though she couldn't read the book at all. When I went to high school, I was an A-student, but not for long. I wanted cool clothes and hung out with friends.

Given the question: The filming was kind of a long process, but maybe it didn’t need to be? Or maybe it did? The first night of filming at the Thornbury Bowls Club was for a test shoot with mine and Rosie’s camera, to work out which one we wanted to use for her film. The second night of filming involved us getting establishing shots of the location. The third night of filming involved us mainly shooting Rosie’s script. And the fourth night of shooting involved us mainly shooting Bell’s script and getting any other shots we needed to get. Perhaps we didn’t need an entire night of filming just to get establishing shots and filler shots, but it certainly made it a lot easier having multiple shots to choose from. For the two nights of shooting we certainly didn’t get that much coverage, which meant in the edit we were somewhat stuck using certain shots because we didn’t have other options. This was mainly because of time limitations with actors and batteries on cameras dying and such. I’m so neurotic I would have happily spent two nights shooting establishing shots and filler shots and two nights on each shoot, but not everyone wants to rearrange the rest of their life to fit around such projects. I get a tad obsessive if I’m allowed, which can often benefit me, although I do become a giant pain in everyone else’s ass. The main thing I learnt from the filming process was that you can plan out exactly what you want to do, and how your going to do it, but once you get into the location with the actors this plan often changes – however, you are still much better of having the plan than none at all! As the neurotic freak I am, I had all the shots I wanted to use storyboarded. I had originally planned to shoot all the establishing shots, stick them in a timeline and then also shoot the other shots (with fill in actors) and add them to the timeline to see how it looked. Of course no one else was interested in spending an entire night shooting the film – but with them as stands in – just so I could complete my psychotic endeavour of... How long did the filming last?

Article: It's common for parents to feel emotional when the moment comes for their child to leave home and go to university. Even parents who don't speak about the event are likely to feel a sense of sadness because it's the end of an era where you and your family were at the centre of your child's world. As a parent you'll probably continue to support your child in different ways, but the main job of raising your child is over. It's a huge change for everyone involved. There are a few things that you can do to make the transition easier. Plan carefully for your child's departure and think about how you can help. Many parents take their child to university for the first time. If you decide to do that, be ready to feel a real wrench when the time comes to say goodbye. Your child will probably be as nervous as you are about the moment when you finally say goodbye - but that might not show! Be positive and cheerful about the choice your child has made to continue studying, and plan to leave once you've unpacked the car and looked around your child's new living accommodations. If you can, save your tears for the car - you'll make things easier on your child and yourself. The more you've invested in being a parent, the more you'll feel a sense of loss, so the sadness you feel now is a sign that you've been a good mom or dad. Remind yourself that parenting is all about raising an independent and confident child who functions well without you. If your child quickly settles and starts enjoying himself, you should congratulate yourself. It's also only fair to allow yourself some time to grieve . Don't expect to pick yourself up and move on straight away. But you may decide to find a hobby or sport to fill your extra time.

Her father turns to a family friend, Eliot Draisen, who is president of the detective agency Crumb & Crumb, to investigate the case. Eliot is reluctant to supply P.J. with one of his capable detectives because, as it turns out, Eliot himself is the organizer of the kidnapping. To give the appearance of taking the investigation seriously, Eliot offers P.J. the services of Harry Crumb, the last descendant of the agency's founders. Eliot knows that Harry is incompetent and counts on this fact to get away with the crime. Harry returns to Los Angeles (by bus) from an assignment in the firm's Tulsa, Oklahoma branch office (which he messed up, as usual). He is assisted in his investigation by P.J.'s younger daughter, Nikki, who is considerably smarter than he is. Harry deduces that Nikki's stepmother, Helen Downing, is having an affair with tennis coach Vince Barnes, and concludes she is behind the kidnapping. Helen is desired by Eliot, but all she is interested in is money. She tries to get rid of her husband on several occasions and does her best – along with Barnes – to get the ransom for herself.

They'd always react the same way. There'd be a riot every time.\\" At the two concerts he performed in September at the Mississippi–Alabama Fair and Dairy Show, 50 National Guardsmen were added to the police security to ensure that the crowd would not cause a ruckus. Elvis, Presley's second album, was released in October and quickly rose to number one on the billboard. The album includes \\"Old Shep\\", which he sang at the talent show in 1945, and which now marked the first time he played piano on an RCA session. According to Guralnick, one can hear \\"in the halting chords and the somewhat stumbling rhythm both the unmistakable emotion and the equally unmistakable valuing of emotion over technique.\\" Assessing the musical and cultural impact of Presley's recordings from \\"That's All Right\\" through Elvis, rock critic Dave Marsh wrote that \\"these records, more than any others, contain the seeds of what rock & roll was, has been and most likely what it may foreseeably become.\\"Presley returned to the Sullivan show at its main studio in New York, hosted this time by its namesake, on October 28.

Context: The geographical regions in which Iranian languages were spoken were pushed back in several areas by newly neighbouring languages. Arabic spread into some parts of Western Iran (Khuzestan), and Turkic languages spread through much of Central Asia, displacing various Iranian languages such as Sogdian and Bactrian in parts of what is today Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan. In Eastern Europe, mostly comprising the territory of modern-day Ukraine, southern European Russia, and parts of the Balkans, the core region of the native Scythians, Sarmatians, and Alans had been decisively been taken over as a result of absorption and assimilation (e.g. Slavicisation) by the various Proto-Slavic population of the region, by the 6th century AD. This resulted in the displacement and extinction of the once predominant Scythian languages of the region. Sogdian's close relative Yaghnobi barely survives in a small area of the Zarafshan valley east of Samarkand, and Saka as Ossetic in the Caucasus, which is the sole remnant of the once predominant Scythian languages in Eastern Europe proper and large parts of the North Caucasus. Various small Iranian languages in the Pamirs survive that are derived from Eastern Iranian.

The Stooges are artists (Moe is a sculptor, Larry is a music composer, and Curly is a painter) living in Paris. When the landlord comes after the overdue rent, the boys skip out and wind up accidentally joining the French Foreign Legion that they confuse with the American Legion. Posted to the desert, their assignment is to guard Captain Gorgonzola from the natives. When the captain is kidnapped, the boys are given a chance to bring him back alive. The Stooges make their way to the town where the captain was taken, all disguised as Santa Claus (complete with a sleigh and a reindeer). Despite the disguise not working, they are able to quickly knock out a guard who confronted them and make their way further into town. Ultimately, they find their captain held by a sheik trying to offer him expensive jewelry and a harem of beautiful women in exchange for the Legion's ammunition. The trio are forced to disguise themselves again as part of the harem and use an opportunity during a dance to render the sheik and his head bodyguard unconscious. The four then escape, but end up coming across a lion's den. Before the lion could eat them, Curly is able to placate it into drawing them on a wagon back to their camp.

Choose the most suitable option to answer the above question. Options： A. celebration B. deflation C. recession D. spend more E. problems","completion":"The ECB (European Central Bank) was focused on fighting inflation without concern for other issues. This obviously caused problems, therefore the most suitable option to answer the question is E. problems. Central banks, including the ECB, are primarily concerned with managing inflation rates and targeting price stability in the economy. As a result, the ECB often focuses on controlling inflation by utilizing various monetary policy tools such as adjusting interest rates and altering money supply. However, when a central bank concentrates solely on fighting inflation without adequately addressing other pertinent issues, it may inadvertently create a ripple effect that leads to a myriad of problems. Firstly, by focusing on curbing inflation without considering the broader economic context, the ECB may unintentionally contribute to unemployment. When a central bank raises interest rates to combat inflation, borrowing costs increase for both businesses and consumers. This can lead to a slowdown in business investment and discourage consumer spending, ultimately dampening economic growth and increasing unemployment rates. Secondly, the ECB's single-minded approach to fighting inflation may hinder its ability to address other macroeconomic challenges such as economic imbalances and financial stability. For instance, while the central bank's priority is to maintain price stability, it may overlook indicators like asset-price bubbles or a buildup of debt in the financial system that could ultimately result in financial crises. Thirdly, prioritizing inflation control without due consideration for other economic factors may lead to social consequences and political instability. As inflation-targeting policies are frequently associated with austerity measures, they may exacerbate social unrest and fuel dissatisfaction with governments that subscribe to such measures. Lastly, an overemphasis on combating inflation could cause the ECB to miss opportunities to foster economic growth and enhance productivity in the Eurozone. By focusing solely on price stability, the central bank might overlook the potential benefits of supporting growth-enhancing investments in areas such as infrastructure, education, and innovation. In conclusion, while keeping inflation under control is a critical objective for any central bank, including the ECB, it is equally important to acknowledge and address the myriad of interconnected factors affecting the economy. Focusing solely on inflation without concern for other issues could inadvertently lead to problems such as unemployment, financial instability, social unrest, and lost opportunities for economic growth. Therefore, a balanced and multifaceted approach is essential for ensuring overall economic stability and sustainable development."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Specifically, it's referring to a philosophical and scientific principle or rule. Occam's Razor, also known as the law of parsimony, is a problem-solving principle attributed to William of Ockham, an English Franciscan friar, philosopher, and theologian, who was born around 1287 and died in 1347. The principle is named after him because he was commonly associated with it, although it existed before him. The term \\"razor\\" in Occam’s Razor refers to the act of shaving away unnecessary assumptions or competing hypotheses. It's a methodological tool that guides scientists and researchers in developing theoretical models or hypotheses from observed data. The philosophical principle states that the explanation of any phenomenon should make as few assumptions as possible, eliminating those that make no difference in the observable predictions of the explanatory hypothesis or theory. In simpler terms, the simplest explanation that fits the data is usually the correct one, or from several acceptable explanations for a phenomenon, the simplest is preferable. This principle is applied across many disciplines, including in science, religion, and philosophy. It underlies the scientific method and is frequently used in a wide range of disciplines, from physics and biology to philosophy and religion. However, it's important to note that Occam’s Razor is not considered an irrefutable principle of logic or a scientific result; it is rather a heuristic guide that suggests a strategy for formulating pragmatic and parsimonious theories. As per Ockham's Razor, when presented with competing hypotheses to solve a problem, one should select the solution with the fewest assumptions, and this is not necessarily always the right answer, but it does make for the best starting point. The principle is fundamentally used to sift through data and information to separate fact from assumption. In conclusion, when the question asks \\"What is Occam's Razor?\\" it is seeking a description or explanation of a particular scientific and philosophical principle, its implications, and its applications."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

The store employee mentioned that there might be another one in a different section, but before Bethany could go looking for it, she received a text message from her best friend, Sophie. Sophie needed Bethany's help immediately as she was having an emotional breakdown. Not knowing what to do, Bethany put the dress on hold and rushed out of the department store, heading straight to Sophie's house. Upon arriving at her best friend's place, Bethany found Sophie in tears, sitting on the front porch with her head in her hands. As Bethany embraced Sophie, she tried to gather what had caused her to become so distraught. After a few moments, Sophie calmed down enough to explain that she'd just been fired from her job, which she loved dearly, without having any idea why she was let go. Bethany's heart went out to her friend, and she attempted to make her feel better by suggesting that they go out and have a girls' night, to try and take Sophie's mind off what had just occurred. They would grab dinner at their favorite sushi place, watch a movie, and spend the night like they used to when they were teenagers. Sophie agreed, but not without some hesitation, as she admitted that she was feeling pretty down and wasn't particularly in the mood. Nonetheless, they went on with their plans, laughing and reminiscing about old times over dinner. The food was delicious, and it was just what they needed to lift Sophie's spirits. After dinner, they went to the movies and saw a romantic comedy, which made them laugh until they cried. After the movie, they decided to go for a walk in the nearby park before calling it a night. The evening stars above them were shining brightly, and the light breeze carried the sweet scent of blooming flowers. That's when Bethany remembered about the dress she had left on hold at the department store and shared her story with Sophie. They found it amusing that something as simple as a shopping trip could lead to such a chaotic and emotionally charged day. Bethany worried that the blouse she originally wanted might be gone by the time she returned to the store, but Sophie reassured her that things would work out, reminding her about the importance of being there for the people we love. As they approached Sophie's house, they decided to make a pact that they would be there for each other, no matter what the situation was. The evening may have started with Sophie's breakdown, but it ended with a renewed bond between the two best friends. They hugged each other tightly before bidding each other goodnight and promised to call one another the following day. The next day, Bethany received a call from Sophie, who sounded much more positive after having slept on her situation and taken some time to reflect on her options. She mentioned that she had submitted her resume to several job openings and was hopeful something new and exciting would come her way soon. Bethany, feeling upbeat and hopeful about her friend's future, ventured back to the department store to purchase the dress she had on hold. To her surprise, she found the blouse she had wanted the previous day, now available in her size. With a smile on her face, she collected her items and headed home, grateful for the importance of friendship and the support it offered. And so, life continued for Bethany and Sophie, who had learned a valuable lesson that day. No matter how dark or difficult life may sometimes seem, true friendships have a way of bringing light and hope.

Another student told me about great websites about learning History and English. The Buddy Club is also a good place to just forget about school altogether! One of the older students taught us origami . We made paper planes, birds and hats together. The table tennis tournament was a great idea. I didn't do very well, but I learnt a lot from watching the doubles tournament won by a fourteen-year-old girl and a seventeen-year-old boy. Last year, we had the annual Buddy Club Picnic. Everyone enjoyed the games we played. After I learnt how to fish, I caught two fish in the lake. I think it might be a good idea to change the Buddy Club Picnic to a weekend camping trip. We could learn how to put up tents and how to find our way through a forest. Many of the older students know how to do this already, and I think they would like to teach the younger students. I want to say again how much I enjoy the club. When I'm older, I will make friends with younger students. Then, I can tell them all about school life and growing up.

Yet they have changed a lot since 1804, when the first train moved at 8 km/hr. Today's high speed trains can go 300 km/hr or faster. Besides their speed, they have many advantages over other transportation types. Japan built the world's first high speed railway. In 1964, Japan's \\"Shinkansen\\" trains started traveling between Osaka and Tokyo at 200 km/hr. Over time, more lines, as well as faster trains, were built. Korea, England, and the USA, now have their own high speed systems. Taiwan Province's started running in 2007. Its trains are based on two types of Shinkansen trains. They can carry 989 people and travel from Taipei to Kaohsiung in less than two hours. These systems are expensive to build, but they have many advantages. For example, they are good for the environment. Trains on the London to Paris line create 1/10 the pollution that planes create. High speed trains are also safer and cleaner than cars. Super fast trains can even help a country's economy . They make it easier to travel to faraway places. That helps businesses and land values in those areas. It's no wonder so many countries are building their own high speed railways.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Write an article that answers the following question: How many field goals of under 30 yards were made?","completion":"Title: A Closer Look at Field Goals Under 30 Yards in Football History Introduction Field goals are an essential part of American football, offering teams an opportunity to score points when they are unable to reach the endzone for a touchdown. In professional football, field goal attempts can range from as little as 18 yards to as long as 64 yards. However, the true test of accuracy for kickers arguably comes from field goals under 30 yards, where the margin for error is slim. In this article, we will take a closer look at how many field goals of under 30 yards were made in professional football history, focusing on the National Football League (NFL) and its impressive record of successful short-field goals. Historical Overview Since the NFL's inception in 1920, the game has evolved significantly. The changes include the introduction of hash marks and narrowing the goalposts over time. The progression of football tactics and strategies have also led to the development of specialized kicking positions like the field goal kicker and punter. While it's difficult to pinpoint the exact number of field goals made under 30 yards throughout the NFL's history, we can gain a better understanding of this phenomenon by examining relevant records and statistics related to short-yardage field goal attempts. Notable Records and Statistics Records of successful field goals under 30 yards can be challenging to come by for the early years of the NFL, as detailed statistics were not meticulously documented until the 1960s. However, using available data, we can make an informed estimate of the number of successful short-yardage field goals since then. Below are some notable records and statistics related to field goals under 30 yards in the NFL. 1. Super Bowls: In the 55 Super Bowls played as of the 2020 season, 69 field goals under 30 yards have been successfully kicked. 2. Season Totals: Over the past few decades, the number of successful short-yardage field goals per season varied. From the early 1990s to the mid-2000s, NFL teams made around 200 to 250 field goals under 30 yards per season. In more recent years, this number has declined to around 150 to 200 short field goals per season, likely due to aggressive offensive playcalling and increased accuracy on longer attempts. 3. Accuracy: Current NFL kickers have consistently demonstrated a high level of accuracy when attempting field goals under 30 yards. According to Pro-Football-Reference.com, the average success rate for field goal attempts under 30 yards is over 96% for the 2020 season, reflecting the impressive skill and precision of today's kickers. 4. Career Leaders: Morten Andersen, the all-time leading scorer in NFL history, made 227 field goals under 30 yards during his career, while the legendary kicker Gary Anderson successfully kicked 223 short field goals. Conclusion While it's challenging to determine the exact number of field goals under 30 yards made throughout the NFL's history, studying notable records and recent statistics suggests that thousands of successful short-yardage field goals have been made. Currently, NFL kickers exhibit incredible accuracy when attempting field goals under 30 yards, making it a reliable scoring option for teams able to move the ball within the vicinity of the opponent's endzone. Although these close-range kicks may appear less challenging compared to longer field goal attempts, a high level of precision and technique is necessary for success. The countless short-yardage field goals made in NFL history reflect the skill and tenacity of the athletes who take to the field, shaping the game of football that fans around the world enjoy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Paragraph- Sent 1: Women and minorities appear to be benefiting from greater employment opportunities in the United States, but discrimination remains a significant problem, according to a study to be released today by two professors at the Rutgers School of Law in Newark. Sent 2: The study, which extrapolated from federal data on about 200,000 large and midsize employers, concludes that about two million workers were affected by intentional discrimination in 1999. Sent 3: Roughly a third of the employers studied appeared to have discriminated against women or minorities in at least one job category, the authors said The study was based on information collected from employers by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission from 1990 through 1999 on so-called EEO-1 forms. Sent 4: The husband-and-wife team of Alfred W. and Ruth G. Blumrosen then looked at how many women or minority workers a company employed in different job categories compared with how many were employed at other companies in the same industry in the same geographic area. Sent 5: They described a company as an intentional discriminator if its employment of women or minorities was at least two standard deviations from the average. Sent 6: Legally, companies are presumed to discriminate if their employment numbers are far below the norm. Sent 7: About 22,000 employers were identified as \\"hard core\\" discriminators. Sent 8: These companies employed below-average numbers of women and minorities for 10 years and their hiring of women or minorities was so far below the averages that there was only one chance in a hundred that the discrimination occurred randomly. Sent 9: The study also found rising employment for women and minorities, suggesting significant progress in the workplace. Sent 10: The names of the companies are confidential and were not known to the researchers. Sent 11: The professors expect to make their study available through a Web site, www.eeo1.com. Sent 12: The Blumrosens, who were instrumental in setting up the E.E.O.C. in 1965, also say the government should make more active use of their data. Sent 13: The commission said it did not comment on draft reports. Question: In what way can one determine what companies are being discriminatory?.","completion":"One can determine if companies are being discriminatory by comparing how many women or minority workers a company employed in different job categories with how many were employed at other companies in the same industry in the same geographic area.

It was suggested in court that the couple could possibly stagger their sentences in order to care for their four young daughters. Joe Giudice must pay 414,000 in restitution. U.S. District Court Judge Esther Salas slammed them for not disclosing all their assets in a presentencing report. She said they didn't include all the recreational vehicles they own. But the judge gave Joe Guidice credit for helping people rebuild after Superstorm Sandy and other storms. He made a brief statement in which he apologized and said he had disgraced many people. The Giudices admitted that they hid assets from bankruptcy creditors and submitted phony loan applications to get some 5 million in mortgages and construction loans. Both Giudices pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud and three types of bankruptcy fraud. Joe Giudice, 43, also pleaded guilty to failing to file a tax return for 2004, and acknowledged he didn't file taxes on income of approximately 1 million between 2004 and 2008.

Do those questions have the same meaning? Options: (i). no. (ii). yes.","completion":"'Fragrant' and 'mollified' are two distinct words with different meanings and usage. Here are examples of how they can be used in sentences and an explanation of their meanings: 1. Fragrant: The term 'fragrant' is an adjective used to describe something that has a pleasant or sweet smell. It typically describes flowers, perfumes, or other substances that emit a delightful aroma. Example sentence: \\"The fragrant scent of jasmine flowers filled the garden, creating a soothing and enchanting atmosphere.\\" In this example, 'fragrant' is used to describe the pleasant smell of jasmine flowers. 2. Mollified: This word is a verb meaning to soothe, appease, or calm someone's anger or anxiety. An action or statement can mollify someone if it reduces their feelings of distress, anger, or discontent. Example sentence: \\"When the concerned customer complained about the faulty product, the manager quickly offered a refund which mollified the situation.\\" In this example, 'mollified' is used to describe how the manager's offer of a refund soothed the customer's anxiety or anger regarding the faulty product. As for your question about whether these two sentences have the same meaning, the answer would be: (i). no. Fragrant and mollified are two different words, with 'fragrant' describing a pleasant smell, while 'mollified' refers to the act of calming or reducing someone's anger or anxiety. Consequently, the questions about those words and how they are used in sentences do not have the same meaning. They are simply asking how to use each term properly within the context of a sentence."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Translate \\"PROGRESS depends on them.\\" to Finnish?","completion":"To translate the phrase \\"PROGRESS depends on them.\\" to Finnish, the following steps can be taken: 1. Identify the main noun in the sentence: In this case, the main noun is \\"progress.\\" 2. Identify the verb in the sentence: The verb in this sentence is \\"depends.\\" 3. Determine the object or the subject that the verb acts upon: In this case, \\"them\\" is what \\"progress\\" depends on. 4. It's essential to be aware of the grammatical conventions and distinctive characteristics of the Finnish language. Finnish is an agglutinative language, which means that words in Finnish can carry several meanings through affixes rather than using connecting words like in English. Additionally, Finnish does not use articles, such as \\"the\\" or \\"a.\\" 5. Translate each word or component separately: - \\"Progress\\" in Finnish can be translated as \\"edistyminen.\\" - \\"Depends\\" in Finnish can be translated as \\"riippuu.\\" - \\"On them\\" in Finnish can be translated as \\"heidän\\" ('their') when thinking about possession, but since in this context, it is about relying or depending on something, the translation would be more accurate if we used \\"heistä\\" (meaning 'of them'). 6.

A:","completion":"Before engaging in his role as a nurse, Alex would have undergone multiple steps which would have been both academically and professionally challenging. 1. Education: The first step he would have needed to take would involve completing the necessary educational groundwork. A nurse usually needs to have a high school diploma or the equivalent to qualify for a nursing program. He might have focused on science and health-related classes in high school, such as chemistry, biology, and psychology. 2. Nursing Degree: Subsequent to that, Alex would have attended a post-secondary institution to complete his nursing degree. This could either be an associate degree in nursing, a bachelor's degree in nursing, or a diploma from a hospital-based school of nursing. This would have involved courses on anatomy, nutrition, adult care, pediatric care, and community health, amongst various others. 3. Clinical Experience: Along with classroom education, Alex most likely participated in supervised clinical experience. This could be in hospitals, outpatient clinics, or public health departments. These experiences help provide practical, hands-on experience and a chance to apply what was learned in the classroom. 4. Licensing: After completing his degree, Alex would have to pass a national licensing exam called the NCLEX-RN (National Council Licensure Examination for Registered Nurses). The NCLEX is a comprehensive exam that tests knowledge and skills needed to competently care for patients. 5. Specialization: If Alex wanted to focus on a particular area of nursing, he would also need to gain certification in the chosen specialty. This generally involves additional education and passing another exam. 6. Professional Experience: Before getting his first job as a nurse, Alex may have acquired some professional experience or an internship in a healthcare environment. This would be important for building a strong base of hands-on knowledge, developing more advanced nursing skills, and understanding the practical realities and challenges of the healthcare field. 7. Job Application: Once Alex got the required qualifications and experience, he would have moved on to apply for jobs. This would involve creating a professional resume, searching for job opportunities, sending applications to potential employers, and attending interviews. 8. Professional Development: Even after entering the nursing profession, Alex would need to continuously update his knowledge and skills. Participating in ongoing professional development, attending workshops and conferences, and reading professional nursing literature are some ways to stay updated in the field. In conclusion, Alex would have had to go through a significant process of education, hands-on training, examination, certification, real-life experience, and professional development before he could finally take up his job as a nurse and start caring for patients."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. If maybe it'll work, can we conclude that \\"It won't work.\\"?","completion":"If there is a possibility that \\"maybe it'll work,\\" then it cannot be concluded definitively that \\"it won't work.\\" The phrase \\"maybe it'll work\\" implies that there is a degree of uncertainty and that there is a chance, however big or small, that the thing in question could work. This uncertainty leaves room for different possible outcomes, which means that it might work, it might not work, or it might partially work, depending on various factors. To conclude that \\"it won't work,\\" we would need to have clear evidence or reasoning that there is no possibility of success, or that failure is inevitable. When absolute certainty is not present, drawing conclusions becomes more challenging and can only be addressed through probability and risk analysis. Considering different possible outcomes and factors that influence the success or failure of a particular task or situation helps to generate a more informed perspective. For instance, it is important to assess: 1. Past experiences and historical results: If similar attempts have been made before, their outcomes can serve as a guide to estimate the probability of success or failure in the current scenario. 2. Available resources and constraints: The quality and quantity of resources significantly influence the probability of a successful outcome. This includes factors such as available time, funding, and skilled personnel. 3. External factors: Factors that are not under direct control, but that can influence the situation either positively or negatively, must also be taken into consideration. These may include market conditions, technological developments, competition, or political changes. 4. Risk management strategies: Having a plan in place to address possible challenges that arise during the implementation of a project can help mitigate risks and increase the likelihood of success. By evaluating factors such as these and others, it becomes possible to estimate the probability that \\"it will work\\" or \\"it won't work\\" and make a more informed decision. It is essential to recognize, however, that even with thorough analysis, there will always be a degree of uncertainty, and no outcome is ever entirely guaranteed. Therefore, while it may be tempting to jump to conclusions, it is crucial to weigh the available evidence and carefully consider the likelihood of each possible outcome before making a definitive statement. In summary, if there is a possibility that \\"maybe it'll work,\\" then we cannot conclude that \\"it won't work\\" without further evaluation and understanding of the circumstances at play."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A contest to turn 'nuisance' grey squirrels into burgers had a cold reception from animal activists - who accused it of being a smear campaign against the so-called 'chicken of the trees'. The cook-off in the Forest of Dean, where the animals are accused of damaging trees, attracted wide publicity in its search for the tastiest squirrel snack. Volunteers cooked up quarter-pounders using three minced carcasses each, and one triumphed with a 'cajun melt' surprise - complete with a mozzarella and chutney topping. But they were criticised by vegetarian groups who said grey squirrels were being unfairly maligned, while the RSPCA issued a warning over how the animals were caught. Tasty: It took at least three grey squirrels to make each quarter-pounder at a contest yesterday in the Forest of Dean, prompting complaints by animal rights activists who said it unfairly maligned the little-loved species. Popular: The contest was hosted as part of the Forest Showcase Food and Drink Festival (pictured) The contest was held at the Forest Showcase Food and Drink Festival yesterday near Coleford, Gloucestershire, in a bid to get the animal on British menus. Dozens of would-be chefs submitted a recipe to the Extraordinary Squirrel Burger Challenge, and four finalists served up their version of the dish. Each contestant was handed three 'locally-sourced' squirrel carcasses and added their own flavours to make a quarter pounder. Introduced to Britain in the 19th century, there are now around 100,000 grey squirrels in the Forest of Dean - a population the Forestry Commission claims is 'huge' and 'extremely destructive'. Although the agency does not cull the animals, a spokesman said: 'Grey squirrels do cause considerable damage to the trees through extensive bark stripping.' Trio of carcasses: At least 12 squirrels were killed, skinned and gutted for the family event (file photo) Hotly-tipped: A poster for the event yesterday promised prizes including a £55 cookery school voucher. Rachel Thomas, one of the event's organisers, said: 'It is here in the Forest and we should be using it - they are a nuisance at the end of the day.' But the Bristol-based charity Vegetarians’ International Voice for Animals said the ‘victimisation of grey squirrels’ was ‘totally misguided’. Juicy: This image was one of those used to advertise the squirrel burger cooking contest last week. Spokesman Justin Kerswell added: 'This smear campaign against the grey squirrel reeks of both cruelty and irony. Red squirrels themselves have previously been tarred as pests and killed in huge numbers. 'Favouring and massacring different species of wildlife continues to be a brutal fashion which cannot carry on.' And People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals attacked the 'desperate-for-attention festival organisers' who were 'swimming against the tide'. 'Our shops are brimming with healthy and delicious grains, pasta, beans, rice, nuts, fruits, almond milks and soya puddings,' a spokesman added. 'More and more Brits are realising that these are not only far kinder choices but also far more nourishing than the dead bodies of squirrels, ponies or any other animal for that matter.' The RSPCA also raised concerns over how the animals were found. A spokesman said: 'We would hope that these particular squirrels had been killed humanely. 'We would also be concerned about ordinary members of the public possibly trying to capture and/or kill grey squirrels and would not advocate this.' Festival organisers defended the event, insisting it was fair to eat animals that roam in the woods. The Forestry Commission said the grey squirrel population in the area is 'huge' and 'destructive' (file photo) Ready for lunch? Nicknamed the 'chicken of the trees', squirrel also tastes a little like rabbit (file photo) Ms Thomas said: 'It is no different to going out and having rabbit. It is also kind of an educational thing. It shows that it is a good food source here in the Forest. By Pascal Aussignac, of the Michelin-starred Club Gascon in the City of London. 'I think people seeing it [at the competition] were fascinated and curious. We had a lot of positive reaction. We haven't come across any [negative comments] as it happens.' Nicknamed the 'chicken of the trees', squirrel meat is gamey and mostly tastes like a cross between chicken and rabbit. The first prize in yesterday's contest was won by Holly Hayes, who won a £55 cookery school voucher for her 'cajun melt' burger seasoned with jerk spices and topped with melted mozzarella and chutney. The runner-up was Sophie Drinkwater who called her creation 'chicken of the tree surprise' - a garlic and herb burger with melted Gloucester cheese in the centre. The Forest of Dean is already at the centre of animal rights campaigns because it is the focus of Britain's largest wild boar cull. The cull - which is taking place all winter and could claim as many as 500 animals, say activists - is set to be sabotaged by up to 30 locals who will inform each other whenever government-approved marksmen appear. The ancient forest is also the focus of the government's highly controversial badger cull, which campaigners have accused of doing more harm than good. Lawrence Jefferies, a catering lecturer at Gloucestershire College and one of the judges, said the grey squirrel was 'obviously a nuisance within the Forest of Dean and it does a lot of damage and there’s nothing wrong with eating it.' He added: 'It is a creature with a fluffy tail and some people would take offence at its use for food but to my mind it’s just the same as a wild rabbit, which is perfectly acceptable. 'They are a pest, they are in abundance and there is a food source to be had there. And I think it might make a nice cheeseburger.' What are highlight points for this article?","completion":"1.

The original sentence \\"A young boy is jumping off of a pile of dirt\\" clearly states that a young boy is engaging in an action that involves leaping off a mound of earth. In no part of the statement does it specify that the boy enters water subsequently. However, it is important to acknowledge that it is not impossible for the boy to land in water after jumping off the dirt pile. The given information simply does not provide enough context to determine whether or not the second sentence is accurate. The circumstances, location, and environment in which this situation is happening could be significant in identifying the veracity of the statement. For example, if we knew that the dirt pile was near a lake or pool, then the likelihood of the second sentence being true would increase. Moreover, it's essential to consider the potential logical link between the two statements, if any. The first sentence mentions a young boy and an action he is undertaking. The second sentence also implicates a boy in an action, so the subject appears related, and it might be about the same boy. Despite this apparent relation of the subject, the action and its context within each statement do not evidently overlap. In conclusion, based solely on the information provided in the original sentence, \\"A young boy is jumping off of a pile of dirt,\\" we cannot confirm or refute the truth of the second sentence, \\"boy is jumping in water.\\" As the original statement does not explicitly mention or imply that the boy is landing in water, and since we lack any additional context or information about the scenario, we are unable to accurately determine the veracity of the second sentence."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Review: Put a DVD of this flick in a time capsule, and it will definitely illustrate for future generations a perfect example of one which warrants the minimal rating on a 1-to-10-star scale. Bill Cosby and Ray Romano have been at the top - in ratings and with tens of millions in earnings annually - with their television series'. Yet each has had no success in big-screen offerings. This has also been true for other TV personalities - perhaps because many of the stories which are presented for two hours or so seem more suited to either a 10-minute skit, or at most, the 22 or 23 minutes of drama during a half-hour program. This film, however, doesn't have one single element which would warrant two or three minutes of time on MAD TV, SNL, or anywhere else on a screen or stage. Its origination date is listed as 2002, but release date - to DVD only - is shown as 2004. It also was filmed not long before Rodney Dangerfield's death, so its one redeeming value is that it probably provided at lease a few hundred thousand more dollars for his heirs. I'd never heard of it, but found it when turning-on my set, and frankly became fascinated by it. Some movies are so truly awful that they rate a sort of top rating in reverse - so bad that you can move the dial backwards to a 9 or 10. \\"Plan 9 from Outer Space\\" is the best example - and the Bruce Jenner/Village People opus, \\"Can't Stop the Music,\\" is another. Unfortunately this flick falls short even there. Even if Rodney's earlier work (as well as some of his fellow cast-members') fell short of \\"Citizen Kane\\" or \\"Casablanca,\\" there were many moments of humor and a story providing at least a modicum of interest. Unfortunately, this presentation doesn't seem to possess even a minute or two's worth of such material. Now, what is this review like? *negative *positive","completion":"This review is negative.

Nuh-uh, no way. Jackie Chan's not supposed to be wining and dining his lady friend and talking about marriage. He's supposed to be kicking butt! Like it or not, Chan is getting older (he'll be 56 in April) and perhaps those new wrinkles have him considering his career options for when he can no longer throw a punch. So he's taken a cue from fellow action heroes like Vin Diesel (think: \\"The Pacifier\\") and signed on for a family film -- the lackluster, so-corny-it's-painful \\"The Spy Next Door.\\" What's more difficult: busting Russian villains or endearing your girlfriend's three rambunctious kids to you? For retired spy Bob Ho, it's clearly the latter. When Gillian (Amber Valetta) goes out of town, Bob volunteers to play Mr. Mom. He can save the world from the Russians, who are scheming to take over the oil industry in a ridiculous subplot involving a thousand silly stereotypes, but he can't make oatmeal. \\"The Spy Next Door\\" is so hokey that I couldn't help but wonder if I was watching a campy sendup. It opens with \\"Secret Agent Man,\\" for god's sake! Everyone, from Chan to supporting spy Billy Ray Cyrus to the big, bad Russians, seems to be reading their terrible lines from somewhere just off camera. The dialogue, particularly Cyrus' cringeworthy Kentucky-fried idioms, is stilted, colorless and boring, even by kids' movie standards. Every Hallmark-wholesome \\"lesson\\" crammed into the movie, particularly those about the idea of family, just makes you squirm. Although Chan is no stranger to comedy, it's clear that he's grasping at straws with this pallid cornball. He's the only one, besides Will Shadley as Gillian's dorky son, Ian, who really, visibly tries to make \\"The Spy Next Door\\" less of a disaster. But pitting a big, strong man against wily, sugar-fueled children is a plot line that's been done to death, and \\"The Spy\\" does nothing to revitalize it. ||||| Originally published Thursday, January 14, 2010 at 3:01 PM Comments (0) E-mail article Print view Share In \\"The Spy Next Door,\\" Jackie Chan's physical grace and legendary stunt work aren't quite what they used to be, but he's still far more nimble than this crummy, family-movie vehicle in which he plays a spy baby-sitting his girlfriend's bratty kids. 'The Spy Next Door,' with Jackie Chan, Billy Ray Cyrus, George Lopez, Amber Valletta, Katherine Boecher, Magnús Scheving, Madeline Carroll, Will Shadley, Alina Foley. Directed by Brian Levant, from a screenplay by Jonathan Bernstein, James Greer and Gregory Poirier. 92 minutes. Rated PG for sequences of action violence and some mild rude humor. Several theaters; see Page 15. I wanted to begin this review of Jackie Chan's new family comedy, \\"The Spy Next Door,\\" by saying something along the lines of, \\"I liked this movie better the first time, when it was called 'The Pacifier.' \\" The latter, a sporadically lively comedy from a few years back starring Vin Diesel as a commando-type who becomes nanny to three brats, bears a striking resemblance to Chan's new movie, in which he plays a superspy baby-sitting his girlfriend's three obnoxious kids (Madeline Carroll, Will Shadley, Alina Foley). But something gets lost in the parallel because, well, \\"The Spy Next Door\\" makes \\"The Pacifier\\" look like \\"Citizen Kane.\\" A dreary, ill-advised production that frequently looks cheap and features a largely unappealing cast (Billy Ray Cyrus as an intelligence officer — somebody shoot me), \\"Spy\\" taxes one's patience from its opening scenes. Chan plays Bob, a Chinese secret agent on loan to U.S. intelligence and hiding in plain sight as a Clark Kent-ish pen salesman. Ready to retire from his secret life, Bob has been dating an attractive next-door neighbor, Gillian (Amber Valletta), a single mom raising a trio of monsters. Bob wants to tell Gillian the truth about himself and marry her, but the time is never right for his confession. Meanwhile, the children appear to have unlimited freedom to treat Bob like dirt for the crime of being boring, an attitude he hopes will change when Gillian leaves town for a few days, putting him in charge. Predictably, the kids run circles around Bob, though equally predictably, he slowly gets under their skin with his attentiveness and kindness. The exact same thing happens in \\"The Pacifier,\\" but it was more fun to watch. The militantly firm yet sympathetic hand supplied by Diesel's character was the right prescription his young wards needed to feel safe and be better-behaved. In \\"Spy,\\" Bob gets dissed and treated badly (locked out of the house with his arms full of bags, that kind of thing) over and over. The kids remain unlikable for most of the movie as a result. Danger looms for Bob's charges when one of them accidentally downloads plans for a high-tech weapon. Director Brian Levant (\\"The Flintstones\\") tries squeezing laughs out of an atmosphere of silliness surrounding the spy game, especially the crazy, Boris-and-Natasha-like antics of a pair of Russians (Katherine Boecher and Magnús Scheving). Comedian George Lopez, playing Bob's CIA boss, makes an interesting impression on screen, with that craggy, lived-in face of his. But none of those extras diminish the tediousness of \\"Spy.\\" The film might offer an aging Chan (now using more and more stunt doubles) a few opportunities to shine in his ongoing bout with the physical world. But it still raises the spectacle of an international superstar in another clunky, American movie. Tom Keogh: tomwkeogh@yahoo.com ||||| In a cruelly misguided tease, the opening-credits sequence in the grating Jackie Chan comedy The Spy Next Door show off his credentials in a montage of footage from a decade or two ago, when Chan was at the height of his powers. For a few minutes, audiences are reminded of what a unique talent he once was, an entertainer and martial artist willing to risk life and limb for a crazy stunt or a bit of slapstick. But once the credits are over, the film can’t paper over the reality that Chan is in his mid-50s, and while he’s exceptionally nimble for his age, he simply can’t pull off the kung-fu Buster Keaton shtick any longer. And as his physical skills have diminished, his mugging skills have sadly increased. A cynical hybrid of family-friendly blockbusters past—The Pacifier, Home Alone, and Spy Kids being the most prominent influences—The Spy Next Door stars Chan as a daredevil secret agent who lives in the suburbs and pretends to be a boring pen importer. He wants to take the next step with girlfriend Amber Valletta, but her three bratty kids haven’t warmed to his Clark Kent persona, partly because they’re still holding out for their father to return. When Valletta gets called away for a few days, Chan eagerly volunteers to look after the kids, but one of them accidentally downloads some highly coveted information. Soon enough, the four are fending off comically inept bad guys, Macaulay Culkin-style. The Spy Next Door follows Brian Levant’s long track record of pandering, PG-rated family comedies that look like bad TV (and sometimes are adapted from it): Problem Child 2, Beethoven, Jingle All The Way, both Flintstones movies, a straight-to-DVD live-action Scooby-Doo sequel. Casting Billy Ray Cyrus and George Lopez as the least and second-least likely secret agents imaginable says everything about Levant’s fidelity to demographic charts, but Chan’s anything-goes affability keeps the film from scraping bottom. Limited to a few minor parkour moves and an above-the-belt fighting style that’s more like John Saxon in Enter The Dragon than the Chan of old, he’s still giving 100 percent, even if that’s often way too much. ||||| On the ground or twirling in a stunt harness above it, Jackie Chan brings an air of determined good cheer to even the most metallic of clunkers. “The Spy Next Door” proves this. Chan’s new all-ages vehicle is smooth like oatmeal. It’s hard to imagine anyone being offended, except fans of good comedy. This is “True Lies” without the striptease or the Arab-maiming. On loan to the Central Intelligence Agency from the Chinese government, Bob Ho (Chan) is a superspy who, by day, masquerades as a mild-mannered pen importer. He is courting Gillian (Amber Valletta), a divorced mother of three whose serene under-reaction to her brats’ bratty brattiness is the plot’s biggest mystery. Sullen older daughter (Madeline Carroll) and aggravating, “Octopussy”-referencing son (Will Shadley) vow to get rid of the opposition, even though the younger daughter (Alina Foley) knows mom’s boyfriend is a fine fellow. Why are they so hard on Bob? Because he isn’t cool. Because there’s no story if they don’t. “The Spy Next Door” operates on familial bonding by way of humiliating pranks, which in better circumstances might go by the name of slapstick. Baby-sitting the kids while his sweetie’s away, Bob ends up getting roped into the pursuit of Russian badskis trying to control the world’s oil supply. Soon the kids are ensnared in the espionage and Magnus Scheving, who may be familiar to some of you as “Sportacus” on the TV show “LazyTown,” must retrieve a digital file accidentally downloaded by Gillian’s son. Billy Ray Cyrus plays the CIA’s least likely agent. George Lopez is Bob’s supervisor. The director is Brian Levant, whose drab visuals match the repartee. A little too much of the movie takes place inside Gillian’s suburban house. It’s a big deal when someone drives to an empty warehouse facility in this thing. Chan’s lines include the expected linguistic manglings (“You’re chopping my bust!” instead of “You’re busting my chops!”) and peculiar stress rhythms (“Why did you tell them! That I was your bodyguard!”). Now and then, the star executes a little something special — with a stunt bike or a folding chair, for example — and you think: Chan still has it. Even when the material conspires to take “it” away, he still has it. My son and his friend, both 9, liked the movie a lot, for the record. I chalk this up to Chan himself, whose kinetic athleticism may be less than it was a couple of decades ago, but honestly: isn’t yours? MPAA rating: PG (for sequences of action violence and some mild rude humor) Cast: Jackie Chan (Bob Ho); Billy Ray Cyrus (Colton James); George Lopez (Glaze); Amber Valletta (Gillian); Madeline Carroll (Farren); Will Shadley (Ian); Alina Foley (Nora); Magnus Scheving (Poldark); Katherine Boecher (Creel) Credits: Directed by: Brian Levant; written by Jonathan Bernstein, James Greer and Gregory Poirier; produced by Robert Simonds.

Plot title: Saturn 3 Movie plot: The film opens at a space station in the vicinity of the planet Saturn. An announcer is paging Captain James (Douglas Lambert) as the ship he is piloting is leaving in just a few minutes. We see James enter a locker room where he starts to put on his spacesuit and we see another figure in a spacesuit lurking in the corner wearing a helmet so we can't see his face. James addresses the figure as Benson (Harvey Keitel). Benson has apparently just failed a mental stability exam and James is replacing him on this mission. Before James is finished putting on his suit, however, Benson straps himself down and opens the airlock venting the locker room. James is killed and his body flushed out into space. Benson closes the door and then takes James's place on the mission.Benson flies the ship through the rings of Saturn and lands it on a moon at the Saturn 3 experimental food station. It is a remote and isolated underground facility crewed by just two scientists: the older Adam (played by a 64 year-old Kirk Douglas) and the beautiful young Alex (played by a 33 year-old Farrah Fawcett). Despite their age difference the two are happy as lovers.Adam and Alex escort Benson inside the facility. Despite their warm greeting, Benson seems cold. He tells them they are behind schedule on developing the new food sources that the over-populated Earth desperately needs. He has brought a new robot - HECTOR - that he will assemble and program to help speed the project. Once Hector is operational he will be so effective that one of the scientists will no longer be needed.When Alex and Benson are alone, he makes it clear that he is interested in having sex with her. She tells him she is exclusively with Adam and Benson responds that on Earth it is considered inhospitable to refuse his request. Alex, who was born in space and has never visited Earth, though she is curious about it, points out that they are not on Earth and continues to ignore his advances. He, in turn, tells her that Adam is \\"obsolete.\\"Alex escorts Benson to his... My question: what is intended to replace the moon's scientists?

Here's a complex question that requires someone to reason about the input, can you answer it? the Tacca and the Zenobia are both native to South America?","completion":"The Tacca and the Zenobia are two different types of plants, and it is important to consider their native habitats and characteristics separately to address the question of whether they are both native to South America. Once we have a better understanding of these plants, we can determine their native habitats and assess whether or not they are native to the region in question. First, let's talk about Tacca. Tacca is a genus of plants popularly known as \\"bat flowers\\" or \\"cat's whiskers\\" due to their unique appearance featuring long, whisker-like protrusions and dark, bat-like flowers. The genus Tacca comprises about a dozen species and is native mainly to Southeast Asia, South Asia, Australia, and Africa. For instance, the famous Tacca chantrieri, or the black bat flower, is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including Malaysia, Thailand, and Southern China. From the information available, it does not seem like any species within the Tacca genus is native to South America. Now, let's discuss Zenobia. Zenobia is a small genus of flowering plants in the family Ericaceae, and it currently contains only one recognized species, Zenobia pulverulenta, also called \\"dusty zenobia\\" or \\"honeycup.\\" This plant is an evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States, specifically in the Atlantic coastal plains of North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia. Zenobia pulverulenta can generally be found in acidic, moist habitats, such as pine savannas and pocosins (a type of wetland). Considering the information we have about Zenobia pulverulenta's native distribution, it is clear that it is not native to South America. Instead, its natural habitat is limited to the southeastern United States. In conclusion, neither Tacca nor Zenobia are native to South America. Tacca is mainly native to Southeast Asia, South Asia, Australia, and Africa, while Zenobia is restricted to specific regions in the southeastern United States. Therefore, the claim that both Tacca and Zenobia are native to South America is not accurate based on their known native habitats."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The initial sentence - \\"A boy in a blue and white jacket with a blue hat helps a girl with a red hat and blue and white jacket onto a horse\\" - provides a detailed description of the scenario, specifying the colors and attire of both individuals involved as well as the action they are engaged in. In this scene, the boy is assisting the girl as she climbs onto a horse. The second sentence - \\"A boy is helping a girl get up onto a horse\\" - can be considered an accurate but simplified summary of the original sentence. This sentence highlights the key aspect of the interaction between the boy and the girl, which is the boy offering assistance to the girl as she attempts to get on the horse.

While the second sentence accurately captures the primary action occurring in the scene, the initial sentence paints a more in-depth and vivid picture, providing details on clothing and colors that are representative of the boy and girl involved in this interaction.

Tamar Manasseh formed Mothers Against Senseless Killings and said she is looking for more volunteers. View Full Caption DNAinfo/Andrea V. Watson ENGLEWOOD — When Tamar Manasseh formed Mothers Against Senseless Killings to patrol the neighborhood after a murder in the 7500 block of South Stewart last month, she hoped to stop any retaliatory violence. So far, in the five weeks since a man opened fire on three women on June 23, killing 34-year-old Lucille Barnes, there have been no shootings on the block or on the 7500 block of South Harvard where the patrols have also been set up, according to a DNAinfo Chicago map of shootings in the city. \\"When you have sisters like sister Manasseh and others out here just participating, it makes a big difference,” said Johnny Banks, the executive director of the community organization A Knock at Midnight. Tamar Manasseh, who founded Mothers Against Senseless Killings, sits with other volunteers keeping an eye on the neighborhood since a murder on June 23. The group's organizer said she needs more help. View Full Caption DNAinfo/Andrea V. Watson But Manasseh, who makes the trek daily from her home in Bronzeville to the neighborhood, said her group really needs more people in the area to join the effort, and that recruitment has been difficult. “Recruiting and getting more volunteers has been quite the challenge,” Manasseh said as she sat on her folding chair on 75th Street and Stewart Avenue, watching over the block, not far from where she used to live at 55th Street and Bishop Avenue. Right now there are about 15 adult volunteers who have pledged to be out there every day until Labor Day. That's about the same number the group had when it started a few days after the June shooting. Manasseh said she didn’t think it would be this difficult to bring in more concerned residents. “What we’ve learned since we’ve been out here is that people’s attention spans are short,\\" she said. \\"It’s hard to keep their interests between tragedies.” Andrea Watson says organizers want moms to remain active: The block and surrounding area where the \\"army of mothers,\\" as she refers to it, have set up have been peaceful since the group formed, she said, but the lack of adult volunteers surprised her. “It’s like some people want to put their children in a bubble because they have good kids,” she said. “They want to separate their good kids from all of these bad kids, but your kids are going to grow up in the world alongside those very kids that you tried to shield them from. So wouldn’t it be better if you tried to save them all instead of just yours?” She said she had higher expectations for the adults, but underestimated the teens from the neighborhood. At least two dozen teens have taken an interest in keeping their community safe and have taken part in the patrols, Manasseh said. The ultimate goal is to get people on other blocks to follow her and start their own neighborhood patrols. She said she wants to hold an orientation in the near future to teach them conflict resolution and strategic placement. Community policing in Englewood and on the South Side is important to Manasseh, she said, because she wants to help save her own children from becoming victims of the violence. Chicago Police did not respond to a request for comment. Banks' group, which provides direct services such as workforce development, family advocacy and more to Englewood residents, encourages more adults to volunteer, but he said he understands why some might be hesitant. “It’s not easy,” he said. “Our people are afraid so they don’t participate.\\" He said that's all the more reason the group of moms and others should be praised for their courage and determination. Manasseh said although the neighborhood has changed since she was a child, she is holding on to one day seeing a better, safer community. “It’s like Englewood is the land that time forgot,” she said. “It’s the land that has been forgotten, but I have hope, I see hope here.” In addition to seeking more volunteers, she’s asking for water and any other donations, which can be dropped off daily between 4-8 p.m. at 75th and Stewart.

View Full Caption DNAinfo/Sam Cholke ENGLEWOOD — An army of mothers started patrolling their neighborhood on Monday, gathering on corners after a shooting. Mothers Against Senseless Killings volunteers in pink shirts were sitting in folding chairs and leaning against a mailbox at 75th Street and Harvard Avenue on Monday, hoping to prevent a violent retaliation after the death of Lucille Barnes a week ago. “People are very emotional about it, and we don’t know what’s going to happen,” said Tamar Manasseh. “If people say there will be violence, there likely will be violence, and you go where you’re called.” According to police, a man walked by Barnes and two other women at 11:35 p.m. on June 23 in the 7500 block of Stewart Avenue and opened fire, fatally wounding 34-year-old Barnes. Sam Cholke discusses the mothers' efforts to be more visible: Manasseh mobilized the group for the first time after the shooting on the gamble that even the most embittered and determined on vengeance would not shoot under the glare of a motherly eye — let alone 15 sets of maternal eyes. “If you’re trying to shoot someone and we’re out here, you’re not getting off the block,” said Manasseh, who grew up on the northern edge of Englewood at Garfield Boulevard and Bishop Street. The group plans to plant itself on the corner for four hours, beginning at from 4 p.m., and return every day until Labor Day. When the next shooting happens and there’s chatter of retaliation, the “army of mothers” as Manasseh calls them, will move and make sure the neighborhood knows that moms are watching. The group brought grills and hot dogs, but no police. The idea was to show in unmistakable terms that the message to would-be shooters is coming from within the community. “This is about mothers reconnecting with children that haven’t been mothered that much,” Manasseh said. “Take away the guns, and they’re just kids.” Monday was the first day trying the idea, but nearly everyone who passed by was nodding in agreement before Manasseh even finished her pitch. Thelma, who said she lived around the corner and declined to give her last name, said she had two boys she kept locked in the house to protect them from the violence in the neighborhood. “They’ve never even walked to the store by themselves,” she said. She mused with two other mothers about how things had changed since she was a young girl. Parents in her day would never have allowed a gun in the hands of a 16-year-old, she said. Manasseh leaned in seeing that Thelma had found the core of the idea and was a likely convert. “When you let a bunch of 16-year-olds run the world, this is what it looks like,” Manasseh said. The Mothers Against Senseless Killings view is that guns are a symptom of a bigger problem: Parents have given up their authority to their children and now fear them when after seeing what teens will do with that power. “It has to be a change in mindset; it can’t just be taking the guns away,” Manasseh said. “What is the alternative? What does it look like if it gets worse? A bulletproof vest in 2T at Target for your 2-year-old?” To see that mindset in action doesn’t look like much. It turns the volume down dramatically from anti-violence marches and protests. The women chatted and groused about the grills being late and there only being mediums of the T-shirts. But they also transmitted authority, vigilance and presence. “A mother’s love is selfless, annoying and always there,” Manasseh said. “This is what mothers do best, get in the way.” For more neighborhood news, listen to DNAinfo Radio here: ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","completion":"Mothers Against Senseless Killings, a group formed by Tamar Manasseh, has been successfully patrolling their neighborhood in Englewood, Chicago, for five weeks, preventing shootings on the block and nearby areas.

The adult volunteers pledge to be on patrol every day until Labor Day, while at least two dozen local teenagers have taken part in keeping their community safe. Manasseh hopes to inspire other blocks to form their own neighborhood patrols and plans to hold an orientation to teach conflict resolution and strategic placement to interested community members."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

You should try to refrain from popping blood blisters if possible. However, if it gets too painful, you can pop larger blood blisters.","completion":"To pop a larger blood blister safely, follow a step-by-step procedure to minimize the risk of infection and promote healing. First, gather the necessary supplies, such as a sterilized needle, rubbing alcohol, a cotton ball, sterile gauze, and adhesive bandages. Next, clean the area surrounding the blood blister thoroughly using soap and water, then pat it dry using a clean towel. Before proceeding, sterilize the needle by wiping it with the rubbing alcohol-soaked cotton ball, ensuring that any bacteria or germs are eliminated. Carefully and gently puncture the blood blister at its edge, close to where it meets the healthy skin, while avoiding applying excessive pressure to minimize pain and prevent the needle from penetrating too deeply. Puncture the blister in two or three different spots to create small openings for the fluid to drain effectively. As the fluid starts to drain, use a clean cotton pad or sterile gauze to absorb it, taking care not to spread it around the wound. Once all the fluid has drained, you can apply an antiseptic ointment or hydrocolloid dressing to prevent infection and reduce the risk of scarring. Cover the popped blister with a sterile gauze pad, and secure it in place with an adhesive bandage or medical tape. Monitor the area for any signs of infection, such as swelling, redness, increased pain, or pus. If you notice any of these symptoms, seek professional medical advice. Keep the wound clean and dry by changing the dressing regularly, ideally once a day or whenever it becomes wet or dirty. It is crucial to avoid picking at the blister, as this can further increase the risk of infection. Finally, allow your skin enough time to heal by giving it proper care, and you will soon experience relief from the discomfort of a large blood blister."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: Information: - Finland , officially the Republic of Finland, is a sovereign state in Northern Europe. A peninsula with the Gulf of Finland to the south and the Gulf of Bothnia to the west, the country has land borders with Sweden to the northwest, Norway to the north, and Russia to the east. Estonia is south of the country across the Gulf of Finland. Finland is a Nordic country situated in the geographical region of Fennoscandia, which also includes Scandinavia. Finland's population is 5.5 million (2014), staying roughly on the same level over the past two decades. The majority of the population is concentrated in the southern region. In terms of area, it is the eighth largest country in Europe and the most sparsely populated country in the European Union. - Angels Fall First is the debut studio album by Finnish symphonic metal band Nightwish . The original 500 - copies limited edition features seven tracks , two of which are not on the regular edition . This edition is highly sought after by collectors and in 2012 a copy was sold for 1137.23 on eBay . The album was released in the US by Century Media in March 2001 . - Symphonic metal is a subgenre of metal music which combines the characteristics of this genre, such as heavy drums and guitars, with different elements of classical music including symphonic instruments, choirs and on occasion, a full symphony orchestra. Keyboards reminiscent of power metal also often find a dominant place in this subgenre. Symphonic metal bands often feature classically trained female vocalists, giving rise to the nickname opera metal or operatic metal, and it is not uncommon for them to feature a second vocalist performing growls, a more common characteristic of gothic metal. Perhaps the most typical and prominent examples of symphonic metal bands are Finnish band Nightwish, Dutch bands Within Temptation, Delain and Epica, and Swedish band Therion, all four of which place a large focus on elements prevalent in film scores on top of the more basic classical components utilized more widely in the genre. - eBay Inc. (;) is an American multinational corporation and e-commerce company, providing consumer-to-consumer and business-to-consumer sales services via the Internet. It is headquartered in San Jose, California. eBay was founded by Pierre Omidyar in 1995, and became a notable success story of the dot-com bubble. Today it is a multibillion-dollar business with operations localized in over 30 countries. - Delain is a Dutch symphonic metal band formed in 2002 by former Within Temptation keyboardist Martijn Westerholt, and Charlotte Wessels. The name of the band comes from the Kingdom of Delain in Stephen King's novel, \\"The Eyes of the Dragon\\". - Classical music is art music produced or rooted in the traditions of Western music, including both liturgical (religious) and secular music. While a more accurate term is also used to refer to the period from 1750 to 1820 (the Classical period), this article is about the broad span of time from roughly the 11th century to the present day, which includes the Classical period and various other periods. The central norms of this tradition became codified between 1550 and 1900, which is known as the common-practice period. The major time divisions of Western art music are as follows: European art music is largely distinguished from many other non-European and some popular musical forms by its system of staff notation, in use since about the 16th century. Western staff notation is used by composers to indicate to the performer the pitches (e.g., melodies, basslines, chords), tempo, meter and rhythms for a piece of music. This can leave less room for practices such as improvisation and \\"ad libitum\\" ornamentation, which are frequently heard in non-European art music and in popular-music styles such as jazz and blues. Another difference is that whereas most popular styles adopt the song (strophic) form, classical music has been noted for its development of highly sophisticated forms of instrumental music such as the concerto, symphony, sonata, and mixed vocal and instrumental styles such as opera which, since they are written down, can sustain larger forms and attain a high level of complexity. - Erno \\"Emppu\\" Matti Juhani Vuorinen (born 24 June 1978) is a Finnish guitarist, most famous for being a founding member and occasional songwriter of the symphonic metal band Nightwish. He is the oldest of five children, having a twin brother and three younger sisters. He started to play guitar as a private study at the age of 12 and since then has played in various bands including Nightwish, Brother Firetribe, Barilari, Almah, and Altaria. - Jukka Antero \\"Julius\\" Nevalainen (born 21 April 1978, Kitee, Finland) is the drummer in the Finnish symphonic metal band Nightwish and the Finnish progressive metal band Sethian. - The dot-com bubble (also known as the dot-com boom, the tech bubble, the Internet bubble, the dot-com collapse, and the information technology bubble) was a historic speculative bubble covering roughly 19952001 during which stock markets in industrialized nations saw their equity value rise rapidly from growth in the Internet sector and related fields. While the latter part was a boom and bust cycle, the Internet boom is sometimes meant to refer to the steady commercial growth of the Internet with the advent of the World Wide Web, as exemplified by the first release of the Mosaic web browser in 1993, and continuing through the 1990s. - Tarja Soile Susanna Turunen-Cabuli (born August 17, 1977), known professionally as Tarja Turunen or simply Tarja, is a Finnish singer-songwriter. She is a soprano and has a vocal range of three octaves. - Pierre Morad Omidyar (born June 21, 1967) is a French-born Iranian-American entrepreneur and philanthropist. He is the founder of the eBay auction site where he served as Chairman from 1998 to 2015. He became a billionaire at the age of 31 with eBay's 1998 initial public offering (IPO). Omidyar and his wife Pamela are well-known philanthropists who founded Omidyar Network in 2004 in order to expand their efforts beyond nonprofits to include for-profits and public policy. - Sami Vänskä (born 26 September 1976) is the former bassist of Finnish symphonic power metal band Nightwish. - Nightwish is a symphonic power metal band from Kitee, Finland. The band was formed in 1996 by lead songwriter and keyboardist Tuomas Holopainen, guitarist Emppu Vuorinen, and lead singer Tarja Turunen. The band soon picked up drummer Jukka Nevalainen, and then bassist Sami Vänskä after the release of their debut album, \\"Angels Fall First\\" (1997). In 2002, Vänskä was replaced by Marco Hietala, who also took over the male vocalist role previously filled by Holopainen or guest singers. - Marko Tapani \\"Marco\\" Hietala (born 14 January 1966) is a Finnish heavy metal vocalist, bass guitarist and songwriter. Internationally, he is most known as the current bass guitarist, male vocalist and secondary composer to Tuomas Holopainen, of the symphonic metal band Nightwish. He is also the vocalist and bassist as well as composer and lyricist for the heavy metal band Tarot. - Tuomas Lauri Johannes Holopainen (born 25 December 1976) is a Finnish songwriter, multi-instrumentalist musician (but mainly keyboardist) and record producer, best known as the founder, leader, keyboardist and songwriter of symphonic metal band Nightwish. He has also studied jazz and classical styles, but prefers to be influenced by harmonic film music. - Within Temptation is a Dutch symphonic metal band founded in April 1995 by vocalist Sharon den Adel and guitarist Robert Westerholt. They have always been classified by critics as gothic metal, although the \\"gothic\\" influence varies with each album. Their most prominent and well-known sound is described as symphonic metal, although their earlier material, such as debut album \\"Enter\\", was mostly gothic metal. \\"Enter\\" even had a hint of doom metal. In an interview, Den Adel said they fell into a symphonic rock genre with various influences.

User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Ian Harlow Stewart (born 30 July 1943) is a former Australian rules footballer who represented St Kilda and Richmond in the Victorian Football League (VFL) during the 1960s and 1970s. He later coached South Melbourne and Carlton and was an administrator at St Kilda. Stewart is one of only four men to win the Brownlow Medal three times. He was one of the first inductees into the Australian Football Hall of Fame in 1996 and was elevated to Legend status the following year. Just months after his last game, Stewart took a punt by taking on the coaching job at the embattled wooden spooners, South Melbourne. He was lured to the job by ex-North Melbourne administrator, Ron Joseph, who was on a short-lived appointment at the club. The Swans were the worst performed team since the war, and their finances were beginning to spin out of control. Over two seasons, Stewart performed a minor miracle by hauling the team up to eighth in 1976 and then the following year the Swans made the finals for only the second time in 32 years. The thrilling campaign to make the 1977 finals was highlighted by a withering run in the last six weeks of the season and a bold stroke by Stewart. He switched Graham Teasdale (a forward struggling so badly that he was thinking about returning to a bush league) in to the ruck and Teasdale dominated to the extent that he won the Brownlow medal in a canter. The fairytale ended the next week when the Swans were crushed by Richmond in an elimination final. Surprisingly, Stewart now left the Lake Oval. Carlton decided to replace their coach and wanted a big name to take over, so they immediately contacted Stewart. It was a fateful decision - Stewart's perfectionism did not always make him a great communicator and he fell out with a number of the Blues' key men. After a thrashing from Richmond in the opening round of 1978, matters went from bad to worse. Captain Robert Walls left for Fitzroy; his veteran teammate Peter Jones (who, like Stewart, had started his career with North Hobart) was relegated to the reserves; club favourite Adrian Gallagher was removed from his assistant coaching position. All three had crossed swords with the irascible coach. Just a few weeks into the season, Stewart quit the club, citing a heart attack. Speculation was rife that he had actually suffered a nervous breakdown, a view that was supported by the fact that he had been charged by the police (under the name of Ian Cervi) for exposing himself to daytime shoppers in Glen Huntly Road, Elsternwick, when parked opposite the Elsternwick Post Office, but it is certain that he quit before he was sacked. Certainly, Stewart was fit enough to resume as South Melbourne coach in 1979. He could not modify his hard-driving style and the personality clashes continued, but overall he got the best out of the limited material available at South Melbourne. In reality, Stewart's three-year stint with the Swans developed into a holding pattern for the team as the club flirted with, then agreed to, a move to Sydney. With the threat of liquidation constantly hovering over performances, Stewart got the club to a creditable sixth in 1980, but overall they lost more than they won in this period. Stewart's role as coach in 1981 was made all the more difficult when he had his driver's licence cancelled for two years, when he was found guilty of having driven dangerously, and having failed to stop after an accident. Stewart continued to give opportunities to young players and publicly backed the relocation, then handed the a player list in reasonable shape for the move, at the end of the 1981 season.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: What was his first season like with the team?","completion":"In the given text, it is mentioned that Ian Stewart's first season with South Melbourne as coach was marked by noticeable improvement: \\"Over two seasons, Stewart performed a minor miracle by hauling the team up to eighth in 1976 and then the following year the Swans made the finals for only the second time in 32 years.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Nintendo Power Magazine Is Shutting Down According To Source [Update: Confirmed] Update: Nintendo has confirmed that publication of Nintendo Power magazine will cease this December. According to an anonymous source at Ars Technica, long-running Nintendo Power Magazine is ceasing publication. Now-deleted Tweets from members of the Nintendo Power staff seem to confirm this, though no official statement from the magazine has been posted. Published by Future Publishing, which also publishes GamesRadar and CVG, the magazine has been in circulation since 1988. From the Ars Technica post: Nintendo Power is one of the longest-running game magazines in the country, having been published continuously since the summer of 1988, when it started as a bi-monthly outgrowth of the previous Nintendo Fun Club newsletter. Nintendo produced and distributed the magazine (with articles that were often just thinly veiled marketing copy) from 1989 through late 2007, when it started contracting the brand out for a more independent angle from tech-and-game-focused Future Publishing. But our source says that Nintendo, which was always “difficult to work with,” was uninterested in renewing that contract or in taking part in a number of digital initiatives that Future saw as necessary for the long-term health of the brand. He added that Nintendo doesn’t seem interested in taking over direct control of the magazine again (Nintendo and Future representatives did not immediately respond to a request for comment for this story). Nintendo Power editors and staffers were told of the magazine’s impending shuttering last week, the source said, and are currently being transitioned to work on other Future properties, including GamesRadar and MacLife magazine. The move should not affect Future’s other gaming magazines, which include official periodicals for the PlayStation and Xbox brands, as well as Best Buy’s @Gamer. With declining circulation, the magazine – like so many others – has been struggling. It’s a shame to watch yet another classic video game magazine close its doors. I’ve reached out to Future and Nintendo as well and will update this story as more news comes in. Image courtesy of Retromags.com via Ars Technica. Follow me on Twitter or Facebook. Read my Forbes blog here.","completion":"Nintendo Power Magazine, a magazine about video games that has been around since 1988, is shutting down and will no longer be published. This is because Nintendo, the company that makes the magazine, didn't want to renew the contract and there was a lack of interest in the digital side of things.

They were a hugely successful chart act that had hit singles over three decades, but their albums barely scraped into the top 30, unless they were greatest hits collections. They were best known for fluffy, hook-laden pop disco, but their back catalogue was packed with other stuff: music that was far weirder, darker and more intriguing. Errol Brown was a great singer, possessed of the ability to convey anguish with a chilling falsetto shriek, but it was a sound he rarely used: instead, he tended to unflustered cool, an imperturbable loverman who wouldn’t have broken sweat if someone had set fire to his tight satin trousers. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Hot Chocolate – Emma They began life as an opportunistic novelty act, born when Brown and bassist Tony Wilson took up an offer to join a group of Brixton based musicians who were employed recording reggae covers of current hits. One track, a bizarre version of Give Peace a Chance with a stentorian vocal and additional lyrics courtesy of Brown – “Rubbish! Rubbish!” he kept shouting, for reasons that weren’t entirely clear – found its way to John Lennon and was released on Apple. Signed to Mickie Most’s RAK, they floundered, devoid of a direction – scoring the occasional pop soul hit, like 1970’s Love Is Life, trying their hand at everything from glam to bubblegum to hard rock in the vein of Free’s All Right Now. It wasn’t until Most steered them in the direction of social commentary and brought in string arranger John Cameron that they settled on what appeared to be a winning style: the bleak funk of Brother Louie, the astonishing 1974 hit Emma, an impossibly morose tale of poverty, failure and suicide. The latter featured a remarkable vocal from Brown: he’s the model of resigned stoicism until the song’s closing minute, where he unleashes a series of harrowing screams. Hot Chocolate singer Errol Brown dies, aged 71 Read more It’s hard not to wish Hot Chocolate had made more records like that, had made more use of Errol Brown’s voice in that way. That said, you could see why they ultimately didn’t. Emma made No 3, but the band’s success was far from assured. Setting what was to prove a pattern, their subsequent debut album, Cicero Park, failed to make the charts at all, despite being a genuinely great record, offering a far tougher, sparser take on the nascent disco sound than the one they would subsequently become famous for. Of their follow-up singles, only the densely orchestrated A Child’s Prayer was a big hit. On the B-side of one of the flops was a track called You Sexy Thing: it was lightweight compared to Emma or Brother Louie or most of Cicero Park, but it was packed with hooks. Rerecorded, it became a hit on both sides of the Atlantic and set a kind of pop-disco template for the rest of Hot Chocolate’s career: So You Win Again, Every 1’s A Winner, deathless wedding disco favourites all. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Hot Chocolate – Mindless Boogie They were still capable of making harder-edged disco records – 1976’s Heaven Is in the Back Seat of My Cadillac among them – and they were still occasionally fond of experimenting: 1977’s echo-laden Put Your Love In Me had something of the spirit of Emma about it, with its deeply odd, creepy ambience and Brown’s voice rising to an eerie falsetto. But when their weirdest singles, Mindless Boogie – a taut, hypnotic funk track with lyrics about, of all things, the Jonestown massacre, taken from another great album that barely scraped the charts, 1979’s Going Through The Motions – broke their run of big hits, that seemed to seal things: from then on Hot Chocolate stayed firmly in the middle of the road, with only the UFO fixated lyrics of No Doubt About It and the occasional improbable cover version (anyone eager to hear Hot Chocolate doing Elvis Costello’ Green Shirt should head to side one of 1980’s Class) to suggest there was more to them. The hits ended with Brown’s departure in 1986: the band eventually replaced him with an Errol Brown impersonator who’d appeared on Stars In Their Eyes. Brown had a couple of hits, but his solo recording career never really took off in the way he might have hoped, although he remained a popular live artist until his retirement: testament to the lasting impression You Sexy Thing and So You Win Again made. When his death was announced, among the more unlikely tributes came from former Suede guitarist turned-songwriter-and-producer Bernard Butler. He took to Twitter to mention one of Hot Chocolate’s weird production quirks, putting congas through a wah pedal intended for a guitar. It was another hint that they were a rather stranger, more intriguing band than their most famous records suggested. ||||| Image caption Brown went on a farewell tour in 2009 Hot Chocolate lead singer Errol Brown has died aged 71, his manager has said.

It is the Gameplay which counts more, not the graphics and the powerful engines... The dreamcast is undoubtedly a very powerful machine, but I played few games and I thought it was a disappointement... I had all of my expectations in Sonic the Hedgehog, and it didn't turn out the game I expected it to be. Games like Incoming are even worse, it is boaring, even the graphics are so-so... It is with regret that I inform you that it was a disappointement. I checked most of the games which are present in the market right now, and so far, 1 star is all I could manage to rate. The only good side though is that it has potential; I am expecting \\"good\\" games to be launched in the near future, that's because the engines are powerful. I hope those guys in SEGA go on to plan B, so my purchase of the Dreamcast wouldn't be a waste! Is this product review negative?","completion":"Yes, this product review is negative. The reviewer expresses their disappointment with the SEGA Dreamcast and its games, primarily focusing on aspects like poor gameplay and unsatisfactory graphics. They title the review \\"Failure (so far!)\\" indicating that their experience has not met their expectations. The reviewer seems to be particularly let down by the flagship game, Sonic the Hedgehog, which they had high hopes for but found to be below their expectations. They also mention other games, such as Incoming, which they found boring and with unimpressive graphics. The overall rating given by the user is just 1 star, reinforcing the negative tone of the review. Although there is one positive aspect mentioned - the potential for improvement in future games due to the powerful engines - this does not negate the overall negative sentiment expressed throughout the review. The reviewer also expresses hope for a change in SEGA's strategy, so their investment in the Dreamcast does not go to waste. This shows they are open to re-evaluation based on future releases, but as it stands, their current review is negative."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Read the text and determine if the sentence is true: Gay Sex in the 70s is a 2005 American documentary film about gay sexual culture in New York City in the 1970s. The film was directed by Joseph Lovett and encompasses the twelve years of sexual freedom bookended by the Stonewall riots of 1969 and the recognition of AIDS in 1981, and features interviews with Larry Kramer, Tom Bianchi, Barton Lidice Beneš, Rodger McFarlane, and many others. Sentence: The film covers a twelve year period.","completion":"Upon reading the provided text, it can be ascertained that the sentence \\"The film covers a twelve year period\\" is true. The documentary Gay Sex in the 70s, released in 2005 and directed by Joseph Lovett, indeed provides a comprehensive overview of gay sexual culture in New York City during the 1970s. The twelve-year period under examination in the film is bookended by two significant events: the Stonewall Riots of 1969 and the recognition of AIDS in 1981. The Stonewall Riots, a series of protests and demonstrations by the LGBTQ+ community against a police raid at the Stonewall Inn, were a catalyst for the modern gay rights movement. This event marked the beginning of an era of sexual freedom and a heightened sense of identity for the LGBTQ+ community, particularly within the gay sexual culture of New York City. The recognition of AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome) in the early 1980s signaled the end of the aforementioned era as it brought about a drastic reshaping of the social and sexual landscape, not just in New York, but globally as well. The gradual understanding of this deadly disease forced people to adjust their perspectives on personal relationships and sexual encounters. The film features several interviews with notable individuals such as Larry Kramer, Tom Bianchi, Barton Lidice Beneš, Rodger McFarlane, and others. Each of these people offers unique insights and perspectives on the sexual freedom experienced throughout the twelve years between the Stonewall Riots and the acknowledgement of AIDS. Their personal anecdotes and reflections shed light on a critical period both in LGBTQ+ history and the broader social history of New York City. In conclusion, the statement \\"The film covers a twelve-year period\\" is accurate as per the provided text. Gay Sex in the 70s delves into the period between 1969 (Stonewall Riots) and 1981 (the recognition of AIDS), highlighting important facets of gay sexual culture and perspectives of key figures who lived during that time."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Would \\"Between 1990 and 2010, about 663 million people moved above the absolute poverty level.\\" be a reasonable answer? pick from the following. a). No. b). Yes.","completion":"a). No. The statement you provided does not address how poverty affects intelligence. It is a statistical data about the amount of people who moved above the absolute poverty level between 1990 and 2010, but it says nothing about the impact of poverty on cognitive capabilities. The relationship between poverty and intelligence is a complex one, grounded in a mix of environmental and biological factors. Evidence suggests that living in poverty can lead to detrimental effects on cognitive development and function. This linkage is thought to come from a variety of factors, including limited access to educational resources, increased stress, poor nutrition, and reduced stimulation at home. Children growing up in poverty often receive less cognitive stimulation from their environment, as they may have limited access to books, games, and other materials that promote cognitive development. Additionally, they are more likely to be exposed to environmental toxins and stressors, such as violence or instability, which can further impede cognitive function. Nutrition also plays a significant role. Poor nutrition, especially in early childhood, can impair brain development, leading to lower cognitive abilities. Moreover, the chronic stress of living in poverty can negatively impact mental processes such as attention, memory, and decision-making. It's important to note here, however, that while poverty can pose challenges to cognitive development, it does not predetermine a person's intelligence. People from impoverished backgrounds can and do overcome these challenges and achieve great intellectual successes. Furthermore, intelligence itself is a multifaceted trait impacted by numerous genetic and environmental influences, and not solely determined by socioeconomic status. So it's clear that an answer to your question should be a robust explanation, discussing these aspects rather than a simple statistical statement."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the answer: The film The French Connection is set in New York and which French city?","completion":"The film The French Connection, released in 1971, is set in New York City, USA, and Marseille, France. This thrilling crime drama is based on the true story of one of the largest drug busts in U.S. history. The movie, directed by William Friedkin, was adapted from the book titled \\"The French Connection: A True Account of Cops, Narcotics, and International Conspiracy\\" by Robin Moore. The French Connection follows the story of two New York City police detectives, Jimmy \\"Popeye\\" Doyle (played by Gene Hackman) and Buddy \\"Cloudy\\" Russo (played by Roy Scheider). They are trying to uncover and dismantle a major heroin-smuggling operation, with the drug being smuggled from Marseille, France, into the United States. Marseille, located in the Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur region on the Mediterranean coast in southern France, serves as the origin of the smuggling operation. The city's strategic position as a trading port historically makes it a suitable location for organized crime and drug smuggling operations. The film switches between the two settings, showing how the events unfold both in New York City and Marseille. While the detectives doggedly pursue leads in New York, the film also showcases the activities in Marseille, particularly the operation headed by the primary antagonist, Alain Charnier (played by Fernando Rey). Charnier masterminds a well-orchestrated plan to smuggle drugs using a vehicle hidden within a cargo ship. Through their tenacious investigation, the detectives eventually track down the operation, leading to a thrilling pursuit and ultimate takedown of some of the key players in the smuggling ring. The film was a massive success both critically and financially. The French Connection went on to win five Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director (William Friedkin), Best Actor (Gene Hackman), Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Film Editing. Its iconic car chase scene is still considered one of the most thrilling and influential in the history of cinema. In conclusion, The French Connection is set in two primary locations: New York City, USA, and Marseille, France. The movie tells the story of the relentless pursuit of a major drug-smuggling operation between these two cities, being investigated by two driven and determined police detectives."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The Empire Strikes Back: U.K. Beats U.S. In 'Soft Power', Survey Says On the news stands in the City of London, Monacle magazine says the U.S., despite all the hoopla around Barack Obama, has lost its lure as world leader. In its place, is the U.K., post-Tony Blair (talk about a slap in the face). Soft power is the way governments per Royal Standard of the United Kingdom (Photo credit: lydia_shiningbrightly) suade other governments to do their bidding, without the use of unmanned drones and semi-automatics. It’s been around for a while, and the soft power leader was larger the U.S. for decades. Not anymore. The globalized nature of world politics has given rise to a host of new challengers and a myriad of new challenges for the practitioners of statecraft. A shifting balance of global power and the effects of instant information have made soft power a critical component of foreign policy strategies. According to Monacle, no other country comes close to Britian’s influence around the world. This is the first time that the U.S. has been dethroned under Monacle’s survey. Monocle magazine’s annual “Global Soft Power” survey, ranks nations according to their standard of government; diplomatic infrastructure; cultural output; capacity for education; and appeal to business. The top five spots went to the U.K., U.S., Germany, France and Sweden. The list is calculated using a matrix of 50 factors that indicate the use of soft power. “I think America vastly undervalues the importance of soft power. It has a tendency to focus on the tangible and the concrete,” Xenia Dormandy, a senior fellow and U.S. expert at Chatham House, was quoted as saying in The Independent, a U.K. daily. What helped Britain this year might have been the fact that the Olympics brought global attention to the country; Bradley Wiggins won the Tour de France and Andy Murray won the Tennis Grand Slam in New York. The latest James Bond film “Skyfall” also has everyone want to be an MI6 agent, and speak the Queen’s English.

Bob's was located in a hilly area, with more precipitation and full of bike trails, so he had more people coming in, while Rob's was in the valley, near the parks. and a hint : In slippery conditions some riders prefer to ride fixed because they believe the transmission provides increased feedback on back tire grip. However, there is also an increased risk of loss of control in such conditions. This is especially so when taking into account the large number of riders who ride brakeless. These riders must brake entirely through the drivetrain. Ideally this is done by resisting the forward motion of the pedals, shedding speed while the bike is still moving. Alternatively, though far less efficiently, one can brake by stopping the motion of the pedals in mid-rotation, causing the rear wheel to lock in place, allowing the bicycle to skid and slow down from kinetic friction (see below).[22] Descending any significant gradient is more difficult as the rider must spin the cranks at high speed (sometimes at 170 rpm or more), or use the brakes to slow down. Some consider that the enforced fast spin when descending increases suppleness or flexibility, which is said to improve pedalling performance on any type of bicycle; however the performance boost is negligible compared to the benefits of riding a free wheel.[23] Please answer this question : Which town had more cyclists riding downhill at high speeds?

Please tell me the sentiment of the following review: Extremely tense thriller set in the urban chaos of São Paulo, the biggest and ugliest third world nightmare in Brazilian urbania. For the sake of making it easy for anyone who is curious about this intriguing and truly well made film, it has the grit of Mexican feature \\"Amores Perros\\" with a character not too far off Max Cady, from both Cape Fears, although this is not, by any means, a film about a psychopath. Two partners (Alexandre Borges and Marco Ricca) in a construction company pay hitman Anisio (Miklos) to off their third partner (and majority share holder) in said construction outfit. The murder is blamed on the city, but things begin to look very grim indeed when witty and charismatic walking nightmare Anisio decides he wants to be around the ever so nervous partners in crime, not only trespassing but, more importantly, deconstructing the strict social codes that make up Brazilian society. Anisio turns poverty into an attitude and he wants in. The look is almost entirely handheld, grainy, the performances outstanding throughout, especially so as first time actor (and member of classic Brazilian pop band 'Titãs'), Paulo Miklos, dazzles and baffles the viewer with his pretty funny social terror. I saw the film at the Brasília film Fest in November 2001. It has since done very well in Sundance and Berlin.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Adelaide father jailed for thrusting finger down infant's throat A man who caused a life-threatening injury to his baby by thrusting his finger down his throat to stop him crying has been jailed for at least two years. The five-week old boy, who had to be resuscitated after suffering an acute obstruction to his airway, was also found to have a broken rib which occurred about the same time. Andrew Gordon Campbell, 28, of Birdwood in Adelaide, pleaded guilty in the South Australian District Court to aggravated charges of recklessly causing harm and causing harm on May 6, 2013. In jailing him for three years and four months, Judge Paul Cuthbertson said the baby was taken to hospital and was unable to drink any fluids for about nine days after the offences. \\"No doubt he would have suffered considerable pain and discomfort,\\" he said. The judge also granted an intervention order, which bans Campbell from having contact with his son without the permission of the child's guardian. As well as a broken rib, the infant was found to have healing rib fractures caused on previous occasions. \\"I accept the evidence that you are trying to rehabilitate yourself so you may continue to have a relationship with your son,\\" the judge said. He had complied with requirements in relation to supervised visits to his son, attended counselling to learn parenting skills and written a letter to his son expressing his feelings about what he did. Campbell had a low level of intellectual functioning and anger management problems. \\"I am told that you have various problems that were a leftover of your unfortunate childhood and upbringing. \\"You must do your best that the same mistakes are not made with your own son.\\" One month of his sentence relates to his breaching a bond to be of good behaviour, for an assault on Campbell's brother.

Solve -24 = -4*i - 4*i for i.","completion":"Alright! Let's solve the math problem step by step, just like putting together a puzzle. We have this equation: -24 = -4*i - 4*i First, we need to add the two parts with \\"i\\" in them together. So, -4*i and -4*i are like taking away 4 candies and then taking away another 4 candies. So, if we put them together, that's like taking away 8 candies in total. Our new equation looks like this: -24 = -8*i Now, we need to figure out how many times -8 is multiplied by \\"i\\" to get -24. Remember how when you had to share 8 cookies with your friends and you shared them 3 times to make 24 cookies? For this problem, it's a bit different because we have negative numbers. But don't worry! When we have negative numbers and we multiply them, they can become positive. In this case, we want to find how many times -8 is multiplied to get -24. So we need to divide -24 by -8: (-24) / (-8) = 3 This means that \\"i\\" equals 3. And that's our solution! So, -8 multiplied by 3 (or -8*i when i equals 3) equals -24.

Answer based on context: Coming off their win over the Falcons, the Patriots stayed at home for a Week 4 matchup against the Baltimore Ravens. The opening kickoff was fumbled by Ravens returner Chris Carr and recovered by McGowan at the Ravens' 12-yard line. However, the Patriots could not capitalize on the field position, settling for a 32-yard Gostkowski field goal to give them an early 3-0 lead. The Ravens began their first drive from their own 19-yard line and advanced on a 15-play drive, capping it with a 20-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Joe Flacco to wide receiver Derrick Mason. The Patriots responded with a 14-play drive of their own, going 76 yards before Brady scored on a 1-yard quarterback sneak to re-establish a Patriots lead at 10-7. The Ravens reached midfield on their next drive with a 22-yard reception by tight end Todd Heap, but the drive stalled at the Patriots' 38-yard line, setting up a punt by Sam Koch that gave the Patriots the ball at their own 9-yard line. Similarly, the Patriots reached Ravens' territory before having to punt; Hanson's punt landed in the end zone for a touchback. On the second play of the Ravens' ensuing drive, left tackle Jared Gaither injured his head falling into Flacco during a block; while he had motion in his extremities, the game was stopped for 15 minutes as Gaither was loaded onto a stretcher and taken to the hospital for tests. The Ravens' drive finished as a three-and-out. The Patriots then went 63 yards on six plays, extending their lead to 17-7 on a 12-yard touchdown run by Morris. With just under four minutes remaining in the half, the Ravens mounted a drive that reached the Patriots' 17-yard line with 1:17 left; Flacco was intercepted by Bodden to prevent the Ravens from scoring again before halftime. The Patriots first drive of the second half was aided by a 15-yard unsportsmanlike penalty on the Ravens' bench, but the Patriots were unable to capitalize as a Matt Light holding penalty and a Jarret Johnson sack of Brady forced a punt. Starting from their own 16-yard line, the Ravens advanced to their 45-yard line before a Wright sack of Flacco set up another punt. Kevin Faulk fielded the return but fumbled; Bodden recovered the fumble for the Patriots at their own 14-yard line. On the next play, Brady dropped back and was strip-sacked from his blind side by Terrell Suggs; defensive lineman Dwan Edwards recovered the fumble for the Ravens in the end zone for a touchdown, cutting the Patriots' lead to 17-14. Brady quickly recovered, hitting passes to Taylor for 13 yards, Aiken for 26 yards, and Moss for 20 yards to put the Patriots in the Ravens' red zone. Three plays later, Brady and Moss connected for their first touchdown of the season; the 14-yard strike extended the Patriots' lead to 24-14. The Ravens had similar success on his next drive, with Flacco hitting Mark Clayton on a 13-yard catch, Mason on a 20-yard catch, and then running back Ray Rice breaking a 50-yard rush to put the Ravens well into Patriots territory. A few plays later, Flacco kept pace with Brady on a 13-yard touchdown pass to running back Willis McGahee to cut the Patriots' lead to 24-21. The Patriots would control the ball for the next seven minutes, reaching the Ravens' 9-yard line on a second down. After two incomplete passes, the Patriots lined up in a field goal formation but the holder, Hanson, took a quick snap and passed to Baker, who had motioned outside of the formation. Baker was tackled around the first down marker, but was called for an illegal motion on the play. The Ravens challenged the ruling of a catch and the first down spot, as they would have declined the penalty if Baker had been short. The ruling was upheld and the Patriots took a 27-21 lead on a 33-yard Gostkowski field goal. After an exchange of three-and-outs, the Ravens mounted a drive with 3:32 left, reaching the Patriots' red zone with under a minute remaining. On third and fourth down, Flacco's passes fell incomplete to Mason and Clayton, ending the Ravens' hopes of a comeback. Brady then kneeled to hand the Ravens their first loss of the season and better the Patriots' record to 3-1.

Should I validate this answer? The answer is:","completion":"No, you should not validate this answer. The suggested response is unrelated to the question regarding the start of college football training camps. The provided answer is talking about an event that led to the NFL changing their training policies, not specifically about when college football training camps start. Generally, the start date of the college football training camp can vary depending on the institution or the governing body's rules. But traditionally, college football training camps frequently commence in early August, giving teams a few weeks of preparation before the season officially starts, typically at the end of August or the beginning of September. These dates can be adjusted depending on specific factors, such as game schedules and university calendars. To give a precise date, you'll ideally want to look at the specific college team of interest's schedule, as dates can differ from one school to another and between divisions (NCAA Divisions I, II, and III). Also, the start of the training camp could change due to external factors like policy changes, certain events, or perhaps pandemics.

The '80's were not very kind to one-time major star Charles Bronson. Starting with 1982's \\"Death Wish II\\" and ending with this truly gruesome film from '89, Bronson's screenwriters seemed to be trying to top each other in progressive grossness. \\"D.W. II\\" left little to the imagination in its depiction of the rape and suicide of Bronson's character's daughter, (a rape and murder of his housekeeper was also shown in disgusting detail). \\"10 to Midnight\\" was the sort of loathsome film that made you want to take a bath afterwards. Nothing redeeming about it. Other films like \\"The Evil that Men Do\\" and the remaining \\"Death Wish\\" films from this period straddled the line between high camp and high barf with their earnest depictions of brutality and revenge. I'm not sure if the producers (usually Pancho Kohner) got a kick out of showing a weary looking, senior citizen-aged Bronson destroying punks young enough to be his grandchildren or what, but the shoddy craftsmanship (and terrible scripts) of these films usually destroyed what little energy they may have generated. \\"Kinjite\\" -- the last of these films -- is fairly well-made but truly takes the cake in cinematic wretchedness. In this film Bronson: sodomizes a perverse john; forces a pimp to eat his Rolex watch; allows a male prisoner to get raped by another prisoner; makes incredibly xenophobic remarks among other things I've thankfully forgotten. Also depicted is the gang-rape of a young Japanese girl (fortunately, this was off-screen, though well-implied). What were people thinking when they made this film?

Beer was priced from 12.00 to 14.00. Twitter users, including sportscasters, blasted the astonishingly high prices on their pages.","completion":"Title: Metlife Stadium Concession Prices Leave Fans and Sportscasters Astonished Introduction: The Metlife Stadium, home to popular sporting events, has recently been the center of criticism after its concession prices reached astonishingly high levels. Fans and sportscasters alike have been using their Twitter pages to blast these inflated prices, especially when it comes to hot chocolate and beer. Hot Chocolate in a Souvenir Mug: One of the primary reasons for this outrage stems from the 20.00 price tag on hot chocolate served in a souvenir mug. If patrons don't want the mug, they still have to pay a hefty 11.00 for the hot chocolate alone. Fans attending events at the stadium are disgruntled by such high prices, which seem unreasonable even within the context of a souvenir mug. Beer Prices on the Rise: In addition to the pricy hot chocolate, stadium-goers are also dealing with a significant cost for beer. Prices range from 12.00 to 14.00, exceeding the expectations of many who are used to stadium prices but find these costs excessive. No one wants to shell out such high amounts for a beverage while trying to enjoy their favorite sporting events. Sportscasters Join the Criticism: It's not just fans who are expressing their dissatisfaction; sportscasters have joined in blasting the exorbitant Metlife Stadium concession prices on their Twitter pages. These prominent individuals hold considerable sway in the sports community, and their taking notice of these outrageous pricing tactics adds weight to the ongoing conversation about attending events at the stadium. Conclusion: As the dissatisfaction around Metlife Stadium's concession prices grow, it remains to be seen whether stadium management will address these concerns and adjust prices accordingly. In the meantime, sportscasters and fans are using social media as a platform to voice their frustration and debate the merits of such expensive concessions. Ultimately, the hope is that the prices will be reduced to a more reasonable range that sports enthusiasts can comfortably afford while enjoying the events they love."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Hoping to rebound from their loss to the Chiefs the Seahawks played on home ground for an NFC duel with the Panthers. In the first quarter the Seahawks trailed early as RB Mike Goodson got a 6-yard TD run, followed by RB Jonathan Stewart getting a 3-yard TD run. They commanded the rest of the game with kicker Olindo Mare getting a 24-yard field goal, followed by RB Marshawn Lynch getting a 1-yard TD run, then with Lofa Tatupu returning an interception 26 yards for a touchdown. The lead was extended with Lynch getting a 1 and a 22-yard TD run. With the win, not only did the Seahawks improve to 6-6, they surpassed their victory mark of the last 2 seasons.

Why is the narrator so excited to get some sleep ?","completion":"The narrator is excited to get some sleep because they have had an exhausting and challenging day. From the text, we can deduce that they had to stay awake for an extended period (almost 25 hours straight) with minimal sleep, which negatively impacted their physical and mental well-being. Only managing to catch 45 minutes of sleep during that time, they are understandably eager to return home, where they can sleep in peace and comfort without any disturbances such as loud noises from pipes or the need to keep watch. Furthermore, it's worth noting the repetition of the phrase \\"I love my job\\" which can be interpreted both literally and sarcastically. On one hand, the narrator could genuinely appreciate their job despite the sleepless nights it entails, while on the other hand, they could be expressing their frustration and sarcasm about the demanding nature of their work. In summary, the narrator is excited to get some sleep because they have been significantly sleep-deprived due to their job commitments, which has likely taken a toll on their physical and emotional well-being.

Francis I of France had continued his policy of seeking a middle course in the religious rift in France until an incident called the Affair of the Placards. The Affair of the Placards began in 1534, and started with protesters putting up anti-Catholic posters. The posters were not Lutheran but were Zwinglian or \\"Sacramentarian\\" in the extreme nature of the anti-Catholic content—specifically, the absolute rejection of the Catholic doctrine of \\"Real Presence.\\" Protestantism became identified as \\"a religion of rebels,\\" helping the Catholic Church to more easily define Protestantism as heresy. In the wake of the posters, the French monarchy took a harder stand against the protesters. Francis had been severely criticized for his initial tolerance towards Protestants, and now was encouraged to repress them. At the same time, Francis was working on a policy of alliance with the Ottoman Empire. The ambassadors in the 1534 Ottoman embassy to France accompanied Francis to Paris. They attended the execution by burning at the stake of those caught for the Affair of the Placards, on 21 January 1535, in front of the Cathedral of Notre-Dame de Paris. John Calvin, a Frenchman, escaped from the persecution to Basle, Switzerland, where he published the Institutes of the Christian Religion in 1536. In the same year, he visited Geneva, but was forced out for trying to reform the church.

His two brothers died in 1823, and his mother in 1826, giving Watts an obsession with death throughout his life. Watts was apprenticed as a sculptor at the age of 10, and by his mid-teens was proficient enough as an artist to be earning a living as a portrait painter. At the age of 18 he gained admission to the Royal Academy schools, although he disliked their methods and his attendance was intermittent. From 1837, Watts was successful enough to devote himself full-time to painting.In 1843 Watts travelled to Italy where he remained for four years. On his return to London he suffered from melancholia, and painted many notably gloomy works. His skills were widely celebrated, and in 1856 he decided to devote himself to portrait painting. His portraits were extremely highly regarded, and in 1867 he was elected to the Royal Academy, at the time the highest honour available to an artist, although he rapidly became disillusioned with its culture. From 1870 onwards he became widely renowned as a painter of allegorical and mythical subjects; by this time, he was one of the most highly regarded artists in the world. In 1881 he added a glass-roofed gallery to his home at Little Holland House, which was open to the public at weekends, further increasing his fame. answer the following question: What is the last name of the person whose two brothers died in 1823?

Some think very highly of SOME of his interpretations (e.g., the Vienna or Toronto no. 7, and the Vienna or Leipzig no. 3), but others consider them to be too adventurous and deviant when compared with Mahler's score.This recording, however, provides one of Scherchen's best Mahler interpretations caught on a disc: the studio 1959 Vienna take of symphony no. 2. It is as adventurous as one could expect from Scherchen, but this works well with the \\"sense of drama\\" that this symphony requires in order to be really successful.Recording quality is acceptable as an early stereo take, but strings are quite weak (too few).This interpretation exist in many incarnations, most of them hard to find since they are deleted from the catalogue. Would you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light? A:","completion":"This review depicts the product, which is Hermann Scherchen's recording of Mahler's Symphony No. 2, in a predominantly flattering light. However, there are certain criticisms involved but those do not majorly outweigh the praiseworthy aspects discussed. The opening paragraph gives a balanced view by acknowledging the varying opinions about Hermann Scherchen among the followers of Gustav Mahler's works. This suggests that his interpretations are subject to individual listener's taste, which is not unusual for any type of artistic performance. The reviewer notes that, while some listeners appreciate Scherchen's bold interpretations, others may find them too divergent from Mahler's original score. In the next paragraph, the reviewer affirms that the recording in question - 1959's Vienna studio rendition of Mahler's Symphony No. 2 - is one of Scherchen's finest interpretations of Mahler's compositions. This certainly puts Scherchen's rendition in a favorable light, as it is appreciated for its adventurousness that resonates well with the drama that this symphony demands for assertive impact. The criticisms and negative remarks are mostly aimed towards the technical aspects of the recording quality. The reviewer mentions that the recording quality is acceptable for an early stereo take, suggesting that although it may not be up to modern and high fidelity standards, for a 1959's stereo recording, it serves its purpose. This criticism seems relatively mild and does not significantly detract from the musical quality of the performance itself. Further emphasizing on this, the reviewer notes that the strings, in the recording, are \\"quite weak\\". This is another technical imperfection and could indeed affect the listening experience for some classical music enthusiasts who seek a well-defined balance in orchestration. Finally, the remark about multiple incarnations of this interpretation and their availability is neither flattering nor unflattering. It's more of an informative note for potential listeners who might be interested in finding other takes of this performance. In conclusion, while there are some technical aspects that present the recording in a less than ideal light, the reviewer's overall impression towards Scherchen's interpretation is positive. The minor criticisms appear more related to recording technology than to Scherchen's interpretive choices or conducting talent. Therefore, it can be said that, on balance, the review depicts the product more in a flattering light."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Write a title for this article: The airlines are still catching up with the technology many of their customers already carry in their pockets. That’s a problem for an industry whose core purpose is customer service. Still, there is some hope for change. The carriers are finally recognizing that many of their antiquated systems contribute to passenger frustrations. They have begun developing hand-held devices, a little bigger than cellphones, that have much quicker access to airline data and allow gate agents to assist passengers throughout the terminal. In theory, gate agents with these devices can anticipate the need to rebook a flight after a missed connection, instead of waiting for passengers to ask. In the future, new technology may allow airlines to know if travelers are stuck in traffic on their way to the airport, thanks to GPS-enabled smartphones, or offer an earlier flight if a traveler shows up with time to spare. Passengers traveling this summer will see only a glimpse of the new technology, though it will be introduced at airports over the next year or two. For now, the airlines remain dependent on computer systems first built a half century ago that have been layered with updates upon updates — “a spaghetti of networks,” as one analyst described it — that do not always communicate well with one another, or with passengers. So some airport screens may say a flight is on time, while the gate information shows it has been moved to another terminal and the airline employees standing behind their monitors say the flight has, in fact, been delayed two hours. And the experiences of passengers are more like Dr. Joan Bengtson’s. Dr. Bengtson, a gynecologist who lives in Boston, said that she was once stranded because of a snowstorm, and it took two days for the airline to rebook her. Meanwhile the phone number she was given remained busy for hours. “Once a problem comes up, their ability to deal with the consequences is woefully inadequate,” she said while traveling through O’Hare International Airport in Chicago last week. That is why the airlines, including American Airlines and Continental Airlines, have started updating their systems. At its major hubs, including Dallas-Fort Worth, American recently started using a technology called Yada — for “your assistance delivered anywhere” — that allows its agents to promptly rebook passengers on a different flight, advise on a gate change or track down a lost bag. Travelers do not have to wait in line anymore. Yada also prints boarding passes using small printers that agents strap to their belts. Because the devices also read credit cards, American’s agents can check oversize carry-on bags and charge a bag fee directly at the boarding gate. It seems simple enough. But modernizing the technology has been complicated, said Monte E. Ford, American’s chief information officer. “It’s like changing the engine of a plane in flight,” he said. “But we firmly believe that consumers will drive the technology, and we are trying to build an environment that will adapt to that.” The airline industry was once a technology pioneer. It introduced computerized reservations in the 1960s, for instance. And airlines run complex systems to schedule flights, choreograph thousands of simultaneous operations, and carry millions of passengers every day. But the technology was developed to first serve the airlines, not the passengers. And as other industries continued to innovate over the last decade, the airlines, struggling with losses, cut their technology budgets. So travelers can now view a plane in midflight, check airport delays or gate changes on sites like Flightstats.com but not necessarily on the airlines own sites, even though the information comes from the carriers. “In some ways, the airlines are a prisoners of their past,” said Henry H. Harteveldt, an analyst at Forrester Research. The airlines have tried to pack information on their Web site, and they use social networks like Twitter or Facebook. But many of these benefits have been overshadowed by bag fees or charging for food or pillows onboard, said Mary C. Gilly, a professor of marketing at the University of California, Irvine. “I think the airlines have deservedly gotten the reputation of doing what is best for the airlines, and not for consumers,” she said. Instead, passengers want “more information, more consideration.” The carriers say they know they need to simplify their computer systems and make them easier to use. And they benefit, too, with reduced operating costs and increase customer loyalty. “Technology is absolutely key for us to be able to offer an exceptional customer experience, which in turn is necessary to succeed as an airline,” said Theresa Wise, chief information officer at Delta Air Lines. “But we recognize that we still have some challenges today.” Airline systems can be maddeningly complex. It took Delta about two years to complete its acquisition of Northwest Airlines, a process that included merging their reservation and technology systems, and slicing 1,200 major computer applications in half. “Given the size and conservative nature of airlines, it is sometimes hard to introduce new systems into this industry,” said Raul Arce, the vice president for travel and transportation at I.B.M. “Airlines are beginning to see that their information technology and analytics are just as important as their aircrafts.” That is not to say airlines have been idle in recent years. The industry replaced its traditional magnetic-strip tickets with electronic tickets, saving 3 billion a year since 2008, according to the International Air Transport Association, a global trade group. The association helped develop the standard for bar codes on electronic tickets that allow passengers to print their own boarding passes. The industry is also working on automated boarding technologies. But new technology is expensive, and the industry has been struggling to generate cash. Airlines usually spend 2.5 percent to 3.5 percent of their revenue on information technology.

Colombia’s Warning for Mexico By HÉCTOR ABADFEB. 13, 2014 MEDELLÍN, Colombia — Most everyone agrees: The only thing worse than killing is being killed. If our lives are threatened, we have the right to defend ourselves, with force if necessary. In a civilized society, that defense is delegated to the state. But not all of us, apparently, live in that kind of civilized society. Colombia in the 1990s saw the rise of vigilante self-defense groups. In its impotence and desperation at not being able to rapidly win the war against the guerrilla army (which was essentially a drug cartel) and against the drug lord Pablo Escobar’s private army, the state gave the green light to these groups — called Convivir. They were made up of agricultural laborers, trained by soldiers, and financed by landowners and agribusinesses. When they began to extort money from the very businessmen who were financing them, they were declared illegal. But it was already too late. They had become clandestine paramilitary groups, using the same weapons as those they were fighting: kidnapping, murder of innocents, drug trafficking. What has been going on these last few months in Mexico, in the western state of Michoacán, makes me fear that the same thing is happening there today. “Autodefensas” have organized to drive out the vicious local drug cartel, called the Knights Templar. After first demanding that the vigilantes disband, the government of President Enrique Peña Nieto has now sanctioned them as part of the Rural Defense Corps — at least nominally under the control of the military. This is how it happens. The army, with the blessing of the central authorities, looks for an ally, a lesser evil among the local powers. Compared with the cruel and bloodthirsty Knights Templar, the self-defense groups have popular support and are allowed to operate. Meanwhile, the government ignores the fact that some of these vigilantes might be financed by the enemies of the Knights Templar — for example, rival drug gangs or another cartel from the neighboring state of Jalisco. The government allows the vigilantes to act for a while, but when it tries to come back in, the self-defense groups will have turned into a real armed power with whom the government will have to make a pact, for without them the state won’t be able to assert its authority. Mexico, like several Latin American countries, is able to guarantee security and the rule of law only in certain zones. The lifeblood of law and order manages to flow near the heart of power, around the big cities, but the farther away we get, the weaker the pulse, and in some places there is none at all. Police officers are few and corrupt, judges live under threat from local despots and strongmen, and the legitimate authorities have been paid off by illegal ones. It’s like the American Wild West, but with 21st-century armaments, private armies funded by the torrential flow of money from drug trafficking, and no prospect of a righteous sheriff riding in to restore calm. Sometimes the United States — which understands itself so well, but badly misunderstands Latin American realities — asks governments of its friendly southern neighbors to wage heroic battles. It asks for elimination of illicit crops, total war on drugs or extermination of guerrilla forces. The most obedient governments ignore what might be real solutions — like cutting off the source of the cartels’ enormous wealth by legalizing drugs — and instead attempt to carry out these requests. They send their national armies to undertake the thankless task of fighting against their own compatriots. That’s what Felipe Calderón, Mexico’s previous president, tried. But these wars to the death always fail. What they generate is local powers defending themselves by arming to the teeth, and outlying territories turning into battlefields where life is impossible for defenseless civilians. The legitimate economy and tourism disappear, death tolls soar (to around 80,000 in Mexico), and the final winner, inevitably, is not the state but some local narco-dictator with his own army of mercenaries. This is what we learned in Colombia: When the state is not present, it is local tyrants who take power and brutally impose their rules, which are nothing more than the defense of their privileges. The old Hobbesian concept, that the natural state of mankind is that man is a wolf to man, seems confirmed in these involuntary Latin American anarchist experiments. The strongest and richest wolf (from trafficking drugs or illegal mining) dominates the other wolves. Of course, every country is different. But I fear that today Mexico is making the same mistake Colombia did a quarter of a century ago. The vigilantes appear to be a cure — they are seen as saviors — but in reality they are part of the illness, one more illegal army, acting without restraints and financed by dirty money. In Colombia, the self-defense groups were eventually pursued until, in 2003, 25,000 of them were forced to demobilize. Since they were also drug traffickers, a few top paramilitary ringleaders ended up being extradited to the United States. But their legacy persists. Their descendants still live in Colombia and still have power: Now they’re called criminal gangs, and they are still practicing extortion and murder financed by illegal mining and drug money. The vigilantes might begin by killing kidnappers, drug dealers and extortionists, but soon they begin killing their relatives, and then their friends, or those they think are their friends, and then the friends’ families, until everyone is suspect and they might come knocking at your own door, as happened to us in Colombia — as happened to my own father, when he was gunned down in the streets of Medellín. To allow private armies, even if they are supposedly for self-defense, is to create a monster like the Hydra: If you cut off one head, two more grow back. Héctor Abad is the author of “Oblivion: A Memoir.” This essay was translated by Anne McLean from the Spanish. What is a short summary of the above article?","completion":"This article is about the rise of vigilante self-defense groups in Colombia in the 1990s and how the situation happening in Mexico with \\"Autodefensas\\" is similar.

The author warns that Mexico might be making the same mistake Colombia did by allowing these groups to exist, as they often become another illegal army, acting without restraints and using dirty money."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Generate a question that has the following answer: nicotine patches for the following movie plot: The film opens with Nick Naylor (Aaron Eckhart) appearing on Joan Lunden's daytime talk show, along a doctor, a senator's aide, and a teenage boy with cancer. As he's introduced, the audience spits at him. The screen freezes, spittle in midair, while Naylor explains what he does for a living in a voice over. He works for the Academy of Tobacco Studies, and he represents Big Tobacco. The Academy is supposed to research links between disease and smoking, and has never been able to find anything conclusive.On the show and throughout the film, he takes the offensive position (in both senses). On Joan Lunden's show, he protests that in no way would he want a potential customer to die, and accuses the doctor of profiting off cancer patients.His immediate nemesis is Senator Ortolan Finisterre (William H. Macy), a Birkenstock-wearing Vermonter whose office is decorated with cheese and bottles of maple syrup. Senator Finisterre wants to plaster a graphic skull-and-crossbones picture on every pack of cigarettes.Through all of this, Naylor is also trying to maintain a relationship with his son Joey (Cameron Bright). Naylor's boss BR (J.K. Simmons) wants ideas on how to make smoking sell. \\"We don't sell Tic Tacs, we sell cigarettes. And they're cool, available, and addictive.

Question: Process: - A person takes in oxygen through their nose or mouth - The oxygen travels into the body - Breaks down into glucose - Carbon dioxide is produced by the glucose breakdown - The carbon dioxide is exhaled out of the body through the nose or mouth. Question: suppose less glycolysis happens, how will it affect MORE oxygen reaching the body. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","completion":"If less glycolysis happens, it would have LESS effect on more oxygen reaching the body. Glycolysis is the process through which glucose is broken down into pyruvate and produces a small amount of ATP (adenosine triphosphate, the energy currency of cells). Oxygen is not directly involved in glycolysis; however, it plays a crucial role in the later stages of cellular respiration, specifically in the process of oxidative phosphorylation and the electron transport chain. These stages require oxygen to efficiently generate ATP from the products of glycolysis. When there is less glycolysis, it means that less glucose is being broken down, which results in a reduced production of pyruvate and ATP. The decreased ATP production means there is less demand for the oxygen needed during oxidative phosphorylation. As a result, the body will not need to take in as much additional oxygen to meet the energy requirements. The supposed perturbation of less glycolysis would lead to a decreased requirement for oxygen in cellular respiration. This may influence the second effect mentioned by causing more oxygen to remain in the body instead of being utilized by cells for energy production. In conclusion, the less glycolysis happening in the body, the less effect it will have on the increased demand for oxygen, and more oxygen may remain unused within the body."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

How to study the functions of sensory neurons in humans Be familiar with the types of neurons in the human body. Generally speaking, neurons are specialized cells of the nervous system of all living systems, including mammalians. The two main neuronal types in humans are motor and sensory neurons.","completion":"In order to effectively study the functions of sensory neurons in humans, it is crucial to first understand the basic structure and function of these specialized cells, as well as the different subtypes of sensory neurons and the specific roles they play in processing and transmitting information from our environment to our central nervous system. Sensory neurons, also known as afferent neurons, are responsible for detecting various external and internal stimuli, such as temperature, pressure, touch, pain, and body position, and then converting these stimuli into electrical signals that can be interpreted by the brain. This process, known as transduction, allows us to perceive and respond to our surroundings and maintain homeostasis within our bodies. Sensory neurons can be further categorized into three major subtypes based on their function: mechanoreceptors, which sense mechanical stimuli like pressure, stretch, and vibration; thermoreceptors, which detect changes in temperature; and nociceptors, which respond to potentially damaging stimuli and are responsible for our perception of pain. To begin studying the functions of sensory neurons in humans, it is essential to develop a comprehensive understanding of the anatomy and physiology of the sensory neurons themselves. This includes the dendrites, which are specialized to receive information from sensory receptors; the cell body, which contains the nucleus and other important cellular structures; the axon, which transmits the information in the form of electrical impulses known as action potentials; and the synaptic terminals, where neurotransmitters are released to communicate with other neurons or target cells. One of the most effective methods for studying sensory neurons' function in a controlled environment is through the use of electrophysiological techniques such as patch-clamping and extracellular recording. These approaches involve the placement of electrodes on the neuronal cells or surrounding tissues and allow researchers to directly measure neuronal activity when exposed to various stimuli. In conjunction with these techniques, molecular and genetic tools can be employed to manipulate the expression of specific genes or proteins involved in sensory neuron function, revealing critical insights into how these cells respond to environmental stimuli. Another valuable method for studying sensory neuron function involves the use of non-invasive neuroimaging techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and magnetoencephalography (MEG). These approaches allow researchers to visualize and monitor the activity of sensory neurons in living human subjects while they are engaged in various sensory processing tasks or experiences. Furthermore, behavioral experiments in combination with these techniques can be particularly useful for investigating how changes in sensory neuron function can impact human perception and performance. For example, researchers might analyze how changes in sensory neuron activity correlate with an individual's ability to detect different types of stimuli or the subjective experience of pain under various conditions. In conclusion, studying the functions of sensory neurons in humans requires a careful consideration of the numerous anatomical, physiological, and molecular features that give rise to the cells' unique properties and specialized roles. By employing a combination of electrophysiological, molecular, and neuroimaging approaches, along with carefully designed behavioral experiments, researchers can gain valuable insights into the complex and vital world of sensory processing in the human nervous system."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Given the question: Information: - Internes Can't Take Money is a 1937 American drama film directed by Alfred Santell and starring Barbara Stanwyck, Joel McCrea, Lloyd Nolan, and Stanley Ridges. McCrea portrays Dr. Kildare in the character's first screen appearance. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer continued the Dr. Kildare series with \\"Young Dr. Kildare\\" (1938) starring Lew Ayres as Kildare and Laraine Day as a nurse in love with Kildare, similar to Stanwyck's role in this film. The film was released in the United Kingdom as \\"You Can't Take Money\\". - A film, also called a movie, motion picture, theatrical film or photoplay, is a series of still images which, when shown on a screen, creates the illusion of moving images due to the phi phenomenon. This optical illusion causes the audience to perceive continuous motion between separate objects viewed rapidly in succession. The process of filmmaking is both an art and an industry. A film is created by photographing actual scenes with a motion picture camera; by photographing drawings or miniature models using traditional animation techniques; by means of CGI and computer animation; or by a combination of some or all of these techniques and other visual effects. - David Hoyt Canary (August 25, 1938 November 16, 2015) was an American actor, best known for his roles in \\"All My Children\\" and \\"Bonanza\\". - A comic book or comicbook, also called comic magazine or simply comic, is a publication that consists of comic art in the form of sequential juxtaposed panels that represent individual scenes. Panels are often accompanied by brief descriptive prose and written narrative, usually dialog contained in word balloons emblematic of the comics art form. Although some origins in 18th century Japan and 1830s Europe, comic books were first popularized in the United States during the 1930s. The first modern comic book, \\"Famous Funnies\\", was released in the United States in 1933 and was a reprinting of earlier newspaper humor comic strips, which had established many of the story-telling devices used in comics. The term \\"comic book\\" derives from American comic books once being a compilation of comic strips of a humorous tone; however, this practice was replaced by featuring stories of all genres, usually not humorous in tone. - The police procedural, or police crime drama, is a subgenre of detective fiction that attempts to convincingly depict the activities of a police force as they investigate crimes. Although traditional detective novels usually concentrate on a single crime, police procedurals frequently depict investigations into several unrelated crimes in a single story. Traditional mysteries usually adhere to the convention of having the criminal's identity concealed until the climax (the so-called whodunit), whereas in police procedurals, the perpetrator's identity is often known to the audience from the outset (the inverted detective story). Police procedurals depict a number of police-related topics such as forensics, autopsies, the gathering of evidence, the use of search warrants, and interrogation. - Rodman Edward \\"Rod\\" Serling (December 25, 1924 June 28, 1975) was an American screenwriter, playwright, television producer, and narrator known for his live television dramas of the 1950s and his science-fiction anthology TV series, \\"The Twilight Zone\\". Serling was active in politics, both on and off the screen, and helped form television industry standards. He was known as the \\"angry young man\\" of Hollywood, clashing with television executives and sponsors over a wide range of issues including censorship, racism, and war. - Nevada (Spanish for \\"snowy\\"; see pronunciations) is a state in the Western, Mountain West, and Southwestern regions of the United States of America. Nevada is the 7th most extensive, the 34th most populous, and the 9th least densely populated of the 50 United States. Nearly three-quarters of Nevada's people live in Clark County, which contains the Las VegasParadise metropolitan area where three of the state's four largest incorporated cities are located. Nevada's capital is Carson City. Nevada is officially known as the \\"Silver State\\" because of the importance of silver to its history and economy. It is also known as the \\"Battle Born State\\", because it achieved statehood during the Civil War (the words \\"Battle Born\\" also appear on the state flag); as the \\"Sage-brush State\\", for the native plant of the same name; and as the \\"Sage-hen State\\". Nevada borders Oregon to the northwest, Idaho to the northeast, California to the west, Arizona to the southeast and Utah to the east. - Television or TV is a telecommunication medium used for transmitting moving images in monochrome (black-and-white), or in color, and in two or three dimensions and sound. It can refer to a television set, a television program (\\"TV show\\"), or the medium of television transmission. Television is a mass medium, for entertainment, education, news, and advertising. - World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier. It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history. - Leonard Freeman (October 31, 1920 January 20, 1974) was an American television writer and producer who is best remembered as the creator of the CBS series \\"Hawaii Five-O\\" in 1968.

He appeared in a 1953 episode (#112) of the TV series, \\"The Lone Ranger\\". - A police force is a constituted body of persons empowered by the state to enforce the law, protect property, and limit civil disorder. Their powers include the legitimized use of force. The term is most commonly associated with police services of a sovereign state that are authorized to exercise the police power of that state within a defined legal or territorial area of responsibility. Police forces are often defined as being separate from military or other organizations involved in the defense of the state against foreign aggressors; however, gendarmerie are military units charged with civil policing. - Paramount Pictures Corporation (known professionally as Paramount Pictures and often referred to simply as Paramount) is an American film studio based in Hollywood, California, that has been a subsidiary of the American media conglomerate Viacom since 1994. Paramount is the fifth oldest surviving film studio in the world, the second oldest in the United States, and the sole member of the \\"Big Six\\" film studios still located in the Los Angeles neighborhood of Hollywood. In 1916 Zukor contracted 22 actors and actresses and honored each with a star on the logo. These fortunate few would become the first \\"movie stars.\\" Paramount Pictures is a member of the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA). - A rerun or repeat is a rebroadcast of an episode of a radio or television program. There are two types of reruns those that occur during a hiatus, and those that occur when a program is syndicated. Reruns can also be, as the case with more popular shows, when a show is aired outside of its timeslot (for example, in the afternoon). - Drama is the specific mode of fiction represented in performance. The term comes from a Greek word meaning \\"action\\" (Classical Greek: , \\"drama\\"), which is derived from \\"to do\\" (Classical Greek: , \\"drao\\"). The two masks associated with drama represent the traditional generic division between comedy and tragedy. They are symbols of the ancient Greek Muses, Thalia, and Melpomene. Thalia was the Muse of comedy (the laughing face), while Melpomene was the Muse of tragedy (the weeping face). Considered as a genre of poetry in general, the dramatic mode has been contrasted with the epic and the lyrical modes ever since Aristotle's \\"Poetics\\" (c. 335 BCE)the earliest work of dramatic theory. - Frederick Schiller Faust (May 29, 1892 May 12, 1944) was an American author known primarily for his thoughtful and literary Westerns under the pen name Max Brand. Faust (as Max Brand) also created the popular fictional character of young medical intern Dr. James Kildare in a series of pulp fiction stories. Faust's Kildare character was subsequently featured over several decades in other media, including a series of American theatrical films by Paramount Pictures and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), a radio series, two television series, and comics. Faust's other pseudonyms include George Owen Baxter, Evan Evans, George Evans, David Manning, John Frederick, Peter Morland, George Challis, Peter Ward and Frederick Frost. - Michael Landon (born Eugene Maurice Orowitz; October 31, 1936 July 1, 1991) was an American actor, writer, director, and producer. He is known for his roles as Little Joe Cartwright in \\"Bonanza\\" (195973), Charles Ingalls in \\"Little House on the Prairie\\" (197483), and Jonathan Smith in \\"Highway to Heaven\\" (198489). Landon appeared on the cover of \\"TV Guide\\" 22 times, second only to Lucille Ball. - Spencer's Mountain is an American family drama film written, directed, and produced in 1963 by Delmer Daves from a novel by Earl Hamner, Jr. The film stars Henry Fonda, Maureen O'Hara, and in early appearances in their careers, James MacArthur, Veronica Cartwright, and Victor French. Longtime Hollywood actor Donald Crisp plays \\"Grandpa\\", his final screen role. - Dr. James Kildare is a fictional American medical doctor character, originally created in the 1930s by the author Frederick Schiller Faust under the pen name Max Brand. Shortly after the character's first appearance in a magazine story, Paramount Pictures used the story and character as the basis for the 1937 film \\"Internes Can't Take Money\\". Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) subsequently acquired the rights and featured Kildare as the primary character in a series of American theatrical films in the late 1930s and early 1940s, several of which were co-written by Faust (as Max Brand), who also continued to write magazine stories and novels about the character until the early 1940s. The Kildare character was later featured in an early 1950s radio series, a 1960s television series, a comic book and comic strip based on the 1960s TV show, and a short-lived second 1970s television series. - Science fiction (often shortened to SF, sci-fi or scifi) is a genre of speculative fiction, typically dealing with imaginative concepts such as futuristic science and technology, space travel, time travel, faster than light travel, parallel universes, and extraterrestrial life. Science fiction often explores the potential consequences of scientific and other innovations, and has been called a \\"literature of ideas.\\" It usually avoids the supernatural, and unlike the related genre of fantasy, historically science fiction stories were intended to have a grounding in science-based fact or theory at the time the story was created, but this connection is now limited to hard science fiction. - Fantasy is a fiction genre set in an imaginary universe, often but not always without any locations, events, or people from the real world. Most fantasy uses magic or other supernatural elements as a main plot element, theme, or setting. Magic and magical creatures are common in many of these imaginary worlds. Fantasy is generally distinguished from the genres of science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three, all of which are subgenres of speculative fiction. - Lorne Hyman Greene, (born Lyon Himan Green; February 12, 1915 September 11, 1987) was a Canadian actor, radio personality, and singer. - Pernell Elven Roberts, Jr. (May 18, 1928 January 24, 2010) was an American stage, film, and television actor, as well as a singer. In addition to guest-starring in over 60 television series, he was best known for his roles as Ben Cartwright's eldest son Adam Cartwright on the Western television series \\"Bonanza\\" (19591965), and as chief surgeon Dr. John McIntyre, the title character on \\"Trapper John, M.D.\\" (19791986). - World War I (WWI or WW1), also known as the First World War, or the Great War, was a global war originating in Europe that lasted from 28 July 1914 to 11 November 1918. More than 70 million military personnel, including 60 million Europeans, were mobilised in one of the largest wars in history. Over nine million combatants and seven million civilians died as a result of the war (including the victims of a number of genocides), a casualty rate exacerbated by the belligerents' technological and industrial sophistication, and the tactical stalemate caused by gruelling trench warfare. It was one of the deadliest conflicts in history, and paved the way for major political changes, including revolutions in many of the nations involved. - The Twilight Zone is an American television anthology series created by Rod Serling. The episodes are in various genres, including psychological horror, fantasy, science fiction, suspense, and psychological thriller; and often conclude with a macabre or unexpected twist, and usually with a moral. A popular and critical success, it introduced many Americans to common science fiction and fantasy tropes. - The Waltons is an American television series created by Earl Hamner, Jr., based on his book \\"Spencer's Mountain\\", and a 1963 film of the same name. The show is centered on a family in a rural Virginia community during the Great Depression and World War II. - Bonanza is an NBC television western series that ran from 1959 to 1973. Lasting 14 seasons and 431 episodes, \\"Bonanza\\" is NBC's longest-running western, and ranks overall as the second-longest-running western series on U.S. network television (behind CBS's \\"Gunsmoke\\"), and within the top 10 longest-running, live-action American series. The show continues to air in syndication. The show is set around the 1860s and it centers on the wealthy Cartwright family, who live in the area of Virginia City, Nevada, bordering Lake Tahoe. The series stars Lorne Greene, Dan Blocker, Michael Landon, Pernell Roberts (who left after six seasons), and later David Canary and Mitch Vogel.

When aired in the UK, the television series was initially titled Gun Law, later reverting to \\"Gunsmoke\\". - CBS Productions is a production arm of the CBS television network, now a part of CBS Corporation, formed in 1952 to produce shows in-house, instead of relying solely on outside productions. Its first production was \\"CBS Television Workshop\\", a drama anthology series. It featured an early appearance of Audrey Hepburn. - A moral (from Latin \\"morlis\\") is a message conveyed or a lesson to be learned from a story or event. The moral may be left to the hearer, reader or viewer to determine for themselves, or may be explicitly encapsulated in a maxim. - Psychological thriller is a thriller story which emphasizes the unstable psychological states of its characters. In terms of classification, the category is a subgenre of the broader ranging thriller category, with similarities to Gothic and detective fiction in the sense of sometimes having a \\"dissolving sense of reality\\", moral ambiguity, and complex and tortured relationships between obsessive and pathological characters. Psychological thrillers often incorporate elements of and overlap with mystery, drama, action, slasher and horror (particularly psychological horror). They are usually books or films. - Hawaii is the 50th and most recent state to have joined the United States of America, having received statehood on August 21, 1959. Hawaii is the only U.S. state located in Oceania and the only one composed entirely of islands. It is the northernmost island group in Polynesia, occupying most of an archipelago in the central Pacific Ocean. Hawaii is the only U.S. state not located in the Americas. - Mitchel L \\"Mitch\\" Vogel (born January 17, 1956) is an American former child actor. Beginning his professional acting career at the age of ten, Vogel is perhaps best known for his role as the red-headed orphan, Jamie Hunter-Cartwright on the NBC western series \\"Bonanza\\", as well as for his feature film roles; as Tommy North in \\"Yours, Mine and Ours\\" and as Lucius McCaslin in \\"The Reivers\\". - Daniel Davis Blocker (December 10, 1928 May 13, 1972) was an American television actor and Korean War veteran. He is best remembered for his role as Hoss Cartwright in the NBC western television series \\"Bonanza\\". - Psychological horror is a subgenre of horror literature, film, television, and video games (as a narrative) which relies on the character's fears and/or psychological instability to frighten readers, viewers or players. On a few occasions, Psychological horror overlaps with the psychological thriller subgenre, making whatever story of the genre more unpleasant as well as terrifyingly suspenseful. - An anthology series is a radio or television series that presents a different story and a different set of characters in each episode or season/series. These usually have a different cast each week, but several series in the past, such as \\"Four Star Playhouse\\", employed a permanent troupe of character actors who would appear in a different drama each week. Some anthology series, such as \\"Studio One\\", began on radio and then expanded to television. - The National Broadcasting Company (NBC) is an American commercial broadcast television network that is the flagship property of NBCUniversal, a subsidiary of Comcast. The network is headquartered in the Comcast Building (formerly known as the GE Building) at Rockefeller Center in New York City, with additional major offices near Los Angeles (at Universal City Plaza), Chicago (at the NBC Tower) and soon in Philadelphia at Comcast Innovation and Technology Center. The network is part of the Big Three television networks.

Remember, they are different, and the answers will not be the same. Question 1: Can I kiss my wife's breast? As long as both you and your wife are happy and comfortable with it, it's okay. Grown-ups sometimes show love and care through physical closeness with the person they love, like hugs or kisses. Question 2: Which bike to prefer between 80k to 1.3 L for a 40-year-old? This is about choosing a bike, like the kind grown-ups ride, with a specific budget, from 80,000 to 1,30,000 (considering it's in rupees). For a 40-year-old, they'd probably prefer a bike that's comfortable, easy to ride, and maybe good on fuel. The best choice can be different for each person, so they should try some bikes and pick the one they like the most. Remember, buddy, these two questions are very different, so the answers can't be the same. One is about showing love, and the other is about choosing a bike!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Warrants for three Wesleyan University students arrested after a rash of illnesses on campus linked to the party drug Molly show police believe the bad batch of the drug originated in the Washington, D.C., area. The students, all neuroscience majors, were arraigned Wednesday in Middletown Superior Court, not far from the private college's campus. Superior Court Judge Leo V. Diana set bond at 50,000 for Eric Lonergan, 22, of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and 20-year-old Rama Agha Al Nakib, a Syrian citizen. Zachary Kramer, 21, of Bethesda, Maryland, was freed after posting a 5,000 bond. Eric Lonergan, left, and Rama Agha Al Nakib, right, are two of the four Wesleyan University students arrested Tuesday in connection with about a dozen hospitalizations among people who took a party drug known as Molly Lawyers for Lonergan, Kramer and Al Nakib said Wednesday that no","completion":"firm evidence has been presented to prove their clients were involved in the distribution or possession of the tainted Molly that caused the hospitalizations. They also questioned the credibility of the claims, insisting that their clients, as neuroscience majors, would be well aware of the potential dangers and consequences of using and distributing drugs like Molly on campus. In response to the worsening situation, Wesleyan University has launched an internal investigation to determine the extent of drug use on campus and whether other students or staff members may be involved. The administration has issued a statement expressing its concern for the wellbeing of everyone affected, and it has reaffirmed its commitment to maintaining a safe and healthy campus environment. As the case progresses, law enforcement agencies from both Connecticut and Washington, D.C., will be cooperating and sharing information to trace the source of the contaminated Molly and identify any other individuals who may be involved in its distribution. Authorities will be closely scrutinizing drug networks in the Washington, D.C., area, examining the production and distribution processes, and identifying potential links to other narcotics-related incidents. In light of this incident, there have been calls for increased drug education and harm reduction measures at college campuses across the United States. Experts argue that college students should be made aware of the risks associated with drug use, especially considering the potential for contamination or unknown substances being sold as popular party drugs like Molly. They also emphasize the importance of providing information about safe drug use practices and resources for students seeking help with drug-related issues. Furthermore, in an effort to prevent similar incidents from occurring, Wesleyan University may revisit its drug policy and consider implementing more stringent measures to deter drug distribution and use on campus. This could involve increased surveillance, more frequent drug testing, and harsher penalties for those who violate the university's rules and regulations. Wesleyan's administration is expected to collaborate with local law enforcement and other institutions to learn from this incident and implement the most effective strategies to address drug use on campus. As the legal proceedings continue, the defendants will either choose to negotiate plea deals with the prosecution or to present their defense in a trial. In either scenario, it will be up to the justice system to ultimately determine the guilt or innocence of these three neuroscience students. Meeting the burden of proof for their involvement in the distribution of the contaminated Molly will be a significant challenge for the prosecution. However, it is crucial for the victims and the affected community that those responsible are held accountable, and measures are taken to prevent similar incidents in the future."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Summarize the following: Raw black beans are harvested from the ground. As a result, it’s not uncommon to find small pebbles mixed in with them. To make sure your bagged beans are safe to eat, spread them out on a baking sheet and sift through them by hand, picking out any small rocks you come across. You don’t want to sink your teeth into one by accident! Most rocks will be light gray in color, which helps them stand out easily from the dark beans. It’s a good idea to give the beans a quick rinse prior to soaking, especially if they’re visibly dirty. A preliminary rinse will sanitize the beans and start breaking down the waxy starches coating the outside of the beans that makes them take longer to cook. Stir the beans up from the bottom by hand as you rinse to make sure the water gets distributed evenly throughout. A good long soak may make a separate rinse unnecessary if you're planning on cooking the beans immediately. The container you choose should be spacious enough to hold the beans you plan on soaking, along with the water that you’ll be adding later on. In most cases, a serving bowl, saucepan or stockpot will provide the volume you need. Measure the beans out into cup-sized portions—this will make it easier to round off your other measurements. A standard serving of black beans is about ½ cup (75g). Unless you’re fixing mass quantities in bulk, plan on soaking all of the beans at once. Breaking them up into multiple batches can add hours to your prep time. Drizzle 1 tablespoon (15ml) of distilled white vinegar or lemon juice over every cup of dried beans. The mild acid will help soften the beans before they even hit the water, while also ensuring that the water heats evenly. A little acidity will also prevent the beans from becoming mushy or completely disintegrating if they’re overcooked. Fresh squeezed lemon juice is preferable as it doesn’t contain any other additives, but bottled will also work just fine. Summary:","completion":"To prepare raw black beans for consumption, first remove any pebbles by spreading the beans on a baking sheet and manually picking out rocks. Rinse the beans to clean and break down waxy starches, then measure them into cup-sized portions. Soak the beans in a spacious container, adding 1 tablespoon of white vinegar or lemon juice per cup of dried beans to soften them and prevent mushiness.

Seeing the difference in the quantity of coffee each of them consumed, Donald took a moment to consider the potential outcomes of this informal competition between him and Nelson. The aroma of freshly brewed coffee filled the air as the two friends sat across from each other in the small, bustling café. They had spent many comfortable afternoons together here, discussing everything from work to personal life, and indulging in the delightful taste of their favorite hot beverage. On this specific day, the competitive spirit seemed to have taken over their casual catch-up session, as they observed each other's coffee consumption. Donald noted to himself that he was clearly having more cups than Nelson, a realization that brought a small, smug smile to his face. Meanwhile, Nelson observed his friend's quiet satisfaction and quickly figured out the reason behind it. At first, he was amused by this unexpected development in their otherwise routine meeting but soon enough, the desire to overcome Donald's lead began to grow within him. Determined not to let his friend outdo him, Nelson started drinking as fast as they could. He picked up the pace, finishing his cups of coffee much more quickly, which caught Donald's attention. Not wanting to be left behind, Donald too began matching Nelson's pace, maintaining his position in their unofficial competition. Slowly but surely, the atmosphere at the table shifted. The friendly banter that usually dominated their conversation became less prevalent as each man increasingly focused on swiftly enjoying his coffee, instead of fully savoring its rich flavors and the pleasant company of his friend. Noticing this change in demeanor, the café staff could not help but exchange quizzical glances, surprised by the tension-filled air surrounding their regular customers. As the two men endeavored to outdo each other, the café atmosphere lost some of its usual warmth and ease. After what seemed like an eternity of hurried sipping and gulping, Donald and Nelson both slowed down, realizing that their playful competition had taken a toll on their cherished camaraderie. They noticed the silence that blanketed their table, making up for the cacophony of noise typical in the café. Although they had started this challenge together, the situation now presented a chance to step back and reconsider its impact on their friendship. They exchanged a sheepish, knowing grin, putting an end to their coffee-drinking contest. They then resumed their conversation, with each of them sharing stories and news once more, ultimately preserving the special bond they shared, nurtured over countless cups of carefully brewed coffee."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

On Thursday, the U.S. Marshals Service placed Matt and Sweat on its 15 Most Wanted fugitives list in the hope of generating new leads. New York state is offering a reward of 50,000 each for information that leads to the capture of one or both men, and the U.S. Marshals are offering a reward of up to 25,000 each. ||||| FRIENDSHIP – After a tip about two men walking along railroad tracks led 300 federal, state and local law enforcement officers on the hunt for two escaped killers to this rural Allegany County town over the weekend, a new lead arose that the missing prisoners may still be near the prison. And this time, there’s forensic evidence. A law enforcement source close to the investigation told The Buffalo News that Saturday someone reported seeing two men who matched the descriptions of Richard W. Matt and David P. Sweat near Clinton Correctional Facility in Dannemora, from which they escaped two weeks ago. Then, on Sunday afternoon, “forensic evidence” that Sweat was in the vicinity of the sighting was confirmed. Law enforcement officials believe that the evidence proves the two men on the U.S. Marshals Service most-wanted list had not gotten far from the prison, at least as of late Saturday. The manhunt abruptly shifted back to the North Country on Sunday afternoon. By late Sunday night, various media reports from that part of the state showed an intense police presence. The Times-Union in Albany reported a person familiar with the investigation said evidence suggested at least one of the convicts had broken into a home in the area around Owls Head, east of Titusville Mountain State Forest, about an hour’s drive west of Dannemora. The Press-Republican in Plattsburgh reported that military trucks and four-wheelers rolled into nearby Mountain View, population 2,444, with light towers set up at intersections along Routes 26 and 27 and trooper cars at each crossroad. In Vermont, the Burlington Free Press reported via Twitter that the public information officer for Vermont State Police confirmed its tactical support unit was headed across the border to help New York State Police in Franklin County. Before the evidence from the North Country surfaced, the possible sighting on the railroad tracks in the Southern Tier seemed to be a promising lead. It came in at 1:16 p.m. Saturday. Brandy Thompson, 35, of Maple Grove Road in Friendship, said she reported seeing two men whom she thought matched the description of the escaped prisoners walking along the railroad tracks behind her home, State Police Maj. Michael J. Cerretto said at a news conference Sunday afternoon. Investigators interviewed her, and based on her descriptions of the men, they launched their search. “We determined she was credible,” he said. “As we have in other areas of the state, we will search under every rock, behind every tree and structure until we are confident that the area is secure. While this is an unconfirmed sighting, the State Police is asking residents who live on this area along the New York-Pennsylvania border to be on alert.” There were also other leads that made it seem possible that Sweat, 35, and Matt, 48, had somehow made it 300 miles southwest of the prison to the Southern Tier. Early Sunday, an area resident told The News that she heard about a second possible sighting Sunday morning in a heavily wooded area in Friendship, prompting police to intensify their search there. She said police searched her home and said that they had further evidence that Matt and Sweat were in the area. Also, Sweat has ties to the area. Sweat’s grandmother lived in Canisteo before her death in 2012. Sweat’s mother, Pamela Sweat, now lives in Conklin, outside Binghamton, but other relatives may live in and around Canisteo, which is 50 minutes due east of Friendship, where the search has concentrated since Saturday. For more than 24 hours straight following the tip in Friendship, law enforcement officers trudged through thick woods and went door to door in the rural town. They scoured barns, backyard sheds, doghouses, treehouses, trailers, even inside a stock car being pulled by a trailer. Roadblocks were set up throughout the area – two on Interstate 86, three on county Route 20 and on state Routes 275 and 19. Police concentrated their search in the area of the town around Moss Brook and Blouvett roads. “We had troopers walking up and down this road all morning,” said Jacob Dunn, who lives on the road. About a dozen officers with shotguns were seen walking through a field and nearby wooded area Sunday. “They told me they are going search every inch of the ground from (county) Route 31 all the way to Moss Brook, even if they have to come back tomorrow,” Dunn said after talking with an officer. The area being searched is thousands of acres of mostly forest in the northern area of the town. John Dunn, Jacob’s father, said several hunters’ tree stands are located in the woods. Many tree stands have propane stoves, and usually are about 10-by-10 feet, he said. But the forest here is dense. “The woods in this area they are searching are so thick that rabbits cannot get through it,” John Dunn added. But by about 5 p.m. Sunday, it appeared they had given up the search. The roadblocks were lifted. Television satellite trucks from national and local news outlets outside the State Police barracks in Amity left. The convoy of vehicles that had descended on the this town headed back east, apparently back toward Dannemora. Fresh troopers from the Buffalo-Niagara region were briefed Sunday morning at the State Police barracks in Amity, about five miles east of Friendship, where a “possible sighting” of the two escaped convicts was reported Saturday. Several vans filled with corrections officers and troopers pulled up to the barracks at about 2 a.m. Sunday, and hundreds of troopers and other law enforcement officers are searching the area. Two helicopters are part of the search, one of them Air One from the Erie County Sheriff’s Department. The state police helicopter was up for two three hours into early Sunday afternoon, but has been sitting on ground since about 1:30 p.m. After the briefing early Sunday, some troopers set up roadblocks on the area roads. Others headed into the forested areas on ATVs. Canine teams also were seen in the area. “We can leave no stone unturned,” one trooper said when asked about the search. A trooper walked out the barracks shortly before 9 a.m. to tell reporters “there was nothing to report.” Another police source said the timeline for the search is “open ended.” A news briefing will be held late this morning. The possible sighting Saturday in Friendship brought state troopers to the small, wooded, hilly township that one local resident said was “a good place to hide.” A witness spotted two men along a railroad line that runs along Route 20 in the Town of Friendship, according to State Police. State Police, U.S. Marshals, officers from the Department of Environmental Conservation, State Parks Police, Allegany County Sheriff’s Office and other local law enforcement agencies Saturday searched an area along I-86 and Route 20 in Friendship. Aviation, canine and special-operation teams are assisting in the search. email: lmichel@buffnews.com and mbecker@buffnews.com ||||| Over 300 law enforcement officers are part of \\"a lot of police activity\\" in Friendship, New York, this weekend in response to a possible sighting of escaped convicts Richard Matt and David Sweat, state officials said today.

Add Interest A witness called police saying she spotted two men who fit the description of Matt and Sweat on a railroad line along Route 20 in Friendship near the Pennsylvania border Saturday at 1:16 p.m., state police Major Michael Cerretto said at a news conference. Various law enforcement agencies, including aviation, K-9 and special operations teams were searching along I-86 and Route 20 to investigate the “credible” report, Cerretto added of the possible sighting in Friendship, which is more than 400 miles from the Clinton Correctional Facility where the men escaped earlier this month. “We will continue to search this area until all leads have been exhausted,\\" Cerretto said. \\"As we have in other areas of the state, we will search under every rock, behind every tree and structure until we are confident that that area is secure.\\" Law enforcement got to the site within 10 minutes of the call, which “came in immediately,” Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y. said today, adding the quick action gave police hope. Schumer also said “one possibility” is that Matt and Sweat, who have been on the run for 16 days, “are riding the rails,” explaining there is a long train line that connects across southern New York they may have ridden. While officials called the most recent sighting \\"unconfirmed,\\" police advised residents to be alert and call 911 immediately, adding that there is a 50,000 award for information leading to the arrest of one of the men, or 100,000 for both. The U.S. Marshals Service has also placed Sweat and Matt on the 15 most wanted fugitives list and is also offering a 25,000 reward for information that leads to their capture, police said. New York State police previously said they were actively searching in Allegany County in western New York Saturday afternoon in response to a possible sighting of Matt and Sweat. The convicts used power tools to cut through the back of their adjacent cells on June 6, broke through a brick wall, then cut into a steam pipe and slithered through it, finally emerging outside the prison walls through a manhole, authorities said. Matt was serving 25 years to life at Clinton Correctional in Dannemora, New York, after he kidnapped and beat a man to death in 1997. Sweat was serving a life sentence after he was convicted of killing a Broome County sheriff's deputy in 2002. ||||| What is a summary?","completion":"Over 16 days after their initial escape, the manhunt for the two prisoners who escaped from the Clinton Correctional Facility in New York continues, with recent DNA evidence found in a cabin pointing towards their continued presence in the area. Authorities are now focusing their efforts on Owls Head and Mountain View areas, after the owner of a cabin saw someone fleeing on Saturday. Over 300 law enforcement officers are working on the case, searching areas and setting up road blocks. While there have been a few reported sightings, these have so far proved inconclusive."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Team one had healthy people with normal red blood cell levels, but team two had people with sickle-cell anemia. the differences in health parameters were amazing and obvious. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which team had people with crescent shaped cells in their blood? Hint: The primary role of red blood cells in the circulatory system is to transport oxygen to the tissues. The actual carrier of oxygen molecules is the protein hemoglobin, which binds to the oxygen and moves it throughout the body, releasing it in areas where the concentration of dissolved oxygen is low. A certain mutation in the gene for hemoglobin causes a slight change in the structure of this crucial protein, resulting in a disease called sickle-cell anemia. For people with this mutation, the hemoglobin produced by their red blood cells has a tendency to clump together, distorting the shape of the red blood cells and giving rise to the crescent-shaped cells seen above. By understanding the changes in structure that are the underlying cause of this disease, we have developed various ways to treat and manage this illness. Answer:","completion":"Team two had people with crescent-shaped cells in their blood. This is because team two consists of people with sickle-cell anemia, a disease caused by a mutation in the gene for hemoglobin. This mutation leads to the production of abnormal hemoglobin, which clumps together and distorts the shape of red blood cells into a crescent or sickle-like shape."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Analyze the differences between the concepts: - Lying to themselves vs. Lying to the listener: While both questions involve a person potentially lying, the first question has an added layer of complexity as it addresses self-deception alongside lying to the listener. 3. Consider whether the differences are fundamental or superficial: - The difference between lying to oneself versus lying to another person is a fundamental distinction because self-deception could lead to unintentional dishonesty as the person might truly believe what they are saying. Meanwhile, lying directly to someone else typically implies intentional dishonesty from the speaker. Conclusion: The two questions are not the same.

(The dog was a gift from Ludlow's wife, who was murdered shortly afterward by their emotionally troubled son.)While taking a day off from work to go fishing, Ludlow and Red are met on the lakeshore by a deer-hunting trio of teenagers: Danny, his brother Harold, and their friend Pete (Noel Fisher, Kyle Gallner, and Shiloh Fernandez). Their conversation is at first friendly, but turns increasingly menacing as Danny - a swaggering bully - points his shotgun at Ludlow and demands money. Ludlow offers Danny the keys to his pickup truck, and says there's 20 or 30 dollars in his wallet in the glove box. Danny is disgusted at the small pickings, and on an impulse turns his shotgun toward Red, shooting him in the head. The boys walk away from the man and his dying dog, Danny and Pete laughing about it while Harold seems shaken and embarrassed.Ludlow takes his dog home and buries him. He learns Danny McCormack's identity by tracking down where he bought the shotgun. He goes to Danny's home and confronts the boy's father (Tom Sizemore), a wealthy businessman with political connections. Ludlow demands that McCormack discipline his son for what he did. McCormack summons his two sons, but they deny the incident happened. McCormack says Ludlow has the wrong culprits, and sends him away. Ludlow goes to his lawyer, who says even if the boys were tried and convicted of the crime, it is at best a 200-dollar fine and a few days in jail. The lawyer introduces Ludlow to Carrie (Kim Dickens), a TV reporter, who persuades him to let her do a feature story on the killing.What follows is an escalating cycle of hostilities between Ludlow and the McCormacks.

The first saw creation as the result of a series of hieros gami or sacred marriages, involving the reconciliation of opposites, postulated as a coming together of male and female divine beings; the gods. This continued to influence the whole Mesopotamian mythos. Thus in the Enuma Elish the creation was seen as the union of fresh and salt water; as male Abzu, and female Tiamat. The product of that union, Lahm and Lahmu, \\"the muddy ones\\", were titles given to the gate keepers of the E-Abzu temple of Enki, in Eridu, the first Sumerian city. Describing the way that muddy islands emerge from the confluence of fresh and salty water at the mouth of the Euphrates, where the river deposited its load of silt, a second hieros gamos supposedly created Anshar and Kishar, the \\"sky-pivot\\" or axle, and the \\"earth pivot\\", parents in turn of Anu (the sky) and Ki (the earth). Another important Sumerian hieros gamos was that between Ki, here known as Ninhursag or \\"Lady Sacred Mountain\\", and Enki of Eridu, the god of fresh water which brought forth greenery and pasture.

Summarize: This is because clever, self-learning programs are getting better than human recruiters at analysing vast amounts of data gleaned from application forms, CVs (curricula vitae or resumes), and social media profiles. Not only can they see if your credentials match the basic requirements of the job description, they can identify personality traits from the way you've expressed yourself on paper and online. These algorithms try \\"to automate the 20-to-50 things the best recruiters do consciously or unconsciously\\" when shortlisting candidates, says Jon Bischke, chief executive of Entelo, a recruitment tech firm. But he doesn't believe we'll ever reach the point where the computer makes the final decision. \\"The goal is not to tell you who to hire,\\" he says. \\"But it might tell you which five people to bring in to interview.\\" The more data recruitment algorithms can analyse, the more accurate their assessments will become. And they can learn from previous successes and failures. So if a selected candidate does well in the job, for example, his or her profile can be fed back into the algorithm so that it can spot people with similar profiles in future. \\"Maybe in life I've looked at 20,000 or 30,000 resumes,\\" says Sheerov Desai, chief executive of Gild, a machine learning recruitment firm. \\"A machine which has been fed hundreds of millions is going to outperform me.\\" Before the advent of powerful computers and data science, recruiters \\"would spend a lot of time doing manual research on applicants, Googling them, looking for details about work they've done in the past, seeing if they would be a good cultural fit,\\" says Mr Desai. All this has now been automated and speeded up. And these algorithms can often spot things we humans can't. For example, one of Gild's clients complained that the agency was sending them Java engineers for a vacancy for an Android programmer. \\"But the machine is scanning hundreds of millions of resumes, and it started to make the conclusion that Java and Android were quite similar technologies,\\" says Mr Desai. The machine was right - a Java programmer not already familiar with Android would pick it up very quickly, he says. Another big advantage computers have over humans is that they are free from racial and gender prejudice. Where human recruiters may - even unconsciously - dismiss candidates based on assumed ethnicity, sex or education, algorithms can assess anonymised applications objectively. It is this kind of bias that drove Stephanie Lampkin to launch Blendoor, a \\"Tinder for jobs\\" that hides applicants' race, age, name, and gender and matches them with companies based on skills and education alone. Finding the best candidates is one thing, keeping them motivated and loyal once you've hired them is another. Most companies set their goals annually, but research shows the average goal's shelf-life is actually just 40 days, says Kris Duggan, chief executive of BetterWorks, a business management software company. Mr Duggan's product lets employees set goals quarterly and check in on their progress - he compares it to the fitness-goals system, FitBit. BetterWorks is also researching how to apply machine-learning to assess how effective a company's goals really are. The more engaged staff are the better they perform, says Jim Barnett, chief executive of Glint, a company that regularly surveys employees. \\"Measuring engagement isn't like an annual check-up with your doctor - it's more like fitness and diet, which you should be monitoring all the time,\\" he says. Algorithms sift through the survey data to predict which teams may be running into problems, and suggest how managers might forestall them. But how much monitoring is too much? In a recent experiment at MIT, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, employees in a business wore monitors to track their basic emotional states. Algorithms sifting through the data identified that all employees experienced flashes of anger during their day. Further analysis showed this was always during meetings with a particular manager. Now that might be useful to know if you're the boss, but how happy would staff be at that level of intrusion? And what are the risks of relying so heavily on computers for recruitment purposes? Algorithms trained to spot correlations and patterns - to seek out candidates that fit an ideal based on previous experience - may reject candidates from non-traditional backgrounds who would actually be excellent, some experts warn. If you write the algorithm too rigidly, it may end up selecting competent applicants but reject \\"the next Picasso, Shakespeare, or Turing\\", says Petar Vujosevic, co-founder of GapJumpers, a recruitment tech company specialising in \\"blind audition\\" assessments of potential candidates. GapJumpers believes setting relevant online tasks for applicants is a better way of assessing talent than simply wading through - probably embellished - CVs. \\"If people are not careful how they think about and build recruitment technology, in what is essentially a human process,\\"' says Mr Vujosevic, \\"it will only make people feel even less engaged and appreciated for their talents - and on a scale human recruiters never could manage.\\" Caveats aside, the financial case for using self-learning algorithms is clear. There are 5.3 million new job hires every month in the US, according to the country's Bureau of Labor Statistics. And each corporate vacancy attracts 250 applications on average. That's a lot of documents for businesses to plough through. Automating this process saves money - that's the bottom line. In the UK, replacing a departing staff member costs Â£30,614 on average, says Oxford Economics - which works out at more than Â£4bn a year in total for British business. And with a third of new hires leaving after six months, as a business you really want to do everything you can to get the right person the first time round. So if your job application is rejected in future, you may have to blame a computer, not the HR department.

As a result, Ed Eagan was promoted to the Giants active roster Tuesday, opening up a spot for Raymond on the practice squad. Should the Giants suffer any more injuries, the 23-year-old could find himself on the active roster as well. Hypothesis: Raymond had a practice spot open on tuesday","completion":"Yes, based on the provided context, we can draw the following hypothesis: Raymond had a practice spot open on Tuesday because Ed Eagan was promoted to the Giants active roster, which led to an open spot in the practice squad. A more detailed analysis of the context and reasoning to support this hypothesis is: 1. The Giants are dealing with significant injury-related issues in their receiving corps, with Brandon Marshall, Odell Beckham, and Dwayne Harris all being placed on injured reserve. 2. To address these roster shortages, the Giants have promoted Ed Eagan to their active roster from the practice squad as they need to strengthen their receiving corps. 3. With Ed Eagan's promotion to the active roster, this created an open spot on the Giants practice squad. 4. Raymond, who is a 23-year-old receiver, signed with the Giants practice squad on Tuesday, presumably filling the open spot that was left by Ed Eagan's promotion. 5. The context also mentions that if the Giants suffer any more injuries, Raymond could potentially be promoted to the active roster as well. This implies that Raymond's role on the team could be subject to change depending on the health of the existing players on the active roster. Based on this analysis, the hypothesis aligns with the context provided: Raymond had a practice spot open on Tuesday due to Ed Eagan's promotion to the Giants active roster and the subsequent need to fill the open spot in the practice squad."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

To do this, subtract 28*f from both sides of the equation: 28*f - 25 - 28*f = 33*f - 28*f This simplifies to: -25 = 5*f Step 2: Solve for f Now that the equation is simplified, we need to isolate f by dividing both sides of the equation by 5: -25 / 5 = (5*f) / 5 This simplifies to: -5 = f So, the solution for the equation 28*f - 25 = 33*f is f = -5."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

I can honestly say I tried them all, and these were the ones that worked for me.

But others immediately renewed calls for a global ban on human reproductive cloning before the technology moves any farther. \\"Successful cloning of an increasing number of species confirms the general impression that it would be possible to clone any species of mammals, including humans,\\" said Ian Wilmut, a reproductive biologist at the University of Edinburgh who produced the first cloned mammal, Dolly the sheep, from an adult cell nearly a decade ago.

So far, efforts to clone a monkey or another primate with the same techniques have failed. Uncertainties about the health and life span of cloned animals continue to exsist; Dolly died at a young age in 2003 after developing cancer and arthritis.

Answer:","completion":"The missing first step in the process of electricity generation from coal is: 1. Extraction and transportation of coal: Prior to the coal being pulverized into fine powder, the raw material, coal, needs to be extracted from coal mines or deposits. This process involves either underground or open-pit mining techniques depending on the accessibility and depth of the coal deposits. Once the coal is extracted, it is then transported to the power plant via various methods such as trucks, conveyors, trains, or barges, depending on the location of the coal mine and the power plant. Upon arrival at the power plant, the coal is generally stored in large stockpiles, where it awaits further processing. Quality checks may also be performed at this stage to ensure that the coal meets the required specifications for efficiency and emissions. To summarize, the complete process of electricity generation from coal includes: 1. Extraction and transportation of coal. 2. Coal is pulverized into fine powder. 3. The coal is mixed with hot air. 4. The coal and hot air are blown into a boiler. 5. The coal and hot air burn over a fire. 6. Highly purified water is pumped through pipes in the boiler. 7. The water turns into steam. 8. The steam presses against turbines. 9. The turbines spin. 10. Electricity is produced.

Even now it can measure up to other movies in this genre. \\"Legend of Zu\\" is connected to \\"Zu\\"warriors from magic mountain\\"! It is not necessary to have seen this movie to understand the plot of this one. The plot is a bit hard to follow. But to be honest it doesn't matter. It is all about the action and adventure! I always was wondering what Tsui Hark would do if he got his hands on CGI. Now we know,he made this movie. Maybe it sometimes is too much but the overall result is so beautiful that I am not going to be critical about that. There is so much happening on the screen,you simply won't believe! I think it is a big shame that this movie wasn't shown in theaters here in Holland. Because this movie is screaming for screen time in cinemas! This movie easily can beat big budget Hollywood productions like \\"Superman Returns\\" or Xmen 3. The only thing I do have to mention is the lack of humor!

If GPRA calls for phased implementation so that selected pilot projects in the agencies can develop experience from implementing GPRA requirements in fiscal years 1994 through 1996 before implementation is required for all agencies., can we conclude that \\"GPRA is completely against implementing the project by all means.\\"? OPT: [A]. yes. [B]. it is not possible to tell. [C]. no.","completion":"C. No, we cannot conclude that \\"GPRA is completely against implementing the project by all means.\\" The Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) of 1993 is a United States law that aims to improve the effectiveness, efficiency, and accountability of federal programs by establishing a system for agencies to set goals, measure performance, and report on their achievements. The provision for phased implementation does not imply that GPRA is against the project; instead, it shows a cautious and strategic approach to its implementation. The phased implementation allows for the gradual introduction of GPRA requirements in selected pilot projects from fiscal years 1994 through 1996 before it becomes mandatory for all agencies. This strategy has several advantages: 1. Learning Curve: Implementing GPRA requirements in pilot projects allows agencies to gain valuable experience and insights into the challenges, adjustments, and best practices needed for successful adoption. This learning curve prepares them for a smoother transition to full implementation. 2. Adaptation: The phased approach provides an opportunity for agencies to adapt their internal processes, systems, and culture to the new requirements. This gradual adaptation ensures that they are well-equipped to handle the changes and can minimize potential disruptions or inefficiencies. 3. Continuous Improvement: By starting with pilot projects, the government can identify areas of improvement and make necessary modifications to the GPRA framework. This iterative process enables them to refine and enhance the framework to better serve its objectives. 4. Reducing Risk: A phased approach helps in mitigating risks associated with large-scale change by testing the effectiveness and practicality of the implementation plan in smaller, controlled settings. This way, potential problems or roadblocks can be detected and addressed earlier, minimizing the negative impact on program performance. 5. Evidence-based Decision Making: The pilot projects serve as a platform for gathering data and evidence on the effectiveness of GPRA requirements in practice. This evidence-based approach allows for more informed decision-making when rolling out the implementation plan to all agencies. In conclusion, the phased implementation in the GPRA is not against the project but serves as a prudent approach to ensure the successful adoption of the requirements across federal agencies. This method allows the government to learn from pilot projects, mitigate risks, and enhance the framework, ultimately leading to more effective and accountable federal programs."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: U.S. President Donald Trump attempted to reset his relationship with Africa on Monday, as he hosted Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari. Buhari is the first sub-Saharan African leader to have a White House summit with Trump, who has been criticized for reportedly making derogatory comments about Africa. During his public remarks with Buhari, Trump focused mostly on common goals and shared interests, such as fighting terrorism and expanding trade. \\"We love helicopters — he loves them more than I do,\\" joked Trump, referring to his administration's decision to approve a 600 million military sales deal to Nigeria. Buhari thanked Trump for approving the deal, which the administration of former President Barack Obama had suspended over allegations of human rights abuses. \\"I worked it out so that now you can buy the helicopters that you want,\\" Trump said, adding, \\"We make the best military equipment in the world, and our friends can now buy it.\\" Human rights groups have accused the Nigerian military of torture, rape and extrajudicial killing in its almost decade-long campaign against the Boko Haram extremist group. Tens of thousands of people have been killed in the insurgency, and hundreds of schoolgirls kidnapped, as the group gained notoriety and spread to neighboring countries, posing one of the most severe threats to West Africa's Sahel region in recent years. Although Nigeria has been a major partner in the U.S. fight against Islamist extremists in Africa, relations have faced challenges over the past year. In January, Nigeria joined a list of outraged African countries demanding an explanation from the U.S. ambassador after Trump's reported vulgar comments referring to African countries. Asked whether those comments came up during his private meeting with Trump, Buhari declined to comment. \\"I'm very careful with what the press says about other than myself. I'm not sure about, you know, the validity or whether that allegation was true or not. So, the best thing for me is to keep quiet,\\" Buhari said.

Question: Background: Once again, a mutation is the change in the DNA or RNA sequence. In multicellular organisms, mutations can be subdivided into germline mutations and somatic mutations. Germline mutations occur in the DNA of sex cells, or gametes, and are therefore potentially very serious. These mutations can be passed to the next generation. If the zygote contains the mutation, every cell in the resulting organism will have that mutation. If the mutation results in a disease phenotype, the mutation causes what is called a hereditary disease. Somatic mutations , which occur in somatic, or body, cells, cannot be passed to the next generation (offspring). Mutations present in a somatic cell of an organism will be present (by DNA replication and mitosis) in all descendants of that cell. If the mutation is present in a gene that is not used in that cell type, the mutation may have no effect. On the other hand, the mutation may lead to a serious medical condition such as cancer. Paragraph: The specialists studied two groups of larvae. Group L displayed all kinds of mutations while group D didn't. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which group of larvae had more somatic mutations? Answer:","completion":"Group L had more somatic mutations. Since the paragraph states that Group L displayed all kinds of mutations, it implies that it includes somatic mutations as well.

The two teams traded field goals in the first quarter, with a 32-yarder by Broncos' placekicker Matt Prater and a 45-yarder by Texans' placekicker Randy Bullock. The Broncos grabbed the lead early in the second quarter, with a 36-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Peyton Manning to wide receiver Demaryius Thomas.

Q:A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the last name of the part owner of the brand that made decisions by consensus that got a A20 million payout when he left?, using the article: Despite Anthony Field's expressed dislike of the term, preferring to refer to it as \\"preserving the good name of The Wiggles\\", the group has stressed the importance of their brand and were protective of it. They remained as independent as possible, and retained full creative control and ownership of every aspect of their business. As Field stated, The Wiggles Pty Ltd was \\"not your regular 'corporate culture'\\". They made decisions by consensus and made business decisions based upon their experience as performers and their knowledge of early childhood education. They made careful decisions regarding their endorsements of toys and other products, and avoided over-extending their brand by only licensing products that correlated with their image. They had high expectations regarding the behaviour and attitude of everyone associated with the group.The Wiggles became formally consolidated in 2005. The group's board of directors consisted of the original three members, Paul Field, who has been general manager of operations since the group was formed and their manager since the mid-1990s, and Mike Conway, who had worked for Ernst & Young in England and become their general manager in 2001. In 2009, the Australian rock band AC/DC knocked The Wiggles, who earned A45 million, from the top of Business Review Weekly's (BRW) list of top entertainment earners for the first time in four years. In 2011, the worldwide recession hit The Wiggles, as it had done for many Australian entertainers; they earned A28 million, but they still appeared second on the BRW's list that year. By 2012, founding members Anthony Field, Cook, and Fatt retained 30% ownership of their brand, and Paul Field and Conway each owned 5%.

What is the evolutionary significance of marketing and how has it changed modern society? Choose your answer. Are these two questions paraphrases of each other? Available options: [A]. no [B]. yes","completion":"[A]. no These two questions are not paraphrases of each other because they are asking about different things. First, let's understand each question: 1. What is the evolutionary significance of communism and how has it changed modern society? Communism is an idea about how people should organize themselves and share things. Imagine if everyone in your neighborhood shared their toys with each other, so no one had to worry about not having enough to play with. That's a bit like communism. The evolutionary significance of communism is about why people came up with this idea and how it might help them work together better. Communism has changed modern society in many ways, with some people thinking it's a good way to share and others thinking it's not fair. 2. What is the evolutionary significance of marketing and how has it changed modern society? Marketing is when people try to show others that their products, like toys or snacks, are the best and get people to buy them. The evolutionary significance of marketing is about why people started to do this and how it might help them find more customers. Marketing has changed modern society a lot, as we see advertisements everywhere, and it helps us know about new things that we might like. So, these two questions are different because one talks about communism, an idea for sharing, while the other talks about marketing, a way to show off products."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Choose the most suitable option to answer the above question. Options: - headache - fresh - constipated - confusion - boredom A:","completion":"Confusion and boredom are the most suitable options to answer the question about what children feel when going to the opera. Let us explain these options in detail. Confusion: Children attending an opera performance may feel confused because they are entering a new environment with which they are not familiar. Operas are typically presented in ornate and grandiose venues, which can be overwhelming for a child. In addition, the language of the opera performances may be foreign to them, and they may not understand the complex storylines, especially if the opera is in a language other than English or their native tongue. Furthermore, operatic singing is stylistically different from the music children are exposed to in their everyday lives, which could lead to confusion about the purpose and enjoyment of this art form. Operatic performances often involve elaborate costumes, makeup, and stage design, which may be difficult for children to comprehend. Since children often have shorter attention spans, the length of the performance can contribute to their confusion and frustration, not being able to follow the story consistently. Boredom: Children who attend an opera may also experience boredom due to various reasons. As mentioned earlier, the length of an opera performance can be a significant factor. Operas often extend for hours with intricate, nuanced performances that require the audience to focus intently for long periods. Children, especially younger ones, may not have the patience or attention span to appreciate the performance without growing bored or restless. Moreover, operas often deal with themes and stories that are not tailored to a young audience, addressing topics such as romance, tragedy, and complex human relationships. The storytelling might be more abstract or mature in nature, which may not hold the attention of children who prefer simpler storylines and more engaging, animated characters. While some children exposed to operatic performances may enjoy the music, acting, and overall experience, others will find it challenging to decode the art form in a meaningful way. Consequently, the combination of complex stories, long runtimes, unfamiliar musical styles, and cultural differences can lead to confusion and boredom during their experience at the opera. Still, it is essential to remember that not all children will react in the same way to experiencing an opera. Some may find the experience educational, enriching, and genuinely enjoyable. These feelings can depend on factors such as the child's prior exposure to classical music and theater or their general interest in artistic experiences. Nonetheless, addressing confusion and boredom seems to be the most suitable options to answer the question considering the variables involved."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

When Russia invaded the Turkish Balkans in 1853, fears of Russian dominance in the Mediterranean and Middle East led Britain and France to invade the Crimean Peninsula to destroy Russian naval capabilities. The ensuing Crimean War (1854–56), which involved new techniques of modern warfare, and was the only global war fought between Britain and another imperial power during the Pax Britannica, was a resounding defeat for Russia. The situation remained unresolved in Central Asia for two more decades, with Britain annexing Baluchistan in 1876 and Russia annexing Kirghizia, Kazakhstan, and Turkmenistan.

Rowling's series of Harry Potter novels. Voldemort first appeared in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, which was released in 1997. Voldemort appears either in person or in flashbacks in each book and its film adaptation in the series, except the third, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, where he is only mentioned. Voldemort is the archenemy of Harry Potter, who according to a prophecy has \\"the power to vanquish the Dark Lord\\". Context: Voldemort does not appear in Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, although his presence and actions are felt: he once again declares war, and begins to rise to power once more. He murders Amelia Bones of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, and begins to target members of the Order of the Phoenix, including Emmeline Vance. Rowling uses several chapters as exposition to establish Voldemort's backstory. In a series of flashbacks, using the pensieve as a plot device, she reveals that Voldemort was the son of the witch Merope Gaunt and a Muggle called Tom Riddle. Riddle abandoned Merope before their child's birth, soon after which Merope died, just hours after giving birth. After living in an orphanage, young Riddle met Dumbledore, who told him he was a wizard and arranged for him to attend Hogwarts. Riddle was outwardly a model student, but was in reality a psychopath who takes sadistic pleasure in using his powers to harm and control people. He eventually murdered his father and grandparents as revenge for abandoning him. The book also discusses Riddle's hatred of \\"Muggles\\", his obsession with Horcruxes, and his desire to split his soul to achieve immortality. Rowling stated Voldemort's conception under the influence of a love potion symbolises the prejudicial circumstances under which he was brought into the world. In the main plot of the book, Voldemort's next step is to engineer an assault on Hogwarts, and to attack Dumbledore. This is accomplished by Draco Malfoy, who arranges transportation of Death Eaters into Hogwarts by a pair of Vanishing Cabinets, which bypass the extensive protective enchantments placed around the school. The cabinets allow Voldemort's Death Eaters to enter Hogwarts, where battle commences and Dumbledore is cornered. Hogwarts professor (and re-doubled agent) Severus Snape uses the Killing Curse against Dumbledore when Draco could not force himself to do so. Question: Who was he the son of?. Whats the answer?","completion":"Lord Voldemort, born as Tom Marvolo Riddle, was the son of a witch named Merope Gaunt and a Muggle named Tom Riddle Sr. Merope Gaunt was a descendant of Salazar Slytherin, one of the four founders of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.

Please briefly summarize this news article: CRISIS IS EXPECTED TO AID TORIES IN LOCAL ELECTIONS LONDON, May 5— The battle for the Falkland Islands is expected to help Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's Conservative Party in Thursday's local elections and thus strengthen her hand. Before Argentina seized the islands April 2, many politicians thought the Tories would take a drubbing, largely because of high unemployment and slow economic recovery. But the fighting in the South Atlantic, with Mrs. Thatcher portrayed as the avenger of the initial humiliation, seems to have pushed the economy to the back of most voters' minds. ''She, and by extension her party, are thoroughly wrapped in the Union Jack,'' said a disgruntled campaigner for the opposition Labor Party. ''At a moment when our fleet is under attack, when servicemen are dying, that is an electoral asset quite beyond compare.'' But it is likely to be the new Social Democratic Party, not Labor, that suffers most at the ballot box. Having scored a series of byelection successes, the Social Democrats had hoped that Thursday's test would demonstrate once and for all that they were a serious third force. Party's Standing Is Slipping Now the party's standing is slipping. At the moment, it stands at 25 percent, down from 40 percent last year. At that level, the Social Democrats can expect to finish second in many races but to win relatively few. Ever since it was launched, the new party has sought to maintain momentum and publicity in the press. The crisis has robbed it of attention and a disappointing showing on Thursday could halt its momentum. One problem has been that the Social Democrats' credibility depended in part on the two major parties' seeming ineptness. The Falkland crisis has made the Tories more popular, and it has masked Labor's divisions. A second difficulty is that much Social Democratic support comes from what are described as the ''concerned'' middle classes, who consider themselves ''the thinking part of the population as opposed to those who obey the atavistic appeals of traditionalism.'' The public mood appears volatile, though it does not seem to have turned against Mrs. Thatcher because of the loss of the destroyer Sheffield. In the long term, Conservative fortunes are linked to a resolution of the crisis, and Labor unity is unlikely to last for long. So the expected setback for the Social Democrats and their Liberal allies could prove to be transitory. Nevertheless, the Social Democrats are worried. William Rodgers, one of the four leaders of the party, said over the weekend that it would not do well, and Roy Jenkins, another leader, has been trying to turn voters' attention away from the Falklands. ''It would be ridiculous,'' he said on Monday, ''for people to elect a council for the next four years on the basis of what they think of the Government's handling of the Falklands crisis at the present time.'' But that is what many voters seem prepared to do. An opinion poll in 20 London boroughs showed, for example, that 24 percent of potential Tory voters considered the crisis either the most important issue or an important factor in the election. The poll showed the Conservatives with 40 percent of the vote, Labor with 34 percent and the Social Democratic-Liberal alliance with 25. A total of 4,800 seats are being contested in the 32 London boroughs, the 36 English metropolitan areas outside London, 103 rural districts in England and 12 regional authorities in Scotland. The Social Democrats have put up 2,300 candidates, slightly fewer than their Liberal allies. At one point, alliance strategists talked of winning 1,500 seats, but their latest forecasts, based on the polls and on canvassing returns, are running at about 600, with about 400 Liberals and 200 Social Democrats. That would be viewed as a considerable accomplishment in political circles but not as the kind of breakthrough the alliance sought. Mrs. Thatcher, on the other hand, will no doubt claim a victory even if the Tory vote is off slightly from that in the last local balloting four years ago. The party in power at Westminster almost always does badly in local elections that come around the midpoint of its term, as these will do. Two more tests for the Prime Minister are also due in the next month, when the outcome of the Falkland dispute may be clearer. Parliamentary by-elections are set for Beaconsfield, a strong Tory seat in the prosperous suburbs west of London, on May 27, and for Mitcham and Morden, a marginal Labor seat in South London, on June 3. The Conservatives had been worried about Beaconsfield, whose Member of Parliament, Sir Ronald Bell, died in March, but they are less anxious as a result of the crisis. ''Suburbia,'' said a Tory tactician, ''is rallying to the flag.'' At Mitcham and Morden, the incumbent, Bruce Douglas-Mann, has switched to the Social Democrats.

James Salt Summary:","completion":"The Falkland Islands crisis is expected to have a positive impact on Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's Conservative Party in the local elections, as she is portrayed as the avenger of the initial humiliation. The Social Democratic Party, which had been gaining popularity, is likely to suffer at the polls due to the crisis. Before the Argentine seizure of the islands, high unemployment and slow economic recovery were major concerns for voters, but these issues have been pushed aside due to the ongoing conflict. Consequently, the Social Democratic Party's standing has slipped from 40% last year to 25%, which could ultimately hinder its momentum."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Libyan Rebels Report Gains in Misrata Fighting TRIPOLI, Libya -- Rebels battled Muammar Qaddafi's troops Thursday for control of central Misrata, driving dozens of snipers from tall buildings in hours of urban warfare and gaining a tactical advantage in the only major city held by the opposition in western Libya, witnesses said. The Libyan government, meanwhile, ramped up its rhetoric against NATO, warning that \\"it will be hell\\" for the alliance if it sends in ground troops, even though Britain's prime minister said the Western nations were not moving toward such a deployment. U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates said President Barack Obama has approved the use of armed Predator drones in Libya. The drones allow for low-level precision attacks and are uniquely suited for urban areas such as Misrata, where NATO airpower has been unable to protect civilians when Qaddafi's forces are operating inside the city. Also Thursday, rebels captured a Libyan border crossing into Tunisia, forcing government soldiers to flee over the frontier and possibly opening a new channel for opposition forces in Qaddafi's bastion in western part of the country. At least seven people were killed in Thursday's fighting for the main Misrata thoroughfare of Tripoli Street, bringing to 20 the number slain in three days in Libya's third-largest city. Misrata has been besieged by government forces for nearly two months, with human rights groups estimating hundreds of people killed. Tripoli Street is the site where two Western photojournalists were killed Wednesday as the rebels tried to dislodge the snipers loyal to Qaddafi perched on rooftops. The street, which stretches from the heart of Misrata to a major highway southwest of the city of 300,000 people, has become a front line for the rebels and Qaddafi's forces. The rebels took over several buildings along parts of the street, enabling them to cut off supplies to a Qaddafi unit and dozens of rooftop snipers who have terrorized civilians and kept them trapped in their homes, said a doctor who identified himself only as Ayman for fear of retaliation. \\"This battle cost us lots of blood and martyrs,\\" the doctor said. Residents celebrated and chanted \\"God is great\\" after the snipers left a battle-scarred insurance building that is the highest point in central Misrata, according to a witness who identified himself only as Sohaib. \\"Thanks to God, the snipers fled, leaving nothing behind at the insurance building after they were cut off from supplies -- ammunition, food and water -- for days,\\" added another resident, Abdel Salam. He called it \\"a major victory\\" because the structure gave the pro-Qaddafi forces a commanding view of the city. In Tripoli, government spokesman Moussa Ibrahim claimed Qaddafi forces control more than 80 percent of the city and the rebels hold \\"the seaport and the area surrounding it.\\" Residents said that at the beginning of the battle for Misrata, the government deployed tanks and shelled the city indiscriminately, forcing residents to flee their homes and businesses, which were taken over by Qaddafi's forces. NATO commanders have admitted their airpower was limited in being able to protect civilians in cities like Misrata, which was the main mission of the international air campaign. Abdel Salam, who asked to be identified only by his given name for fear of retribution, said Qaddafi's forces were using tanks and rocket-propelled grenades. \\"Col. Qaddafi's troops continue their vicious attacks, including the siege of Misrata,\\" Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton said in Washington. \\"There are even reports that Qaddafi forces may have used cluster bombs against their own people.\\" Libyan officials have persistently denied the use of cluster bombs, which indiscriminately spray small bomblets over a wide area and are particularly lethal in residential areas. However, Human Rights Watch has said it found evidence of cluster bombs being used by government forces in Misrata. Earlier this week, Britain, Italy and France said they were sending military officers to advise the rebels, prompting speculation that this was a step toward sending in ground forces at a time when NATO airstrikes were failing to break the battlefield stalemate or protect civilians in Misrata. Ibrahim, the government spokesman, warned that NATO would find itself entangled in fighting ordinary Libyans if its soldiers were to set foot on Libyan soil. \\"We are arming the whole population, not to fight the rebels, by the way, because the rebels are very easy -- they are not a challenge for us,\\" Ibrahim said. \\"What we are fighting is NATO now.\\" Ibrahim said the Qaddafi regime is ready to observe an immediate cease-fire and negotiate the terms of political transition. Rebels have said Qaddafi must step down before such talks can begin. \\"We are ready and accepting peace ... but we are also ready for war,\\" Ibrahim said. \\"If NATO comes, it will be hell.\\" But British Prime Minister David Cameron insisted NATO isn't edging toward deploying ground troops in Libya. Italy, France and Britain are sending experienced combat advisers to help train and organize Libya's opposition forces dislodge Qaddafi after four decades in power. Ministers have insisted the officers won't play any role in offensives against Qaddafi's troops -- and have repeatedly said NATO and allies won't overstep boundaries set out in the United Nations resolution authorizing action in Libya. \\"We're not allowed, rightly, to have an invading army, or an occupying army,\\" Cameron told BBC Scotland radio. \\"That's not what we want, that's not what the Libyans want, that's not what the world wants.\\" The capture of the border crossing with Tunisia in western Libya followed three days of intense fighting outside the desert town of Nalut, about 140 miles (240 kilometers) southwest of Tripoli, said a rebel leader, Shaban Abu Sitta. The area was briefly in hands of anti-government forces last month before Libyan troops moved in. Holding the Dhuheiba border crossing could open important supply routes for anti-Qaddafi forces and give the rebels another foothold in western Libya. After taking control of the crossing early Thursday, rebels raised the pre-Qaddafi tricolor flag. In recent weeks, more than 10,000 Libyans from the border region had crossed into Tunisia, and 1,200 found shelter in a tent camp near the village of Dhuheiba, a few miles from the border. When people in the camp learned of the takeover of the crossing, they chanted, \\"The rebels brought freedom to their town.\\" By afternoon, hundreds of Libyan refugees had assembled at the crossing, waiting to return home. Also Thursday, the Greek passenger ferry Ionian Spirit carried more than 1,000 people fleeing Misrata to the rebel stronghold of Benghazi in eastern Libya, where 30 ambulances were waiting. The ship's passengers included dozens of wounded and shell-shocked Libyans, hundreds of migrant workers from Africa, as well as smaller groups from Pakistan, Nigeria and the Philippines. Four of the injured were seriously hurt It also carried the bodies of two photojournalists killed in Misrata on Wednesday: Chris Hondros, a New York-based photographer for Getty Images, and British-born Tim Hetherington, co-director of the 2010 Afghanistan war documentary \\"Restrepo\\" that was nominated for an Academy Award. Also aboard was the body of a Ukrainian doctor who was killed by an artillery blast in Misrata. Several banners were hung to greet the ferry. One said: \\"U.K. and U.S., your blood was mixed with ours in Misrata.\\" Summary:","completion":"Libyan rebels made significant gains in Misrata, driving out snipers from tall buildings and gaining a tactical advantage in the only major city they hold in western Libya.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. how much longer will financial hardships that affect billions of lives last? Write the above sentence using proper case.","completion":"How long will financial hardships that affect billions of lives persist? The persistence of financial hardships that influence billions of lives is a complex issue and it is not possible to predict an exact timeframe for its resolution. There are several factors that contribute to this concerning situation, such as economic inequalities, political decisions, global crises, social support systems, technological advancements, and individual circumstances. For a more elaborate understanding, let us dissect these factors and their relevant impacts: 1. Economic Inequalities: The wealth gap between the richest and poorest sectors of society has increased significantly over the years, making it more difficult for those in lower socioeconomic strata to break out of their financial hardships. To lessen economic inequalities, governments must focus on policy decisions that address the root causes of wealth distribution disparities, such as an improved tax structure, provision of quality education, and job opportunities for all. 2. Political Decisions: Political decisions play a crucial role in shaping the economy of a country. Policies that facilitate job growth, promote fair wages, enable easy access to credit, and support small businesses can lessen the financial burden on the economically disadvantaged. Transparent and efficient governance systems are vital for equitable distribution of resources. 3. Global Crises: Events such as recessions, pandemics, natural disasters, and geopolitical tensions can result in job losses, inflation, reduced investments, and declining economic growth, which in turn exacerbate financial hardships for the general populace. Addressing these crises requires international cooperation, sound decision-making by governments, and effective adaptation strategies. 4. Social Support Systems: Robust social support systems, including healthcare, education, and social welfare programs, can go a long way in mitigating financial hardships experienced by vulnerable populations. Governments need to prioritize establishing and maintaining these support systems to lessen the burden on those who are less fortunate. 5. Technological Advancements: While technological progress can create new job opportunities and increase productivity, it can also lead to job displacement and reduced demand for certain skill sets. Governments and industries must work together to design and implement re-skilling and up-skilling programs, ensuring everyone has a chance to participate in the evolving job market. 6. Individual Circumstances: Factors such as personal choices, family background, education, and individual capabilities can all impact financial well-being. Empowering individuals to make informed decisions about their finances, such as budgeting wisely, investing in education, and selecting appropriate career paths, is instrumental in overcoming financial hardships. The persistence and eventual resolution of financial hardships that affect billions of lives depend on how effectively these factors are managed on a global scale. It involves collective efforts by governments, private sectors, nonprofit organizations, and individuals alike. Only when all stakeholders come together to address the root causes and implement effective solutions can we expect a meaningful reduction in financial hardships that affect such a large portion of the world's population."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer this question: Which fictional hero, created by Baroness Orczy, takes his name from the small red flower with which he signs his messages?","completion":"The fictional hero you are referring to, who was created by Baroness Emma Orczy, is Sir Percy Blakeney, also known as \\"The Scarlet Pimpernel.\\" The character first appeared in the play \\"The Scarlet Pimpernel,\\" written by Orczy and her husband, Montague MacLean Barstow, in 1903. The play's success led to a novel of the same name, published in 1905, which further popularized the character and spawned multiple sequels, adaptations, and spin-offs. The Scarlet Pimpernel takes his name from the small red flower, the pimpernel (Anagallis arvensis), which he uses to sign messages and leave as a signature at the scene of his daring escapades. This flower has a rich symbolism and adds to the overall mystique and enigmatic nature of the character. Sir Percy Blakeney, an English baronet, leads a double life in the story. On the surface, he is a rich, fashionable, and foppish aristocrat, known for his extravagant lifestyle and lack of intellectual prowess. However, his true identity is the elusive and ingenious Scarlet Pimpernel, a master of disguise and cunning who rescues French aristocrats from the clutches of the revolutionary French government during the Reign of Terror. As the Scarlet Pimpernel, Sir Percy operates secretly and uses his considerable wit, intelligence, and skills to outsmart the authorities and organize a network of dedicated followers, called the \\"League of the Scarlet Pimpernel.\\" This brave and resourceful group works tirelessly to save innocent lives from the guillotine, risking their own in the process. Sir Percy's arch-nemesis, Chauvelin, is an agent of the French government and the primary antagonist in the series. He relentlessly pursues the identity of the Scarlet Pimpernel, often coming close to catching him but ultimately falling prey to the hero's clever ruses. The character of the Scarlet Pimpernel is considered one of the earliest influences on the modern superhero genre. His dual identity, elaborate disguises, and feats of physical prowess and cunning are reminiscent of many characters that followed, including Zorro, Batman, and others. Throughout the numerous books, plays, and adaptations, the legend of the Scarlet Pimpernel has continued to capture the imagination of audiences worldwide. Baroness Orczy's creation has stood the test of time and serves as a powerful reminder of the importance of courage, heroism, and self-sacrifice in the face of tyranny and oppression."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Let me explain in detail why the correct choice is \\"win game.\\" Monopoly is a game of property buying, trading, and developing, wherein players roll dice to move around the game board, aiming to acquire and improve properties. The central goal of the game involves dominating the property market and driving opponents to bankruptcy. As such, the game draws to a close when one person has managed to achieve the following: 1. Acquire a majority of the properties, utilities, and/or railroads. 2. Develop these properties by building houses and hotels, which increases the rent that opponents are required to pay when landing on these spaces. 3. Strategically negotiate trades and deals with other players to further expand their property empire. 4. Forcing opponents to spend their in-game money to pay rent, fines, and other in-game costs until they have no funds or assets left to continue. Considering these requirements, \\"win game\\" is the most accurate choice that reflects how Monopoly concludes. The remaining possibilities, like \\"makes feel happy,\\" \\"the timer stops,\\" \\"have fun,\\" and \\"enjoy yourself,\\" don't correctly address the game's primary objective. Furthermore, these other options either refer to the emotional experience associated with playing a game or imply the existence of a timer, which Monopoly does not utilize. While having a good time and enjoying oneself are often encouraged when playing a game, these sentiments do not indicate the official end of Monopoly. Similarly, the presence of a timer or the stopping of time have no bearing on this particular game's conclusion. To summarize, in Monopoly, the game is over when one player has accumulated and maintained a significant advantage over the other players, effectively driving them to bankruptcy and securing their position as the game's winner. As such, the most appropriate answer to the question is \\"win game.\\" This choice reflects the primary goal of Monopoly and provides a more accurate depiction of how the game reaches its conclusion when compared to the other provided options."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Title: The Addams Family Movie plot: Gomez Addams laments the 25-year absence of his brother Fester, who disappeared after the two had a falling-out. Gomez's lawyer Tully Alford owes money to loan shark Abigail Craven, and notices that her son Gordon closely resembles Fester. Tully proposes that Gordon pose as Fester to infiltrate the Addams household and find the hidden vault where they keep their vast riches. Tully and his wife Margaret attend a sÃ©ance at the Addams home led by Grandmama in which the family tries to contact Fester's spirit. Gordon arrives, posing as Fester, while Abigail poses as psychiatrist Dr. Pinder-Schloss and tells the family that Fester had been lost in the Bermuda Triangle for the past 25 years. Gomez, overjoyed to have Fester back, takes him to the family vault to view home movies from their childhood. Gordon learns the reason for the brothers' falling-out: Gomez was jealous of Fester's success with women, and wooed the conjoined twins Flora and Fauna Amor away from him out of envy. Gomez starts to suspect that \\"Fester\\" is an impostor when he is unable to recall important details about their past. Gordon attempts to return to the vault, but is unable to get past a booby trap. Gomez's wife Morticia reminds \\"Fester\\" of the importance of family amongst the Addamses and of their vengeance against those who cross them. Fearing that the family is getting wise to their con, Abigail (under the guise of Dr. Pinder-Schloss) convinces Gomez that his suspicions are due to displacement.

Here's a question and a few possible answers: Q: I'm getting warm because I increased the thermostat in my bedroom. What might I be doing soon? Possible A: feeling comfortable, overheat, increase of temperature, pleasure, starting fire Why is \\"feeling comfortable\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? A:","completion":"The answer \\"feeling comfortable\\" is aligned with human common sense for various reasons. Firstly, the primary purpose of adjusting a thermostat is to control the temperature of a particular environment, such as a room, to a level that is comfortable for the occupants. The mechanism works by adjusting the temperature as needed within a home's heating system to maintain a consistent ambient temperature. This core function of maintaining a comfortable environment leans into the realm of human common sense; when a person feels chilly, they tend to increase the temperature to feel more comfortable. Secondly, \\"feeling comfortable\\" is an interpretation of a physical status that most people can perceive. Human common sense is built upon everyday experiences and shared understanding. The experience of adjusting a thermostat to alleviate discomfort from cold is quite common and could be well-understood by others. People universally seek comfort, and one's level of comfort can often be influenced by the surrounding temperature. Thirdly, the act of increasing the thermostat setting indicates an intention to alter the current environment, presumably for the better. If a person is getting warm because they've increased the thermostat in their bedroom, it's a sound assumption that they were previously feeling cool or uncomfortable due to lower temperature. Thus, their adjustment of the thermostat can be seen as an effort to rectify this discomfort, leading to the assumption they might soon be feeling comfortable. Lastly, \\"feeling comfortable\\" is related to personal well-being and satisfaction. The ability to control one's environment to enhance comfort is a fundamental aspect of human behavior — it is quite common to adjust factors within our control to achieve a sense of comfort and satisfaction. Thus, deriving the answer \\"feeling comfortable\\" from the scenario aligns with human common sense because it takes into account basic human needs, common experiences, and the logical steps people often take to satisfy their comfort requirements. This shared understanding and predictability of actions and outcomes in familiar scenarios lie at the heart of what we consider to be 'common sense.'"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer this question: Which writer created the the character Walter Mitty?","completion":"Walter Mitty, a fictional character, was created by the celebrated American author James Thurber. James Grover Thurber was born on December 8, 1894, in Columbus, Ohio, and he passed away on November 2, 1961. Thurber was an influential humorist, cartoonist, and author of short stories, essays, and plays. His work was widely celebrated for its wit and satire, often commenting on the human condition and presenting ordinary individuals in humorous and absurd situations. Walter Mitty first appeared in a short story titled \\"The Secret Life of Walter Mitty,\\" which was published in The New Yorker magazine on March 18, 1939. The story revolves around the protagonist, Walter Mitty, who often escapes his mundane and unexciting existence by immersing himself in vivid daydreams. These fantasies see him undertaking various heroic and adventurous roles, such as a daring pilot, a skilled surgeon, or a fearless soldier. Mitty's vivid imagination serves as an escape from the real world, where he is often belittled and controlled by his overbearing spouse. The character of Walter Mitty struck a chord with readers and became an iconic symbol of individuals struggling with the uneventful routine of their lives. The popularity of the character led to the coining of the term \\"Mittyesque,\\" which refers to someone indulging in grandiose daydreams to compensate for their unassertive and unremarkable life. The story has been adapted into various formats over the years, including stage productions, radio plays, and films. The most well-known adaptation is the 1947 film, \\"The Secret Life of Walter Mitty,\\" starring Danny Kaye, and the 2013 film of the same name, featuring Ben Stiller. James Thurber was renowned for his unique storytelling and illustration style, which made him one of the most prominent humorists of his time. His other notable works include \\"My Life and Hard Times\\" (1933), \\"The Middle-Aged Man on the Flying Trapeze\\" (1935), and \\"The White Deer\\" (1945). Thurber's writing and cartoons have left an indelible mark on American humor, and his influence can still be seen in today's literature, comic strips, and television programs. The enduring popularity of the character Walter Mitty is a testament to Thurber's imagination, wit, and profound observations of human nature."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Hold on to your shopping carts: There is no perfect diet for human beings. At least not one that's based on how much protein, fat or carbohydrates you eat. People have lived and thrived on high-protein, high-fat diets (the Inuit of Greenland); on low-protein, high-carb diets (the indigenous peoples of southern Africa); on diets high in raw milk and cream (the people of the Loetschental Valley in Switzerland); diets high in saturated fat (the Trobriand Islanders) and even on diets in which animal blood is considered a staple (the Massai of Kenya and Tanzania). And folks have thrived on these diets without the ravages of degenerative diseases that are so epidemic in modern life--heart disease, diabetes, obesity, neurodegenerative diseases, osteoporosis and cancer. In Depth: The Healthiest Foods On Earth The only thing these diets have in common is that they're all based on whole foods with minimum processing. Nuts, berries, beans, raw milk, grass-fed meat. Whole, real, unprocessed food is almost always healthy, regardless of how many grams of carbs, protein or fat it contains. All these healthy diets have in common the fact that they are absent foods with bar codes. They are also extremely low in sugar. In fact, the number of modern or ancient societies known for health and longevity that have consumed a diet high in sugar would be ... let's see ... zero. Truth be told, what you eat probably matters less than how much processing it's undergone. Real food--whole food with minimal processing--contains a virtual pharmacy of nutrients, phytochemicals, enzymes, vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, anti-inflammatories and healthful fats, and can easily keep you alive and thriving into your 10th decade. Berries, for example, are phenomenally low in calories, high in fiber and loaded with plant compounds that improve memory and help fight cancer. Studies have consistently shown that nut-eaters have lower rates of heart disease. Beans are notorious for their high fiber content and are a part of the diet of people--from almost every corner of the globe--who live long and well. Protein--the word comes from a Greek word meaning \\"of prime importance\\"--is a feature of every healthy diet ever studied. Meat , contrary to its terrible reputation, can be a health food if--and this is a big if--the meat comes from animals that have been raised on pasture land, have never seen the inside of a feedlot farm and have never been shot full of antibiotics and hormones. Ditto for raw milk, generally believed to be one of the healthiest beverages on the planet by countless devotees who often go to great expense and inconvenience to obtain it from small, sustainable farms. Wild salmon, whose omega-3 content is consistently higher than its less-fortunate farm-raised brethren, gets its red color from a powerful antioxidant called astaxathin. The combination of protein, omega-3s and antioxidants makes wild salmon a contender for anyone's list of great foods. Another great food: eggs--one of nature's most perfect creations, especially if you don't throw out the all-important yolk. (Remember \\"whole\\" foods means exactly that--foods in their original form. Our robust ancestors did not eat \\"low-fat\\" caribou; we don't need to eat \\"egg-white\\" omelets.) There are really no \\"bad\\" vegetables, but some of them are superstars. Any vegetable from the Brassica genus--broccoli, cabbage, brussels sprouts, kale--is loaded with plant chemicals called indoles, which help reduce the risk of cancer. In the fruit kingdom, apples totally deserve their reputation as doctor-repellants: they're loaded with fiber, minerals (like bone-building boron) and phytochemicals (like quercetin, which is known to be a powerful anti-inflammatory and to have anti-cancer properties). Some exciting new research suggests that pomegranate juice slows the progression of certain cancers. Other research shows it lowers blood pressure and may even act as a \\"natural Viagra.\\" Tea deserves special mention on any list of the world's healthiest foods. The second most widely consumed beverage in the world (after water), all forms of tea (black, oolong, white, green and the newer Yerba Matte) are loaded with antioxidants and anti-inflammatories. Some types (green tea, for example) contain plant chemicals called catechins which have decided anti-cancer activity Finally, let's not forget members of the Alliaceae family of plants--onions, garlic and shallots. Garlic has been used for thousands of years for its medicinal properties; hundreds of published studies support its antimicrobial effects as well as its ability to lower the risk of heart disease. A number of studies have shown an inverse relationship between onion consumption and certain types of cancer. A healthy diet doesn't have to contain every one of the \\"healthiest foods on earth,\\" but you can't go wrong putting as many of the above mentioned foods in heavy rotation on your personal eating plan. Jonny Bowden, Ph.D., CNS, is a board-certified nutritionist and the author of seven books on health and nutrition, including The 150 Most Effective Ways to Boost Your Energy and The 150 Healthiest Foods on Earth. What is a short summary of the above article?","completion":"The best diet for humans is one with whole, real, and unprocessed foods, which have lots of nutrients. Some great food examples include berries, nuts, beans, grass-fed meat, raw milk, wild salmon, and eggs. There are no perfect diets, but people can be healthy with different diets as long as they have whole foods and very little sugar. Vegetables, fruits, and tea are also very healthy. So remember, eating a variety of real and natural foods without too much processing is the key to a healthy diet!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Movie plot: Louise (Danielle Darrieux) is an aristocratic woman of Belle Ãpoque Paris, married to AndrÃ© (Charles Boyer), both a count and a high-ranking French army general. Louise is a beautiful, but spoiled and superficial, woman who has amassed debts due to her lifestyle. She arranges to secretly sell her costly heart-shaped diamond earrings, a wedding present from her husband, to the original jeweler, Mr RÃ©my (Jean Debucourt). Relations between Louise and AndrÃ© are companionable, but they sleep in separate beds, have no children, and AndrÃ© has a secret mistress, of whom he has recently tired. Louise disguises the disappearance of the earrings by pretending to have lost them at the opera. The search for them eventually reaches the newspapers (\\"Theft at the Theatre\\") which in turn prompts RÃ©my to go to AndrÃ© and \\"discreetly\\" offer to sell them back. He accepts cheerfully and, rather than confront his wife, coolly gifts the earrings to his mistress, Lola (Lia Di Leo), whom he happens to be seeing off permanently to Constantinople. At her destination, however, Lola soon sells the earrings herself to settle gambling debts and they are later purchased by an Italian baron, Fabrizio Donati (Vittorio De Sica), who is on his way to a high diplomatic post in Paris. Through a series of encounters, Donati becomes infatuated with Louise, later dancing with her long into the night at a ball. AndrÃ©'s long absence \\"on maneuvers\\" facilitates the couple's affair. With each passage of time, the Baron asks Louise if she has heard from her husband. AndrÃ©'s return prompts Louise to stop seeing Donati, but during a hunting excursion where all three are present, she witnesses Donati fall from his horse and faints. She is said to have a \\"weak heart,\\" but AndrÃ© sees this behavior as an affectation, and the event makes him suspicious.

Process: - Place the water in a pot - Cover the pot with a slightly too large cover - Place a larger pot under the first - Heat water to evaporation - Water vapor will collect on the lid - Drip into the second pot as fresh water - Salt is left behind in the original pot. Question: suppose The lid isnt the proper one happens, how will it affect More salt will drip inside the fresh water pot.. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect Answer:","completion":"A: More If the lid isn't the proper one for the pot, it means that the seal between the pot and the lid will not be as tight. This will affect the efficiency of the process and may result in more saltwater droplets entering the fresh water pot. Let's analyze the situation in more detail. By using a slightly too large cover for the pot, there's a higher chance of an imperfect seal between the two surfaces, leading to more gaps or spaces for the steam to escape instead of condensing properly on the lid. As the water is heated and evaporates, the water vapor will rise and come into contact with the lid. Ideally, the water vapor should only condense on the lid and drip into the second pot as fresh water, with the salt being left behind in the original pot. However, when the lid isn't the proper one, the gaps or spaces created might allow some of the saltwater vapor to mix with the condensed fresh water on the lid. Therefore, when the water drips into the second pot, it may contain more dissolved salt than desired, resulting in a higher concentration of salt in the fresh water pot. Moreover, the use of an improper lid could also cause the steam to condense on other parts of the pot or the surrounding kitchen surfaces instead of just on the lid, making the whole process less effective. To summarize, by using a lid that isn't the proper size for the pot, there's a higher risk of more saltwater droplets entering the fresh water pot and causing a higher concentration of salt. The optimal solution to this problem would be to use a lid that fits the pot perfectly in order to create the most efficient system for separating salt from the water."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write some highlights for the following article: A race row has erupted in one of Britain's wealthiest villages after offensive graffiti was plastered on the site of a proposed Sikh school. If the Khalsa Secondary Academy is built it would see more than 1,000 people flock into Stoke Poges, Buckinghamshire, from as far afield as West London. Tension in the village has grown over the past fortnight with angry locals venting their anger online and at parish council meetings. Now one racist hooligan has daubed 'NO P*** SCHOOL' and 'DON'T SELL TO P*** SCHOOL' on a sign at the proposed site. Race row: Someone has daubed this sign on the site of a proposed school with racist language in a village that opposes it. Up for sale: Pioneer House (pictured) is the site in Stoke Poges where developers are hoping to build a 850 place Sikh faith school. Residents in Stoke Poges have condemned the thugs responsible for the graffiti, claiming their objections to the school have nothing to do with race. But they feel the Slough Sikh Education Trust (SSET), which is behind the proposed faith school, could be fuelling rumours it is a race issue by circulating images of the graffiti. Saera Carter, vice chairman of the Stoke Poges Parish Council, said: 'It was discovered at 8:30am in the morning and seven villagers scrubbed it off within the hour. 'As a village we were offended by it. We don't want to offend our Asian neighbours or the SSET as we are a peaceful village. 'Sikhism is a peaceful religion but this is immature and inflammatory behaviour and it wouldn't surprise me if the SSET is turning this into a race issue.' Upset: Campaigners Avtar Singh Brar and Saera Carter from Stoke Poges, who are fighting the plans. Stoke Poges is known for the exclusive Stoke Park estate which featured in the James Bond classic Goldfinger. Recent figures ranked Stoke Poges as having the eighth highest concentration of £1 million properties sold in Britain. It is understood Mr Kandola has also sent the image to Dominic Grieve, the Conservative MP who represents Stoke Poges as part of the Beaconsfield Ward. In touch: Local MP Dominic Grieve is said to have been sent the image of the graffiti. Locals have said their opposition to the school is based on the proposed site - the current UK headquarters for Pioneer - being on greenbelt land. They say Stoke Poges doesn't have the infrastructure to deal with 1,000 people entering the village each day and also fear children will lose their right to free bus travel if the multi-million pound taxpayer-funded school opens on the site. When 222 parents at the village's primary school were asked if they would send their child to the Khalsa Academy, 93.25 per cent said no. The chairman of the Slough Sikh Education Trust yesterday has described the racist graffiti as 'unfortunate'. Nick Kandola said: 'The incident of graffiti at the proposed school site is unfortunate. 'We would much rather things like this weren't happening and, as a Trust, we would prefer to focus on the more important questions of how we can best deliver a new school in this location and serving this community.

They are investigating the disappearance of patient Rachel Solando, who was incarcerated for drowning her three children.

Though they are given access to the hospital, they are told Ward C is off limits, while the lighthouse has already been searched. Whilst being interviewed, one patient secretly writes the word \\"RUN\\" in Daniels' notepad. Daniels starts to have migraine headaches from the hospital's atmosphere and experiences waking visions of his involvement in the Dachau liberation reprisals.

In one instance Chanal tells Daniels that Solando is still on the island somewhere. The same applies to Laeddis who everyone claims was never there to begin with. Daniels later explains to Aule that locating Laeddis was an ulterior personal motive for taking the case. During their investigation Daniels and Aule find that Solando has abruptly resurfaced with no explanation as to her former whereabouts or how she escaped. This prompts Daniels to break into the restricted Ward C. There he encounters George Noyce who is a patient in solitary confinement.

Question: \\"Whose submarines, between the Germans and Soviets, were the Bermuda bases LATER used to look out for?\\" Context: \\"Construction began in 1941 of two airbases consisting of 5.8 km2 (2.2 sq mi) of land, largely reclaimed from the sea. For many years, Bermuda's bases were used by US Air Force transport and refuelling aircraft and by US Navy aircraft patrolling the Atlantic for enemy submarines, first German and, later, Soviet. The principal installation, Kindley Air Force Base on the eastern coast, was transferred to the US Navy in 1970 and redesignated Naval Air Station Bermuda. As a naval air station, the base continued to host both transient and deployed USN and USAF aircraft, as well as transitioning or deployed Royal Air Force and Canadian Forces aircraft.\\" Answer: The answer to this question is:","completion":"The Bermuda bases were later used to look out for Soviet submarines. The construction of the airbases in Bermuda began in 1941, with the primary purpose of serving as strategic locations for the United States Air Force (USAF) and the United States Navy (USN) to monitor and patrol the Atlantic Ocean for enemy submarines. Initially, these bases were crucial in detecting and combating German U-boats during World War II. The predominant focus at the time was on intercepting German submarines, which posed significant threats to the Allied forces and their supply routes across the Atlantic. However, the role of these Bermuda bases changed with time, encompassing new objectives as global political scenarios shifted. After the end of World War II, the world entered into the Cold War era, marked by an intense rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union. In response to this rising threat, the Bermuda bases were repurposed to monitor and counteract Soviet submarine activities in the Atlantic. The presence of Soviet submarines was a significant concern for the US and its allies, as these underwater vessels were crucial components of the Soviet Union's naval forces and could potentially be used for covert missions and nuclear attacks in the event of a conflict. During this time, the principal installation, Kindley Air Force Base, was transferred to the US Navy in 1970 and redesignated Naval Air Station Bermuda. This allowed for greater coordination between the USN and USAF, with both branches working together to patrol the Atlantic Ocean, detect Soviet submarines, and ensure the security of the United States and its allies. The Naval Air Station Bermuda also served as a crucial stopover point for not only US aircraft but also those belonging to the Royal Air Force (United Kingdom) and Canadian Forces, further emphasizing the importance of these Bermuda bases in allied collaboration. In conclusion, while the Bermuda bases were initially built and used for detecting German submarines during World War II, their role later evolved, and they were primarily used to look out for Soviet submarines during the Cold War era. The strategic importance of these bases in safeguarding interests of the United States and its allies in the Atlantic was evident throughout both time periods, highlighting their critical contribution to global security."},{"prompt":"Instructions: In this task, you will be given a list.

Desegregation in Birmingham took place slowly after the demonstrations. King and the SCLC were criticized by some for ending the campaign with promises that were too vague and \\"settling for a lot less than even moderate demands\\". In fact, Sydney Smyer, president of the Birmingham Chamber of Commerce, re-interpreted the terms of the agreement. Shuttlesworth and King had announced that desegregation would take place 90 days from May 15. Smyer then said that a single black clerk hired 90 days from when the new city government took office would be sufficient. By July, most of the city's segregation ordinances had been overturned. Some of the lunch counters in department stores complied with the new rules. City parks and golf courses were opened again to black and white citizens. Mayor Boutwell appointed a biracial committee to discuss further changes. However, no hiring of black clerks, police officers, and firefighters had yet been completed and the Birmingham Bar Association rejected membership by black attorneys.The reputation of Martin Luther King Jr. soared after the protests in Birmingham, and he was lauded by many as a hero. The SCLC was much in demand to effect change in many Southern cities. In the summer of 1963, King led the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom where he delivered his most famous speech, \\"I Have a Dream\\". King became Time's Man of the Year for 1963 and won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964. Four months after the Birmingham campaign settlement, someone bombed the house of NAACP attorney Arthur Shores, injuring his wife in the attack.

Eight members of the \\"Eighth and H Street Crew\\" were eventually convicted of the Oct. 1, 1984, killing. But lawyers say they might not have been if prosecutors had disclosed a key piece of evidence: Witnesses near the crime scene had reported seeing another man, James McMillan, reports the New York Times. McMillan was convicted of assaults on two women in the area around the same time, and later of a woman's murder in the same neighborhood. \\"He is the reason that you should have doubt about this prosecution's case,\\" a lawyer arguing for the convictions to be overturned told the Supreme Court on Wednesday, per the Washington Post. Lower courts have backed up the lead prosecutor's assertion that the McMillan sighting was irrelevant. The eight crew members—one died in prison, one was released, and six remain incarcerated—went on to be convicted based on testimony of witnesses characterized by Justice Elena Kagan as \\"a couple of really drug-addled people and a 14-year-old boy,\\" per the Guardian. Lawyers for the federal government say the outcome would have been the same even if prosecutors had disclosed the McMillan sighting, because police got crew members to confess. But Kagan suggested that another suspect might've prevented a \\"circular firing squad\\" of crew members accusing each other. \\"It would have been a completely different trial,\\" she said. A decision is expected in June.","completion":"Title: A Miscarriage of Justice? Revisiting the 1984 Murder of Catherine Fuller Introduction In October 1984, the brutal murder of 49-year-old Catherine Fuller shocked the community of Washington, DC. Nearly four decades later, questions still surround the prosecution and conviction of eight members of the \\"Eighth and H Street Crew\\" for her killing. With new revelations about potential witness testimony and prosecutorial misconduct, the case has been brought to the Supreme Court, sparking a debate on the validity of the convictions and the possibility of a grave miscarriage of justice. The Catherine Fuller Case: Background On October 1, 1984, Catherine Fuller was found dead in a garage near Eighth and H streets in Washington, DC. She had been viciously beaten and sodomized with a metal pipe. The police identified eight members of a local gang, the \\"Eighth and H Street Crew,\\" as the perpetrators of the horrifying crime. After lengthy trials, all eight were convicted and sentenced to lengthy prison terms. However, in recent years, lawyers and civil rights advocates have argued that vital evidence pointing to another suspect, James McMillan, was withheld from the trial, potentially depriving the defendants of a fair trial. McMillan had been convicted of two assault charges in the area before Fuller's murder and was later convicted of another murder in the same neighborhood. The Suppressed Evidence: The McMillan Sighting During the initial investigation into Catherine Fuller's murder, witnesses reported seeing James McMillan near the crime scene. This crucial piece of information was never disclosed to the defense, leading many to question the integrity of the prosecution's case. Lawyers arguing for the convictions to be overturned assert that the undisclosed McMillan sighting is proof that reasonable doubt exists in the case. The Supreme Court Weighs In In a hearing before the Supreme Court, Justice Elena Kagan criticized the original trial's testimony from what she called \\"a couple of really drug-addled people and a 14-year-old boy.\\" Kagan went on to suggest that disclosing the McMillan sighting could have drastically changed the outcome of the trial. The government's lawyers countered by claiming that the presence of another suspect would not have changed the outcome because the \\"Eighth and H Street Crew\\" members implicated one another during police interrogations. However, Kagan argued that the crew members might not have accused each other in the face of another potential suspect. She said, \\"It would have been a completely different trial.\\" A decision on whether to overturn the convictions is expected in June. Conclusion The Catherine Fuller murder case raises important questions about the fairness and accuracy of the criminal justice system. Serious concerns about the suppression of critical evidence must be addressed to avoid further miscarriages of justice. The Supreme Court's decision in this case will have a significant impact on the lives of those convicted and the public's trust of the judiciary process as a whole. Ultimately, this case serves as a stark reminder of the need for transparency and accountability at all levels of the criminal justice system."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Process: - Sunlight strikes the chlorophyll molecules in the plant - Is trapped - Plant also takes in water and carbon dioxide from the environment - The plant forms glucose - The plant releases oxygen into the atmosphere. suppose There is no coal happens, how will it affect more sunlight is trapped by the plant molecules. Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process Answer:","completion":"The supposed perturbation is indirectly impacting a step of the process. To understand this, let's break down the process and examine how the lack of coal affects it. 1. Sunlight strikes the chlorophyll molecules in the plant: The amount of sunlight reaching a plant's chlorophyll molecules is not directly influenced by the presence or absence of coal. Sunlight is primarily determined by geographic location, season, and time of day. However, the presence of coal-burning power plants can contribute to air pollution, which may reduce the amount of sunlight reaching plants. In this case, the absence of coal would lead to less air pollution and potentially more sunlight reaching the chlorophyll molecules. 2. Sunlight is trapped: The trapping of sunlight is an internal process in the plant and is not directly affected by the presence or absence of coal. 3. Plant takes in water and carbon dioxide from the environment: The lack of coal does not directly influence a plant's ability to uptake water and carbon dioxide. However, coal-burning power plants emit large amounts of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change. An increase in carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere can result in changes to weather patterns and precipitation, which could indirectly affect the availability of water for plants. Additionally, higher carbon dioxide levels can stimulate plant growth and photosynthesis in certain conditions, indirectly affecting this step of the process. 4. Plant forms glucose: The formation of glucose within the plant is an internal process and is not directly affected by the presence or absence of coal. 5. Plant releases oxygen into the atmosphere: The release of oxygen is an internal process within the plant and is not directly influenced by the presence or absence of coal. However, as mentioned earlier, higher carbon dioxide levels resulting from coal combustion can stimulate plant growth and photosynthesis, potentially increasing the release of oxygen into the atmosphere. In summary, the absence of coal does not directly impact any specific step of the photosynthesis process. However, it can indirectly affect the availability of sunlight, as well as water and carbon dioxide uptake, through its impact on air pollution and climate change. These indirect effects may influence the functioning and efficiency of the photosynthesis process as a whole."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Route 66 gets extremely hot during the summer, and portions of the road may become unsafe during the winter. For the most pleasant driving conditions, schedule your trip between March and early June or between September and November. Oklahoma and Texas get a lot of tornados between late April and early June. If you travel during these times, make sure to keep an eye on local weather forecasts for any tornado warnings or watches. If you want to travel the entire 2,451 mi (3,945 km) road, you’ll need to start in either Chicago, Illinois or Santa Monica, California. This will allow you to get the full Route 66 experience while traveling across the country. If you are travelling in the spring, begin in California and make your way to Illinois. If you are travelling the the fall, start in Illinois and work your way to California. This should provide the most ideal weather conditions. Depending on how often you stop and how many places you explore, a one-way road trip from Chicago to Santa Monica (or vice versa) will take anywhere from 2 to 4 weeks. As a general guideline, plan to travel between 70 and 90 mi (110 and 140 km) a day if you want to stop and see everything. If you only want to explore a portion of the classic highway, you can start in Missouri, the southeastern tip of Kansas, Oklahoma, the Texas panhandle, New Mexico, or Arizona. Choose a starting point based on its appeal or its proximity to your home. Route 66 passes through a number of major cities including Oklahoma City, Tulsa, Amarillo, Flagstaff, Santa Fe, Albuquerque, and Los Angeles. Once you know your starting point, decide where you want to end your trip and plug the information into an online mapping service. Then, use the service’s distance estimate to determine how many days it will take you to complete your journey. Due to the road’s size, a car or motorcycle is the best way to experience Route 66. You’ll get a great view of all the sights and can stay at hotels or motels along the way. In some places, you may even be able to camp out! If you live in the United States, consider using your own vehicle for the trip. If you’re flying in from another country, or if your vehicle isn’t durable enough for the trip, you can rent a vehicle. If you only want to visit the major cities on Route 66, you can book a 14-day train trip. Though you can take a large vehicle like an RV, certain parts of the road may be difficult to drive on as the road is narrow and winding in some areas. You’ll also have a harder time finding parking and RV campgrounds. Route 66 houses a number of unique hotels and motels, such as the famous Magnolia Hotel in St. Louis and the themed Mayo Hotel in Tulsa. These places fill up fast, so make room reservations 2-3 months beforehand if at all possible. For a full list of Route 66 hotels and motels, visit https://www.theroute-66.com/hotels.html. If you’re travelling by RV, find and reserve campgrounds ahead of time. You can also check out tent campgrounds if you’re travelling by car or motorcycle and want to sleep under the stars. If you aren’t planning on driving both ways, decide how you’d like to get home. You can take the train or bus, or even book a flight, though you’ll have to pay to ship your vehicle home if you choose not to rent one for the trip. You may want to book a flight with free cancellation in case the trip takes more or less time than you anticipated. If you rent a vehicle to make the drive, choose a company that has a hub near the airport you plan to fly home from for your convenience. . Before your trip, break down how much you expect to spend on gas, lodging, food, entertainment, and miscellaneous items like souvenirs. For things with specific rates, like gas and lodging, look up current pricing information online. For anything else, create a rough estimate based on how much you normally spend during vacations. For a 1-way trip from Chicago to Santa Monica or vice versa, expect to spend a minimum of 300 on gas, 1,700 on lodging, 600 per person on food, and 200 per person on entertainment. Boost your final budget by 10-20% to account for unintended expenses, price hikes, and emergencies.

FREETOWN The head doctor fighting an outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus in Sierra Leone has himself caught the disease, one of a growing list of medical workers infected while battling to halt its spread across West Africa. Ebola has killed 632 people across Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone since an outbreak began in February, putting strain on a string of weak health systems facing one of the world's deadliest diseases despite waves of international help. In a sign of the growing frustrations with the failure of region's governments to tackle the outbreak, a Liberian whose brother died from the disease set fire to the Health Ministry in protest on Wednesday. A statement from the president's office said 39-year-old Sheik Umar Khan, a Sierra Leonean virologist credited with treating more than 100 Ebola victims, had been transferred to a treatment ward run by medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres. A source at the ward confirmed that the doctor was alive and receiving treatment, but gave no details of his condition. Khan has been hailed a \\"national hero\\" by the Health Ministry for his efforts to lead the fight against an outbreak that has killed 206 people in the West African nation. There is no cure or vaccine for Ebola, which can kill up to 90 percent of those infected, although the mortality rate of the current outbreak is around 60 percent. It was not immediately clear how Khan had caught the virus. His colleagues told Reuters that he was always meticulous with protection, wearing overalls, mask, gloves and special footwear. Three days ago, three nurses working in the same Ebola treatment center alongside Khan died from the disease. Tarik Jasarevic, a spokesman for the World Health Organization, said around 100 health workers had been infected by Ebola in the three countries, with 50 of them dying. \\"Personal protection equipment is very hot. But there is a very strict procedure how you wear it, how you take it off, what can be re-used or not,\\" he said. Earlier this month, Samuel Muhumuza Mutoro, a senior Ugandan doctor working in Liberia died after treated infected patients. \\"AFRAID FOR MY LIFE\\" The latest WHO figures, released on Saturday, showed that there were 19 new deaths and 67 new cases within the four days since its previous statement. The Ebola outbreak started in Guinea's remote southeast and has since spread across the region's poorly controlled borders. Symptoms of the highly infectious disease are diarrhea, vomiting and internal and external bleeding. Part of Liberia's Health Ministry was destroyed on Wednesday when Monrovia resident Edward Deline set fire to the building in protest over the death of his 14-year-old brother from Ebola. \\"The health (workers) here are not doing enough to fight this virus. They are taking this to be a money making thing while our people are dying,\\" Deline told journalists after he was arrested by police. Local and international health workers face a combination of fear, suspicion and local traditions for burying the dead as they try to prevent Ebola spreading further. [ID:nL6N0PO12H] During a Reuters visit to the Kenema treatment center in eastern Sierra Leone in late June, Khan said he had installed a mirror in his office, which he called his \\"policeman\\", to check for holes in his protective clothing before entering an isolation ward. Nevertheless, Khan said he feared Ebola. \\"I am afraid for my life, I must say, because I cherish my life,\\" he said in an interview, showing no signs of ill health at the time. \\"Health workers are prone to the disease because we are the first port of call for somebody who is sickened by disease.

Whatever advantages, however, that sapwood may have in this connection are due solely to its relative age and position.\\", answer the following question. Note that the answer is present within the text. Question: What can damage trees? Answer:","completion":"There are several factors that can damage trees, as mentioned in the passage. These include: 1. Broken limbs or roots: When a tree sustains damage to its limbs or roots, it can create an opening for decay to enter and potentially spread throughout the trunk. 2. Deep wounds from various sources: Deep wounds inflicted by fire, insects, or falling timber can also serve as an entry point for decay, which may then penetrate and weaken the tree. 3. Insect larvae: Many insects bore into trees to lay their eggs, creating tunnels that remain indefinitely within the tree's structure. These tunnels can serve as sources of weakness, contributing to the overall damage a tree may suffer over time. In summary, trees can be damaged by broken limbs or roots, deep wounds from fire, insects, or falling timber, and the tunnels created by insect larvae. These factors can compromise the tree's health and longevity, as decay can spread through the trunk once it has gained access to the tree's inner structure."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The first act of the film revolves around the administrators and officials of Cape Colony, notably the supremely arrogant Lord Chelmsford and the scheming Sir Henry Bartle Frere, who both wish to crush the neighbouring Zulu Empire, which is perceived as a threat to Cape Colony's emerging industrial economy. Bartle Frere issues an impossible ultimatum to the Zulu king, Cetshwayo, demanding that he dissolve the Zulu Empire. Cetshwayo refuses, providing Cape Colony with a pretext to invade Zululand. Despite objections from leading members of Cape Colony's high society and from Great Britain itself, Bartle Frere authorises Lord Chelmsford to lead a British invasion force into Zululand. The rest of the film focuses on the British invasion of Zululand and the lead-up to the Battle of Isandlwana. The invading British army, laden with an immense network of supply wagons, invades Zululand and marches in the direction of Ulundi, the Zulu capital. British forces, eager to fight a large battle in which they can unleash their cutting-edge military technology against the vast Zulu army, become increasingly frustrated as the main Zulu army refuses to attack the British, and fighting is restricted to a few small skirmishes between British and Zulu scouts. Concerned that their supply lines are becoming overstretched and that the main Zulu army is still at large, British troops begin torturing captive Zulu warriors in an effort to learn the location and tactics of the Zulu army. Halfway to Ulundi, Chelmsford halts his army at the base of Mount Isandhlwana, ignoring the advice of Boer attendants to entrench the camp and laager the supply wagons, leaving the camp dangerously exposed. During the night, Colonel Durnford and an escort of fifty mounted Basutos approach the camp.

Sadly, my experience has been nothing short of disappointing, prompting me to rate it a mere 1 star. To begin with, the user interface is far from friendly. The navigation is convoluted and confusing. It's hard to even locate games and when I do, the app often crashes unexpectedly. I have even restarted my device many times in hopes of resolving this to no avail, making the app virtually unusable. Moreover, the compatibility of this app leaves a lot to be desired. Despite claiming support for most games, I found several of my favorite ones not working. The graphics and sound lag significantly - sparks of nostalgia were swapped with moments of frustration because of the continuous frame drops and sound distortions. Another downside is the lack of adequate customer support. On reaching out, my queries and concerns were met with radio silence. A little guidance could have potentially resolved my issues, but it seems this was too much to ask for. In addition, the app often serves too many intrusive ads, which significantly disrupts the gaming experience. I understand the necessity of ads for free apps, but the frequency and disruptive nature of these ads are unjustifiable. Last but not the least, the overall performance of the app is extremely poor. The sluggishness, frequent crashes, and persistent bugs render the app frustrating to navigate and use. In summary, the com.reicast.emulator app was a letdown.

In response to a question from VOA News just before heading to Asia from the Group of Seven summit in Canada, Trump said “I really feel confident” about the unprecedented encounter between a sitting American president and a member of the family dynasty which has maintained iron-fist control over one of the world’s most reclusive countries for three generations. Trump added that he believes Kim, half the age of the American president, “wants to do something great for his people.” But Trump cautioned that Kim “won’t have that opportunity again” if the talks do not go well -- describing this opportunity for diplomacy with the United States as a “one-time shot.” Trump and others in his government have said advancement has been made on obtaining a commitment from Kim to give up all his nuclear weapons and long-range ballistic missiles. Progress could lead to a peace treaty and formally end a state of war on the Korean peninsula, which has persisted for nearly 70 years. Whether such a deal can be done, Trump declared on Saturday, is something he will know almost... Question: Who is feeling 'very good' about the summit?

However, the latter was not completed to their satisfaction, and by December 2011, Clayton admitted it would not come to fruition. The sessions with Danger Mouse instead formed the foundation of U2's next album, and they worked with him until May 2013 before enlisting the help of producers Paul Epworth, Ryan Tedder, Declan Gaffney, and Flood. The band suspended work on the album late in 2013 to contribute a new song, \\"Ordinary Love\\", to the film Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom. The track, written in honour of Nelson Mandela, won the 2014 Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song. In November 2013, U2's long-time manager Paul McGuinness stepped down from his post as part of a deal with Live Nation to acquire his management firm, Principle Management. McGuinness, who had managed the group for over 30 years, was succeeded by Guy Oseary. In February 2014, another new U2 song, the single \\"Invisible\\", debuted in a Super Bowl television advertisement and was made available in the iTunes Store at no cost to launch a partnership with Product Red and Bank of America to fight AIDS. Bono called the track a \\"sneak preview\\" of their pending record.On 9 September 2014, U2 announced their thirteenth studio album, Songs of Innocence, at an Apple product launch event, and released it digitally the same day to all iTunes Store customers at no cost. The release made the album available to over 500 million iTunes customers in what Apple CEO Tim Cook called \\"the largest album release of all time.\\" Apple reportedly paid Universal Music Group and U2 a lump sum for a five-week exclusivity period in which to distribute the album and spent US100 million on a promotional campaign.

Question: This is a correct answer to the following question about Bretton Woods system. Yes or no? Answer: This action, referred to as the Nixon shock , created the situation in which the United States dollar became a reserve currency used by many states. Question: What are the fundamentals of Bretton Woods system for fixed exchange rates Answer:","completion":"The Bretton Woods system, established in 1944, was designed to regulate international monetary relations and stabilize exchange rates after World War II. It was a major accomplishment in international economic policy that helped promote global trade and investment. The basic fundamentals of the Bretton Woods system for fixed exchange rates are as follows: 1. Fixed exchange rates: One of the key features of the Bretton Woods system was that exchange rates were fixed, rather than allowed to float freely. Each participating country committed to maintaining its currency within a narrow band, typically within 1% of the agreed-upon exchange rate. This helped to create currency stability, reduce exchange rate risk, and facilitate international trade and investment. 2. US dollar as a reserve currency: The United States dollar (USD) was chosen to be the central reserve currency, and it was pegged to gold at a fixed price of 35 per ounce. Other currencies' values were pegged to the US dollar hence their value was indirectly linked to gold. This in turn created a strong link between the US dollar and gold, which helped to foster global confidence in the US dollar as a stable reserve currency. 3. International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank: The Bretton Woods conference led to the creation of two major international organizations - the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank. The IMF was responsible for managing the system and ensuring exchange rate stability, while the World Bank aimed to promote economic development and reduce poverty through financial and technical assistance. 4. Convertibility and capital controls: Under the Bretton Woods system, countries agreed to make their currencies convertible into other currencies on demand for current account transactions. However, member countries were allowed to implement capital controls to regulate the movement of financial capital, such as investments, to limit speculative capital flows and maintain financial stability. 5. Adjustments and intervention mechanisms: Member countries were required to intervene in currency markets to maintain fixed exchange rates, usually by buying or selling their own currency. However, if a country faced persistent balance of payments deficits or surpluses, they could request permission from the IMF to adjust their exchange rate to correct the imbalance. The Bretton Woods system eventually collapsed in 1971 when President Nixon announced the suspension of the US dollar's convertibility into gold, known as the Nixon Shock. This led to the abandonment of fixed exchange rates and the adoption of floating exchange rates as countries sought alternative ways to manage their currencies and stabilize their economies. However, the system played an important role in shaping global economic policies over the more than two decades it endured and laid the foundation for organizations like the IMF and World Bank that still exist today."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This club has been around for SO long. I think this may have been one of the first clubs I ever went to when I started making monthly trips to Vegas. As there were about 20 of us girls in the Bachelorette party, we were looking to find a place that wouldn't make us wait in some massive line, wouldn't charge us cover, and also had an open bar. We were first in line to enter Pure. The bouncers were super friendly (not always the case at clubs in Vegas) and we got our wristbands in no time. They had an open bar (for ladies) until midnight, so we went on in and enjoyed our free drinks. The dance floor was empty, so we danced away until there was no more room to dance. I headed up stairs and went to check out the outdoor VIP areas. The view is pretty fancy, and they had a roped off area for people with tables. I walked in there and took some pictures of us with the strip in the background. Then, we made friends with one of the bouncers in the area who was again, REALLY nice. I made my way down the stairs back into the club area of Pure. But first, I insisted on can-canning down each step. So of course, there was quite a line of grumpy people behind me. I was so happily buzzed off my free drinks, that I was legitimately can-canning down the stairs. I highly recommend that everyone try to do this as well.

U.S. troops make up the bulk of NATO-led forces in Afghanistan.","completion":"Title: Afghan Forces Ready to Protect Their Country and British Troops' Journey Home Once upon a time in a faraway land called Afghanistan, there lived a President named Hamid Karzai. He was in charge of all the people and the country, just like your school principal, but for the whole nation! President Karzai was working to make Afghanistan a safe and happy place for everyone. For many years, soldiers from different countries came to Afghanistan to help keep the people safe. Among those soldiers, there were British soldiers, who came all the way from the United Kingdom, and American soldiers, who came from the United States. They were part of a big team called NATO. These soldiers worked together with the Afghan forces to make the country peaceful. In the beginning of our story, President Karzai made a very important announcement. He said that the Afghan forces were now strong enough to protect their country and its people. This was very exciting news because it meant that Afghanistan was becoming safer by the day. When President Karzai shared this news with everyone, the leader of the United Kingdom, David Cameron, decided that it was time to bring some of his soldiers back home. He said that almost 4,000 British soldiers will go back to the United Kingdom next year, and only about 5,200 will stay in Afghanistan until the end of 2013. This made the British soldiers very happy because they missed their families and friends back home. As for the American soldiers, who made up the biggest portion of NATO's protective force, they were still going to stay in Afghanistan for some more time. President Karzai appreciated their help and was glad to have his Afghan forces work alongside them in keeping the country safe. So, dear little ones, this story tells us about how the Afghan forces became strong enough to protect their own country, which led to some of the British soldiers returning to their loved ones in the United Kingdom. Thanks to teamwork and everyone's efforts, Afghanistan is becoming a better place, and we hope it continues to grow stronger and safer for everyone living there."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Jessica sat at her desk, scrolling through yet another report destined for her superiors. Her focus never wavered, her determination only growing stronger - after all, she had deadlines to meet and a reputation to uphold. She was known as the most reliable employee in the office. She’d always take on extra work, staying late to get it done. But Jessica also knew her limits. She wasn't one to let others down. She prided herself on her impeccable organizational skills and her ability to manage several tasks at once. Rebecca, on the other hand, seemed to be the polar opposite. Her workspace was always cluttered with Post-its, loose papers, and half-empty coffee cups. Procrastination seemed to be her modus operandi, leaving work to pile up until the last minute. She was never concerned about deadlines and viewed the strict schedules as guidelines rather than firm times. Jessica often wondered how Rebecca managed to keep her job, with her constant tardiness and apparent disregard for authority. Their boss, Mr. Thompson, seemed to tolerate Rebecca's inefficiencies without any decisive action. Jessica assumed he had a soft spot for Rebecca—a unprofessional weakness. But that all changed one fateful morning when Jessica arrived early to the office, as she always did. As she settled at her spotless desk, brewing coffee and booting up her computer, she noticed Mr. Thompson approaching. He looked more serious than Jessica had ever seen him. He quietly asked her to join him in his office. The words reverberated through her ears like a thousand chaotic echoes, each one heavier than the last. \\"Jessica, I'm sorry, but we have to let you go.\\" Her eyes widened in shock, and her heart dropped to her stomach. It was words she did not expect nor comprehend. It was her, Jessica, who was being terminated, and not Rebecca as she'd long assumed would be the case. Her usually steady and composed voice trembled as she asked for an explanation. Was it due to a couple of missed deadlines? A poorly executed project? Mr. Thompson, with a pained look in his eyes, explained that it had nothing to do with her performance. He admired her work ethic, punctuality, and attention to detail. Unfortunately, the company was undergoing budget cuts, and they had to make some difficult decisions, he said. They had to downsize. As Jessica grappled with the reality of her situation, she couldn't help but feel a sense of injustice. Why was she, the diligent and hardworking employee, the one being let go, while Rebecca, despite her lack of discipline, was allowed to stay? Was there any fairness left in the world? Overwhelmed with emotions and with tears welling up in her eyes, Jessica packed up her belongings from her pristine desk and left the building for the last time. Out in the world now, she felt a fire ignite within her—a determination more potent than she'd ever known. She would prove them all wrong. This setback was only a stepping-stone towards something bigger and greater. Jessica decided to embrace her future with open arms, ready to face new challenges and victories. And one day, she'd look back on this moment with a bittersweet smile, thinking of how much she'd grown and the person she'd become.

Movie plot title: This Is England Movie plot: In 1983, 12-year-old Shaun gets into a fight at school with a boy named Harvey after he makes an offensive joke about his father, who died in the Falklands War. On his way home, Shaun comes across a gang of young skinheads led by Woody, who feels sympathy for Shaun and invites him to join the group. They accept Shaun as a member, and he finds a big brother in Woody, while developing a romance with Smell, an older girl who dresses in a new wave style. Combo, an older skinhead, returns to the group after a prison sentence, accompanied by a knife-wielding moustachioed man called Banjo. A charismatic but unstable individual with sociopathic tendencies, Combo expresses English nationalist and racist views, and attempts to enforce his leadership over the other skinheads. This leads the group to split, with young Shaun, the belligerent Pukey, and Gadget, who feels bullied by Woody for his weight, choosing Combo over Woody's apolitical gang. Shaun finds a mentor figure in Combo, who in turn is impressed by and identifies with Shaun. Shaun goes with Combo's group to a white nationalist meeting. After Pukey expresses doubt over their racist and nationalistic politics, Combo throws him out of the group and sends him back to Woody. The gang then engages in bigoted antagonism of, among others, shopkeeper Mr. Sandhu, an Indian man who had previously banned Shaun from his shop. Combo becomes depressed after Lol, Woody's girlfriend, rejects him when he admits that he has loved her since they had sex years before. To console himself, Combo buys cannabis from Milky, the only black skinhead in Woody's gang. During a party, Combo and Milky bond while intoxicated, but Combo becomes increasingly bitter and envious when Milky shares details of his many relatives, comfortable family life and happy upbringing, everything that Combo lacked. Enraged, Combo enters a frenzied state and brutally beats Milky unconscious, while Banjo restrains Shaun, who watches on in horror. When Banjo attempts to hit Milky as well, Combo violently beats...

I haven't been to this place in a year. There's a reason. When Moira first opened, I waited a few weeks then went down there to check it out. The sushi wasn't bad. It was actually okay. The reason I think it was even okay was because, like many others... I WANT to like it. I've lived downtown for 15+ years and we're starving for an outstanding sushi spot... okay... even a \\"decent\\" sushi spot. It didn't happen with Moira. The first few times I went there... the food wasn't too shabby... but then... OOPS... not so good. I've now gone there a couple of times and received FOUL sushi. I'm not joking. The icing on the cake was the last time my bf and I went there and the tuna sashimi was served to us in a VERY LARGE portion. We were both excited... at first. Then quickly realized that the fish was definitely past its expiration. UGH... the smell was SO BAD. When we alerted the server of this they told us that they'd see if they could take it off the bill. Uh... we were NOT about to pay for this foul smelling tuna. I mean who in their right mind would eat this? In the end, they agreed to not have us pay for that dish. What I thought was pretty screwed up was that they served this to us thinking that we were idiots and some stinky tuna would just fly under the radar. NOPE! Btw, the above experience isn't the only one. I had a previously bad experience on NYE 2 years ago... and should have not gone back... but I chalked it up as one bad incident and thought I'd be open minded, since I really wanted to like it. The only thing I could say positively about the place was that the sake menu was pretty good. But to be honest with you... great sake is only a few steps away at Sens... along with some really tasty eats. I truly want to have a great sushi place downtown here... why can't we get it?

The Hull Truck theatre, which got £1.5m, was among the main recipients. Northern Ballet, the Cambridge Junction and the National Youth Theatre have all received at least £680,000 since 2011. However, Arts Council England has not named the most recent beneficiaries because of \\"commercial sensitivity\\". Many arts organisations have struggled in recent years from a combination of government and local council cuts, a tough climate for private sponsorship and squeezed household budgets. Arts Council England's system of emergency \\"financial intervention\\" is intended for organisations that receive annual funding but which have run into trouble. To receive financial intervention, the criteria say venues will be \\"assessed as high risk\\" and \\"at immediate and serious financial risk\\". The Arts Council steps in where it believes an organisation is \\"irreplaceable\\", where other forms of support have failed and where it is confident the cash injection will turn the situation around. From Arts Council England financial intervention grants issued April 2011-March 2013, except Hull Truck (April 2011-March 2014) The £14m has been paid to 55 theatre, art, music, dance and literature organisations over the past three financial years. The Arts Council has named the cultural venues and producers that received such funds in 2011/12 and 2012/13. But 12 of the 13 beneficiaries in 2013/14 have not been identified because it could \\"prejudice the commercial interests of the organisations concerned\\". The only recipient to have been named from the most recent financial year was Hull's Truck theatre. It received a £300,000 grant in February 2014, a city council document recently revealed. That was one of seven such emergency Arts Council grants given to the Hull theatre since March 2011, totalling £1.505m. The venue got into financial trouble after moving to a new £15m building in 2009 and after long-serving artistic director John Godber departed the following year. Hull is due to be UK City of Culture in 2017. Hull Truck's executive director Janthi Mills-Ward said: \\"Being the second-lowest funded producing theatre in the Arts Council's National Portfolio, alongside a difficult economic climate, it has been necessary to secure additional support.\\" The extra funding has ensured \\"ongoing financial resilience to produce the very best work,\\" she said. Recent concerns about funding outside the capital are reflected by the fact that several of the biggest bail-outs have gone to organisations outside London. Other large grants include £750,000 to Northern Ballet in 2012 to cover increased running costs at its new £12m home in Leeds, which it shares with Phoenix Dance Theatre and which opened in 2010. Northern Ballet chief executive Mark Skipper said the grant gave the company \\"the breathing space we needed to make the transition to running a major new building\\" and that the company had also increased its ticket sales and other forms of fundraising. The Cambridge Junction, which stages gigs, comedy, plays and club nights, received £700,000 in 2011. Its director Daniel Brine explained that it had faced \\"a period of financial instability\\" that year. \\"This was a result of some long-standing financial weaknesses coupled with a shift in trading at the time of the global financial crisis,\\" he said. A new business model has made the venue \\"stronger and more financially resilient\\" he added. The London-based National Youth Theatre of Great Britain got two grants totalling £680,000 in 2012 to deal with \\"major issues\\" with its finances, according to chief executive Paul Roseby. It achieved \\"a rapid return to financial and organisational health\\" after a restructure of its management and an increase in private funding, he said. Two grants totalling £510,000 went to Northampton's Royal & Derngate theatre in 2012 and 2013. The venue's chief executive Martin Sutherland said the recession had hit ticket sales and \\"had a very direct impact on our overall financial stability\\". \\"We have moved on significantly from that point in time, having evaluated how to make ourselves more resilient to economic change and position the organisation better in case of any future economic downturn,\\" he explained. Meanwhile, the Bluecoat gallery in Liverpool required £500,000 in 2011 to resolve \\"a number of unforeseen structural problems\\" after a £14m redevelopment, according to chief executive Mary Cloake, who added that the venue's future was now \\"looking better than ever\\". Arts Council England's deputy chief executive Althea Efunshile said the body supported \\"bold, innovative arts and culture\\". She continued: \\"With innovation comes risk and many arts organisations are operating on very small margins in a challenging economic environment. A grant of this nature indicates our belief in the future of the organisation and their ability to deliver on their artistic aims.\\" Arts Council England currently distributes annual government funding totalling £341m to 696 venues and producers. On 1 July, it is due to announce who will receive regular funding from 2015-18. Output:","completion":"Arts Council England has provided £14m in emergency funding to 55 arts organizations facing financial difficulties over the past three years, supporting venues like Hull Truck Theatre, Northern Ballet, and the Cambridge Junction amidst government and local council cuts and challenging economic conditions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Despite the frantic efforts of the Navy Corpsman present who try to save him, Wilson dies from his wounds. Overwhelmed by guilt, Kovic appeals to his executive officer (XO), who merely tells him to forget the incident.

The sketch was titled \\"Harry Potter and the Secret Chamberpot of Azerbaijan\\" and was a part of the events and activities held during the annual Red Nose Day, which is organized by the charity Comic Relief. In this sketch, Dawn French donned a Harry Potter-esque costume, complete with glasses and scarf, and portrayed a humorous version of Harry as he navigated a mysterious and magical scenario. The sketch also featured other popular British comedians and actors, such as Jennifer Saunders, playing the roles of Hagrid, Professor McGonagall, and other Hogwarts characters. The goal of the sketch was to entertain audiences while raising awareness and funds for the Comic Relief charity, which strives to create a just world free from poverty. The Red Nose Day event has grown over the years to become a major fundraiser across the United Kingdom, with comedians, actors, musicians, and other public figures contributing through various forms of performance and donations. It's important to mention that Dawn French's portrayal of Harry Potter is not canon in J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter series or film adaptation. Daniel Radcliffe is well known as the actor who played Harry Potter in the film series based on the novels. The 2003 Red Nose Day sketch was a fun and lighthearted parody meant to bring laughter and support a good cause."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Court sides with employee fired for smoking pot at work HARTFORD, Conn. — A Connecticut state worker fired after he was caught smoking marijuana on the job was punished too harshly and should get his job back, the state Supreme Court ruled Friday. Gregory Linhoff was fired from his maintenance job at the University of Connecticut Health Center in Farmington in 2012 after a police officer caught him smoking pot in a state-owned vehicle. He had no previous disciplinary problems since being hired in 1998 and had received favorable job evaluations, according to his union. He was arrested, but the charges were later dismissed. State officials said firing the New Hartford resident was the only appropriate penalty for his conduct and not doing so would send a bad message to other employees. An arbitrator disagreed and overturned the firing, saying Linhoff instead should be suspended without pay for six months and be subject to random drug testing for a year after he returned to work. The state appealed and a Superior Court judge overturned the arbitrator’s decision on the grounds that it violated Connecticut’s public policy against marijuana use. Linhoff’s union, the Connecticut Employees Union Independent SEIU, appealed the judge’s ruling to the Supreme Court. All seven justices agreed that the lower court judge was wrong to overturn the arbitrator’s ruling, saying that while state policy on drug use in the work place allows for firing workers it does not require it. Justices also said that judicial second-guessing of arbitration awards is uncommon and should be reserved only for extraordinary circumstances. “The misconduct at issue was completely unacceptable, and we do not condone it,” Chief Justice Chase T. Rogers wrote in the decision. “By the arbitrator’s estimation, (Linhoff’s) personal qualities and overall record indicate that he is a good candidate for a second chance,” Rogers wrote. “Moreover, the discipline the arbitrator imposed was appropriately severe, and sends a message to others who might consider committing similar misconduct that painful consequences will result.” Linhoff couldn’t be reached for comment Friday. A phone number for him could not be found. His attorney, Barbara Collins, and officials with the state Attorney General’s Office did not immediately return messages. At the time Linhoff was fired, he was seeking treatment for depression, stress and anxiety because his wife had filed for divorce and he had a cancer scare; he believed smoking pot helped to alleviate his worries, Collins has said. Collins wrote in court documents that Linhoff’s conduct was not so egregious that he should be denied a second chance. Write a one or two sentence summary.","completion":"The Connecticut Supreme Court ruled that a state worker, who was fired after being caught smoking marijuana on the job, should get his job back, stating that the firing was too harsh and a six-month suspension without pay and random drug testing would be more appropriate.

In Anglican, Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Lutheran, and Oriental Orthodox doctrine, all of their faithful deceased in Heaven are considered to be saints, but some are considered worthy of greater honor or emulation; official ecclesiastical recognition, and consequently veneration, is given to some saints through the process of canonization in the Catholic Church or glorification in the Eastern Orthodox Church. - London is the capital and most populous city of England and the United Kingdom, as well as the most populous city proper in the European Union. Standing on the River Thames in the south east of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded by the Romans, who named it \\"Londinium\\". London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its medieval boundaries. Since at least the 19th century, \\"London\\" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which today largely makes up Greater London, governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly. - The London Borough of Bromley is one of the 32 London Boroughs (plus the City) which make up Greater London. The London Borough of Bromley is south of the River Thames which flows through London, the capital city of the United Kingdom. Bromley is the principal town in the London Borough of Bromley. The local authority is Bromley London Borough Council. - Folklore is the body of expressive culture shared by a particular group of people; it encompasses the traditions common to that culture, subculture or group. These include oral traditions such as tales, proverbs and jokes. They include material culture, ranging from traditional building styles to handmade toys common to the group. Folklore also includes customary lore, the forms and rituals of celebrations like Christmas and weddings, folk dances and initiation rites. Each one of these, either singly or in combination, is considered a folklore artifact. Just as essential as the form, folklore also encompasses the transmission of these artifacts from one region to another or from one generation to the next. For folklore is not taught in a formal school curriculum or studied in the fine arts. Instead these traditions are passed along informally from one individual to another either through verbal instruction or demonstration. The academic study of folklore is called folkloristics. - A legend is a narrative of human actions that are perceived both by teller and listeners to take place within human history and demonstrating human values, and which possesses certain qualities that give the tale verisimilitude. Legend, for its active and passive participants, includes no happenings that are outside the realm of \\"possibility\\", but may include miracles. Legends may be transformed over time, in order to keep them fresh and vital, and realistic. Many legends operate within the realm of uncertainty, never being entirely believed by the participants, but also never being resolutely doubted. - Constrained Energy Lapped Transform (CELT) is an open, royalty-free lossy audio compression format and a free software codec with especially low algorithmic delay for use in low-latency audio communication. The algorithms are openly documented and may be used free of software patent restrictions. Development of the format was maintained by the Xiph.Org Foundation (as part of the Ogg codec family) and later coordinated by the Opus working group of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). - Bromley is a large suburban town, the administrative headquarters of the London Borough of Bromley in Greater London, England, United Kingdom. It was historically a market town chartered since 1158 and an ancient parish in the county of Kent. Its location on a coaching route and the opening of a railway station in 1858 were key to its development, and the economic history of Bromley is underpinned by a shift from an agrarian village to commerce and retail. As part of the suburban growth of London in the 20th century, Bromley significantly increased in population and was incorporated as a municipal borough in 1903. It has developed into one of a handful of regionally significant commercial and retail districts outside central London and has formed part of Greater London since 1965. Most of Bromley including the town centre falls under the BR1 postcode district, whereas areas to the west towards Shortlands are part of BR2 instead. - A holy well or sacred spring is a spring or other small body of water revered either in a Pagan or Christian context, often both. Holy wells were frequently pagan sacred sites that later became Christianized. The term \\"holy well\\" is commonly employed to refer to any water source of limited size (i.e. not a lake or river, but including pools and natural springs and seeps), which has some significance in the folklore of the area where it is located, whether in the form of a particular name, an associated legend, the attribution of healing qualities to the water through the numinous presence of its guardian spirit or Christian saint, or a ceremony or ritual centred on the well site. In Christian legend, the water is often said to have been made to flow by the action of a saint, a familiar theme especially in the hagiography of Celtic saints. - Kent is a county in South East England and one of the home counties. It borders Greater London to the north west, Surrey to the west, East Sussex to the south west, and Essex across the Thames Estuary to the north. The county town is Maidstone. - Shortlands is a suburban village in the London Borough of Bromley, Greater London, England. - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union. - A ritual \\"is a sequence of activities involving gestures, words, and objects, performed in a sequestered place, and performed according to set sequence.\\" Rituals may be prescribed by the traditions of a community, including a religious community. Rituals are characterized but not defined by formalism, traditionalism, invariance, rule-governance, sacral symbolism, and performance. - St Blaise 's Well is a holy well located in the grounds of the old Bishop 's Palace ( residence of Bishops of the see of Rochester until 1845 ) , now part of Bromley Civic Centre . in Bromley , Kent . - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. We do not know exactly how the hijackers gained access to the cockpit; FAA rules required that the doors remain closed and locked during flight. Ong speculated that they had \\"jammed their way\\" in. Perhaps the terrorists stabbed the flight attendants to get a cockpit key, to force one of them to open the cockpit door, or to lure the captain or first officer out of the cockpit. Or the flight attendants may just have been in their way. At the same time or shortly thereafter, Atta-the only terrorist on board trained to fly a jet-would have moved to the cockpit from his business-class seat, possibly accompanied by Omari. As this was happening, passenger Daniel Lewin, who was seated in the row just behind Atta and Omari, was stabbed by one of the hijackers-probably Satam al Suqami, who was seated directly behind Lewin. Lewin had served four years as an officer in the Israeli military. He may have made an attempt to stop the hijackers in front of him, not realizing that another was sitting behind him. The hijackers quickly gained control and sprayed Mace, pepper spray, or some other irritant in the first-class cabin, in order to force the passengers and flight attendants toward the rear of the plane. They claimed they had a bomb. About five minutes after the hijacking began, Betty Ong contacted the American Airlines Southeastern Reservations Office in Cary, North Carolina, via an AT&T airphone to report an emergency aboard the flight. This was the first of several occasions on 9/11 when flight attendants took action outside the scope of their training, which emphasized that in a hijacking, they were to communicate with the cockpit crew. The emergency call lasted approximately 25 minutes, as Ong calmly and professionally relayed information about events taking place aboard the airplane to authorities on the ground. At 8:19, Ong reported:\\"The cockpit is not answering, somebody's stabbed in business class-and I think there's Mace-that we can't breathe-I don't know, I think we're getting hijacked.\\" She then told of the stabbings of the two flight attendants. At 8:21, one of the American employees receiving Ong's call in North Carolina, Nydia Gonzalez, alerted the American Airlines operations center in Fort Worth, Texas, reaching Craig Marquis, the manager on duty. Marquis soon realized this was an emergency and instructed the airline's dispatcher responsible for the flight to contact the cockpit. At 8:23, the dispatcher tried unsuccessfully to contact the aircraft.

Our first expression is \\"in the red.\\" It is another way of saying that a business is losing money. In the past, numbers in the financial records of a company were written in red ink to show a loss. A business magazine recently published a report about a television company. The report said the company was still in the red, but was able to cut its loss from the year before. A profit by a business is written in black numbers. So a company that is \\"in the black\\" is making money. Another financial expression is \\"run on the bank.\\" That is what happens when many people try to withdraw all their money from a bank. A \\"run on the bank\\" usually happens when people believe there is danger a bank may fail or close. Newspaper reports about a banking crisis in Russia used that expression. They said the government acted because of fears that the crisis would cause a run on the banks. \\"Day trading\\" is a system that lets investors trade directly on an electronic market system. It was the first completely computerized stock market. It sells stocks of companies not listed on any stock exchange. Many high technology companies are listed on it. Day trading companies provide a desk and a computer system to an investor who wants to trade. Individuals must provide fifty thousand dollars or more to the trading company to pay for the stocks they buy. Thousands of other investors do day trading from computers in their homes. A day trader watches stock prices carefully. When he sees a stock rise in price, he uses the computer to buy shares of the stock. If the stock continues to rise in price in the next few minutes, the day trader sells the shares quickly to make a small profit. Then he looks for another stock to buy. If a stock goes down instead of up, he sells it and accepts the loss. The idea is to make a small profit many times during the day. Day traders may buy and sell stocks hundreds of times each day.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What are the names of the four other dogs who died in Soviet space missions?, using the article: Laika is memorialised in the form of a statue and plaque at Star City, Russia, the Russian Cosmonaut training facility. Created in 1997, Laika is positioned behind the cosmonauts with her ears erect. The Monument to the Conquerors of Space, constructed in 1964, also includes Laika. On 11 April 2008 at the military research facility where staff had been responsible for readying Laika for the flight, officials unveiled a monument of her poised on top of a space rocket. Stamps and envelopes picturing Laika were produced, as well as branded cigarettes and matches.Future space missions carrying dogs would be designed to be recovered. Four other dogs died in Soviet space missions: Bars and Lisichka were killed when their R-7 rocket exploded shortly after launch on 28 July 1960; Pchyolka and Mushka died when Korabl-Sputnik 3 was purposely destroyed with an explosive charge to prevent foreign powers from inspecting the capsule after a wayward atmospheric reentry trajectory on 1 December 1960.Although never shown, Laika is prominently mentioned in the 1985 film My Life as a Dog, in which the main character (a young Swedish boy in the late 1950s) identifies strongly with the dog. Laika, a 2007 graphic novel by Nick Abadzis giving a fictionalized account of Laika's life, won the Eisner Award for Best Publication for Teens. Laika is also mentioned in the 2004 song \\"Neighborhood #2 (Laika)\\" by Arcade Fire, included on their debut album Funeral.

Sentence:","completion":"The data provided offers specific information regarding Amsterdam Airport Schiphol, which is a significant international airport located in the Netherlands. Focusing on two main aspects, the details highlight information about the surface type of the airport's fifth runway and its elevation above sea level. Firstly, it is mentioned that the 5th runway surface at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol is made of \\"Asphalt.\\" Asphalt is a common type of material used in the construction of airport runways. It is derived from petroleum byproducts and is favored for its durability, flexibility, and ability to withstand the heavy load and impact of landing aircraft. Additionally, asphalt offers a high level of skid resistance, ensuring the safety of airplanes during landing and take-off. Secondly, the data specifies that the elevation above the sea level for Amsterdam Airport Schiphol is -3.3528. This negative number indicates that the airport is located below sea level. Being situated below sea level poses unique challenges for the airport's engineering design, drainage, and flood prevention measures. As the Netherlands is known for its low elevation and extensive system of dikes and water control structures, the airport has been designed in a manner that addresses these challenges and allows for the safe and efficient facilitation of air travel. In conclusion, the data provided offers an insightful look into the structural components of Amsterdam Airport Schiphol, namely the surface type of its fifth runway and its elevation relative to sea level.

I have a new situation: Ben and Andy were two old friends. They both have high levels of cholesterol. Ben was prescribed cholesterol medication, while Andy didn't go to the doctor because he was careless. But I can use this background: Currently, millions of individuals with high cholesterol take a similar type of drug, known as a statin. The drug, an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase (3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase), the rate limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis, decreases blood levels of cholesterol by induce the expression of low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors in the liver. The increased levels of the LDL-receptors stimulate the catabolism of plasma LDL, removing cholesterol from plasma, which is an important determinant of atherosclerosis. You may know of people who take a statin to help with their cholesterol levels. However, these drugs probably work slightly differently in many of those people. In some, it lowers their cholesterol significantly; in others it may lower it only moderately; and in some, it may have no significant effect at all. (Luckily for those individuals, there are multiple versions of the statins, so different drugs can be tested to find the proper combination for that individual.) Why the difference? Because of the genetic background of all people; the different single nucleotide polymorphisms that make us all different. Pharmacogenomics, a combination of pharmacology and genomics (the study of the genome) that refers to the study of the relationship between pharmaceuticals and genetics, may explain and simplify this problem.

So, let's move the 46 to the other side of the equation by doing the opposite (subtracting 46). -2 * r = -24 - 46 That gives us the new equation: -2 * r = -70 Now, to find r, we need to divide both sides of the equation by -2: r = -70 / -2 After dividing, we find that: r = 35 So the solution to the math problem is r = 35.

(SJD) I recently took the kids to see a performance by Jim Dale, the longtime British stage actor (he won a Tony for Barnum) who is best known these days as the wildly entertaining reader of the Harry Potter books on tape. He was reading an adaptation of a Eudora Welty story called “The Shoe Bird,” which he recently recorded with the Seattle Symphony. (It was wonderful, and I encourage you to give it a listen.) Afterward, Dale took questions from the audience — which, predictably, were about the Harry Potter series.

Read this article and answer this question After its initial box-office success, many theaters decided to continue to show the film for more than two weeks, even though its 3D Blu-ray release was scheduled for two-and-a-half weeks after its theatrical release. In North America, the 3D re-release ended its run in theaters on January 12, 2012 with a gross 94,242,001. Outside North America, it earned 83,400,000. The successful 3D re-release of The Lion King made Disney and Pixar plan 3D theatrical re-releases of Beauty and the Beast (1991 film), Finding Nemo, Monsters, Inc., and The Little Mermaid (1989 film) during 2012 and 2013. However, none of the re-releases of the first three films achieved the enormous success of The Lion King 3D and theatrical re-release of The Little Mermaid was ultimately cancelled. In 2012, Ray Subers of Box Office Mojo wrote that the reason why the 3D version of The Lion King succeeded was because, \\"the notion of a 3D re-release was still fresh and exciting, and The Lion King (3D) felt timely given the movies imminent Blu-ray release.

No. The premise provided suggests that the facility design and construction industry is growing increasingly competitive, productive, sophisticated, and capable. It also states that this industry is able and willing to take on an increased workload. Based on this information, we cannot conclude that the hypothesis stating that \\"an increasingly competitive, productive, sophisticated, and capable facility design is incapable of taking on the workload\\" is true. On the contrary, the premise directly contradicts the hypothesis, as it emphasizes the capabilities and willingness of the industry in taking on an increased workload. The growth in competition and productivity within the industry further supports the notion that the facility design and construction sector is not only capable of handling increased workloads but is also actively adapting to meet the growing needs and demands of the market. Additionally, the use of the word \\"sophisticated\\" in the premise points to the industry's continuous advancement and improvement, allowing its players to develop innovative solutions and designs to address the challenges that come with a growing workload.

While this process moved along, diplomacy continued its rounds. Direct pressure on the Taliban had proved unsuccessful. As one NSC staff note put it, \\"Under the Taliban, Afghanistan is not so much a state sponsor of terrorism as it is a state sponsored by terrorists.\\" In early 2000, the United States began a high-level effort to persuade Pakistan to use its influence over the Taliban. In January 2000, Assistant Secretary of State Karl Inderfurth and the State Department's counterterrorism coordinator, Michael Sheehan, met with General Musharraf in Islamabad, dangling before him the possibility of a presidential visit in March as a reward for Pakistani cooperation. Such a visit was coveted by Musharraf, partly as a sign of his government's legitimacy. He told the two envoys that he would meet with Mullah Omar and press him on Bin Laden. They left, however, reporting to Washington that Pakistan was unlikely in fact to do anything,\\" given what it sees as the benefits of Taliban control of Afghanistan.\\" President Clinton was scheduled to travel to India. The State Department felt that he should not visit India without also visiting Pakistan. The Secret Service and the CIA, however, warned in the strongest terms that visiting Pakistan would risk the President's life. Counterterrorism officials also argued that Pakistan had not done enough to merit a presidential visit. But President Clinton insisted on including Pakistan in the itinerary for his trip to South Asia. His one-day stopover on March 25, 2000, was the first time a U.S. president had been there since 1969. At his meeting with Musharraf and others, President Clinton concentrated on tensions between Pakistan and India and the dangers of nuclear proliferation, but also discussed Bin Laden. President Clinton told us that when he pulled Musharraf aside for a brief, one-on-one meeting, he pleaded with the general for help regarding Bin Laden.\\" I offered him the moon when I went to see him, in terms of better relations with the United States, if he'd help us get Bin Laden and deal with another issue or two.\\" The U.S. effort continued.

Possible A: sit still, stationary, running, stand still, stay still Why is \\"stand still\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? The answer to this question is:","completion":"\\"Stand still\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because it refers to being motionless and not moving. When you're on the move, you are in motion, making it impossible to stand still at the same time. The other options do not align as closely with the phrasing of the question: 1. \\"Sit still\\" - Although sitting still involves not moving, the question specifically asks about being on the move, which implies standing or walking rather than sitting. 2. \\"Stationary\\" - Being stationary refers to a state of inactivity or not moving, but it doesn't necessarily imply a specific body position like standing still does in the context of the question. 3. \\"Running\\" - Running is an action that involves being in motion, not a state of stillness, so it doesn't align with the question asking about something you cannot do while on the move. 4. \\"Stay still\\" - Although staying still aligns with the idea of not moving, it is a less specific term than standing still. Standing still highlights the contradiction of being on the move and not moving simultaneously in a clearer way.

Question: Which force keeps the planets in their orbits around the Sun? Answer:","completion":"Step 1: Identify the subject of the question. In this case, the subject is the force that keeps planets in their orbits around the Sun. Step 2: Recollect any related fundamental principles or scientific laws. Here, the relevant principle is the concept of gravity, as described by Sir Isaac Newton's law of universal gravitation. Step 3: Apply the identified principle to the subject. According to Newton's law of universal gravitation, every object in the universe attracts every other object with a force that is proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers. Step 4: Consider any effects or consequences of the applied principle. In the context of the Solar System, the Sun's gravity pulls the planets toward it, while the planets' inertia (their tendency to keep moving in a straight line) prevents them from being pulled into the Sun entirely. This balance of forces results in the planets following an elliptical orbit around the Sun. Step 5: Formulate the answer based on the application and consequences of the principle.

He started the week with a course record-tying 63 in the first round at the Stadium Course of TPC at Sawgrass, joining Fred Couples (1992), Greg Norman (1994), and Roberto Castro (2013). He played the front nine (his second nine) in 29 (-7). This was the first time ever, back or front nine, that a player shot below 30 through nine holes at The Players. The final round was delayed due to bad weather while Kaymer was playing the 14th hole. He holed a difficult 28-foot (8.5 m) par putt (with a huge downhill left-to-right-break) on the 17th green to retain his one-stroke lead. His approach shot on 18 was short of the green but he holed the winning putt for par in near darkness and avoided a three-hole playoff. He became the fourth European to win this event (Sandy Lyle in 1987, Sergio Garcia in 2008, and Henrik Stenson in 2009), and is the fourth to win a major, a World Golf Championship, and The Players, joining Tiger Woods, Adam Scott, and Phil Mickelson. Kaymer earned a winner's share of 1.8 million, the largest of his career, and re-entered the top 50 in the Official World Golf Ranking, rising 33 places from 61st to 28th. In June, Kaymer started the U.S. Open at Pinehurst with consecutive rounds of 65 (-5) to set a U.S. Open record for 36 holes (130). He finished at 271 (-9), eight strokes ahead of runners-up Rickie Fowler and Erik Compton, and became the first player in history to win those two championships back to back. (Woods also held both titles concurrently, winning the U.S. Open in 2000 and The Players in March 2001; it moved to May in 2007.) With the win, Kaymer gained exempt status on the PGA Tour through 2019 and rose to eleventh in the world rankings. With his U.S. Open victory in 2014, Martin became the first non-British European golfer ever to win the U.S. Open, and one of few players to win two majors under the age of thirty. In October 2014, Kaymer won the PGA Grand Slam of Golf, the annual 36-hole event featuring the year's four major champions. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: Did he do anything historical during the wins?","completion":"Yes, Martin Kaymer achieved several historical feats during his wins.

A: Answer:","completion":"A process in which heat flows into its surroundings and causes an increase in kinetic energy is called an exothermic process. In an exothermic process, a system releases heat energy to its surroundings, which results in an increase in the internal energy or kinetic energy of the molecules in the environment. This release of heat usually leads to a rise in temperature as the molecules move faster and their kinetic energy increases. Common examples of exothermic processes include chemical reactions such as combustion or oxidation, phase transitions such as freezing or condensation, and some metabolic reactions in living organisms."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the last name of the band member that wrote all the lyrics on the album that went to number one in UK? In 1982, Waters suggested a new musical project with the working title Spare Bricks, originally conceived as the soundtrack album for Pink Floyd – The Wall. With the onset of the Falklands War, Waters changed direction and began writing new material. He saw Margaret Thatcher's response to the invasion of the Falklands as jingoistic and unnecessary, and dedicated the album to his late father. Immediately arguments arose between Waters and Gilmour, who felt that the album should include all new material, rather than recycle songs passed over for The Wall. Waters felt that Gilmour had contributed little to the band's lyrical repertoire. Michael Kamen, a contributor to the orchestral arrangements of The Wall, mediated between the two, also performing the role traditionally occupied by the then-absent Wright. The tension within the band grew. Waters and Gilmour worked independently; however, Gilmour began to feel the strain, sometimes barely maintaining his composure. After a final confrontation, Gilmour's name disappeared from the credit list, reflecting what Waters felt was his lack of songwriting contributions.Though Mason's musical contributions were minimal, he stayed busy recording sound effects for an experimental Holophonic system to be used on the album. With marital problems of his own, he remained a distant figure. Pink Floyd did not use Thorgerson for the cover design, Waters choosing to design the cover himself. Released in March 1983, The Final Cut went straight to number one in the UK and number six in the US. Waters wrote all the lyrics, as well as all the music on the album. Gilmour did not have any material ready for the album and asked Waters to delay the recording until he could write some songs, but Waters refused. Gilmour later commented: \\"I'm certainly guilty at times of being lazy ... but he wasn't right about wanting to put some duff tracks on The Final Cut.\\" Rolling Stone magazine gave the album five stars, with Kurt Loder calling it \\"a superlative achievement ... art rock's crowning...

Instead, you need to figure out how you will transport them. Most fish can survive for around 48 hours of travel, but beyond that you increase the risk that they will not survive. When you stop for the night, you need to take the fish with you. Don’t leave them unattended in cars or trailers. If you need to fly with your fish, contact the airline to find out what requirements they have for transporting fish. Some of the water in your aquarium should be changed prior to moving and transporting the aquarium. This helps ensure that the water in the tank is clean. Switch out 20 percent of the water in the aquarium daily for five days prior to transporting the aquarium.

The fifth chapter of the Gospel of John describes such a pool in Jerusalem, near the Sheep Gate, which is surrounded by five covered colonnades. It is associated with healing. Until the 19th century, there was no evidence outside of Johns Gospel for the existence of this pool; therefore, scholars argued that the gospel was written later, probably by someone without first-hand knowledge of the city of Jerusalem, and that the \\"pool\\" had only a metaphorical, rather than historical, significance. - Jerusalem , is a city located on a plateau in the Judaean Mountains between the Mediterranean and the Dead Sea. One of the oldest cities in the world, Jerusalem was named as \\"\\"Urusalima\\"\\" on ancient Mesopotamian cuneiform tablets, probably meaning \\"City of Shalem\\" after a Canaanite deity, during the early Canaanite period (approximately 2400 BCE). During the Israelite period, significant construction activity in Jerusalem began in the 9th century BCE (Iron Age II), and in the 8th century the city developed into the religious and administrative center of the Kingdom of Judah. It is considered a holy city in the three major Abrahamic religions of Judaism, Christianity and Islam. - Kansas is a U.S. state located in the Midwestern United States. Its capital is Topeka and its largest city is Wichita. Kansas is named after the Kansa Native American tribe, which inhabited the area. The tribe's name (natively \\"\\") is often said to mean \\"people of the wind\\" or \\"people of the south wind\\", although this was probably not the term's original meaning. For thousands of years, what is now Kansas was home to numerous and diverse Native American tribes. Tribes in the eastern part of the state generally lived in villages along the river valleys. Tribes in the western part of the state were semi-nomadic and hunted large herds of bison. - The Walter Reed National Military Medical Center (WRNMMC), formerly known as the National Naval Medical Center and colloquially referred to as the Bethesda Naval Hospital Bethesda, \\"Walter Reed, or Navy Med\\"', is a tri-service military medical center located in the community of Bethesda, Maryland, near the headquarters of the National Institutes of Health. It is one of the most prominent U.S. military medical centers in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area and the United States, having served numerous U.S. presidents since the 20th century. - Claflin is a city in Barton County, Kansas, United States. As of the 2010 census, the city population was 645. - A head of state (or chief of state) is the public persona that officially represents the national unity and legitimacy of a sovereign state. In developing the current Constitution of France (1958), former French president Charles de Gaulle said the head of state should embody \\"the spirit of the nation\\" (\\"\\"). In some countries, typically those with parliamentary governments, the head of state is a ceremonial figurehead that does not actually guide day-to-day government activities and may not even be empowered to exercise any kind of political authority (e.g., Queen Elizabeth II in the United Kingdom). In other countries, the head of state is also the head of government, such as in the U.S., where the president is both a public figurehead and the actual highest ranking political leader who, in practice, oversees the executive branch. - A commander-in-chief is the person or body that exercises supreme operational command and control of a nation's military forces or significant elements of those forces. In the latter case, the force element is those forces within a particular region, or associated by function. As a practical term; it refers to military competencies that reside in a nation-state's executive leadershipeither a head of state, a head of government, a minister of defence, a national cabinet, or some other collegial body. Often, a given country's commander-in-chief (if held by an official) need not be or have been a commissioned officer or even a veteran. This follows the principle of civilian control of the military. - A census-designated place (CDP) is a concentration of population defined by the United States Census Bureau for statistical purposes only. CDPs have been used in each decennial census since 1980 as the counterparts of incorporated places, such as cities, towns, and villages for the purposes of gathering and correlating statistical data. CDPs are populated areas that generally include one officially designated but currently unincorporated small community, for which the CDP is named, plus surrounding inhabited countryside of varying dimensions and, occasionally, other, smaller unincorporated communities as well. CDPs include small rural communities, colonias located along the U.S. border with Mexico, and unincorporated resort and retirement communities and their environs. - The Bethesda Meeting House (BMH) is a historic Presbyterian church complex located at Bethesda, Montgomery County, Maryland, USA. It is situated on Maryland Route 355 (known as Rockville Pike at this point) just inside the Capital Beltway. - The Governor of the State of Kansas is the head of state for the State of Kansas, United States. Under the Kansas Constitution, the Governor is also the head of government, serving as the chief executive of the Kansas executive branch, of the government of Kansas. The Governor is the Commander-in-Chief of the Kansas National Guard when not called into Federal use. Despite being an executive branch official, the Governor also possesses legislative and judicial powers. The Governor's responsibilities include making yearly \\"State of the State\\" addresses to the Kansas Legislature, submitting the budget, ensuring that state laws are enforced, and that the peace is preserved.

Jean-Philippe Rameau (French: [Zafilip Ramo]; (1683-09-25)25 September 1683 - (1764-09-12)12 September 1764) was one of the most important French composers and music theorists of the 18th century. He replaced Jean-Baptiste Lully as the dominant composer of French opera and is also considered the leading French composer for the harpsichord of his time, alongside Francois Couperin. Little is known about Rameau's early years, and it was not until the 1720s that he won fame as a major theorist of music with his Treatise on Harmony (1722) and also in the following years as a composer of masterpieces for the harpsichord, which circulated throughout Europe. Unlike Lully, who collaborated with Philippe Quinault on almost all his operas, Rameau rarely worked with the same librettist twice. He was highly demanding and bad-tempered, unable to maintain longstanding partnerships with his librettists, with the exception of Louis de Cahusac, who collaborated with him on several operas, including Les fetes de l'Hymen et de l'Amour (1747), Zais (1748), Nais (1749), Zoroastre (1749; revised 1756), La naissance d'Osiris (1754), and Anacreon (the first of Rameau's operas by that name, 1754). He is also credited with writing the libretto of Rameau's final work, Les Boreades (c. 1763). Many Rameau specialists have regretted that the collaboration with Houdar de la Motte never took place, and that the Samson project with Voltaire came to nothing because the librettists Rameau did work with were second-rate. He made his acquaintance of most of them at La Poupliniere's salon, at the Societe du Caveau, or at the house of the Comte de Livry, all meeting places for leading cultural figures of the day. Not one of his librettists managed to produce a libretto on the same artistic level as Rameau's music: the plots were often overly complex or unconvincing. But this was standard for the genre, and is probably part of its charm. The versification, too, was mediocre, and Rameau often had to have the libretto modified and rewrite the music after the premiere because of the ensuing criticism. This is why we have two versions of Castor et Pollux (1737 and 1754) and three of Dardanus (1739, 1744, and 1760).

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose less oxygen in the environment happens, how will it affect rocks press harder against each other. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","completion":"To analyze the potential impact of less oxygen in the environment on the process outlined above, let's examine each step, and assess if it could be affected by the decrease in oxygen levels: 1. The earth develops cracks deep beneath the surface: This step is primarily a result of geological processes and tectonic plate movement. Oxygen levels should not have a direct impact on this step. 2. The cracks get very long and big in some places: This step is also a result of geological processes and would not be directly affected by oxygen levels. 3. The earth places pressure against the rocks on both sides of the cracks: Pressure on the rocks is created by the movement of tectonic plates and geological processes. Oxygen levels would not directly affect this process. 4. The pressure causes the rocks to press against each other very hard: Pressure on rocks is a physical process, and changes in oxygen levels would not directly impact this process. 5. The cracks continue to develop: Crack development occurs due to geological processes and is not directly influenced by oxygen levels. 6. The earth moves against itself on both sides of the cracks: This movement is a result of tectonic plate interactions and not influenced by oxygen levels. 7. The pressure and movement around the cracks cause the rocks to crumble in some places: While rock composition can be affected by environmental factors including atmospheric gases, the pressure and movement of tectonic plates are the primary causes of rock crumbling in this context, making the effect of a decrease in oxygen levels indirect at best. 8. A lot of energy is released: Energy release is a result of the movement and interaction of tectonic plates; oxygen levels would not directly affect this process. 9. The energy causes seismic waves: Seismic wave generation is a result of released energy and tectonic plate interactions; it would not be directly influenced by oxygen levels. 10. The seismic waves move the earth in an earthquake: Seismic wave propagation is a result of energy transmission through the earth and would not be directly affected by oxygen levels. In conclusion, the decrease in oxygen levels in the environment would not have a direct effect on the process outlined above. While the change in oxygen levels might indirectly influence rock compositions over long periods of time, it would not directly affect the geological processes related to the development and propagation of earthquakes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It's rare that I feel a need to write a review on this site, but this film is very deserving because of how poorly it was created, and how bias its product was. I felt a distinct attempt on the part of the film-makers to display the Palestinian family as boorish and untrustworthy. We hear them discuss the sadness that they feel from oppression, yet the film is shot and arranged in a way that we feel the politically oppressed population is the Jewish Israeli population. We see no evidence that parallels the position of the Palestinian teenager. We only hear from other Palestinians in prison. I understand restrictions are in place, but the political nature of the restrictions are designed to prevent peace. I came out of the film feeling that the mother of the victim was selfish in her mourning and completely closed minded due to her side of the fence, so to speak. She continued to be unwilling to see the hurt of the bomber's parents, and her angry and closed-minded words caused the final meeting to spiral out of control. It is more realistic, in my mind, to see the Israeli mindset to be a root of the problem; ignored pleas for understanding and freedom, ignored requests for acknowledgment for the process by which the Jewish population acquired the land. I have given this a two because of these selfish weaknesses of the mother, which normally would be admirable in a documentary, however in the light of the lack of impartiality, it all seems exploitative. Also for the poor edits, lack of background in the actual instance, and finally the lack of proper representation of the Palestinian side. Ultimately, it is a poor documentary and a poor film.

Background: Alberto Kenya Fujimori Fujimori (Spanish: [al'berto fuxi'mori, fuji-]; Japanese: [FWzimori]; born 26 July 1938 or 4 August 1938) served as the President of Peru from 28 July 1990 to 22 November 2000. His government is credited with the creation of Fujimorism, defeating the Shining Path insurgency, and restoring Peru's macroeconomic stability. Fujimori ended his presidency by fleeing Peru for Japan amid a major scandal involving corruption and human rights violations. Even amid his prosecution in 2008 for crimes against humanity relating to his presidency, two-thirds of Peruvians polled voiced approval for his leadership in that period. Context: Fujimori obtained his early education at the Colegio Nuestra Senora de la Merced and La Rectora. Fujimori's parents were Buddhists, but he was baptised and raised as a Roman Catholic. While he spoke mainly Japanese at home, Fujimori also learned to become a proficient Spanish speaker during his years at school. In 1956, Fujimori graduated from La gran unidad escolar Alfonso Ugarte in Lima. He went on to undergraduate studies at the Universidad Nacional Agraria La Molina in 1957, graduating in 1961 first in his class as an agricultural engineer. The following year he lectured on mathematics at the university. In 1964 he went to study physics at the University of Strasbourg in France. On a Ford scholarship, Fujimori also attended the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee in the United States, where he obtained his master's degree in mathematics in 1969. In 1974, he married Susana Higuchi, also Japanese-Peruvian. They had four children, including a daughter, Keiko, who followed her father into politics. In recognition of his academic achievements, the sciences faculty of the Universidad Nacional Agraria offered Fujimori the deanship and in 1984 appointed him to the rectorship of the university, which he held until 1989. In 1987, Fujimori also became president of the National Commission of Peruvian University Rectors (Asamblea Nacional de Rectores), a position which he has held twice. He also hosted a TV show called \\"Concertando\\" from 1988 to 1989, on Peru's state-owned network, Channel 7. Fujimori won the 1990 presidential election as a dark horse candidate under the banner of Cambio 90 (\\"cambio\\" means \\"change\\") beating world-renowned writer Mario Vargas Llosa in a surprising upset. He capitalized on profound disenchantment with outgoing president Alan Garcia and the American Popular Revolutionary Alliance party (APRA). He exploited popular distrust of Vargas Llosa's identification with the existing Peruvian political establishment, and uncertainty about his plans for neoliberal economic reforms. During the campaign, Fujimori was nicknamed El Chino, which roughly translates to \\"Chinaman\\"; it is common for people of any East Asian descent to be called chino in Peru, as elsewhere in Latin America, both derogatively and affectionately. Although he is of Japanese heritage, Fujimori has suggested that he was always gladdened by the term, which he perceived as a term of affection. With his election victory, he became just the second person of East Asian descent to become head of government of a Latin American nation, after Fulgencio Batista of Cuba and the third of East Asian descent to govern a South American state, after Arthur Chung of Guyana and Henk Chin A Sen of Suriname (each of whom had served as head of state, rather than head of government). Question: Did he do anything with his career as an agricultural engineer? Answer:","completion":"Yes, Alberto Fujimori utilized his career as an agricultural engineer in various ways. After graduating first in his class as an agricultural engineer from the Universidad Nacional Agraria La Molina in 1961, he took up a lecturing position on mathematics at the same university the following year. In 1984, he was offered the deanship of the sciences faculty at the Universidad Nacional Agraria, and later, he became the rector of the university, a position he held until 1989. His background in agricultural engineering played a significant role in shaping his academic career and bolstering his qualifications before transitioning into the political arena."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","completion":"The last step of the process is the exhalation of carbon dioxide. After the oxygen has been delivered to various cells throughout the body and effectively utilized by them to produce energy, the by-product of this process is carbon dioxide (CO2). The carbon dioxide then diffuses back into the capillaries, which return the deoxygenated blood (containing carbon dioxide) to the heart. From the heart, the deoxygenated blood is pumped through the pulmonary arteries to the lungs, where the carbon dioxide is exchanged for fresh oxygen. In the lungs, CO2 diffuses from the blood vessels into the alveoli, while oxygen simultaneously diffuses from the alveoli into the blood vessels. This gaseous exchange process is known as respiration. When you breathe out, you expel the carbon dioxide through the process of exhalation. The exhaled CO2 travels in the reverse path that the inhaled oxygen took: it moves through the bronchioles, bronchi, and trachea before finally exiting the body through the nose and mouth. Exhalation is essential to maintaining a proper balance of gases in the body and to removing waste products from cellular respiration. Ultimately, this entire process helps to ensure that your body receives the oxygen it requires for optimal functioning and efficiently removes the carbon dioxide that would be harmful if accumulated. So, the last step of the process is: - Carbon dioxide is expelled from the alveoli, through the bronchioles, bronchi, and trachea, and finally exhaled through the nose and mouth, completing the respiratory cycle."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write some highlights for the following article: By. Kerry Mcdermott. PUBLISHED:. 07:59 EST, 4 November 2012. |. UPDATED:. 08:04 EST, 4 November 2012. A couple have told of their horror after discovering an earwig inside a sealed bag of bread rolls picked up on their weekly supermarket shop. Jane Naisbett, who bought the rolls at an Asda Superstore in Sunderland while shopping with her partner Gary MacPhail, said she was 'terrified' when she spotted the bug as she prepared to make some sandwiches. 'If I was partially sighted I might have eaten it,' the 53-year-old said. Shock: The couple say there is no way the earwig could have got into the bag after they brought it home as it was still completely sealed. The disgusted couple, from Hendon in Sunderland, complained to the store on the Leechmere Road Industrial Estate, but Asda bosses say they could not fully investigate because the pair did not leave the item with them. An inspection has since been carried out at the bakery but the supermarket said it found no evidence of insects. Ms Naisbett and her partner Mr MacPhail, a 47-year-old council worker, said they bought the rolls fresh on Monday and put them straight into their freezer when they got home. After removing them to defrost on Wednesday the couple say they found the earwig lurking inside the bag. Disgust: Gary MacPhail and Jane Naisbett, seen with the bread rolls, say they will be taking their business elsewhere. Mr MacPhail said: 'Jane lifted out the pack of rolls to make some sandwiches and when they had defrosted there was earwig inside the bag. 'The bag is still completely sealed, there's no way it could have got in there,' he added. Mr MacPhail claims he was offered a £5 voucher after taking the rolls back to Asda - although the store insists he was offered a £10 voucher as a goodwill gesture. His partner said she would be taking her business elsewhere. 'I've shopped there for over 20 years,' Ms Naisbett said. 'But I won't be setting foot in there again.' An Asda spokesman said: 'The quality of our products is our number one priority and we take any customer complaints incredibly seriously. 'We are at a loss to understand how this could have happened and unfortunately we were not given the opportunity to look at this product or investigate it properly. 'However, a thorough inspection of our bakery has found no evidence of any pests,' the spokesman added. Highlights:","completion":"1.

The Slaver Wildfire. - SPECIAL MESSAGE OF IRRESIDENT BUCHANAN. - NYTimes.com To the Senate and House of Representatives: On the 26th day of April last, Lieut. CRAVEN, of the United States steamer Mohawk, captured the slaver Wildfire, on the coast of Cuba, with five hundren and seven African negroes on board. The prize was brought into Key West on the 30th April, and the negroes were delivered into the custody of FERNANDO J. MORENO, Marshal of the Southern District of Florida. The question which now demands immediate decision is, what disposition shall be made of these Africans? In the annual message to Congress of December 6, 1858, I expressed my opinion in regard to the construction of the act of the 3d March, 1819, \\"In addition to the acts prohibiting the slave trade,\\" so far as the same is applicable to the present case. From this I make the following extract: \\"Under the 2d section of this act the President is authorized to make such regulations and arrangements as he may deem expedient for the safe-keeping, support and removal beyond the limits of the United States of all such negroes, mulattoes, or persons of color captured by vessels of the United States, as may be delivered to the marshal of the district into which they are brought, 'and to appoint a person or persons residing upon the coast of Africa as agent or agents for receiving the negroes, mulattoes, or persons of color delivered from on board vessels seized in the prosecution of the slave trade by commanders of the United States armed vessels.' Mr. MONROE, in his special message of 17th December, 1819, at the first session after the act was passed, announced to Congress what, in his opinion, was its true construction. He believed it to be his duty under it to follow these unfortunates into Africa, and make provision for them there until they should be able to provide for themselves.\\" Adopting this construction of President MONROE, I entered into an agreement with the Colonization Society, dated 7th September, 1858, to receive the Africans which had been captured on the slaver Echo from the agent of the Untied States in Liberia; to furnish them during the period of one year thereafter with comfortable shelter, clothing and provisions; and to cause them to be instructed in the arms of civilized life suitable to their condition, at the rate of 150 for each individual. It was believed that within that period they would be prepared to become citizens of Liberia, and to take care of themselves. As Congress was not then in session, and as there was no outstanding appropriation applicable to this purpose, the Society were obliged to depend for payment on the future action of that body. I recommended this appropriation, and seventy-five thousand dollars were granted by the act of 3d March, 1859, (the Consular and Diplomatic bill) \\"to enable the President of the United States to carry into effect the act of Congress of 3d March, 1819, and any subsequent acts now in force for the suppression of the Slave-trade.\\" Of this appropriation there remains unexpended the sum of twenty-four thousand three hundred and fifty dollars and ninety cents, (24,350 99,) after deducting from it an advance made by the Secretary of the interior out of the judiciary fund of eleven thousand three hundred and forty-eight dollars and ten cents, (11,348 10.) I regret to say that, under the mode adopted in regard to the Africans captured on board the Echo, the expense will be large; but this seems to a great extent to be inevitable, without a violation of the laws of humanity. The expenditure upon this scale for those captured on board the Wildfire will not be less than 100,000, and may considerably exceed that sum. Still it ought to be observed that, during the period when the Government itself, through its own agents, undertook the task of providing for captured negroes in Africa, the cost per head was much greater than that which I agreed to pay the Colonization Society. But it will not be sufficient for Congress to limit the amount appropriated to the case of the Wildfire. It is probable, judging from the increased activity of the slave-trade and the vigilance of our cruisers, that several similar captures may be made before the end of the year. An appropriation ought, therefore, to be granted, large enough to cover such contingencies. The period has arrived when it is indispensable to provide some specific legislation for the guidance of the Executive on this subject. With this view, I would suggest that Congress might authorize the President to enter into a general agreement with the Colonization Society, binding them to receive on the coast of Africa from our agent there all the captured Africans which may be delivered to him, and to maintain them for a limited period, upon such terms and conditions as may combine humanity towards these unfortunates with a just economy. This would obviate the necessity of making a new bargain with every new capture, and would prevent delay and avoid expense in the disposition of the captured. The law might then provide that, in all cases where this may be practicable, the captor should carry the negroes directly to Africa, and deliver them to the American agent there, afterwards bringing the captured vessel to the United States for adjudication. The capturing officer, in case he should bring his prize directly to the United States, ought to be required to land the negroes in some one or more parts to be designated by Congress, where the prevailing health throughout the year is good. At there ports cheap, but permanent accommodations might be provided for the negroes, until they could be sent away, without incurring the expense of electing such accommodations at every port where the capturing officer may think proper to enter. On the preson, occasion these negroes have been brought to Key Wess; and, according to the estimate presented by the Marshal of the Southern District of Florida to the Secretary of the Interior, the cost of providing temporary quarters for them will be 2,500, and the aggregates expenses for the single month of May will amount to 12,000. But this is far from being the worst evil. Within a few weeks the yellow fever will most probably prevail at Key West; and hence the Marshal press their removal from their present quarters at an early day, which must be done, in any event, as soon as practicable. For these reasons I earnestly commend this subject to the immediate attention of Congress. It is truly lamentable that Great Britain and the United States should be obliged to expend such a vast amount of blood and treasure for the suppression of the African Slave-trade; and this when the only portions of the civilized world where it is tolerated and encouraged are the Spanish islands of Cuba and Porto Rico. JAMES BUCHANAN. What are the most important parts of this text?","completion":"The most important parts of the text are as follows: 1. The capture of the slaver Wildfire: On April 26, Lt. Craven of the United States steamer Mohawk captured the slaver ship Wildfire off the coast of Cuba. The ship carried 507 African slaves onboard, who were later delivered to the custody of Marshal Fernando J. Moreno in Key West, Florida. 2. The question of the Africans' fate: President James Buchanan raises the issue of what should be done with the captured Africans, and refers to a previous message where he addressed the construction of the act of March 3, 1819, regarding the suppression of the slave trade. 3. President Monroe's interpretation of the act: Buchanan adopts President James Monroe's interpretation of the act, which stated that the responsibility of the U.S. Government extended to providing for the captured Africans in Africa until they could provide for themselves. 4. Agreement with the Colonization Society: Buchanan had entered into an agreement with the Colonization Society on September 7, 1858, to receive captured Africans, provide them with shelter, clothing, and provisions for a year, and instruct them in civilized life at a rate of 150 per individual. 5. Appropriation of funds: Buchanan laments the large expenses incurred in providing for captured Africans but argues that it is essential to adhere to the laws of humanity. He informs that 24,350.99 remains unexpended after previous appropriations and calls upon Congress to allocate more funds to accommodate potential future captures. 6. Suggestion for specific legislation: Buchanan urges Congress to provide specific legislation for the guidance of the Executive, suggesting that the President be authorized to enter into a general agreement with the Colonization Society for receiving and maintaining captured Africans for a limited period. He proposes that captors should carry the captured directly to Africa and then bring the captured vessel to the United States for adjudication. 7. Designation of specific ports for landing captured Africans: Buchanan emphasizes the need to designate specific ports with good prevailing health conditions for landing captured Africans, to avoid the significant expenses incurred in providing temporary accommodations at various ports. 8. Criticism of Spanish islands tolerating the slave trade: The text concludes with lamentation that Great Britain and the United States have spent considerable resources suppressing the African Slave-trade, particularly when it is only tolerated and encouraged in the Spanish islands of Cuba and Puerto Rico."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

We all eventually die, even though we usually what? - seek help - write will - wish we could - never want - go to hell The best answer is Answer:","completion":"We all eventually die, even though we usually wish we could live forever. Death is a natural part of the cycle of life, and it is something that every living being on this planet must face. Nevertheless, many people harbor a deep fear of death and hope to stave it off for as long as possible. This longing for immortality is a part of human nature, reflecting our desire to continue experiencing life and to leave a lasting legacy behind. Throughout history, humans have searched for ways to extend their lives and seek help in their quest for longevity. Medical science has consistently progressed and advanced, allowing us to live longer and healthier lives than our ancestors. In addition to medical advancements, people also turn to healthy lifestyles, including good nutrition, exercise, and stress management as ways to enhance and prolong their lives. One way individuals attempt to maintain a sense of control over their mortality is by preparing for the inevitable through writing a will. A will is a legal document that outlines how a person's assets and possessions will be distributed after their death. The creation of a will can help ensure that our loved ones are taken care of, and our possessions are divided as per our wishes, providing a sense of comfort in the face of life's uncertainty. Nevertheless, no one can predict or control when their time will come, which can lead to feelings of fear and anxiety. People often never want to confront the reality of their own mortality, preferring to avoid the topic altogether. Some may even harbor fantasies of evading death, inspired by mythology, fiction, or religious beliefs that promise eternal life or reincarnation. In various religious and cultural traditions, the concept of an afterlife or spiritual realm, such as heaven or hell, provides a moral framework for how we lead our lives. For some, the idea of going to hell represents a catastrophic end, which they strive to avoid by adhering to the tenets of their faith or seeking forgiveness for their perceived wrongs. This desire to avoid punishment or reach a peaceful afterlife can influence people's actions and moral choices throughout their lives. In conclusion, although we all eventually die, we usually wish we could live forever and seek help in delaying the inevitable. We express this desire through pursuing healthy lifestyles, relying on medical advancements, making preparations for our death through writing a will, and seeking solace and meaning in our religious and cultural beliefs. Our complex relationship with death is influenced by both biological instincts and societal factors, making it an enduring and fascinating aspect of the human experience."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Translate to English English:","completion":"We also do not know how the reduced appropriations are supposed to be distributed over the next few years. English: The original statement in Finnish, \\"Emme myöskään tiedä, miten pienennetyt määrärahat on tarkoitus jakaa muutaman seuraavan vuoden aikana,\\" conveys the uncertainty and concern regarding the allocation of reduced budgetary funds in the coming years. In this context, \\"pienennetyt määrärahat\\" refers to the reduced appropriations or budget funds, while \\"jakaa\\" means to distribute or allocate. The issue highlighted in this statement is a common challenge faced by organizations, governments, and institutions when confronted with a need to adjust to budget cuts or reduced financial resources. In these situations, decision makers must carefully consider various factors, such as the organization's priorities, the impact on the stakeholders, and the long-term consequences of their choices. Moreover, it is crucial for those in leadership positions to clearly communicate their plans and reasons behind the allocation decisions to promote transparency and accountability. This type of information sharing can alleviate some concerns, assist in gaining the understanding and support from affected parties, and foster collaboration in finding alternative solutions. For instance, organizations can explore cost-saving measures, more efficient processes, or additional funding sources to minimize the impact of budget reductions. As the statement implies a lack of knowledge about the distribution of the reduced appropriations, it may be helpful to engage in open discussions with relevant stakeholders and decision makers. Analyzing historical data, understanding current needs and priorities, and considering potential future requirements can aid in formulating a well-informed and strategic approach to allocating the limited funds over the next few years. Additionally, monitoring and adjusting the allocation process based on the evolving circumstances and needs can result in more effective utilization of the available resources, ultimately contributing to the sustainability and success of the entity facing budget constraints."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

But giving yourself a little TLC can do wonders for your mental and physical wellbeing. It's essential to take some time out and indulge in a home spa day that nourishes your body and soul. In this article, we'll guide you through a step-by-step process to create the perfect pampering experience. Step 1: Prepare the Space Transform your bathroom into a sanctuary by lighting candles, playing soft music, and setting the perfect water temperature. Dim the lights, and place a soft fluffy towel near the bathtub. Creating a soothing atmosphere allows you to fully relax and unwind. Step 2: Take a Relaxing Bath Fill your bathtub with warm water and add Epsom salts, essential oils, or a bubble bath solution. Soak in the tub for at least 20 minutes, allowing your mind to clear and your muscles to loosen up. The warm water will also open your pores, preparing your skin for the treatments to follow. Step 3: Apply a Face Mask Choose a face mask that caters to your skin's specific needs, such as a moisturizing, purifying, or brightening formula. Apply the mask evenly to clean skin and leave it on for the recommended time. Face masks are designed to address various skin concerns, and they create a luxurious feeling while nourishing your skin. Step 4: Try a Hot Oil Hair Treatment Warm up your favorite hair oil (such as coconut, olive, or argan oil) and massage it into your scalp and through the length of your hair. Wrap your hair in a warm towel and let the oil penetrate deeply for 20-30 minutes. Hot oil treatments can improve hair health by providing moisture, reducing frizz, and strengthening hair shafts. Step 5: Make and Apply a Sugar Scrub Mix equal parts sugar and oil (such as coconut or olive oil) to create a simple and effective body scrub. Apply the scrub in a circular motion, focusing on rough areas like elbows and knees. Sugar scrubs help remove dead skin cells, revealing softer and smoother skin. Step 6: Indulge in a Foot Treatment Soak your feet in warm water with Epsom salts and a few drops of your preferred essential oil. After about 10-15 minutes, gently scrub your feet with a pumice stone to remove any dead skin. Finish by massaging a foot cream onto your feet to lock in moisture. Step 7: Paint Your Nails Choose a nail polish color that makes you happy and paint your nails to complete your home spa experience. Painting your nails is not only a fun way to express your style, but it also helps maintain healthy nail beds and cuticles. Conclusion: A luxurious home spa day is the perfect way to relax and rejuvenate your body, mind, and spirit.

Plot title: The Lorax Movie plot: Ted Wiggins is an idealistic boy, who lives in \\"Thneedville\\", a walled city that, aside from the human citizens, is completely artificial; everything is made of plastic, metal, or synthetics with no living plants. Ted has a crush on local environmentalist Audrey, who wants to see a \\"real tree\\" more than anything in the world, and decides to find one in order to impress her. His energetic Grammy Norma secretly tells Ted the legend of the Once-ler, who will tell anyone about trees if they brought him fifteen cents, a nail, and a shell of a great-great-great grandfather snail. When Ted leaves Thneedville in search of the Once-ler, he discovers that the outside world is a contaminated, empty wasteland. Once the boy finds him, the Once-ler agrees to tell Ted about the trees on the condition that he listens to the story over multiple visits. Ted agrees, but on his way home, he encounters the mayor of Thneedville, Mr. Aloysius O'Hare, who is also the proprietor of a company that sells bottled oxygen to Thneedville residents. O'Hare explains to Ted that because trees produce oxygen free of charge, he considers it a threat to his business whenever he hears people talking about them. After revealing that he has \\"security camera eyes\\" all over the city, O'Hare pressures Ted to stay in town. However, Ted continues to sneak out of O'Hare's sight (with his grandmother's encouragement) and learns more of the trees' history. Over Ted's various visits, the Once-ler recounts the story that when he was a young man, he departed his family to find good material for his Thneed invention and make a business. After stumbling upon a lush Truffula Tree forest valley, the Once-ler meets the guardian of the forest, the Lorax, after cutting down a Truffula Tree. The Lorax urges the Once-ler to leave the forest, but the Once-ler refuses. Eventually, the Once-ler promises not to chop another tree down, and the two seem to begin a friendship of sorts. Then, the young businessman's Thneed invention becomes a major success and the Once-ler's... My question: Who is expelled from the town?

The primary antagonist, Mr. Aloysius O'Hare, tries to prevent Ted from discovering the truth about the trees and eventually faces opposition from Ted, his family, and the citizens of Thneedville.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize the following: Every Medic possesses a 40/150 Syringe Gun (Primary), the class defining Medi-Gun (Secondary) and their last resort, the Bonesaw (Melee). They may also unlock a series of alternate weapons by successfully completing Medic Achievements. Use the Bonesaw sparingly, at point-blank range. Melee kills are always fun, and melee weapons have taken quite a boost in power since the Team Fortress Classic (TFC) crowbar, but don't get cocky. Save your Bonesaw for stealthy strikes from behind, or if your attacker is right next to you and retreating isn't an option. Otherwise, you're usually better off healing another teammate and letting them finish the job for you instead. Use the Syringe Gun for distance shots. As the name implies, the Syringe Gun fires hypodermic needles. It is not the most powerful weapon in TF2, but it is often underestimated by most players. An experienced player can be lethal with the Syringe Gun in their hands. Note that the needles from the Syringe Gun actually fire slightly to the right of where the crosshair is. Fire at a wall from varying distances and look where the needles land to get a feel of where to aim. They also arc downward rather quickly. You'll need to aim upward and to the left with the Syringe Gun if you intend to hit any enemies from a distance. This does, however, make it useful to shoot over short hills. The Syringe Gun's needles travel through the air slowly, which can make them easy for other players to dodge them. Keep this in mind. Try using the Syringe Gun to provide cover fire for your team. They'll stay in the air long enough to travel at enemies that like to sidestep back and forth from corners. Since the Syringe Gun's projectiles move through the air slowly, it is a good strategy to fire if an enemy is chasing you, with you either standing still, moving towards him, or backtracking. If he moves towards your syringes, he is more likely to get hit and thus die. This is essentially a given; your teammates will respect you for being able to heal them effectively and quickly. The biggest change to the Medic since TFC is his ability to heal from a distance. You can now space yourself out from between your teammate as you heal them to avoid splash damage. You don't have to keep your crosshairs on the player to keep healing them, so you should look around frequently to keep an eye on the rest of the battlefield; it's a good idea to look for other wounded players, and keep an eye out for approaching Spies and Pyros. In addition to healing, your Medi Gun can raise a player's health to 150% more of their maximum health. This will slowly return back to its maximum when you stop healing them. You can tell how \\"overhealed\\" a player is by the white glowing/pulsating surrounding his or her health cross; the bigger this glow, the more over healing they have received. You will earn an \\"assist kill\\" if you are healing a teammate that gets a kill point. As you heal players, you will notice that the small bar on the bottom right corner of your HUD will start to fill itself. This is your ÜberCharge meter. When this reaches 100%, the Medic will announce that he is \\"charged\\". By right-clicking, you will activate the ÜberCharge, which will make you and your healing target completely invulnerable for a maximum of 8 seconds Note that you and your target cannot capture points when Über Charged. Similarly, you and your target will not be able to carry the enemy intelligence (flag). However, you can still prevent the enemy team from taking a capture point while ÜberCharged. Your ÜberCharge meter will fill fastest when healing a damaged player. It fills slowest when over healing a player who is already at 150% of their maximum health. This gives Medics an incentive to take care of his team as a whole, rather than to attach themselves to the nearest Heavy. The announcement of \\"I am charged!\\" can be heard by nearby enemies. If you wish to cover up this tell-tale signal so they are less likely to be prepared for it, you can call for a Medic (or any other vocal command) just as the meter reaches 100%, and it will override the passive \\"I am charged!\\" announcement. Summary:","completion":"A Medic in the game has three main tools: a Syringe Gun for shooting from a distance, a Medi-Gun for healing teammates, and a Bonesaw for close fighting. The Medic can unlock more weapons by finishing achievements. You should use the Bonesaw only when you're really close to an enemy, and it's better to heal your teammates and let them fight instead. The Syringe Gun shoots needles that go a little to the right and down, so you need to aim up and left to hit enemies far away. It's good for slowing down enemies as well. The Medi-Gun can heal friends from far away, making them feel better and even stronger than usual. This helps the team because your friends can fight better and you can help them by looking out for sneaky enemies. When you heal a lot, you can use a special power called ÜberCharge that makes you and your friend invincible for a short time. But, you can't win the game while using it, so use it to help your friends in tough fights. Remember to heal all your friends, not just the big strong ones, to be a good Medic and keep the team strong and healthy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Choose between \\"Motorcycle Far\\" and \\"Motorcycle Near\\". Question: As the motorcycle pulled away from Rick he realized that it became (A) quieter (B) louder","completion":"As the motorcycle pulled away from Rick, he realized that it became (A) quieter. This phenomenon can be explained by the Doppler effect and other factors associated with the physics of sound and distance. The Doppler effect is the change in frequency and wavelength of a wave concerning an observer who is moving relative to the wave source. In this scenario, the observer (Rick) is stationary, and the wave source (the motorcycle) is moving. When the motorcycle is near Rick, the engine's noise, including exhaust and mechanical sounds, is quite intense as the sound waves have minimal distance to travel. As the motorcycle begins to pull away, those sound waves take increasingly longer to reach Rick. Consequently, the frequency of the sound waves decreases, and the perceived pitch drops. This effect is the Doppler shift, and it is responsible for the noticeable change in the motorcycle's sound as it distances itself from Rick. Additionally, sound travels in different ways, such as through the air and via reflection off various surfaces (e.g., the ground, buildings, or other objects in the vicinity). As the motorcycle moves further away, the number of reflecting surfaces decreases, and the waves traverse a longer path through the air before reaching Rick's ears. Thus, the sound waves dissipate more energy, resulting in a quieter motorcycle noise for the observer. In conclusion, several factors contribute to the motorcycle sounding quieter as it moves away from Rick. The Doppler effect, which decreases the sound wave frequency and perceived pitch, and the physical properties of sound propagation and reflection, which cause energy dissipation and lowered intensity, all play a significant role. So, the correct response to the question is (A) quieter."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Eddie James \\"Son\\" House, Jr. (March 21, 1902 - October 19, 1988) was an American delta blues singer and guitarist, noted for his highly emotional style of singing and slide guitar playing. After years of hostility to secular music, as a preacher and for a few years also as a church pastor, he turned to blues performance at the age of 25. He quickly developed a unique style by applying the rhythmic drive, vocal power and emotional intensity of his preaching to the newly learned idiom. In a short career interrupted by a spell in Parchman Farm penitentiary, he developed to the point that Charley Patton, the foremost blues artist of the Mississippi Delta region, invited him to share engagements and to accompany him to a 1930 recording session for Paramount Records. House was born in the hamlet of Lyon, north of Clarksdale, Mississippi, the second of three brothers, and lived in the rural Mississippi Delta until his parents separated, when he was about seven or eight years old. His father, Eddie House, Sr., was a musician, playing the tuba in a band with his brothers and sometimes playing the guitar. He was a church member but also a drinker; he left the church for a time, on account of his drinking, but then gave up alcohol and became a Baptist deacon. Young Eddie House adopted the family commitment to religion and churchgoing. He also absorbed the family love of music but confined himself to singing, showing no interest in the family instrumental band, and hostile to the blues on religious grounds. When House's parents separated, his mother took him to Tallulah, Louisiana, across the Mississippi River from Vicksburg, Mississippi. When he was in his early teens, they moved to Algiers, New Orleans. Recalling these years, he would later speak of his hatred of blues and his passion for churchgoing (he described himself as \\"churchy\\" and \\"churchified\\"). At fifteen, probably while living in Algiers, he began preaching sermons. At the age of nineteen, while living in the Delta, he married Carrie Martin, an older woman from New Orleans. This was a significant step for House; he married in church and against family opposition. The couple moved to her hometown of Centerville, Louisiana, to help run her father's farm. After a couple of years, feeling used and disillusioned, House recalled, \\"I left her hanging on the gatepost, with her father tellin' me to come back so we could plow some more.\\" Around the same time, probably 1922, House's mother died. In later years, he was still angry about his marriage and said of Carrie, \\"She wasn't nothin' but one of them New Orleans whores\\". House's resentment of farming extended to the many menial jobs he took as a young adult. He moved frequently, on one occasion taking off to East Saint Louis to work in a steel plant. The one job he enjoyed was on a Louisiana horse ranch, which later he celebrated by wearing a cowboy hat in his performances. He found an escape from manual labor when, following a conversion experience (\\"getting religion\\") in his early twenties, he was accepted as a paid pastor, first in the Baptist Church and then in the Colored Methodist Episcopal Church. However, he fell into habits which conflicted with his calling--drinking like his father and probably also womanizing. This led him after several years of conflict to leave the church, ceasing his full-time commitment, although he continued to preach sermons from time to time. How long was he a pastor?","completion":"Son House was a pastor for a few years in his early twenties. His stint as a pastor began after a conversion experience (\\"getting religion\\"), and he was a paid pastor in both the Baptist Church and the Colored Methodist Episcopal Church during that time. However, he eventually left the church due to personal conflicts and habits, such as drinking and possibly womanizing, which contradicted his religious commitment.

At the age of 4, she discovers the local library and walks there every day to read while her father is at work, her mother is playing bingo, and her older brother, Michael (Brian Levinson), is at school. At age six-and-a-half, Matilda begins to lose patience with her parents, expressing a desire to go to school. In retaliation for her father constantly berating her, she adds hydrogen peroxide to his hair tonic, turning his hair an unhealthy blonde. He takes his children to his workshop, where he reveals that the cars he sells are faulty. Matilda accuses him of being dishonest and he belittles her, so she responds by putting super glue on his hat, forcing Zinnia to cut it off of his head. She reads a borrowed library copy of Moby-Dick, which Harry rips up while her family is watching television. When he forces her to watch with them, she becomes increasingly angry and causes the television set to suddenly explode. Agatha Trunchbull (Pam Ferris) is the tyrannical principal of a rundown elementary school, Crunchem Hall.

She wrote a book – Come As You Are. Here’s a secret: the entire sexology community was eager to get their mitts on her book, it was very exciting. I can’t recall the last time there was that much hullabaloo about one book. In this important book, Dr Nagoski explains the interplay between sexual desire and stress — a concept that gives us a unique insight into what is going on in women’s sex lives. THE ACCELERATOR AND THE BRAKES This concept is a big deal. Think of the accelerator and the brake of a car. Each pedal acts independently from one another; you can press on the accelerator and you can stomp on the brakes. You can even press both at the same time. We don’t often press them at the same time – in fact, I was specifically told NOT to do that in driver’s ed – but anyhow, pretend you do. If you press both pedals all the way to the floor of the car, do you stop or go? That’s right, you STOP! Ok, now get this, your brake pedal is all the stress you have and your accelerator is your sexual desire. In the same way that the brake and accelerator of a car are two separate pedals yet also inextricably linked, so are your stress and your arousal. They are not the same things, yet have everything to do with one another. If your stress level is high, the majority of women have brakes that turn on, meaning, no matter how much sexy stuff is going on around her, she does not want sex at all. It is like she is pressing down the brakes and the accelerator at the same time. This isn’t the case for all women; some women have extremely sensitive brakes or extremely sensitive accelerators. And as Nagoski has found, while this correlation between stress and sexual desire is more common for women, men experience it too (just not quite as often).

A young man, \\"Eighteen,\\" is walking through the city streets with his girlfriend, and he is kidnapped. As police detective Victor Fuentes (Jesús Ochoa) consoles the family, Eighteen's wealthy father receives a call from human trafficker Daniel Sanchez (Gustavo Sánchez Parra), who is very interested in Eighteen's ten million dollar life insurance policy. The father and Fuentes arrange a dead drop, and Eighteen is found near a freeway overpass, blindfolded and in his underwear, but alive.

Article:Consisting of two regions separated by some 640 miles of the South China Sea, Malaysia is a multi-ethnic, multi-religious federation of 13 states and three federal territories. The majority Muslim ethnic Malay are dominant politically, and benefit from positive discrimination in business, education and the civil service, but a large ethnic Chinese minority holds economic power. The communities coexist in relative harmony, although there is little racial interaction, and a religious divide persists. The country is benefiting from a growth in manufacturing, and is a major tourist destination, but there are fears that development could harm the environment, particularly the rainforests of northern Borneo, which are under pressure from palm oil plantations and illegal logging. Population 29.3 million (UN, 2012) Area 329,847 sq km (127,355 sq miles) Major languages Malay (official), English, Chinese dialects, Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam Major religions Islam, Buddhism, Taoism, Hinduism, Christianity, Sikhism Life expectancy 73 years (men), 77 years (women) Currency Ringgit Head of state: Tuanku Abdul Halim Tuanku Abdul Halim was appointed the 14th paramount ruler, Malaysia's head of state, in December 2011. The post of paramount ruler is rotated every five years among the sultans of the nine Malay kingdoms. Prime minister: Najib Abdul Razak Najib Razak, the scion of an longstanding Malaysian political dynasty, assumed the post of prime minister following the resignation of his predecessor in 2009. He was sworn in for a second term after the National Front coalition won the 2013 elections with a weakened majority to extend its unbroken, 56-year rule, in the face of the strongest opposition ever. Opponents alleged major electoral fraud. On coming to power, Mr Najib pledged radical reforms and a more transparent government, including closing closing a widening ethnic and religious divide, after ethnic minorities shifted towards the opposition in large numbers in the 2008 polls, fearing their rights were being eroded. But his rise to power was marked by a government crackdown on the resurgent opposition, with allegations that strong-arm tactics were being used to stifle political dissent. Malaysia has some of the toughest censorship laws in the world. The authorities exert substantial control over the media and can impose restrictions in the name of national security. TV3 is the leading national private, terrestrial broadcaster. Privately-owned TVs have close ties to the ruling National Front coalition, while state outlets reflect government views, says US-based Freedom House. Most privately-owned print titles are run by parties or business groups allied with the ruling coalition. Newspapers must renew their publication licences annually, and the home minister can suspend or revoke publishing permits. The internet has become the main platform for free discussion and for exposing political corruption, says Freedom House. But Malaysia is listed as a country \\"under surveillance\\" in Reporters Without Borders' (RSF) \\"Enemies of the Internet\\" report. Some key dates in Malaysia's history: 14th century - Conversion of Malays to Islam begins. 1826 - British settlements of Malacca, Penang and Singapore unite; British begin to establish protectorates over the Malay sultanates of the peninsula. 1895 - Four Malay states combine to form the Federated Malay States. 1942-45 - Japanese occupation. 1948 - British-ruled Malayan territories unified under Federation of Malaya. 1957 - Federation of Malaya becomes independent. 1965 - Singapore withdraws from Malaysia. 2001 - Malaysia, Singapore resolve long-standing disputes, and agree to build a new bridge and tunnel. 2003 - Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad steps down after 22 years in office.

To protect its seagoing interests and trade routes, Portugal established strategic garrisons in Goa (India), Malacca (East Indies), and Hormuz in the Persian Gulf. Portuguese explorers then embarked upon Macau (now Macao), the Congo, and various other parts of Africa, including the Sudan. The Portuguese policy was to avoid armed strife and to develop a trade empire, rather than to conquer nations. To this end it succeeded with relatively few blood-soaked episodes in its colonial history. Adventures abroad, however, proved disastrous during the second half of the 16th century. In 1557 the 14-year-old boy-king Sebastião ascended the throne, the beginning of a calamitous reign that was to end at the battle of Alcacer-Quiber (Morocco) in pursuit of a vain crusade. Sebastião's untimely demise, alongside some 18,000 ill-prepared, badly led followers, set the stage for a crisis of succession. For many years afterwards, legends and rumors bizarrely insisted that the king was still alive, and imposters turned up from time to time claiming the throne; those who were plausible enough to be deemed a threat were summarily executed. In fact, the only rightful claimant to the crown was the elderly Prince Henry. But after two years of alternating between the throne and his sickbed, he died, heirless. Surveying the situation and smelling an opportunity, Spain occupied the power vacuum, and Portugal's neighbor and long-time antagonist became its master. Spanish rule dictated Portugal's inadvertent involvement in Spain's ongoing wars. In 1587 a squadron of British ships commanded by Francis Drake attacked the Algarve (now a \\"legitimate target\\" as Spanish territory) and sacked Sagres, thus depriving the world of the relics of Henry the Navigator. Nine years later Faro was torched. The 1386 Treaty of Windsor, by which Britain and Portugal had pledged eternal friendship, seemed a distant memory. Portugal's empire was gradually eroded, and many of its trading posts (with the notable exception of Brazil) were picked off by the British and Dutch. Finally, after 60 years of Spanish rule, Portuguese noblemen (aided by the French, then at war with Spain) organized a palace coup and restored independence. The Great Disaster Portugal's greatest misfortune struck on All Saint's Day, 1 November 1755.

Which famous horror movie star was buried in his Dracula costume?","completion":"To find the answer to this question, I will search for information on famous actors who played Dracula and were buried in their costumes. Step 1: Identify the most famous portrayals of Dracula in movies. Several actors like Bela Lugosi, Christopher Lee, and Gary Oldman have starred as Dracula in various movies. Step 2: Find information on their death and burial. Bela Lugosi passed away in 1956, Christopher Lee died in 2015, and Gary Oldman is still alive as of my knowledge. Step 3: Check if any of them was buried in their Dracula costume. After searching for information on their burials, I found that Bela Lugosi was buried wearing one of his Dracula capes at his request in his funeral.

Paragraph: Honours and legacy In 1929, Soviet writer Leonid Grossman published a novel The d'Archiac Papers, telling the story of Pushkin's death from the perspective of a French diplomat, being a participant and a witness of the fatal duel. The book describes him as a liberal and a victim of the Tsarist regime. In Poland the book was published under the title Death of the Poet. In 1937, the town of Tsarskoye Selo was renamed Pushkin in his honour. There are several museums in Russia dedicated to Pushkin, including two in Moscow, one in Saint Petersburg, and a large complex in Mikhaylovskoye. Pushkin's death was portrayed in the 2006 biographical film Pushkin: The Last Duel. The film was directed by Natalya Bondarchuk. Pushkin was portrayed onscreen by Sergei Bezrukov. The Pushkin Trust was established in 1987 by the Duchess of Abercorn to commemorate the creative legacy and spirit of her ancestor and to release the creativity and imagination of the children of Ireland by providing them with opportunities to communicate their thoughts, feelings and experiences.

It is often considered common courtesy, for example, to message a distant acquaintance on Facebook with a brief greeting before adding them as a friend. If a website or application does list any social expectations, of course, it is good practice to follow them. Many online forums, including the more updated and newfangled Reddit, will list their rules of engagement.

Movie title: Burn After Reading Context: Faced with a demotion at work due to a drinking problem, Osbourne Cox angrily quits his job as a CIA analyst and resolves to write a memoir about his life and career. When his pediatrician wife Katie finds out, she sees it as a justifiable opportunity to file for divorce and continue her adulterous affair unimpeded. Taking her lawyer's advice, she copies financial records and several other files from her husband's computer onto a CD. These files contain a rambling, meaningless diatribe by Cox on purported CIA activities. When the CD gets left on the locker room floor of Hardbodies, a local gym, by a careless law firm employee, it falls into the hands of dim-witted personal trainer Chad Feldheimer and his co-worker Linda Litzke, who mistakenly believe the numerical data in the Coxes' bank records, and especially, Cox's diatribes, to be highly sensitive government information. After getting the data traced back to Osbourne, who thinks his memoirs have been stolen, Chad and Linda plan to give the disc back to him for a reward, with Linda planning to use the money to pay for plastic surgery. When a phone call and subsequent meeting with Osbourne provoke a furious reaction and go horribly wrong, Chad and Linda turn over the disc to the Russian embassy, offering more information in return for monetary compensation. With no other data to give them, Linda persuades Chad to sneak into the Coxes' home to get more files from their computer. Meanwhile, Osbourne's increasingly erratic behavior, aggravated in part by his encounters with Chad and Linda, prompt Katie to move ahead with the divorce proceedings. She changes the locks on their house, forcing Osbourne to move onto the sailboat they have docked on the Chesapeake Bay. With her husband out of the picture, Katie invites her lover, Harry Pfarrer, to move in. A womanizing, multi-adulterous deputy U.S. Marshal, Harry is coincidentally also secretly seeing Linda.

With 61 million inhabitants, it is the fourth most populous EU member state. - The Adriatic Sea is a body of water separating the Italian Peninsula from the Balkan peninsula and the Apennine Mountains from the Dinaric Alps and adjacent ranges. The Adriatic is the northernmost arm of the Mediterranean Sea, extending from the Strait of Otranto (where it connects to the Ionian Sea) to the northwest and the Po Valley. The countries with coasts on the Adriatic are Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Greece, Italy, Montenegro and Slovenia.

Tidal movements in the Adriatic are slight, although larger amplitudes are known to occur occasionally. The Adriatic's salinity is lower than the Mediterranean's because the Adriatic collects a third of the fresh water flowing into the Mediterranean, acting as a dilution basin. The surface water temperatures generally range from in summer to in winter, significantly moderating the Adriatic Basin's climate. - Winnetou is a fictional Native American hero of several novels written in German by Karl May (18421912), one of the best-selling German writers of all time with about 200 million copies worldwide, including the \\"Winnetou\\"-trilogy. - Friuli-Venezia Giulia is one of the 20 regions of Italy, and one of five autonomous regions with special statute.

Emona itself was the region's easternmost city, although it was assumed formerly that it was part of the Pannonia or Illyricum, but archaeological findings from 2008 proved otherwise. It was located in the area where the navigable Ljubljanica came closest to Castle Hill. The river played an important role as a transport route for the trade between the city and the rest of Roman empire. From the late 4th to the late 6th century, Emona was the seat of a bishopric that had intensive contacts with the ecclesiastical circle of Milan, reflected in the architecture of the early Christian complex along Erjavec Street in present-day Ljubljana. - The Gulf of Trieste (, ) is a very shallow bay of the Adriatic Sea, in the extreme northern part of the Adriatic Sea.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more insulin will be released happens, how will it affect LESS regulation of blood sugar level being needed. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","completion":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of more insulin being released can have an indirect effect on the process. When more insulin than needed is released, it will cause the body to absorb more glucose than necessary from the blood, leading to lower blood sugar levels. As a result, less regulation of blood sugar levels is needed as the body has already significantly decreased the glucose levels in the blood. However, this can also lead to an imbalance, as overly low blood sugar levels (hypoglycemia) can cause various symptoms and complications. In response to this situation, cells in the pancreas will release glucagon, causing the liver to convert stored glycogen into glucose and increasing blood sugar levels back to normal. In this way, the perturbation of more insulin being released can indirectly affect the process by causing a temporary imbalance in blood sugar levels, ultimately leading to the body's regulatory mechanisms attempting to restore normal glucose levels."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In the last half of the film, he becomes intruder himself, returning in ancient french colony in the hope of atoning for the past. The overall tone is bitter rather than pathetic, full of regrets and guilts, sense of failure being more or less dominant.

However, the reviewer also points out that the film's overall tone is bitter, filled with regret, guilt, and a sense of failure, painting a rather grim picture of old age.

There was a dirt road through the tract, but further down, it crossed two huge concrete pipes. The dirt was washed out between them, and the deep gulch made it impossible to cross in a car. Sometimes, eight or ten of us would go looking for parked cars. If we found one or more, we would go move this incredibly heavy stump onto the road and lay a telephone pole across it. It took all of us and it was incredibly heavy. It was impossible to drive around it because of the ditches and there was no way two or three people could move it. We'd go back to the car and set off a big string of fire crackers or shake the cat and slap on it and run like crazy. We'd watch from the woods as they drove like heck and come to a screeching stop at our roadblock. The guy would get out and try to lift the pole. Never happen. Then the car would drive the other way. That wouldn't happen because of the pipes. We'd go home leaving them in there. This was before cell phones, and it was miles to a pay phone. We'd go back the next day and find the stump and pole moved. We thought it was real funny until one night we set it up and beat on the trunk of a car. A couple was inside, getting it on. We hadn't noticed a guy sitting on the hood with a bottle of booze and a pistol. As we ran, he was shooting and we could hear bullets going through the underbrush. No one was hit, thank goodness. That was the end of that stunt. How does the group (or some) of boys feel after the shooting episode? Pick the correct answer from the following options: A. Thankful they were not hit B. not enough information C. Amused about the episode D. Consider it fun to continue looking for parked cars The answer is:","completion":"A.

It is expressed that the boys could hear bullets whizzing through the underbrush, but luckily, no one was hit. After this frightening experience, the boys decided to put an end to their prank. It can be inferred from the story that the group of boys, or at least some of them, felt thankful that they were not hit during the shooting episode.

Background: Rasputin was born a peasant in the small village of Pokrovskoye, along the Tura River in the Tobolsk guberniya (now Tyumen Oblast) in Siberia. According to official records, he was born on 21 January [O.S. 9 January] 1869, and christened the following day. He was named for St. Gregory of Nyssa, whose feast was celebrated on January 10. There are few records of Rasputin's parents. Context: In 1897, Rasputin developed a renewed interest in religion, and left Pokrovskoye to go on a pilgrimage. His reasons for doing so are unclear: according to some sources, Rasputin left the village to escape punishment for his role in a horse theft. Other sources suggest that he had a vision - either of the Virgin Mary, or of St. Simeon of Verkhoturye - while still others suggest that Rasputin's pilgrimage was inspired by his interactions with a young theological student, Melity Zaborovsky. Whatever his reasons, Rasputin's departure was a radical life change: he was twenty-eight, had been married ten years, and had an infant son with another child on the way. According to Douglas Smith, his decision \\"could only have been occasioned by some sort of emotional or spiritual crisis.\\" Rasputin had undertaken earlier, shorter pilgrimages to the Holy Znamensky Monastery at Abalak and to Tobolsk's cathedral, but his visit to the St. Nicholas Monastery at Verkhoturye in 1897 was transformative. There, he met and was \\"profoundly humbled\\" by a starets (elder) known as Makary. Rasputin may have spent several months at Verkhoturye, and it was perhaps here that he learned to read and write, but he later complained about the monastery itself, claiming that some of the monks engaged in homosexuality and criticizing monastic life as too coercive. He returned to Pokrovskoye a changed man, looking disheveled and behaving differently than he had before. He became a vegetarian, swore off alcohol, and prayed and sang much more fervently than he had in the past. Rasputin would spend the years that followed living as a Strannik, (a holy wanderer, or pilgrim), leaving Pokrovskoye for months or even years at a time to wander the country and visit a variety of different holy sites. It is possible that Rasputin wandered as far Athos, Greece - the center of Orthodox monastic life - in 1900. By the early 1900s, Rasputin had developed a small circle of acolytes, primarily family members and other local peasants, who prayed with him on Sundays and other holy days when he was in Pokrovskoye. Building a makeshift chapel in Efim's root cellar - Rasputin was still living within his father's household at the time - the group held secret prayer meetings there. These meetings were the subject of some suspicion and hostility from the village priest and other villagers. It was rumored that female followers were ceremonially washing him before each meeting, that the group sang strange songs that the villagers had not heard before, and even that Rasputin had joined the Khlysty, a religious sect whose ecstatic rituals were rumored to included self-flagellation and sexual orgies. According to historian Joseph Fuhrmann, however, \\"repeated investigations failed to establish that Rasputin was ever a member of the sect,\\" and rumors that he was a Khlyst appear to have been unfounded. Question: Did he learn anything while on pilgrimage?. Whats the answer?","completion":"Yes, Rasputin learned several things while on pilgrimage. During his transformative visit to the St. Nicholas Monastery at Verkhoturye in 1897, he met and was profoundly humbled by a starets (elder) named Makary. It was during this time that Rasputin may have learned to read and write. Additionally, his experiences at the monastery and during his travels as a Strannik (holy wanderer) influenced his spiritual beliefs and practices, leading to significant changes in his behavior and lifestyle upon his return to Pokrovskoye."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Hattie McDaniel (June 10, 1895 - October 26, 1952) was an American stage actress, professional singer-songwriter, and comedian. She is best known for her role as \\"Mammy\\" in Gone with the Wind (1939), for which she won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress, the first Academy Award won by an African American entertainer. In addition to acting in many films, McDaniel was a radio performer and television star; she was the first black woman to sing on radio in the United States. She appeared in over 300 films, although she received screen credits for only 80 or so. The whereabouts of McDaniel's Oscar are currently unknown. In 1992, Jet magazine reported that Howard University could not find it and alleged that it had disappeared during protests in the 1960s. In 1998, Howard University stated that it could find no written record of the Oscar having arrived at Howard. In 2007, an article in the Huffington Post repeated rumors that the Oscar had been cast into the Potomac River by angry civil rights protesters in the 1960s. The assertion reappeared in the Huffington Post under the same byline in 2009. In 2010, Mo'Nique, the winner of the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress, wearing a blue dress and gardenias in her hair, as McDaniel had at the ceremony in 1940, in her acceptance speech thanked McDaniel \\"for enduring all that she had to so that I would not have to\\". Her speech revived interest in the whereabouts of McDaniel's plaque. In 2011, J. Freedom duLac reported in the Washington Post that the plaque had disappeared in the 1960s. In November 2011, W. B. Carter, of the George Washington University Law School, published the results of her year-and-a-half-long investigation into the Oscar's fate. Carter rejected claims that students had stolen the Oscar (and thrown it in the Potomac River) as wild speculation or fabrication that traded on long-perpetuated stereotypes of blacks. She questioned the sourcing of the Huffington Post stories. Instead, she argued that the Oscar was likely returned to Howard University's Channing Pollack Theater Collection between the spring of 1971 and the summer of 1973 or had possibly been boxed and stored in the drama department at that time. The reason for its removal, she argued, was not civil rights unrest but rather efforts to make room for a new generation of black performers. If neither the Oscar nor any paper trail of its ultimate destiny can be found at Howard today, she suggested, inadequate storage or record-keeping in a time of financial constraints and national turbulence may be blamed. She also suggested that a new generation of caretakers may have failed to realize the historic significance of the 5 1/2\\" x 6\\" plaque.

We live along coastlines, around bays, up the course of rivers and streams and on islands. We also vacation at the beach and find comfort fishing on a lake. Nothing makes small children happier than the chance of playing in water. More surprisingly, this human favor for water makes evolutionary sense. Sure, we need drinking water to live, but we have also benefited from what's swimming under the waves. Neuroscientist Crawford of the University of North London has proposed that our ancient ancestors attached to the sea, and that their devotion paid off by allowing the human species to develop large and complex brains. Crawford claims that when humans separated from apes and appeared in the forests of Africa, they stuck close to rivers and beaches and started catching fish, clams and crabs. That seafood was packed with omega-3 fatty acids, essential fatty acids that promote brain cell growth. It's no coincidence, Crawford claims, that human brain growth began to increase rapidly once we left the woods and headed for the beach. Scientists have also discovered that people who eat fish regularly are less likely to suffer from depression than those who eat less seafood. Biochemist Hibbelin of the National Institutes of Health has shown that across cultures there is a direct link between amount of fish eaten each week and rates of depression. More interestingly, Hibbelin and researcher Laura have found that fish is commonly used as a symbol of happiness and good health in various religions and cultures. We know that fish and the sea are good for us, and so we seek them out. We vacation on the coast and see the waves come and go, feeling happiness has taken over our brain. When we move inland, or go home from vacation, we lose touch with our sea roots and feel unhappy. Human beings have benefited a lot from seafood because _ . A) seafood has enough water and is fresh B) fishes in the sea have large and complex brains C) our ancestors had nothing to eat but seafood D) it is abundant in fatty acids promoting brain cell growth A:","completion":"Human beings have benefited a lot from seafood because it is abundant in fatty acids promoting brain cell growth. Seafood is packed with omega-3 fatty acids, which are essential for the development and maintenance of the brain. These fatty acids have not only contributed to the evolution of the human brain but also have been linked to lower rates of depression and improved mental health in those who consume fish regularly.

Her edgy lyrics are another aspect that draws praise. Sentence 2, on the other hand, discusses the following: 1. Time regards Badu as a thrilling new voice in pop music. 2. She is very likely to become successful in the next few years. As we can see, there is some overlap between the two sentences, particularly in acknowledging Badu as a \\"thrilling new voice in pop\\" by Time. However, Sentence 2 limits the discussion more specifically to Badu's predicted success in the next few years. It does not touch upon the unique elements of her music, such as genre-blending and edgy lyrics, which are highlighted in Sentence 1. In conclusion, while Sentence 2 does entail part of the information provided in Sentence 1, it doesn't completely encompass all the details. It captures the aspect of Badu being a thrilling new voice in pop music according to Time but does not address her genre-blending musical style and edgy lyrics, which are key aspects of her praise as mentioned in Sentence 1. Moreover, Sentence 2 brings up the likelihood of her future success, which isn't mentioned directly in Sentence 1 but can be inferred by the praises she received."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

After submitting Medical and PCC how much maximum time will require? Question 2: Can I apply for 189 visa while I am on 190 visa in Australia? Available choices: a). no; b). yes; Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","completion":"Question 1: Does anyone have an idea about the time line of Visa Sub Class 189 for Australia? After submitting Medical and PCC, how much maximum time will it require? Answer 1: The Skilled Independent visa (subclass 189) is an Australian permanent residency visa for skilled workers who meet the required criteria and pass the point test. The processing time for the subclass 189 visa can vary depending on various factors such as application volumes, seasonal fluctuations, and the complexity of individual applications. However, the approximate processing time for the visa subclass 189 can be broken down as follows: 1. Invitations to apply: Once you have submitted your Expression of Interest (EOI) to apply for the visa, you may receive an invitation to apply. The invitation rounds are generally conducted by the Department of Home Affairs twice a month, although the dates can vary. Only the highest-ranking EOIs receive invitations, and the cut-off scores vary each round. 2. Visa application preparation and submission: Once you receive an invitation to apply, you have 60 days to submit your visa application, gather all the required documents, and pay the application fees. This timeframe may vary depending on how quickly you gather and submit all of the required information. 3. Medical and character assessments: The time it takes to complete Medical examinations and the submission of the Police Clearance Certificate (PCC) can vary depending on the individual's circumstances, local infrastructures, and processing times of the concerned authorities. The medical examination results are typically valid for 12 months, and the PCC is generally valid for a year. 4. Visa processing time: According to the Department of Home Affairs, the current processing time for 75% of the subclass 189 applications is around 6 months, while 90% of applications are processed within 8 months. This can vary based on the workload of the immigration authorities and the specific details of your application. In summary, after submitting your Medical and PCC, the processing time can range from a few weeks to a few months depending on various factors. It's essential to monitor the status of your application regularly and provide any additional information requested by the authorities promptly. Question 2: Can I apply for a 189 visa while I am on a 190 visa in Australia? Answer 2: Yes. If you are currently in Australia on a Skilled Nominated visa (subclass 190), you can still apply for the Skilled Independent visa (subclass 189) if you meet the eligibility requirements. You would need to submit an Expression of Interest (EOI) for the subclass 189 visa through the SkillSelect system and, if you receive an invitation to apply, submit a visa application alongside the required documents, fees, and medical and character assessments. It is essential to note that you must continue to meet and fulfill the conditions of your subclass 190 visa while your subclass 189 application is being processed. Also, receiving an invitation to apply for a subclass 189 visa does not guarantee visa grant: your application will be subject to the standard eligibility requirements, assessment, and processing guidelines. In conclusion, Questions 1 and 2 are not asking the same thing. Question 1 is related to the processing timeline of the Visa Subclass 189 for Australia. In contrast, Question 2 asks about the possibility of applying for a Subclass 189 visa while already in Australia on a Subclass 190 visa."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

His old coachman is getting feeble, and he wants a man to work with him and get into his ways, who would be able, when the old man was pensioned off, to step into *his* place OPT: *no. *yes. The answer is:","completion":"Yes, the \\"old coachman\\" and \\"his\\" in the sentence do refer to the same person. In the context presented, \\"his\\" is a pronoun referring back to \\"old coachman\\". This use of \\"his\\" is known as a possessive pronoun. It is describing something that belongs to the \\"old coachman\\", specifically his place or role. The sentence, \\"His old coachman is getting feeble, and he wants a man to work with him...\\" introduces us to a character - the old coachman. The word \\"his\\" is then employed to refer back to this character throughout the rest of the sentence. Therefore, when the sentence says \\"...who would be able, when the old man was pensioned off, to step into *his* place\\", it means the new groom would take over the position or role of the old coachman when he is pensioned off. So, in conclusion, \\"his\\" is used as a pronoun to replace and refer back to the previously mentioned old coachman.

Olt was a fast moving river, while Mures river was slow moving and deep. Both rivers are very important for the local economies. But I can use this background: The major zones in river ecosystems are determined by the river bed's gradient or by the velocity of the current. Faster moving turbulent water typically contains greater concentrations of dissolved oxygen, which supports greater biodiversity than the slow moving water of pools. These distinctions form the basis for the division of rivers into upland and lowland rivers. The food base of streams within riparian forests is mostly derived from the trees, but wider streams and those that lack a canopy derive the majority of their food base from algae. Anadromous fish are also an important source of nutrients. Environmental threats to rivers include loss of water, dams, chemical pollution and introduced species. A dam produces negative effects that continue down the watershed. The most important negative effects are the reduction of spring flooding, which damages wetlands, and the retention of sediment, which leads to loss of deltaic wetlands. What is an answer for this question: Which river had a water that contains lower concentrations of dissolved oxygen?

Thermal mass is any material that can be used to store heat—heat from the Sun in the case of solar energy. Common thermal mass materials include stone, cement and water. Historically they have been used in arid climates or warm temperate regions to keep buildings cool by absorbing solar energy during the day and radiating stored heat to the cooler atmosphere at night. However, they can be used in cold temperate areas to maintain warmth as well. The size and placement of thermal mass depend on several factors such as climate, daylighting and shading conditions.

What is the best way to: Heat up leftovers evenly.","completion":"The best way to heat up leftovers evenly depends on the type of food and the tools available. Here are the step-by-step instructions for reheating leftovers using a microwave, as it is the most common and convenient method available in most households: 1. Choose an appropriate container: Select a microwave-safe container that is large enough to hold your leftovers. Make sure the container allows for a bit of space around the edges of the food so that heat can circulate evenly. 2. Arrange food properly: Spread the leftovers out in an even layer within the container. If possible, arrange larger and denser items towards the outside of the container, while smaller and less dense items can be placed towards the center. This helps promote even heating since microwaves tend to heat the outer edges of the food first. 3. Add a splash of moisture: If the leftovers seem dry, add a small amount of liquid (such as water, broth, or sauce) to help them rehydrate and prevent overcooking. Alternatively, you can place a damp paper towel over the food to provide some additional moisture. 4. Use microwave-safe covering: Place a microwave-safe cover or lid on the container, but leave a small opening to allow steam to escape. This helps food to heat more evenly while also preventing moisture loss. 5. Use the appropriate power setting: Start by microwaving your leftovers at 50%-70% power for longer periods to allow heat to penetrate the food evenly. Most microwaves have a \\"reheat\\" or \\"defrost\\" setting, which is ideal for reheating leftovers. 6. Stir or rotate the food regularly: To promote even heating, pause the microwave halfway through the reheat time and carefully stir or rearrange the food. Be cautious when removing the lid or cover, as hot steam can escape rapidly. 7. Check the temperature: After stirring or rotating the food, continue microwaving until the leftovers reach a safe internal temperature of 165°F (74°C). Use a food thermometer to check for doneness. 8. Let the food rest: Remove the container from the microwave and let the leftovers stand for a minute or two to allow the temperature to equalize throughout the dish. 9. Serve: Once the food has rested and is evenly heated, serve and enjoy your leftovers. Remember that not all foods are safe to reheat in a microwave, as some can become overcooked or lose their texture. If you're unsure about how to reheat a specific dish, it's best to consult the original cooking instructions or check for recommendations online."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Its name was a misnomer, as France already had colonies overseas and was short lived compared to the Colonial Empire. - Charles Percier ( ( al psje ) ; 22 August 1764 -- 5 September 1838 ) was a neoclassical French architect , interior decorator and designer , who worked in a close partnership with Pierre François Léonard Fontaine , originally his friend from student days . For work undertaken from 1794 onward , trying to ascribe conceptions or details to one or other of them is fruitless ; it is impossible to disentangle their cooperative efforts in this fashion . Together , Percier and Fontaine were inventors and major proponents of the rich , grand , consciously - archaeological versions of neoclassicism we recognise as Directoire style and Empire style . Following Charles Percier 's death in 1838 , Fontaine designed a tomb in their characteristic style in the Pere Lachaise Cemetery . Percier and Fontaine had lived together as well as being colleagues . Fontaine married late in life and after his death in 1853 his body was placed in the same tomb according to his wishes . - The Empire style, , the second phase of Romanticism, is an early-nineteenth-century design movement in architecture, furniture, other decorative arts, and the visual arts that flourished between 1800 and 1815 during the Consulate and the First French Empire periods, although its life span lasted until the late 1820s (or more in some countries).

Article: There's no pizza on Mars, but scientists have found a solution to this problem for hungry astronauts: a pizza printer! NASA, the American space agency, has developed a machine that \\"prints\\" food. They showed a model of the printer in Austin, Texas last month. How does it work? Cartridges filled with powdered dough , cheese, sauce, water and oil put the ingredients layer by layer onto a printer bed. The printer bed, which gets hot from below, cooks the food as it's being printed. Since most of the ingredients are powdered, they can be sent into space and stored for many years without going bad. Water makes food go sour, so the food powders are mixed with water and oil only when they are being printed. \\"Long-distance space travel requires more than 15 years of shelf life for food.\\" says Anjan Contractor, whose company developing the printer. \\" We take water out, and in that form, food will last maybe 30 years.\\" In outer space, there are far fewer choices for astronauts for dinner. Most of their foods--even things like beef or shrimp--are eaten from bags as powders . Scientists hope the new food printer can be used to make more delicious food in outer space, keeping astronauts healthier and happier. But the printer is not limited to use in outer space. Scientists think it could be useful on Earth, too. It could allow personal meals to be made at the dinner table, according to each person's different needs. \\"Let's say someone is an athlete in the family, and he needs more protein ,\\" says Anjan Contractor, founder of Systems and Materials Research Corp, the company developing the printer. \\"We can design recipes for him and print out more protein-nutritious food for him.\\" Question: Which of the following is TRUE? _ Options: A: Astronauts eat beef powder in outer space. B: A model of the food printer was shown in New York last month. C: Only astronauts and athletes can eat the food from the printer. D: The printer can only be used in outer space.

She played the role for nine seasons, appearing in all but three episodes. One of the episodes that she did not appear in was the inaugural pilot episode, \\"The Seinfeld Chronicles\\", because her character was not initially intended to be a part of the series. It was only after the first episode that NBC executives felt the show was too male-centric, and demanded that creators Jerry Seinfeld and Larry David add a woman to the cast. It was revealed in the commentary on the DVD package that the addition of a female character was the condition for commissioning the show. Louis-Dreyfus won the role over several other actresses who would also eventually enjoy their own TV success, including Patricia Heaton, Rosie O'Donnell and Megan Mullally. On the \\"Notes About Nothing\\" featurette on the DVD package, Seinfeld says that Louis-Dreyfus' ability to eat a peanut M&M without breaking the peanut aptly describes the actress: \\"She cracks you up without breaking your nuts.\\" Her performance on the series was met with critical acclaim, and she was a regular winner and nominee at television award shows throughout the 1990s. Her performance earned her two Golden Globe Award nominations, winning once in 1994, nine Screen Actors Guild Award nominations, winning one in 1995 and two in both 1997 and 1998, and seven American Comedy Awards, winning five times in 1993, 1994, 1995, 1997 and 1998. In 1996, she received the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series, an award she was nominated for on seven occasions from 1992 to 1998. After receiving the award, Louis-Dreyfus claimed the win was a \\"shocker\\", and that after being in both positions, it was \\"much better to win than to lose.\\" In 1998, Seinfeld decided to end the series after nine seasons. The series finale aired on May 14 and was one of the most watched TV events in history, with over 76 million people tuning in.

Bowie's songs and stagecraft brought a new dimension to popular music in the early 1970s, strongly influencing both its immediate forms and its subsequent development. Bowie was a pioneer of glam rock, according to music historians Schinder and Schwartz, who credited Marc Bolan and Bowie with creating the genre. At the same time, he inspired the innovators of the punk rock music movement. When punk musicians were \\"noisily reclaiming the three-minute pop song in a show of public defiance\\", biographer David Buckley wrote that \\"Bowie almost completely abandoned traditional rock instrumentation.\\" Bowie's record company promoted his unique status in popular music with the slogan, \\"There's old wave, there's new wave, and there's David Bowie\\".Musicologist James Perone credited Bowie with having \\"brought sophistication to rock music\\", and critical reviews frequently acknowledged the intellectual depth of his work and influence. The Human League founder Martyn Ware remarked that he had lived his life \\"as though he were an art installation.\\" The BBC's arts editor Will Gompertz likened Bowie to Pablo Picasso, writing that he was \\"an innovative, visionary, restless artist who synthesised complex avant garde concepts into beautifully coherent works that touched the hearts and minds of millions\\".

They invite him into their group, which entertains itself with a secret after-hours game at the morgue of who can commit the perfect undetectable murder. Eventually the group's leader, Jake Gallo, realizes that Teddy is sleeping with his girlfriend, Dr. Juliette Bath. When Teddy catches several members of the group in lies, he realizes that what initially seemed like vigilante killings are, in actuality, just innocent people murdered for sport. Teddy's fiancÃ©e Gwen arrives to stay with him in his apartment. Gallo, angered by Juliette's infidelity, kills her for the next game. However, just as they are about to begin the autopsy on Bath (in the meantime plotting Teddy's death), Gallo realizes that the gas has been left on in the room, resulting in a massive explosion as one of the group lights a meth pipe, killing everyone but Teddy who was not in the room. Gallo realizes what is about to happen and survives. Teddy is seen walking away from the explosion. Later, Gallo manages to kill Gwen in what he believes to be the \\"perfect murder\\". Upon completing his autopsy report on his murdered fiancÃ©e, Teddy is knocked out by Gallo and then is forced to trade verbal barbs with him. Teddy uses some of Gallo's own rhetoric against him in reverse psychology fashion, after which fellow pathologist Ben Stravinsky frees Teddy and together they kill Gallo in exactly the same way that he killed Teddy's fiancÃ©e. In the process, they vivisect Gallo.
