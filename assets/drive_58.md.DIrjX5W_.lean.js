Q:Read the article and select the best answer. Article: prefix = st1 /Gland, Switzerland - Rivers on every continent are drying out, threatening severe water shortages, according to a new WWF report. The report, World's Top Rivers at Risk, released ahead of World Water Day (22 March), lists the top ten rivers that are fast dying as a result of climate change, pollution and dams. \\"All the rivers in the report symbolize the current freshwater crisis, which we have been signalling for years,\\" says WWF Global Freshwater Programme Director Jamie Pittock. \\"Poor planning and inadequate protection of natural areas mean we can no longer assume that water will flow forever. Like the climate change crisis, which now has the attention of business and government, we want leaders to take notice of the emergency facing freshwater now not later.\\" Five of the ten rivers listed in the report are in Asia alone. They are the Yangtze, Mekong, Salween, Ganges and Indus. Europe's Danube, the America'sLa Plataand Rio Grande/Rio Bravo, Africa's Nile-Lake Victoria andAustralia's Murray-Darling also make the list. Dams along the Danube River -- one of the longest flowing rivers in Europe -- have already destroyed 80 per cent of the river basin's wetlands and floodplains. Even without warmer temperatures threatening to melt Himalayan glaciers, the IndusRiverfaces scarcity due to over-extraction for agriculture. Fish populations, the main source of protein and overall life support systems for hundreds of thousands of communities worldwide, are also being threatened. The report calls on governments to better protect river flows and water allocations in order to safeguard habitats and people's livelihoods. \\"Conservation of rivers and wetlands must be seen as part and parcel of national security, health and economic success,\\" Pittock adds. \\"Emphasis must be given to exploring ways of using water for crops and products that do not use more water than necessary.\\" In addition, cooperative agreements for managing shared resources, such as the UN Watercourses Convention, must be ratified and given... Question: Judging from what Jamie Pittock says, he wants to _ .

I was sent to court and found guilty based on no evidence by a magistrate court judge who was later struck off for corruption after defrauding an old lady of over a million pounds! I was not put in prison for this minor offense but did receive a minor criminal record. This criminal records the same DJ’s and bent ex-police have used to ruin my reputation and career. One of the bent policemen, who incidentally had already been thrown out of the police force for car insurance fraud, even turned up at the uni I went to and spread vicious slander to ruin me there, and in the area that I lived at the time. I was then victimised by the people at the famous college that I went to and all my intellectual and copyright works stolen. Which I note, generated millions for others.

Přechodná těhotěnská vyrážka Translate to English","completion":"The phrase \\"Přechodná těhotěnská vyrážka\\" is in Czech, and when translated to English, it means \\"Transient pregnancy rash.\\" A transient pregnancy rash is a temporary skin condition that some pregnant women may experience during their pregnancy. This rash can be characterized by red, itchy, and inflamed skin. However, it is essential to note that different types of rashes can affect pregnant women, and some may have a more serious underlying cause. Therefore, it is crucial to consult a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis and treatment. Some common rashes experienced during pregnancy include: 1. Pruritic urticarial papules and plaques of pregnancy (PUPPP): This is the most common pregnancy-related rash, usually occurring during the third trimester. It often starts around the abdominal area, particularly near the stretch marks, and may spread to the thighs, buttocks, and arms. PUPPP is not harmful to the baby but can cause significant discomfort for the mother. 2. Prurigo of pregnancy: This is a less common rash characterized by small, itchy bumps that can appear anywhere on the body. It typically occurs during the second or third trimester and may last several weeks to months after giving birth. 3. Pemphigoid gestationis: A rare but more severe rash that starts with itchy, red bumps and develops into large, fluid-filled blisters. It is an autoimmune condition that can cause premature birth and low birth weight, and it requires medical attention. 4. Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP): This is a liver condition that causes severe itching without a visible rash. It can be harmful to the baby, increasing the risk of premature birth, stillbirth, and fetal distress. Women with ICP should receive medical care and monitoring. Managing a transient pregnancy rash involves various approaches, depending on the cause and severity. Some general recommendations may include: - Regularly applying fragrance-free moisturizers - Avoiding harsh soaps and opting for gentle, hypoallergenic products - Wearing loose, breathable clothing - Reducing stress and practicing relaxation techniques - Applying over-the-counter anti-itch creams or ointments, as directed by a healthcare provider - Seeking medical advice for prescription medication or other targeted treatments, if necessary. While dealing with a transient pregnancy rash can be uncomfortable, it is essential to remember that most rashes resolve either during pregnancy or shortly after giving birth. However, if the rash is severe, getting worse, or potentially a symptom of a more serious condition, it is crucial to contact a healthcare professional for further evaluation and appropriate care."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: This is a correct answer to the following question about Mariah Carey.

Twenty years later, present day, a new family moves into Belle's childhood home, unaware of the town's tragic history. Main Characters: 1. Belle Thomas (deceased)- a talented artist full of life and dreams. 2. Max - the curious teenager of the new family who moves into Belle's house. 3. Annie - Max's younger sister with a gift for communicating with the spirit world. 4. Claire and Peter - Max and Annie's parents. 5. Allison - Belle's best friend who still lives in the town, now a teacher at the local high school. 6. Sheriff Grant - The town's sheriff who was involved in the investigation of Belle's accident. Plot: Max and Annie's family moves into the old Thomas residence, oblivious to the dark history attached to the house and town. As they settle in, strange occurrences begin to take place, particularly around Annie, who has a unique ability to communicate with spirits. Through her supernatural connection, she encounters the spirit of Belle and befriends her. Throughout the school year, Max and Annie uncover Belle's artistic talents and tragic story of her death, which still haunts the town. With Allison's help, they decide to put together an art exhibition at the local gallery to honor Belle's memory and celebrate her work. As they investigate Belle's death, however, they stumble upon a long-buried secret and suspect there may be more to her death than just a car accident. As the exhibition date nears, Max, Annie, and Allison investigate further, leading them to the town's sheriff - Sheriff Grant. The plot thickens as they discover Sheriff Grant was in a romantic relationship with Belle when he was still a deputy. However, the late reveal of a letter written by Belle and an authentic account from a mysterious eyewitness compels the trio to suspect that Sheriff Grant was somehow involved in the accident. The art exhibition becomes a huge success, as Belle's spirit brings the town together in a bittersweet celebration of her life. Max, Annie, and Allison finally confront Sheriff Grant, forcing him to reveal the true nature of Belle's accident. It turns out it was not a deliberate act but an unfortunate reaction to an intense argument between Grant and Belle that night. Filled with remorse, Grant resigns as sheriff and admits his part in Belle's accident to the town. As the family and the town come to terms with the truth and begin to heal, Belle's spirit finally finds peace and is able to move on to the afterlife - but not before leaving a profound impact on Max, Annie, and a town that will always remember her.

In this game, you had to guess which teams would win each match, and if you guessed really well, you could win a 20,000 gift card and a trip to a fancy basketball tournament in Maui! Over 11 million people tried to make the best guesses, but a really smart 12-year-old boy named Sam Holtz from Chicago did better than almost everyone else. He guessed so well that he was tied for first place! But, there was a tiny problem - you had to be at least 18 years old to win the big prize. Sam was sad about it and said he was \\"irritated,\\" but he knew that winning the big prize might still not happen because they would pick the winner from the top 1% of all the people who played – that's like trying to find 1 tiny candy in a bag of 115,000 candies. Even though Sam didn't win the big gift, the people from ESPN thought he did such an amazing job that they wanted to send him a special bag filled with cool things from their TV network. They were really impressed because he guessed better than all their experts and famous people who know a lot about basketball. What's even more cool is that it took Sam only five minutes to make all his guesses. He said, \\"I just rushed right through it. I think it was kind of all skill. Some people say it's luck, but I think I studied enough\\". So, even without the big prize, Sam is still a champion in a lot of people's hearts!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Image copyright Uruguayan Interior Ministry Image caption Rocco Morabito had been on the run since 1994 One of Italy's most wanted fugitives has been arrested in Uruguay after 23 years on the run from convictions for mafia association and drug trafficking. Rocco Morabito of the 'Ndrangheta organised crime gang was detained in the resort of Punta del Este. Uruguayan police said he had been living there for more than 10 years under a false identity. He was nicknamed \\"cocaine king of Milan\\" for his involvement in shipping the drug from South America to Italy. The 'Ndrangheta controls much of the world's cocaine trade and police say Morabito was behind the smuggling of hundreds of kilos of cocaine from Brazil to Italy. South American hideaway Morabito is believed to have arrived in Uruguay in 2002. Police arrested Morabito in a hotel in the Uruguayan capital, Montevideo. But officials said he had settled in the resort of Punta del Este with false Brazilian identity papers in the name of Francisco Capeletto.

His wife was also detained. According to his lawyer, Morabito has been leading \\"a normal life\\" since 1994 and has not engaged in any criminal activities since then. He is currently being held in Uruguay for falsifying documents but is expected to be extradited to Italy in the coming months. Last year, police in Italy found a 'Ndrangheta mafia boss who had been on the run for 18 years hidden in a bunker in the mountains of Calabria. ||||| Rocco Morabito, one of Italy’s most-wanted mafia bosses, slipped up by enrolling daughter at local school under real name 'Cocaine king of Milan' arrested in Uruguay after 23 years on the run After 23 years on the run, one of Italy’s most wanted mobsters – the so-called “cocaine king of Milan” – has been arrested at a hotel in Uruguay. Uruguayan and Italian authorities said Rocco Morabito, 50, a fugitive boss of Italy’s most powerful organised crime group, the Calabrian ‘Ndrangheta, had been living with false papers in the southern coastal resort of Punta del Esta for more than a decade. Uruguayan police said Morabito, the target of an international arrest warrant since 1995, was detained after a six-month investigation that was triggered after he enrolled his daughter at a local school under his own name. Morabito, who obtained Uruguayan papers after presenting a false Brazilian passport in the name of Francisco Capeletto, was arrested on Monday at a luxury hotel in Montevideo, Uruguay’s capital, along with his wife, reportedly an Angolan national. Mafia bosses caught in Italian police raid on mountain hideout Read more A search of his properties uncovered 13 mobile phones, 12 bank cards, two cars, 150 passport-sized photos of him in various guises plus a Portuguese passport, a quantity of jewels, about 50,000 (£38,500) in cash and a 9mm pistol, the Uruguayan interior ministry said. In a statement, Marco Minniti, Italy’s interior minister, congratulated Italian and Uruguayan police for a joint operation that resulted in the apprehension of “the No 1 fugitive” from the ‘Ndrangheta. Sentenced to 30 years in prison in Italy, Morabito had been sought by police since 1994 after attempting to import almost a tonne of cocaine, worth 13bn lire (£6m), into Italy from Brazil, according to the Corriere della Sera newspaper. Also suspected of transporting the drug to Milan from elsewhere in the country, he was wanted on charges of belonging to a criminal organisation devoted to international drug trafficking, the Italian interior ministry said. Thought to have arrived in Uruguay in 2002, Morabito has has been leading “a normal life” since 1994 and has not engaged in any criminal activities since, his lawyer told Italian media. Pending a formal Italian extradition request, he will be held in Uruguay for at least the next three months for false papers and identity theft, the Uruguayan interior ministry said. Federico Cafiero de Raho, chief prosecutor for the Calabria region, said Morabito had played “a major role” in cocaine trafficking between South America and Milan, a distribution point for the drug to be sold elsewhere. He described Morabito as “a key figure” in the ‘Ndrangheta mob, which controls a large part of the world’s cocaine trade. Italian prosecutors have suggested the organisation tries to ensure the size and quality of its cocaine deals live up to dealer expectations by placing top gang bosses in Latin American so they can be closer to the drug’s producers. The arrest ticks off one of the Italian interior ministry’s top five list of most wanted organised crime bosses, which also includes the Sicilian mafia boss Matteo Messina Denaro. Last year Italian anti-mafia police caught two other fugitive ’Ndrangheta bosses after discovering them “living like animals” in a mountain hideout stocked with an arsenal of weapons. Giuseppe Ferraro, 47, and Giuseppe Crea, 37, both high-ranking members of the organisation, had been on Italy’s list of most dangerous fugitives. Ferraro, convicted of a string of brutal murders, had been on the run for 18 years. Crea, wanted for mafia association and extortion, disappeared 10 years ago. |||||Summary:","completion":"Rocco Morabito, one of Italy's most wanted fugitives, has been arrested in Uruguay after 23 years on the run.

Summarize this article: Gastroschisis is increasing among babies, especially those born to young black mothers, in the U.S. Getty Images/Blend Images A serious birth defect that causes the intestines to hang out of a newborn’s body near the belly button area is on the rise among babies born to young black mothers in the U.S., and health officials have no idea why. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention sounded the alarm about the birth defect, called gastroschisis, in a report published Thursday that looked at data across 14 states. Over the course of 18 years, the prevalence of gastroschisis more than doubled in the U.S., increasing among moms of every age and racial group. Among babies born to black mothers, it increased by more than 250 percent, particularly among teen mothers. In all, 2,000 babies are born with the condition each year. “Public health research is urgently needed to figure out the cause and why certain women are at higher risk of having a baby born with gastroschisis,\\" Coleen Boyle, director of the CDC’s National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities, said in a statement. The defect occurs during embryo development when the abdomen forms incorrectly, leaving a hole for the intestines – and sometimes the stomach and liver – to extend outside of the body. Doctors can spot the condition among mothers who receive regular ultrasounds by the second trimester, and then know to be particularly careful during delivery. But the organs still can become irritated from exposure inside the uterus and can twist, swell and become infected. Surgery, in which doctors put the organs back into the abdomen and close its walls, is necessary a few weeks after birth. Recovery takes about six weeks. Even after surgery, some gastroschisis patients have problems eating and digesting food, which can lead to acid reflux, malnutrition or stunted growth. In some cases, the birth defect can be life-threatening. The CDC does not know why some babies develop gastroschisis – whether it is caused by genetic or environmental factors like what a pregnant woman eats or drinks or by the medicines she takes. The number of cases did not follow the same track as the number of live births for teen moms, which actually declined during the same period. Clarified on Jan. 21, 2016: This story has been updated to clarify where the signs of gastroschisis occur. ||||| Gastroschisis is a serious congenital defect in which the intestines protrude through an opening in the abdominal wall. Gastroschisis requires surgical repair soon after birth and is associated with an increased risk for medical complications and mortality during infancy. Reports from multiple surveillance systems worldwide have documented increasing prevalence of gastroschisis since the 1980s, particularly among younger mothers (1,2); however, since publication of a multistate U.S. report that included data through 2005 (1), it is not known whether prevalence has continued to increase. Data on gastroschisis from 14 population-based state surveillance programs were pooled and analyzed to assess the average annual percent change (AAPC) in prevalence and to compare the prevalence during 2006–2012 with that during 1995–2005, stratified by maternal age and race/ethnicity. The pooled data included approximately 29% of U.S. births for the period 1995–2012. During 1995–2012, gastroschisis prevalence increased in every category of maternal age and race/ethnicity, and the AAPC ranged from 3.1% in non-Hispanic white (white) mothers aged <20 years to 7.9% in non-Hispanic black (black) mothers aged <20 years. These corresponded to overall percentage increases during 1995–2012 that ranged from 68% in white mothers aged <20 years to 263% in black mothers aged <20 years. Gastroschisis prevalence increased 30% between the two periods, from 3.6 per 10,000 births during 1995–2005 to 4.9 per 10,000 births during 2006–2012 (prevalence ratio = 1.3, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.3–1.4), with the largest increase among black mothers aged <20 years (prevalence ratio = 2.0, 95% CI: 1.6–2.5). Public health research is urgently needed to identify factors contributing to this increase. To follow up on a study that included gastroschisis prevalence data from 15 states and reported a near doubling of gastroschisis prevalence during 1995–2005 (1), CDC requested updated data from each of these states for 1995–2012. Fourteen states* provided data on gastroschisis cases crosstabulated by maternal age groups (<20 years, 20–24 years, 25–29 years, 30–34 years, and ≥35 years) and race/ethnicity (white, black, and Hispanic, with all other racial/ethnic groups included in the total). The gastroschisis case definition was based on the British Pediatric Association Classification of Diseases code (756.71) or the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) code for gastroschisis (756.73, or before 10/1/2009, 756.79, with verification to confirm cases of gastroschisis, because the previous code was shared with omphalocele). Gastroschisis cases included live births, fetal deaths,† and elective terminations.§ Data were pooled at CDC, and gastroschisis prevalence was calculated for each year, maternal age group, and race/ethnicity. Prevalence was calculated as number of gastroschisis cases among all birth outcomes divided by the total number of live births. The denominators of total number of live births in the same catchment area as the birth defects surveillance program were reported by states or obtained from public use data files. Poisson exact methods were used to calculate 95% CIs for each prevalence estimate. Prevalence ratios were calculated by dividing the prevalence during 2006–2012 by the prevalence during 1995–2005, and CIs for the prevalence ratios were calculated using Poisson regression. Because the comparison of prevalence between the two study periods involved an artificial breakpoint during the 18-year data span and only examined pooled prevalence within those periods, joinpoint regression analysis was used to identify statistically significant changes in the annual prevalence of gastroschisis over the course of the entire study period (1995–2012). Joinpoint regression initially models annual trend data by fitting a straight line (i.e., zero joinpoints). Then, joinpoints are added, one at a time, and a Monte Carlo permutation test is used to determine the optimal number of joinpoints. Each joinpoint in the final model corresponds to a significant change in the trend, and an AAPC and its 95% CI are calculated to describe how the rate changes within each time interval (3). The estimated overall percent change was calculated by first converting the AAPC to the projected single year change in prevalence and then exponentiating to the number of years studied minus one to estimate the total increase throughout the 18 years. This gives the magnitude of the increase, which is then converted to a percent increase. For example, an AAPC of 5 represents a projected single year change of 1.05, which would correspond to a 2.29-fold increase over the entire study period (1.05^17 = 2.29). This corresponds to an overall change of 129% ([2.29–1] x 100). The Joinpoint Regression Program, version 4.2.0 (National Cancer Institute), was used to conduct joinpoint regression. During 1995–2005, 4,369 gastroschisis cases were detected among 12,014,244 live births (prevalence = 3.6 per 10,000 live births, 95% CI: 3.5–3.7), and during 2006–2012, 4,497 gastroschisis cases were detected among 9,264,540 live births (prevalence = 4.9 per 10,000 live births, 95% CI: 4.7–5.0). Comparing the two periods, gastroschisis prevalence increased 30% (prevalence ratio = 1.3, 95% CI: 1.3–1.4) during 2006–2012 compared with 1995–2005. The prevalence of gastroschisis increased over the course of the study period in each of the five maternal age groups (Figure). Because fewer cases were detected among older maternal age groups, maternal age was collapsed into three groups (<20 years, 20–24 years, and ≥25 years) to stratify the data simultaneously by maternal age and race/ethnicity. A significant increase in gastroschisis prevalence occurred in each maternal age group from the first period (1995–2005) to the second (2006–2012) (Table). Statistically significant increases comparing the two periods were seen in eight of the nine categories of maternal age and race/ethnicity assessed. Among mothers aged <20 years and 20–24 years, significant increases were seen in all racial/ethnic groups examined. The prevalence of gastroschisis during 2006–2012 among mothers aged <20 years was higher among white mothers (18.1 per 10,000 live births, 95% CI: 16.7–19.7) and Hispanic mothers (16.1 per 10,000 live births, 95% CI: 14.9–17.3) than among black mothers (10.2 per 10,000 live births, 95% CI: 8.7–11.9); however, black mothers in this age group experienced the largest increase in prevalence, which doubled between the two study periods (prevalence ratio = 2.0, 95% CI: 1.6–2.5). Using Joinpoint regression to assess temporal trends within strata of maternal age and race/ethnicity, the AAPC indicated a significant increase in prevalence for all nine groups (Table). Zero joinpoints were identified for each of the nine strata, indicating that a single AAPC estimate was appropriate for the entire study period for each group. The two highest AAPCs among these strata were in black mothers aged <20 years and 20–24 years. The AAPCs ranged from a low of 3.1 in white mothers aged <20 years to a high of 7.9 in black mothers aged <20 years. These corresponded to overall percent increases from 1995 to 2012 that ranged from 68% in white mothers aged <20 years to 263% in black mothers aged <20 years. ||||| These crawls are part of an effort to archive pages as they are created and archive the pages that they refer to.

Morrison and EMI producer Norman Smith negotiated Pink Floyd's first recording contract, and as part of the deal, the band agreed to record their first album at EMI Studios in London. Mason recalled that the sessions were trouble-free. Smith disagreed, stating that Barrett was unresponsive to his suggestions and constructive criticism. EMI-Columbia released The Piper at the Gates of Dawn in August 1967. The album peaked at number 6, spending 14 weeks on the UK charts. One month later, it was released under the Tower Records label. Pink Floyd continued to draw large crowds at the UFO Club; however, Barrett's mental breakdown was by then causing serious concern. The group initially hoped that his erratic behaviour would be a passing phase, but some were less optimistic, including Jenner and his assistant, June Child, who commented: \\"I found [Barrett] in the dressing room and he was so ... gone. Roger Waters and I got him on his feet, [and] we got him out to the stage ... The band started to play and Syd just stood there. He had his guitar around his neck and his arms just hanging down\\".Forced to cancel Pink Floyd's appearance at the prestigious National Jazz and Blues Festival, as well as several other shows, King informed the music press that Barrett was suffering from nervous exhaustion.

The next evening the young Hardys again took their seats by Seth, and, without any delay, he went on with his story. \\"After El Zeres had ridden off, the lieutenant, Pedro, selected ten from the men around--for pretty well the whole camp had gathered round us--and told them, in the first place, to clear the house of the hammock and other belongings of El Zeres, and when this was done to carry Rube in. Bound and helpless as he was, there was a visible repugnance on the part of the men to touch him, so great was the fear which his tremendous strength had excited. However, six of them took him up and carried him into the hut--for it was little more--and threw him down like a log in the inner room. I walked in of my own accord, and sat down on the ground near him. I heard Pedro give orders to some of the men outside to take away the dead bodies and bury them, and for the rest to go down to their campfires. Then he entered the house with his other four men. \\"The house was just the ordinary Mexican hut. It contained two rooms, or rather, one room partially divided into two, the inner compartment forming the sleeping-room of the family. There was no door between the rooms, nor was there any window; the light entering through the wide opening into the outer room. The outer room had no regular windows, only some chinks or loopholes, through which a certain amount of light could come; but these were stopped up with straw, for the Mexicans are a chilly people; and as the door was always open, plenty of light came in through it.

Please answer the following question: Process: - A dam is built in an area prone to flooding - A large amount of rain occurs - The water builds up behind the dam - The dam opens its floodgates when it starts to get full - The water flows into a river below the dam - The dam closes its gates - The dam will occasionally open its gates again to gradually release more water - Eventually all of the floodwater will be slowly released into the river without causing any flood damage. Question: suppose poor planning by city engineers happens, how will it affect DEGRADED safety from flooding. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect A:","completion":"B: less Poor planning by city engineers might result in decreased safety from flooding. This could arise from various factors, including an inadequately designed or constructed dam, improper assessment of the rainfall intensity, poor assessment of the upstream and downstream area, insufficient monitoring systems to predict floods, inadequate evacuation plans, and poor maintenance practices. In such a case, if the dam cannot store the large amounts of rainfall, it might get overfilled which increases the risk of dam failure, causing catastrophic flooding downstream. On the other hand, the dam might also not open its floodgates at the right times, leading to a buildup of floodwater. If the floodwater is not gradually released properly, there is a risk of flooding the downstream areas. Moreover, if the dam closes its gates when it shouldn't, it can cause an excess of water to build up in the reservoir, ultimately leading to dam failure or severe flooding downstream when the gates do open. The inadequate control and management of the dam can therefore lead to serious damage in downstream areas increasing the risk to safety from flooding. Therefore, poor planning by city engineers would likely lead to less safety from flooding, not more or no effect. Without careful planning and management, the risks associated with flooding can be greatly elevated."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

For our main course, I had the lamb shank - it was cooked to perfection, succulent and packed full of flavor, coupled with the buttery smooth mashed potatoes and fresh, crisp vegetables. My companion went for the vegetarian risotto where the chef had balanced the creaminess and crunch with expert skill. Each mouthful was an adventure that had me eagerly anticipating the next. To finish, we had the chocolate lava cake. The cake was dense, dark, and sinfully delicious, exploding with a warm, gooey center that simply melted in the mouth. This paired beautifully with the accompaniment of homemade vanilla ice cream which was silky and aromatic. In terms of drinks, their wine list was extensive, offering a range of wines that cater to all tastes and budgets.

McKinney details her upbringing as a charismatic young beauty queen with a self-reported IQ of 168. In search of a \\"clean-cut, all-American boy\\" for a potential husband, McKinney is introduced to Kirk Anderson, a young Mormon man on the eve of his religious mission.

Article: Like many other small boys, I was fascinated by cars, not least because my oldest brother was a bit of a car guy and subscribed to cool magazines like Car and Driver and Motor Trend. Every so often, one of those magazines would run an article on the \\"Car of the Future\\". They featured unconventional styling and things like small nuclear reactors as power sources. Yet, frankly, my car doesn't do anything that my brother's Studebaker didn't do. It goes, it stops, it burns gasoline, it plays music. I still have to steer it, and it still runs into things if I don't steer it carefully. But guess what? All of these things are subject to change in the not-so-distant future. It will still go and stop, but it may not burn gasoline, I may not have to steer it, and it may be a lot better at not running into things. Airbags aren't the be-all and end-all in safety. In fact, considering the recent news about people occasionally being killed by their airbags in low-speed collisions ,they obviously still need some development. But they aren't going away, and in fact, you can expect to see cars appearing with additional, side-impact airbags, something some European car manufacturers already offer. Better than systems to minimize injury in the event of an accident, however, are systems that minimize the likelihood of an accident happening in the first place. Future cars may be able to eliminate many of the major causes of accidents, including drunk-driving, tailgating and sleepiness. Cars could be equipped with sensors that can detect alcohol in a driver's system and prevent the car from being started, for example.

The cold open, which featured the assassination of the president of the fictional \\"banana republic\\" of San Marcos and a coup d'Ã©tat that brings Gen. Emilio Molina Vargas (Carlos Montalban) to power, sets up the situation in which Mellish would become embroiled. The scene was in the form of a championship boxing telecast on Wide World of Sports, with Don Dunphy as the host and Howard Cosell as the commentator.[4] Mellish is a neurotic blue collar man who tries to impress social activist Nancy (Louise Lasser) by trying to get in touch with the revolution in San Marcos. He visits the republic and attempts to show his concern for the native people. However, he is nearly killed by the local caudillo and then saved by the revolutionaries, putting him in their debt. Mellish then learns, clumsily, how to be a revolutionary. When the revolution is successful, the Castro-style leader goes mad, forcing the rebels to place Mellish as their President. When traveling back to the U.S. to obtain financial aid, he reunites with his activist ex-girlfriend and is exposed. In a classic courtroom scene, Mellish tries to defend himself from a series of incriminating witnesses, including a reigning Miss America and a middle-aged African-American woman claiming to be J. Edgar Hoover in disguise. One of the witnesses does provide testimony favorable to Mellish, but the court clerk, when asked to read back this testimony, replies with an entirely different, wholly unfavorable rendition. Mellish is eventually sentenced to prison, but his sentence is suspended on the condition that he does not move into the judge's neighborhood. Nancy then agrees to marry him. The film ends with the between-the-covers consummation of their marriage, an event that was over much more quickly than Nancy had anticipated.

Gather materials: You will need an ice cube tray and access to clean water. 2. Check the tray: Before using the ice cube tray, ensure it is clean. If it's not clean, wash it with warm water and dish soap, then rinse thoroughly and dry. 3. Fill the tray: In most cases, an ice cube tray consists of several small compartments called cube molds. Slowly pour the water over the entire tray, allowing the water to fill each of these compartments. 4. Mind the water level: Do not overfill the tray as it will make removal of the ice cubes more difficult. Fill each compartment up to approximately 90% full, leaving room for the water to expand as it freezes. 5. Check for spills: If you overfilled any of the compartments, use a paper towel or clean cloth to wipe away any excess water. 6. Place in the freezer: Carefully transfer the filled tray to your freezer. Make sure to place it on a flat surface to avoid spills or uneven freezing. Close the freezer door to maintain the cold temperature needed to freeze the water. 7. Allow sufficient time: Let the tray sit in the freezer for a few hours, or until the water has fully frozen. The freezing time may vary depending on your freezer's temperature settings but typically takes around 4-6 hours. 8. Retrieve frozen ice cubes: Once you confirm that the water has fully frozen, remove the ice cube tray from the freezer. 9. Release the ice cubes: Gently twist the ice cube tray or push on the bottom of each compartment to release the individual ice cubes. If the ice cubes don't come out easily, you can briefly run the bottom of the tray under warm water to loosen them. 10. Store or use the ice cubes: Either place the ice cubes in a container and return them to the freezer for later use, or add them to your drinks and enjoy!

Given these facts, a platypus is an example of _. among the following options: - Marsupial. - Monotremes. - insects - animals - killing insects - Amphibian. - Placental mammal. - matter vibrating A:","completion":"A platypus is an example of Monotremes. Monotremes are a unique group of mammals that, as you mentioned, reproduce by laying eggs. This makes them distinct from other mammals, which typically give birth to live young. Monotremes are very rare, with only five extant species currently known to science, including the platypus and several species of echidna. Marsupials are another distinct group of mammals that are characterized by giving birth to relatively undeveloped young, which then continue to develop outside the womb, typically in a pouch on the mother's abdomen. Examples of marsupials include kangaroos, wallabies, and koalas. Given that platypuses reproduce through egg-laying, they are not classified as marsupials. Insects, while also egg-laying creatures, are not mammals. They are a completely different class of animals called arthropods, characterized by their exoskeletons, segmented bodies, and jointed appendages. Platypuses, being mammals, do not have these traits and thus are not considered insects. Animals is a broad term that refers to all living organisms that are part of the kingdom Animalia. Platypuses, as mammals, are indeed members of the animal kingdom; however, this classification does not provide specific information about their reproductive characteristics, which is the focus of your question. Killing insects is an action or behavior rather than a classification, so it is not relevant when categorizing a platypus by its egg-laying reproduction. Amphibians are a different class of animals that include frogs, toads, and salamanders. They are characterized by a life cycle that involves both aquatic and terrestrial environments, and they have smooth, moist skin that aids in respiration. Platypuses, as mammals with fur and mammary glands, are not amphibians. Placental mammals are the most widespread group of mammals, characterized by developing embryos inside the mother's uterus, with nourishment provided through a specialized organ called the placenta. Since platypuses lay eggs and do not give live birth, they are not placental mammals. Matter vibrating is a concept related to the study of physics and is not applicable to the categorization of organisms such as the platypus. It refers to the movement of particles in a substance, which is unrelated to the reproduction and classification of mammals. In summary, given the characteristics of a platypus as a mammal that reproduces by laying eggs, it is most accurately classified as a monotreme."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Weather forecasts today, however, are much more accurate than they were just 20 years ago. Scientists who study and forecast the weather are called meteorologists. How do they predict the weather?. Q: What are scientists called who study the weather and give forecasts? A: A:","completion":"A: Scientists who study the weather and give forecasts are called meteorologists. Meteorologists are experts in the field of atmospheric science, which is the study of Earth's atmosphere, its processes, and the resulting weather conditions. Meteorologists use a variety of tools and techniques to observe and forecast the weather. They gather data from various sources, including satellites, weather stations, radar systems, and ocean buoys, which provide information on temperature, humidity, wind speed, air pressure, and other atmospheric factors. This continuous flow of data enables meteorologists to track weather patterns, monitor changes, and make predictions based on this information. In addition to gathering data, meteorologists rely on computer models to simulate the behavior of the atmosphere. These models are based on complex mathematical equations that represent the physical laws governing the movement of air and moisture in the atmosphere. By inputting current and historical weather data into these models, meteorologists can generate forecasts which predict future weather conditions. Meteorologists also study the interactions between the Earth's atmosphere and other components of the Earth system, such as the oceans, ice sheets, and land surfaces. They investigate the role of large-scale atmospheric patterns, like jet streams, El Niño and La Niña, and the North Atlantic Oscillation in shaping weather conditions. Weather forecasts have become increasingly accurate over the years due to advancements in technology, improved understanding of atmospheric science, and enhanced computer models. Despite these improvements, weather prediction remains an inherently uncertain process, as the atmosphere is a chaotic and complex system with countless variables. Meteorologists continually strive to improve the accuracy and reliability of their forecasts through ongoing research and advancements in the field of atmospheric science. In summary, meteorologists are the scientists who study weather and provide forecasts by analyzing atmospheric data and employing computer models to predict future weather conditions. They play a crucial role in helping to prepare individuals, communities, and industries for weather events, ensuring public safety, and minimizing the potential impacts of severe weather."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Even so, Ebenezer offers him some respite from his busy evening of helping miser's to change their ways. The Spirit tells that Ebenezer is ok, but in his past, there are other Blackadders who are quite miserly. Curious, Ebenezer asks to know more, and the Spirit goes into several flashbacks.The first vision shows how Lord Blackadder managed to con his way into great fortune and entitlement by tricking Queen Elizabeth (Miranda Richardson) into executing Lord Melchett (Stephen Fry).The second vision shows Edmund Blackadder tricking Prince Regent (Hugh Laurie) into giving up his valuable worldly goods to the poor.These visions intrigue Ebenezer, and he also wishes to see the future. However, the Spirit shows him two futures: if he becomes bad, his future descendant will become ruler of the Universe. If he stays good, he'll become the slave to the future descendant of Mr Baldrick.The Spirit of Christmas then attempts to leave, hoping that none of what Ebenezer has seen will cause him to stray from the side of good. Ebenezer claims he won't, and the Spirit departs.The next day however, it becomes apparent that Ebenezer has lied.

Article: The exterior of Apple headquarters is seen before an event to announce new products at the company's headquarters Monday, March 21, 2016, in Cupertino, Calif. (AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez) (Associated Press) The Latest from Apple's product announcement in California (all times local): 10:40 a.m. Apple is cutting the price of its smartwatch and introducing an array of new bands in an attempt to spur more sales of a gadget that hasn't won a big following yet. Prices for the Apple Watch will start at 299, down from 349. Apple is also releasing a new type of wristband made of woven nylon, along with more colors for existing types of bands. The expanded variety is designed to appeal to the roughly one-third of Apple watch owners who like to switch bands. The highly anticipated Apple Watch was released a year ago, but sales haven't met some of analysts' more bullish predictions. While Apple hasn't released figures, IDC's analysts estimate the tech giant shipped 11.6 million watches last year. — Michael Liedtke, AP Technology Writer, San Francisco ___ 10:20 a.m. Apple CEO Tim Cook is reiterating his pledge to resist the U.S. government's demands for the company's help to unlock an encrypted iPhone used by one of the killers in the San Bernardino mass shootings. Cook opened a product event in California on Monday by saying that Apple owes it to its customers to protect their privacy and the personal information they store on iPhones. He says he is \\"humbled and deeply gratified\\" by the outpouring of support he has received. He has vowed to fight a federal magistrate's order requiring Apple to create special software that would override the iPhone's security features and allow the FBI to hack into the device used by the San Bernardino killer in a suspected case of terrorism. Apple says that doing so could leave all iPhones vulnerable to future hacking attempts, although federal prosecutors contend they're only asking Apple to write code that would work with one phone to protect national security. Federal magistrate Sheri Pym, who issued the order, will hear arguments from both sides in a Riverside, California, courtroom on Tuesday. — Michael Liedtke, AP Technology Writer, San Francisco ___ 9:30 a.m. Apple product events typically spark anticipation among tech bloggers and the company's hard-core fans. Monday's event, though, is drawing less excitement than some previous product launches. Apple is expected to announce a smaller, 4-inch iPhone and a smaller version of the iPad Pro tablet. But there's been no hint of any blockbuster developments, such as last year's highly anticipated Apple Watch debut. Despite speculation that Apple is working on a self-driving car or some new virtual-reality device, those are likely years away. The event starts at 10 a.m. PDT at Apple's Cupertino, California, headquarters. Gartner tech analyst Brian Blau says it's not unusual for Apple to save major announcements until the fall. He says the company's spring events are often focused on products that Apple considers important, but which may not be its biggest sellers. — Brandon Bailey, AP Technology Writer, Cupertino, California. ||||| It’s no secret that iPad sales have been trending downward for years now, but Apple today unveiled a new 9.7-inch version of the iPad Pro that it hopes will reverse that trend. Positioned as the second member of Apple’s iPad Pro family, the new smaller screened tablet weighs just about one pound, slightly heavier than the iPad Air 2. But not to worry, the iPad Pro really packs a whole host of compelling improvements over the iPad Air 2. FROM EARLIER: Apple unveils the iPhone SE, the latest 4-inch iPhone On the display front, the 9.7-inch iPad Pro screen is 40% less reflective than the iPad Air 2 while also delivering 25% more brightness. Phil Schiller also touted a new technology Apple calls True Tone display which can adjust the color temperature of the display to match the light in the room. “It’s really natural to use,” Schiller added. “Once you use this display, you’ll never want to go back. It is quite a breakthrough.” Underneath the hood, the new iPad Pro comes with an A9x processor along with an integrated M9 motion coprocessor for ‘Hey Siri’ support. The new iPad Pro also packs the most advanced camera system Apple has ever packed into a tablet. Specifically, the new iPad Pro comes with a 12 megapixel iSight camera with focus pixels, true tone flash, and support for Live Photos. The 9.7-inch iPad Pro also comes with a more advanced speaker system, Smart Keyboard support, support for Apple’s widely revered Apple Pencil, and will be available in four finishes, including a Rose Gold model. Price wise, a 32GB model will be available for 599, with 128GB and 256GB models available for 749 and 899 respectively. Notably, this marks the first time Apple has developed a 256GB tablet. Pre-orders for the latest addition to the iPad Pro family will begin on March 24. It will be available in stores on March 31. Developing… ||||| The 9.7-inch iPad, the Apple tablet snuggled between the smaller mini and the big boy Pro, hasn’t been updated since 2014 with the iPad Air 2. So as some kind of mea culpa, Apple just blew up the Air line altogether with a “new” and “improved” 9.7-inch iPad Pro. Except it’s really not very new or improved. Prior to Phil Schiller’s breakdown at today’s Apple event, there wasn’t much left to the imagination thanks to months worth of leaks and rumors. When compared to the larger iPad Pro that debuted last year, the new iPad Pro is basically different only in size. Schiller spent time highlighting some of the new Pro’s differences anyway. For one, it has what Apple calls a “True Tone” display that can become warmer and cooler in different kinds of light thanks to ambient sensors. Neat, I guess. But clearly geared toward artists. Advertisement Other than its smaller dimensions, there is one noticeable hardware improvement on the new iPad. It will have a better shooter: a 12-megapixel rear camera that can also capture in 4k along with Live Photos. So basically the camera on the iPhone 6s. It makes sense if you view the Pro as a creation machine, but most people will probably never even use it. Just Schiller doing Schiller. But the new iPad Pro has Apple’s same powerful processor, the A9x (and M9x co-processor), and the same four speaker design that last year’s model had. There’s Pencil support and Smart Keyboard support, too. It’s all just packed in a smaller body. That’s good news for some people who found the iPad Pro hand-achingly huge and wanted something a little more traditional. Apple says the small iPad Pro comes with silver, gold, space gray, and yes, rose gold, too. The new Pro will launch starting at 600 for 32GB and 750 for 128GB and a whopping 256GB for 900 (if that’s something you need/want), making it the most expensive 9.7-inch iPad starting price. Additionally, the 12.9-inch Pro will get the 256GB option. Like the new iPhone SE, the new Pro will be available for pre-order on March 24 and will start shipping a week later. Now only the big question remains. Will people finally ditch their old tablets to go Pro? iPad Pro Specs ||||| The technology company introduced a smaller iPhone, a smaller iPad Pro and new bands for the Apple Watch. The event came a day before the company will face off against the United States government over whether or not to unlock a killer’s iPhone. New York Times writers Brian X. Chen, Farhad Manjoo and Vindu Goel provided reaction and analysis from the event. We will also answer your questions about the company’s new product offerings. ||||| Apple CEO Tim Cook took the stage at Apple's Cupertino campus to introduce a smaller, four-inch version of the iPhone, called the iPhone SE. The key marketing words for Apple products have usually been thinner, faster, bigger. IPhones have grown up over the past nine years, going from the original 3.5-inch display to the iPhone 6S Plus' 5.5-inch screen. Apple went in the opposite direction and announced a new iPhone that's actually smaller. Cook also introduced a new iPad Pro, new Watch bands and some software updates. And he kicked off the event by previewing Apple's court battle with the FBI on Tuesday over iPhone encryption.. The 4-inch iPhone SE The big announcement of the day was the smaller iPhone SE -- a 4-inch iPhone with updated internals. It looks like the iPhone 5S, Apple's last 4-inch phone released in 2014, but has the same processor and graphics performance as the iPhone 6S. Inside is Apple's A9 chip, which doubles the speed of the iPhone 5S. It can use Hey Siri, the hands-free voice assistant, has a 12MP camera, and shoots 4K video. There is an NFC chip inside so the phone can work with Apple Pay. The smaller iPhone is an attempt to appeal to fans of more pocketable devices. Last year, Apple sold 30 million phones that were 4-inches and smaller. A chunk of Apple customers have resisted upgrading to the recent 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch smartphones. According to Mixpanel, a third of iPhone owners are still using a device with a 4-inch screen or smaller. The 16 GB iPhone SE starts at 399 but will be free with a two-year contract or 17 a month on an installment plan. The company will start taking orders for the phone on March 24, and it will be available on March 31. New 9.7-inch iPad Pro Apple's other big hardware news is that it took the iPad Pro and make it smaller. Also called the iPad Pro, the new 9.7-inch version includes many of the same powerful features as the larger 12.9-inch Pro model. Inside is the same A9x chip. The screen is less reflective but brighter and has more color saturation, for all those pros using it as a primary work device. It has a true tone display that measures the color temperature of ambient light with new light sensors and adjusts the screen accordingly. The smaller iPad Pro works with the Apple Pencil stylus and new line of snap on keyboards the company introduced in with the original iPad Pro. People really like using the cameras on their tablets, for some reason, so the new iPad Pro has a 12-megapixel camera and a LED back-facing flash. The tablet starts at 599 for the 32 GB Wi-Fi version and 749 for the 129 GB model. In a first, Apple is offering a new larger 256 GB option that starts at 899. It comes in silver, gold, space gray and rose gold. Apple Watch gets cheaper, more colorful Apple (AAPL) really wants people to try out the Apple Watch. Tim Cook announced a new line of straps for the wearable, including all new woven nylon bands, a space black Milanese Loop, and additional sport and leather bands in a variety of colors. Pretty watch straps on their own might not be enough to lure in new customers, so Apple dropped the price of the watch. It now starts at 299. Why go small? Apple says it sold 30 million four-inch iPhones in 2015, so there's clearly demand for a smaller, cheaper iPhone. Software Updates The latest version of Apple mobile operating system, iOS 9.3, is available starting today. Key new features including Night Shift, which adjusts the screen for late night reading for better sleep, and finger print lock for top secret documents in the Notes app. There is a small update for the Apple TV OS that adds folders for apps and Siri voice dictation. It also announced a new health-related jSDK called CareKit. It's built for personal care apps. For example, a hospital might make an app to help patients taking the proper steps after a major surgery. The first application is a partnership with major universities and medical centers for monitoring Parkinson's. Encryption Before the iPhone SE and Watch announcement, Cook opened with what he admitted is \\"on everybody's mind\\": encryption. \\"We built the iPhone for you our customers and we know that it is a deeply personal device,\\" said Cook. \\"For many of us the iPhone is an extension of ourselves.\\" \\"We need to decide as a nation how much power the government should have over our data and over our privacy,\\" said Cook. \\"We will not shrink from this responsibility.\\" On Tuesday, Apple will face off against the FBI in a California court. Related: Apple could reveal mini iPhone 5SE on March 21 Apple likes the environment Apple brought out Lisa Jackson, its vice president of environment, to talk about a new, special Apple employee, Liam. Liam is a custom robot that takes old iPhones apart to recycle them. While it disassembles them, it detects what components can be reused and recycled. It identifies materials in a device like gold, silver and tungsten. In the future, you might see a Liam robot doing its thing inside an Apple store. Apple uses 100% renewable power in 25 countries including the US and China. In China, Apple even built a solar farm to accommodate adorable grazing yaks. ||||| What was revealed at today's Apple announcement at the company's headquarters in Cupertino, Calif: • The iPhone SE, a return to the 4-inch model, but one that is as powerful as the iPhone 6S • A new, 9.7-inch iPad Pro — a smaller version of the initial 12.9-inch iPad Pro • The cheapest Apple Watch is now cheaper at 299 and there are new bands to go with it • iOS9.3 is available as new update today • Apple's high-profile fight with the FBI over the iPhone's encryption was addressed immediately and forcefully by CEO Tim Cook ||||| What is a summary?","completion":"Apple has introduced a new 9.7-inch version of its iPad Pro, smaller and slightly heavier than the iPad Air 2, with a starting price of 599.

If you're feeling extra decadent, go nuts with a bit more yolk and a little less white. Most commonly, you'd add a teaspoon or two of vanilla extract, though there are other options. Add any of the following along with the flour, after most of it is incorporated: Vanilla extract Almond Mint or peppermint Hazelnut Fondants go wonderfully with a fruity or cocoa liquor -- any flavor that would go well with chocolate. Simply fold in 2 tablespoons of your favorite liquor after the flour goes in, then bake like normal. Some ideas include: Chocolate, current, black raspberry, or cherry liquors Coffee spirits or liquors Tia Maria, Cointreau, and other specialty liquors. While most people need some dark chocolate to offset the sweetness of the sugar, you can mix and match milk, dark, and even white chocolate to find your favorite fondant. Simply add whatever chocolate you desire in place of the dark, and melt like normal. Want to hide some \\"crunch\\" in your fondants? Add some chocolate chips, of any type, to the cooled batter right before it goes in the oven. A fun-sized candy bar, though decadent, works well too. If you want a little more than chocolate to ooze out of your fondant, you have a few excellent choices. To make them, simply freeze the liquids like ice cubes, then plop the cube into the center of your batter by pouring half in the dish, adding the cube, then covering with batter. Try out: Frozen peanut butter Frozen caramel sauce Frozen jelly (such as raspberry, which pairs well with the dark chocolate_ Frozen chocolate sauce (like a white chocolate center)","completion":"This article discusses various ways to enhance the flavor and texture of a chocolate fondant dish using different ingredients and techniques. Egg yolks play a significant role in providing the rich, filling flavor in the dish, and using more yolk with less egg white can make the dessert even more decadent. In addition to the traditional ingredient of vanilla extract, other options such as almond, mint, peppermint, or hazelnut extract can be added alongside the flour. To complement the flavors further, a fruity or cocoa liquor can be folded into the mix after adding the flour. Examples include chocolate, currant, black raspberry, or cherry liquors, coffee spirits, and specialty liquors such as Tia Maria or Cointreau. Experimenting with different types of chocolate, such as milk, dark, or white chocolate, can personalize the fondant based on taste preferences. To achieve a varied texture, chocolate chips or small candy bars can be added to the cooled batter right before baking. For an extra surprise inside the fondant, freeze liquids such as peanut butter, caramel sauce, jelly, or chocolate sauce and place the frozen cube in the center of the batter. This creates a delicious, oozy filling that pairs wonderfully with the cake's outer layer. By incorporating these ingredients and techniques, one can create a delectable and unique chocolate fondant dessert to satisfy any palate."},{"prompt":"Here is a review left by a customer on a product.

Here is a question about this article: The outcome of the First World War was disastrous for both the German Reich and the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic. During the war, the Bolsheviks struggled for survival, and Vladimir Lenin recognised the independence of Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland. Moreover, facing a German military advance, Lenin and Trotsky were forced to enter into the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, which ceded massive western Russian territories to the German Empire. After Germany's collapse, a multinational Allied-led army intervened in the Russian Civil War (1917–22). What is the answer to this question: When did the russian civil war take place?","completion":"The Russian Civil War took place from 1917 to 1922. This conflict occurred following the October Revolution in 1917, when the Bolshevik Party, led by Vladimir Lenin, overthrew the Provisional Government and established a socialist government in Russia. The civil war was fought primarily between the Bolshevik Red Army and the White Army, which comprised various anti-Bolshevik forces including monarchists, liberals, and other socialist factions. Foreign intervention by the Allied powers, as well as the involvement of various regional and ethnic groups, further complicated the conflict. The war ultimately ended in 1922, with the Bolsheviks consolidating their power and the establishment of the Soviet Union."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The premise states that \\"It dramatizes how wanting and memory compete and explores how lonely, unhappy people mythologize their adolescence (D.T.\\" This clearly emphasizes the exploration of the feelings and memories of lonely and unhappy individuals as they look back on their adolescence. The premise's focus on the experiences and memories of those who are lonely and unhappy contrasts with the hypothesis's suggestion that the emphasis is on fulfilled, socially satisfied individuals. The two groups have distinct emotional backgrounds and are likely to have different perspectives and ways of recalling their past experiences. Furthermore, the premise also highlights the competition between wanting (desire) and memory, suggesting an exploration of how people long for things they cannot have or struggle to reconcile their present feelings with their past experiences. This theme may not be relevant or hold the same weight for individuals who are fulfilled and socially satisfied, as their experiences, desires, and memories may be more aligned.

How to compose interesting tweets on twitter<br>Be original. This is the most important way to make your twitter posts interesting. Nobody likes reading the same rehashed material over and over. Can we draw the following conclusion? You should only post once a day","completion":"While it is important to be original and create interesting tweets on Twitter, the conclusion that you should only post once a day doesn't necessarily follow from the initial advice given. Ensuring high-quality, engaging content is key, but there are no specific rules concerning how often you should tweet to be successful on the platform. You can maintain an active presence on Twitter by following a few simple guidelines and strategies. 1. Find your niche: Determine what you are passionate about and what your followers might be interested in. Focusing on a specific topic allows you to establish your expertise and attract a dedicated audience that shares the same interests. 2. Post consistently: While there's no strict rule on the number of tweets per day, it's essential to maintain a consistent presence on Twitter. Consistency helps your followers know when to expect new content and contributes to building a loyal following. This could mean tweeting multiple times a day, or maintaining the frequency of a few tweets per week. 3. Use a content calendar: Planning your tweets in advance can make it easier to maintain consistency and post engaging content without feeling overwhelmed. A content calendar allows you to keep track of significant events, holidays, and promotions, providing ample opportunities for crafting relevant tweets. 4. Engage with your audience: Twitter is all about interaction and conversation. Responding to tweets, retweeting interesting content from others, and participating in relevant Twitter chats are ways to create an engaging presence on the platform. Additionally, actively engaging with your audience will provide you with more opportunities for content ideas and conversation starters. 5. Utilize multimedia: Incorporate a variety of content formats such as images, GIFs, videos, and links to keep your tweets visually interesting and engaging. Multimedia tweets tend to perform better and are more likely to be retweeted, increasing your tweet's visibility. 6. Monitor trending topics and hashtags: Staying updated on what's trending can help you create timely, relevant content that connects with your audience's current interests. Use popular but relevant hashtags to increase the visibility of your tweets. 7. Be authentic: Be genuine in your tweets and share your thoughts, opinions, and experiences. Your audience will appreciate your authenticity and are more likely to engage with you when you show your true personality. In conclusion, while being original and interesting are essential aspects of composing tweets, they should not be equated with limiting posts to once a day. Instead, focus on sharing relevant, engaging content consistently, using multimedia, and connecting with your audience to create a robust presence on Twitter."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Police officials have warned that the person was extremely fortunate not to have been electrocuted while committing the crime. The incident has sent shockwaves across the community, raising concerns about public safety and the need for increased monitoring of such areas. Step 1: Discuss the incident The vandal, whose identity remains unknown, targeted five streetlights in the industrial town of Grangemouth, which is located in the Falkirk council area in Scotland. The act of vandalism appears to be deliberate, as the street lights were disabled in quick succession. This has led authorities to theorize that the individual may have been intending to create a dark environment for nefarious purposes. Step 2: Highlight the risks involved According to police reports, the perpetrator executed this act without significant injury due to sheer luck. Streetlights, which carry high voltages of electricity, pose a significant threat to anybody tampering with them. In this specific case, the vandal could have faced severe repercussions like electrocution or even death. Step 3: Delve into public safety concerns The deliberate disabling of streetlights poses a genuine concern for public safety. Darkness can potentially encourage criminal activity, putting both residents and visitors at risk for various offences such as theft, assault, and other threats. In response to the incident, public officials and community leaders have emphasized the importance of maintaining public lighting to ensure safety and deter crime in Grangemouth. Step 4: Discuss the reactions of local officials and citizens Local representatives and residents have expressed their shock and dismay at the vandal's actions, with many declaring it both reckless and highly irresponsible. Some have called for increased surveillance in the area, while others have urged citizens to remain vigilant and report any suspicious activities to the authorities. Step 5: Summarize the situation The act of vandalism in Grangemouth has left local residents unsettled but has been a strong reminder of the importance of public safety, the dangers of tampering with electrical installations, and the need for constant vigilance within communities. Police are currently investigating the case with the aim of apprehending the perpetrator, and local authorities are working to restore the damaged streetlights as soon as possible. Conclusion: As this incident has shown, senseless acts of vandalism can pose serious threats to public safety and even endanger the life of the vandal. It is crucial for community members to remain vigilant and report such incidents to the authorities to ensure the mutual safety of all individuals residing and working in the area. The Grangemouth streetlight vandal may have escaped electrocution this time, but their actions serve as a stark warning of the potential dangers of interfering with public utilities."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: A few years ago, in one experiment in behavioural psychology, Stanley Milgram of Yale University tested 40 subjects for their willingness to obey instructions given by a \\"leader\\" in a situation in which the subjects might feel a personal dislike of the actions they were called upon to perform. Specifically, Milgram told each volunteer \\"teacher-subject\\" that the experiment was in the noble cause of education, and was designed to test whether or not punishing pupils for their mistakes would have a positive effect on the pupils' ability to learn. The teacher-subjects were placed before a panel of thirty switches with labels ranging from \\"15 volts of electricity (slight shock)\\" to \\"450 volts (danger -- severe shock)\\" in steps of 15 volts each. The teacher-subject was told that whenever the pupil gave the wrong answer to a question, a shock was to be administered. The supposed \\"pupil\\" was in reality an actor hired by Milgram to pretend to receive the shocks by giving out cries and screams. Milgram told the teacher-subject to ignore the reactions of the pupil, and to administer whatever level of shock was called for. As the experiment unfolded, the \\"pupil\\" would deliberately give the wrong answers to questions, thereby bringing on various electrical punishments, even up to the danger level of 300 volts and beyond. Many of the teacher-subjects _ administering the higher levels of punishment, and turned to Milgram. In these situations, Milgram calmly explained that the teacher-subject was to carry on with the experiment and that it was important for the sake of the experiment that the procedure be followed through to the end. What Milgram was trying to discover was the number of teacher-subjects who would be willing to administer the highest levels of shock, even in the face of strong personal and moral revulsion against the rules and conditions of the experiment. Before carrying out the experiment, Milgram explained his idea to a group of 39 psychiatrists and asked them to predict the average percentage of people...

Step 2: Analyze the content of the comment The comment is focusing on political issues and the attitudes of individuals in regard to these issues. There is criticism of the DNC leaders and other commenters, but it doesn't specifically target someone's identity, such as their appearance, race, gender, or sexual orientation.

Former Arsenal forward Charlie Nicholas accused the Wales midfielder of playing 'Hollywood football' following the 3-3 draw with Anderlecht. Ramsey, though, said he 'knows his qualities'. He has yet to hit the heights of last season, when he scored 16 goals in all competitions for Arsenal - finding the net only three times in 17 appearances for club and country. Aaron Ramsey hurdles the challenge of Nicolas Lombaerts during Sunday night's draw in Belgium. Gareth Bale and Ramsey celebrate at the final whistle after securing a hard-earned point for the Welsh. He was out for three weeks with a hamstring injury sustained in Arsenal's 1-1 draw with Tottenham on September 27. Arsene Wenger has said his player must focus on getting his 'priorities right' between attack and defence. 'I’m not worried. I know my qualities,' said Ramsey. 'I’ve had a few injuries this season and I’m just getting back. 'To be honest, I’m still not 100 per cent physically there. It does take a bit out of me.

Ramsey was part of the Wales team who earned a point in Belgium to keep their hopes of qualifying for Euro 2016 very much alive. The 23-year-old praised manager Chris Coleman, but also predecessor Gary Speed, who Ramsey said laid the foundations. 'Chris has done really well,' he said. 'It was always difficult to come in after Gary Speed - whoever the manager was. 'To be fair to the gaffer, he was brave to take on the job. Now he has had his own input as well as building what Gary first started off. 'He’s done really well and you can see everyone is right behind him. We all want to go in the right direction.' The 0-0 draw places Wales second in Group B on eight points from four games, one point behind Israel. Scenes of jubilation greeted the final whistle, with Ramsey one of several players to throw his shirt to the celebrating travelling fans. 'It wasn’t a very exciting game for them to watch when we had the ball,' said Ramsey. 'We felt like that we needed them to get us over the line. We showed them our appreciation for getting us that point in the end. 'You can see the fans are right behind us. They have come over in numbers this week and they stuck with us all through the game even when we weren’t playing great. Ramsey says former Wales manager, the late Gary Speed, laid the foundations for the country's current form. 'We’ve got a very important point. We were under pressure for large periods of the game, but I felt we stuck together and that is something we have improved on dramatically in this campaign. We are very hard to beat and to score against. 'We are going in the right direction and we have kept the momentum going in terms of getting the point and keeping the points ticking over. 'We are second in the group but we would have snapped anyone’s hand off if we were offered that before the campaign began. 'We will go to Israel now full of confidence and hopefully be more dangerous with the ball. Hopefully it will be a more comfortable game for us.'

The caller claimed that the actress appeared to be suffering from a nervous breakdown and was acting aggressively. While the alleged incident did not involve any weapons, TMZ sources described the situation as disconcerting. The sources also revealed that the previous night, Spelling had called the police herself, fearing that someone was breaking into her home. It turned out to be her husband, Dean McDermott, arriving home and no intruder was found. The Blast obtained dispatch audio in which Tori Spelling is referred to as potentially having a \\"mental illness\\" issue. However, officers who spoke to People magazine would only confirm that the call pertained to a \\"disturbance\\" and that the situation was ongoing. While further information is yet to be revealed, it is worth mentioning that Spelling and McDermott have been struggling with financial woes over the past year, as reported by Page Six. Tori Spelling, best known for her role in the classic 90s TV series \\"Beverly Hills, 90210,\\" and Dean McDermott tied the knot in 2006 and have five children together. Unfortunately, in recent years, the couple has made more headlines for their financial struggles than their acting careers. Despite Spelling being the daughter of famed American television and film producer, Aaron Spelling, she stated in her 2013 autobiography \\"Spelling It Like It Is\\" that her parents did not leave her a substantial inheritance. This revelation spurred speculation and conversations regarding the management of her financial affairs. In the recent past, Spelling and McDermott have faced numerous lawsuits and financial setbacks. These include a lawsuit from City National Bank in 2016, which claimed that the couple owed a large sum after taking out a loan that was not repaid in full. Additionally, the couple was sued by American Express for outstanding credit card debts in 2016. To further compound their financial woes, they were ordered by the IRS to pay back taxes for the years 2014 and 2015. The couple's monetary issues have continued to escalate over the last year, which might have contributed to the recent disturbances at their home. The ongoing situation at Tori Spelling's California home raises concerns about her mental health and well-being. While law enforcement confirmed that they responded to a \\"disturbance,\\" the details of the incident are still emerging. The stressful circumstances surrounding Spelling and McDermott's financial woes may have contributed to the alleged nervous breakdown or aggressive behavior by the actress. In conclusion, the recent call to law enforcement and police response at Tori Spelling's residence has raised serious concerns about her mental health and the current status of her relationship with Dean McDermott. It remains to be seen whether the couple's financial struggles have exacerbated the situation, but it is clear that the situation is distressing for their family. As more details emerge, it is imperative to continue supporting and understanding the challenges faced by those in the public eye, as this can significantly impact their mental health and well-being."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Last year Schlemmer backed over her children with her van.","completion":"Title: The Tragic Case of Laurel Schlemmer: A Mother's Horrific Attempt to be a \\"Better Mother\\" Introduction: In a world where mothers are often seen as the epitome of love and protection for their children, the case of Laurel Schlemmer stands in stark contrast. At 40 years old, Schlemmer made the news headlines as a result of her tragic attempt to drown her youngest children, allegedly with the hope of becoming a better mother to her eldest son. The actions undertaken by Schlemmer have left a grieving family and appalled society grappling to understand the warped rationale behind her actions. The Incident: On the fateful day of the incident, Laurel Schlemmer decided that, in order to be a better mother to her seven-year-old son, she needed to drown her two youngest sons, aged 3 and 6. Luke Schlemmer, the three-year-old, lost his life after his mother allegedly sat on him while he was in the bathtub. His elder brother Daniel Schlemmer, aged 6, was put on life support with no brain activity after undergoing the same traumatic experience. Confirmation of Brain Death: The tragedy escalated when it was later confirmed that Daniel Schlemmer was brain dead. The lack of any response or activity emanating from the child's brain was a clear indication that he would never recover from his mother's actions. With no hope of revival, Daniel's life support was presumably removed, and his family was left to pick up the shattered pieces of their lives. The 911 Call and Suicide Watch: To compound the heartache, Mrs Schlemmer was interviewed by a 911 operator, to whom she provided a troubling account of the events leading up to her sons' drowning. She stated that while she was in the restroom, she left her sons to play in the bathtub. Upon returning to the bathroom, she claimed to have found her children unconscious. Whether or not this account was entirely accurate, it raises questions about the kind of support and supervision that were in place for the family. Following her confession, it was reported that Laurel Schlemmer was placed on suicide watch. This implies that the authorities were concerned about the potential risk she posed to herself in the aftermath of these tragic events. While determining the cause of the incident, it is possible that mental health factors may have played a significant role in her actions. An Earlier Incident: Yet, this was not the first time that Laurel Schlemmer had caused harm to her children. In a worrying development, it was revealed that she backed over her sons with her van just one year prior to the drowning incident. This prior occurrence brings to light the question of whether this earlier event should have acted as a warning sign for Schlemmer's ability to care for and protect her children, or if adequate intervention and support were provided to the family at that time. Conclusion: The tragic case of Laurel Schlemmer and the devastating loss of her two youngest sons highlights the importance of understanding the extreme pressures that some parents face and ensuring that mental health care and support are accessible to struggling families. Furthermore, it serves as an essential reminder to remain vigilant and responsive to warning signs exhibited by caregivers, such as previous incidents of harm towards their children. Only when we learn to recognise and respond to these warning signs can we hope to prevent future tragedies of this nature."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Abstract: Abstract Some techno-economical analyses and environmental impact evaluation have proved that bipolar membrane electrodialysis (BMED) is feasible for the reclamation of industrial saline water. However, to date, the technology cannot be put into practice due to some unsolved application-oriented problems, such as the requirements of BMED for feed solution, the availability of the produced acid and base, relatively high salt concentration of the effluent, and relatively low desalinating efficiency and capacity. In this work, a novel hybrid process, which coupled conventional electrodialysis installed with monovalent selective cation-exchange membranes with BMED running in a constant-voltage mode, was designed to reclaim brine generated from surface water desalination by the ion-exchange process. Subsequently, the response surface methodology was employed to establish the empirical models for understanding the influences of some initial operating conditions on BMED performance. Finally, the BMED-based reclamation scheme was confirmed again by a continuous BMED experiment on real solution. Specially, the effects of product concentration on current efficiency and energy consumption were investigated. In this case, an acceptable current efficiency and energy consumption were obtained on the basis of the conventional membranes and spacers when the product concentration was set as 0.9 M, which is adequate for the regeneration of ion-exchange resins..

It starts by emphasizing the importance of confirming if the store accepts checks for payment. This action is vital to ensure a smooth transaction and avoid misunderstandings. The paragraph then mentions that most businesses display acceptable payment methods on their front doors and registers, offering a practical way of obtaining the needed information. While the paragraph does not outright state that you should ask an employee if you cannot confirm whether a store accepts checks from the door or register, the suggestion is implied. The paragraph advises that you could also ask an employee whether the store accepts checks as an alternative, which complements the primary method of checking the front door or register. In this context, the two options act as complementary sources of information. Considering the information provided, the hypothesis can be seen as true. The paragraph suggests multiple ways to confirm if a store accepts checks for payment, with one being to inquire directly from an employee if the information cannot be confirmed through the business's front door or register signage. This notion aligns with the hypothesis, supporting its validity. Thus, although not explicitly stated, the paragraph does indeed align with the hypothesis, making it true. The best course of action when unsure about a store's acceptance of checks would be to consult an employee to obtain definitive confirmation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Fiat Croma is a large family car manufactured by the Italian automaker Fiat between 1985 to 1996, and then again from 2005 to 2010. It is known for its spacious interior and comfortable ride, making it suitable for family road trips or extensive travel. The first generation of Fiat Croma was an innovative design and ahead of its time in terms of comfort and spaciousness. The second generation, while not as groundbreaking, still offered solid performance and adaptability. On the other hand, the Saab 9000 is a luxury vehicle that was produced by the Swedish company Saab from 1984 to 1998. As implied in the data, the Saab 9000 is indeed related to the Fiat Croma. In the 1980s, Saab collaborated with the Italian automaker Fiat to create a new line of cars, under a project called 'Type Four.' Within this project's framework, they developed the Saab 9000 along with the Fiat Croma, the Lancia Thema, and the Alfa Romeo 164. The cars shared many components and systems but were still distinct from each other in terms of design and performance. This Saab 9000 is associated with a reputation for unrivaled safety features, a serious stance on power and performance, and a level of comfort that makes long-distance traveling enjoyable. Finally, the Alfa Romeo 164 was a full-size luxury sports sedan produced by the Italian car manufacturer Alfa Romeo from 1987 to 1998. It was the last model developed while Alfa Romeo was still an independent brand before being bought by Fiat. Like the Fiat Croma and Saab 9000, the Alfa Romeo 164 was also a result of the 'Type Four' project. The sedans share many similarities but were tailored to express their individual brand identities and cater to their specific target markets. The Alfa Romeo 164 was designed for drivers who wish to combine sports performance with comfort and luxury. Hence, a sentence that verbalizes this data could be: \\"The Fiat Croma, Saab 9000, and Alfa Romeo 164 are all related means of transportation, as they were developed under the shared 'Type Four' project, orchestrated by Fiat and Saab, which led to cars with many shared components but still each managing to express its brand's distinctive character and target specific segments of auto consumers.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Q:Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: What language did the author of the Moomin series speak even though she was Finnish? A:","completion":"The author of the Moomin series, Tove Jansson, mainly spoke Swedish despite being Finnish by nationality. Born on August 9, 1914, in Helsinki, Finland, Jansson belonged to a family of Finnish-Swedish origin. Her family, like many inhabitants of coastal Finland, was part of the Finland-Swedish minority who communicate mainly in Swedish and retain strong cultural ties to Sweden. In the Finland-Swedish community, which constitutes around 5% of Finland's population, Swedish is the mother tongue. This bilingualism is facilitated by Finland’s history, as it was under Swedish rule for an extensive period, from the late Middle Ages to 1809, when the Finnish territories were ceded to Russia. As a result, Finland continues to be a bilingual country where Finnish and Swedish are both recognized as official languages. Coming from such a diverse cultural background, Tove Jansson naturally grew up speaking Swedish, and this language became an essential part of her artistic expression. Her Moomin series, widely popular among children and adults alike, was originally written in Swedish as \\"Mumin.\\" The books have since been translated into over 50 languages, spreading the charm and appeal of the Moomin family and their quirky adventures across the globe. In addition to being an author, Jansson was also a well-regarded illustrator, painter, and comic strip artist, with her artistic inclinations deeply rooted in her family. Her mother, Signe Hammarsten-Jansson, was a Swedish-born graphic artist, while her father, Viktor Jansson, was a Finnish sculptor.

Please answer the following question: This article: Handel joined the Hamburg opera house when it was experiencing a period of considerable artistic success. This blossoming followed the arrival of Reinhard Keiser, who had become musical director at the Gänsemarkt in about 1697, and in 1703 succeeded Johann Kusser as the theatre's manager. Born in 1674, Keiser had studied under Johann Schelle and probably Johann Kuhnau at the Thomasschule zu Leipzig. In 1694 he was employed as a court composer at Brunswick, where in three years he composed seven operas, at least one of which (Mahumeth) was performed in Hamburg. According to Handel's biographer Donald Burrows, Keiser was a good judge of popular taste, with a flair for writing Italian-style arias. Between 1697 and 1703, prior to Handel's arrival, about a dozen more Keiser operas had been staged at the Gänsemarkt. Despite his on-stage successes, Keiser was an unreliable general manager, with expensive private tastes and little financial acumen, often at odds with his creditors.It is possible that Keiser, who had connections in the Halle area, had heard of Handel and was directly instrumental in securing the latter's post in the Gänsemarkt orchestra; certainly he was a considerable influence on the younger man in the three years that Handel spent in Hamburg. Another important Gänsemarkt colleague was the house composer and singer Johann Mattheson, who noted Handel's rapid progress in the orchestra from back-desk violinist to harpsichord soloist, a role in which, said Mattheson, \\"he showed himself a man—a thing which no one had before suspected, save I alone\\".

Answer the question...who played uncle jesse in the dukes of hazzard movie??","completion":"In the 2005 film adaptation of \\"The Dukes of Hazzard\\", Uncle Jesse Duke was portrayed by the versatile and accomplished actor Willie Nelson. Born on April 29, 1933, in Abbott, Texas, Willie Nelson is a renowned American musician, singer, songwriter, and actor. He is best known for his contribution to country music, which helped to pioneer the outlaw country subgenre. Apart from his prolific music career, Nelson has a long list of acting credits, appearing in over 30 films and television shows throughout his career, including the classics \\"The Electric Horseman\\" (1979) and \\"Honeysuckle Rose\\" (1980). His performance as Uncle Jesse Duke in \\"The Dukes of Hazzard\\" movie added a touch of authenticity and charisma to the character, as Nelson effortlessly delivered the down-home humor and wisdom of the original character. \\"The Dukes of Hazzard\\" film is based on the popular 1979-1985 television series of the same name. The story revolves around cousins Bo and Luke Duke, who live in the rural Hazzard County along with their cousin Daisy and Uncle Jesse. With their iconic orange 1969 Dodge Charger named the General Lee, the cousins always seem to run afoul of the law, represented by the corrupt county commissioner Boss Hogg and the bumbling Sheriff Rosco P. Coltrane. Despite its lighthearted nature, the movie and the original series touched on themes of good-natured rebelliousness and family values. The characters in the 2005 film adaptation were portrayed by different actors as compared to the original television series. In the TV series, Uncle Jesse Duke was played by Denver Pyle, who passed away in 1997, which led to Willie Nelson stepping into the role for the film version."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Where can you find millions of apple tree? Choose the most suitable option to answer the above question. Options： A. spain B. bible C. washington state D. woods E. orchard","completion":"C. Washington State The most suitable option from the given choices that can be associated with the presence of millions of apple trees is Washington State. Washington State, located in the northwestern United States, is the largest producer of apples in the country. The state's climate, fertile soil, and abundant natural resources provide an excellent environment for apple cultivation, making it home to numerous apple orchards. Washington State produces over 90% of the apples consumed in the United States, and also exports to 90 different countries. These apples are grown in both small family farms and large-scale commercial operations. The majority of apple production in Washington State is concentrated in the regions of the Yakima Valley, Wenatchee Valley, and Columbia Basin, where the unique soil composition and moderate temperatures make for ideal apple-growing conditions. Apple cultivation in the Washington State dates back to the 19th century, and over time the industry has grown and evolved. Today, Washington State produces a wide variety of apples such as Fuji, Gala, Granny Smith, Golden Delicious, and Honeycrisp, as well as the state’s well-known Red Delicious apples. While Spain (Option A) does produce apples, the quantity is not as significant as in Washington State. Option B, the Bible, is a religious text and not a physical location where apple trees can be found. Option D, the woods, is a generic term and does not specify a particular location where millions of apple trees can be identified. Option E, orchard, is a general term for a place where fruit trees are cultivated but is not specific enough to answer the question. In conclusion, it is Washington State (Option C) that best answers the question, as it is a significant location where millions of apple trees can be found due to its favorable climate and growing conditions for apple production."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

However, the FSB suggested growth would be uneven, with businesses in the South and in sectors such as technology and professional services feeling more positive.

The image of the vibrantly colored M&M's scattered across the floor was etched in her mind, but it was time to put those thoughts aside for the sake of her baby. As I dialed the doctor, I continued to massage Anna's back, trying to help ease the tension in her muscles and calm her nerves.

Time seemed to slip away as we focused on timing contractions, monitoring Anna's comfort levels, and keeping in touch with the doctor.

Athens dominates the Attica region and is one of the world's oldest cities, with its recorded history spanning over 3,400 years, and its earliest human presence starting somewhere between the 11th and 7th millennia BC. Classical Athens was a powerful city-state that emerged in conjunction with the seagoing development of the port of Piraeus, which had been a distinct city prior to its 5th century BC incorporation with Athens. A centre for the arts, learning and philosophy, home of Plato's Academy and Aristotle's Lyceum, it is widely referred to as the cradle of Western civilization and the birthplace of democracy, largely because of its cultural and political impact on the European continent, and in particular the Romans. In modern times, Athens is a large cosmopolitan metropolis and central to economic, financial, industrial, maritime, political and cultural life in Greece. In 2015, Athens was ranked the world's 29th richest city by purchasing power and the 67th most expensive in a UBS study. - HAT LS2 ( designation standing for \`\` Landplane , Single engine , 2 - seater ) is a light airplane developed by Hellenic Aeronautical Technologies ( HAT ) , a small Greek manufacturer of aerospace components .

Next question: where does bile go after it leaves the gallbladder?","completion":"After bile leaves the gallbladder, it follows a complex pathway through the biliary system, which is responsible for the production, storage, and transportation of bile. Bile is a greenish-yellow fluid produced by the liver that aids in the digestion and absorption of dietary fats in the small intestine. Here is a detailed step-by-step journey of bile after it leaves the gallbladder: 1. Contraction of the gallbladder: When you consume a meal, particularly one that contains fats, the presence of these fats in the stomach and small intestine triggers the release of a hormone called cholecystokinin (CCK). CCK acts on the gallbladder, causing it to contract and release bile that has been concentrated and stored. 2. Release into the biliary tract: The bile exits the gallbladder through the cystic duct, a small tube that connects the gallbladder to the common bile duct. 3. Common bile duct: The cystic duct joins with the hepatic duct, which transports bile produced by the liver, to form the common bile duct. The common bile duct is a long tube that extends from the liver to the first part of the small intestine, known as the duodenum. 4. Pancreatic duct: As the bile flows through the common bile duct, it is joined by the pancreatic duct, which carries digestive enzymes from the pancreas. The combined contents of both the common bile duct and the pancreatic duct form the ampulla of Vater. 5. Sphincter of Oddi: Just before the bile and pancreatic secretions enter the duodenum, they pass through a muscular valve called the sphincter of Oddi. This valve helps regulate the flow of bile and pancreatic secretions into the small intestine. 6. Duodenum: When the fats in the meal reach the duodenum, the sphincter of Oddi relaxes, allowing the bile and pancreatic secretions to enter the small intestine. Here, the bile begins to emulsify the fats, breaking them down into smaller droplets. This process increases the surface area of the fats, making it easier for digestive enzymes known as lipases to further break down the fats into absorbable molecules. 7. Absorption and recycling: The majority of the bile acids are reabsorbed in the ileum, the last part of the small intestine, through a process called enterohepatic circulation. Approximately 90-95% of bile acids are transported back to the liver via the portal vein, where they are taken up by liver cells and reused for bile production. The remaining 5-10% of bile acids are excreted in the feces, along with other waste products. In summary, bile leaves the gallbladder through the cystic duct, passes through the common bile duct and the sphincter of Oddi, and then enters the duodenum. Bile aids in digestion and absorption of dietary fats before being reabsorbed and returned to the liver for recycling or excretion."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

I was REALLY sad when my mom told me the news . My grandparents are pretty old , and my grandpa has been in pretty bad health the past few years . They loved Charlie , and it makes me really sad for them to lose him . What may be the reason for posting this ?","completion":"The possible reasons for posting this text could be: 1. Emotional sharing: The author might want to share their emotions, thoughts, and feelings with others. Losing a loved pet like Charlie can be a very emotional and challenging experience, and expressing one's sadness by talking about it can help in coping with the situation. Sometimes, people seek comfort in sharing their grief with others, as it helps them feel less alone in their struggle, and they might receive emotional support or empathetic responses from their audience. 2. Seeking advice: One of the primary reasons could be seeking advice on dealing with the loss of a pet, especially for elderly family members, such as their grandparents. Losing a beloved pet like Charlie can have a significant impact on mental health, particularly for older individuals who may struggle with loneliness or other emotional challenges. By sharing the situation, the author may be looking for guidance, recommendations, or insights into how best to support their grandparents and help them cope with their loss. 3. Raising awareness: This text could be aimed at raising awareness about the difficult choice of having to euthanize a suffering pet. This is an emotionally challenging decision for pet owners to make, and by sharing their experience, the author may want to highlight the importance of making this decision responsibly and compassionately. The sharing of such an experience could potentially help others who are facing similar situations and educate them on how to handle such decisions with care. 4. In tribute to Charlie: The author might want to share the memory of their beloved pet with others as a tribute or celebration of their pet's life. People often share recollections and stories of their pets as a way of honoring their memory and acknowledging the positive impact they had on their life. By sharing this information, the author is not only commemorating Charlie's life but also acknowledging the joy and happiness that he brought to their family and, in particular, their grandparents. 5. Building connections: Sharing personal experiences and stories can help people forge connections with others who may have gone through similar experiences. Losing a pet is a common experience, and by talking about it, the author can potentially connect with other pet owners who can empathize with their situation. This can lead to meaningful conversations, mutual support, and the development of new friendships or relationships built on shared experiences. Overall, the text seems to serve multiple purposes, such as sharing emotions, seeking advice, raising awareness, paying tribute to Charlie, and building connections with others who can understand the author's situation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Information: - Roy Buchanan (September 23, 1939 August 14, 1988) was an American guitarist and blues musician. A pioneer of the Telecaster sound, Buchanan worked as both a sideman and solo artist, with two gold albums early in his career, and two later solo albums that made it on to the Billboard chart. Despite never having achieved stardom, he is still considered a highly influential guitar player. \\"Guitar Player\\" praised him as having one of the \\"50 Greatest Tones of all Time.\\" He appeared on the PBS music program \\"Austin City Limits\\" in 1977 during Season 2. - Gordon \`\` Gordy '' Johnson , ( born 1952 in Minneapolis , Minnesota ) is an American double bassist and bass guitarist who has toured and / or recorded with numerous artists , a few of which include Roy Buchanan , Bill Carrothers , Lorie Line , Chuck Mangione , Dewey Redman , Greg Brown , Peter Ostroushko , Paul Winter Consort , Cliff Eberhardt , Maynard Ferguson , Becky Schlegel , Benny Weinbeck , Bradley Joseph , and Stacey Kent . He is the older brother of Allan Holdsworth and James Taylor bassist Jimmy Johnson . - Paul Winter (born August 31, 1939) is an American saxophonist (alto and soprano saxophone), and is a seven-time Grammy Award winner. - A pianist is an individual musician who plays the piano. Most forms of Western music can make use of the piano. Consequently, pianists have a wide variety of repertoire and styles to choose from, including traditionally classical music, Jazz, blues and all sorts of popular music, including rock music. Most pianists can, to a certain extent, play other keyboard-related instruments such as the synthesizer, harpsichord, celesta and the organ and keyboard. Perhaps the greatest pianist of all time was Franz Liszt, whose piano mastery was described by Anton Rubinstein: \\"In comparison with Liszt, all other pianists are children\\". - Glen Velez (born 1949) is an American percussionist, vocalist, and composer, specializing in frame drums from around the world. He is largely responsible for the increasing popularity of frame drums in the United States and around the world. - Keith Jarrett (born May 8, 1945) is an American jazz and classical music pianist. - The violin is a wooden string instrument in the violin family. It is the smallest and highest-pitched instrument in the family in regular use. Smaller violin-type instruments are known, including the violino piccolo and the kit violin, but these are virtually unused in the 2010s. The violin typically has four strings tuned in perfect fifths, and is most commonly played by drawing a bow across its strings, though it can also be played by plucking the strings with the fingers (pizzicato). Violins are important instruments in a wide variety of musical genres. They are most prominent in the Western classical tradition and in many varieties of folk music. They are also frequently used in genres of folk including country music and bluegrass music and in jazz. Electric violins are used in some forms of rock music; further, the violin has come to be played in many non-Western music cultures, including Indian music and Iranian music. The violin is sometimes informally called a fiddle, particularly in Irish traditional music and bluegrass, but this nickname is also used regardless of the type of music played on it. - Peter Ostroushko (born August 12, 1953) is an American violinist and mandolinist. - A composer (Latin \\"compn\\"; literally \\"one who puts together\\") is a person who creates or writes music, which can be vocal music (for a singer or choir), instrumental music (e.g., for solo piano, string quartet, wind quintet or orchestra) or music which combines both instruments and voices (e.g., opera or art song, which is a singer accompanied by a pianist). The core meaning of the term refers to individuals who have contributed to the tradition of Western classical music through creation of works expressed in written musical notation (e.g., sheet music scores). - Russ Landau is an American composer of film and television scores and themes including \\"seaQuest 2032\\", \\"Survivor\\", \\"Fear Factor\\", and \\"Pirate Master\\" for which he won an Emmy in 2008. He is an alumnus of the University of Bridgeport class of 1977 (South End, Bridgeport, Connecticut). - The Paul Winter Consort is an American musical group, led by soprano saxophonist Paul Winter. Founded in 1967, the group mixes elements of jazz, classical music, world music, and the sounds of animals and nature. They are often classified as \\"new age\\" or \\"ecological jazz\\", and their musical style is often called \\"Earth Music\\". The group has had many lineup changes since it was founded. Long-standing members currently in the group include Paul Winter, cellist Eugene Friesen, bassist Eliot Wadiopan, jazz oboist Paul McCandless, and percussionist and frame drum specialist Glen Velez. Past members who were part of the group for a considerable length of time include Paul Halley, Susan Osborn, Oscar Castro-Neves, Russ Landau, David Darling, Jim Scott and Rhonda Larson. - Oscar Castro-Neves (May 15, 1940 - September 27, 2013), was a Brazilian guitarist, arranger, and composer who is considered a founding figure in bossa nova. - Jazz is a music genre that originated amongst African Americans in New Orleans, United States, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Since the 1920s jazz age, jazz has become recognized as a major form of musical expression. It emerged in the form of independent traditional and popular musical styles, all linked by the common bonds of African American and European American musical parentage with a performance orientation. Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes, call and response vocals, polyrhythms and improvisation. Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression, and in African-American music traditions including blues and ragtime, as well as European military band music. Although the foundation of jazz is deeply rooted within the Black experience of the United States, different cultures have contributed their own experience and styles to the art form as well. Intellectuals around the world have hailed jazz as \\"one of America's original art forms\\". - Classical music is art music produced or rooted in the traditions of Western music, including both liturgical (religious) and secular music. While a more accurate term is also used to refer to the period from 1750 to 1820 (the Classical period), this article is about the broad span of time from roughly the 11th century to the present day, which includes the Classical period and various other periods. The central norms of this tradition became codified between 1550 and 1900, which is known as the common-practice period. The major time divisions of Western art music are as follows: European art music is largely distinguished from many other non-European and some popular musical forms by its system of staff notation, in use since about the 16th century. Western staff notation is used by composers to indicate to the performer the pitches (e.g., melodies, basslines, chords), tempo, meter and rhythms for a piece of music. This can leave less room for practices such as improvisation and \\"ad libitum\\" ornamentation, which are frequently heard in non-European art music and in popular-music styles such as jazz and blues. Another difference is that whereas most popular styles adopt the song (strophic) form, classical music has been noted for its development of highly sophisticated forms of instrumental music such as the concerto, symphony, sonata, and mixed vocal and instrumental styles such as opera which, since they are written down, can sustain larger forms and attain a high level of complexity. - Eugene Friesen (born 1952) is an American cellist and composer. - Tenor is a type of classical male singing voice whose vocal range is one of the highest of the male voice types. The tenor's vocal range (in choral music) lies between C, the C one octave below middle C, and A, the A above middle C. In solo work, this range extends up to C, or \\"tenor high C\\". The low extreme for tenors is roughly A (two As below middle C). At the highest extreme, some tenors can sing up to two Fs above middle C (F). The tenor voice type is generally divided into the \\"leggero\\" tenor, lyric tenor, spinto tenor, dramatic tenor, heldentenor, and tenor buffo or spieltenor. - Stanley Newcomb \\"Stan\\" Kenton (December 15, 1911 August 25, 1979) was an American jazz pianist, composer, and arranger who led an innovative, influential, and often controversial progressive jazz orchestra. In later years he was active as an educator. - Paul McCandless, Jr. (born March 24, 1947, Indiana, Pennsylvania) is an American multi-instrumentalist known for his time with the group Oregon. He is one of few expert jazz oboists. He also plays bass clarinet, English horn, and soprano saxophone. - Austin City Limits (ACL) is an American public television music program recorded live in Austin, Texas, by Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) member television station KLRU, and broadcast on many PBS stations around the United States. The show helped Austin to become widely known as the \\"Live Music Capital of the World\\", and is the only television show to receive the National Medal of Arts, which it was awarded in 2003. It also won a rare institutional Peabody Award in 2011 \\"for its more than three decades of presenting and preserving eclectic American musical genres.\\" For the first 12 seasons (1976-1987), \\"Austin City Limits\\" was produced by the Southwest Texas Public Broadcasting Council. Beginning in Season 13 (1988), \\"Austin City Limits\\" moved to its current production home at Austin's PBS affiliate KLRU, the Capital of Texas Public Telecommunications Council. - Randolph Denard Ornette Coleman (March 9, 1930 June 11, 2015) was an American jazz saxophonist, violinist, trumpeter, and composer. He was one of the major innovators of the free jazz movement of the 1960s, a term he invented with the name of . He was awarded a MacArthur Fellowship in 1994. His album \\"Sound Grammar\\" received the 2007 Pulitzer Prize for music. - A sideman is a professional musician who is hired to perform or record with a group of which he or she is not a regular member. They often tour with solo acts as well as bands and jazz ensembles. Sidemen are generally required to be adaptable to many different styles of music, and so able to fit smoothly into the group in which they are currently playing. Often aspiring musicians start out as sidemen, and then move on to develop their own sound, a name, and fans of their own, or go on to form their own groups. Some examples of this are: Some sidemen become famous for their musical specialties, and become highly sought-after by pop, rock, blues, jazz and country music bands. Examples of some of these include multi-instrumentalists. David Lindley is a multi-instrumentalist who has worked with such diverse musicians as Curtis Mayfield, Dolly Parton, Jackson Browne, and Hani Naser. Lindley used his time as a sideman to discover and master new instruments while on tour around the world, becoming proficient on ethnic instruments rarely seen in Western music genres. He has mastered so many that he admits to losing count, and instead placed a photo gallery of them on his website. - Bradley Joseph (born 1965) is an American composer, arranger, and producer of contemporary instrumental music. His compositions include works for orchestra, quartet, and solo piano, while his musical style ranges from \\"quietly pensive mood music to a rich orchestration of classical depth and breadth\\". - Stacey Kent (born March 27, 1968) is a Grammy-nominated American jazz singer. She is married to British tenor saxophonist Jim Tomlinson - Reno is a city in the U.S. state of Nevada. It is located in Northern Nevada, approximately from Lake Tahoe.

It is the county seat of Washoe County, located in the northwestern part of the state. The city sits in a high desert at the foot of the Sierra Nevada and its downtown area (along with Sparks) occupies a valley informally known as the Truckee Meadows. - Free jazz is an approach to jazz music that was first developed in the 1950s and 1960s as musicians attempted to alter, extend, or break down jazz convention, often by discarding fixed chord changes or tempos. Though the music of free jazz composers varied widely, a common feature was dissatisfaction with the limitations of bebop, hard bop, and modal jazz that had developed in the 1940s and 1950s. Often described as avant-garde, free jazz has also been described as an attempt to return jazz to its primitive, often religious, roots and emphasis on collective improvisation. - A mandolin (; literally \\"small mandola\\") is a musical instrument in the lute family and is usually plucked with a plectrum or \\"pick\\". It commonly has four courses of doubled metal strings tuned in unison (8 strings), although five (10 strings) and six (12 strings) course versions also exist. The courses are normally tuned in a succession of perfect fifths. It is the soprano member of a family that includes the mandola, octave mandolin, mandocello and mandobass. - Lorie Line (born 1958) is a classically trained pianist, composer, and performer from Minneapolis, Minnesota.

He came to prominence playing in Stan Kenton's orchestra before forming his own band in 1957. He was noted for his bands, which often served as stepping stones for up-and-coming talent, and his ability to play expressively and accurately in a remarkably high register. - The flugelhorn (also spelled fluegelhorn, flugel horn, or Flügelhornfrom German, \\"wing horn,\\" ) is a brass instrument pitched in B, and resembles a trumpet, but has a wider, conical bore. The instrument known today as the flugelhorn was developed from the valved bugle and is a member of the saxhorn family, which was developed by Adolphe Sax, who also created the saxophone family. The modern flugelhorn and Sax's B soprano (contralto) saxhorn are practically the same instrument. - A bandleader is the leader of a music group such as a rock or pop group or jazz quartet. The term is most commonly, though not exclusively, used with a group that plays popular music as a small combo or a big band, such as one which plays jazz, blues, rhythm and blues or rock and roll music. Most bandleaders are also performers with their own band, either as singers or as instrumentalists, playing an instrument such as electric guitar, piano, or other instruments. - Charles Frank \\"Chuck\\" Mangione (born November 29, 1940) is an American flugelhorn player, trumpeter and composer. - Walter Dewey Redman (May 17, 1931 September 2, 2006) was an American jazz saxophonist, known for performing free jazz as a bandleader, and with Ornette Coleman and Keith Jarrett.

Can you tell me the answer to when was the first five year plan started in india??","completion":"The first Five-Year Plan in India was formulated and initiated in 1951, under the leadership of India's first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru. The Planning Commission, which was an Indian government institution created in 1950, was given the responsibility of formulating and administering the Five-Year Plans. The overarching aim of the first Five-Year Plan was to focus on the balanced and integrated development of India, which had just gained its independence from British colonial rule in 1947. The first Five-Year Plan, which spanned from 1951 to 1956, mainly concentrated on the development of the primary sector, particularly agriculture, as a priority in order to achieve self-sufficiency in food production and address the challenges posed by famine, extreme poverty, and unemployment. The plan also sought to enhance national income, bring about a fair distribution of wealth, reduce income inequality, and promote rapid industrialization. Some important projects and initiatives executed during the first Five-Year Plan include: 1. Agrarian Reforms: Land reforms such as the redistribution of land, the abolition of intermediaries, and consolidation of holdings were undertaken to address issues of landholding inequalities and improve agricultural productivity. 2. Multipurpose River Valley Projects: Initiatives like the Damodar Valley Corporation (DVC), the Bhakra Nangal Dam, and the Hirakud Dam Project were launched to produce hydroelectric power and irrigate vast agricultural lands. 3. Community Development Programme: This program aimed for the socio-economic development of rural India by strengthening Panchayati Raj Institutions. 4. Industrial Development: A series of industries, including engineering, shipbuilding, steel, and fertilizers, was encouraged to lay foundations for future expansion and growth. Public Sector Industries, such as Hindustan Machine Tools (HMT) and Indian Telephone Industries (ITI), were established during this period. 5. Infrastructure Development: Investment was directed to infrastructure development, including transportation, communication, and power. The first Five-Year Plan laid the groundwork and set the direction for future economic planning in India. It achieved a 3.6% annual growth rate, higher than the targeted 2.1%, improving the agricultural infrastructure and alleviating poverty to some extent. Though the first plan was moderately successful, the subsequent Five-Year Plans progressively shifted focus to industry and service sectors and strived for an even broader and more comprehensive development strategy, aiming to transform India into a robust and vibrant economy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"Title: Father in Eastern Zhejiang Province Takes Drastic Measures to Protect Injured Son Introduction: In the rural regions of Eastern Zhejiang province, a heart-wrenching story of a father and his son's life-changing ordeal unfolds. The father, He Pengwei, shackled himself to his son, He Zili, after the boy suffered a debilitating head injury in a tragic accident when he was just one-year-old. Step 1: Exploring the backstory The family's life took a tragic turn following Zil's injury, which left him with cognitive and behavioral impairments. Due to financial constraints, the family could not afford proper medical attention for Zili, leaving his father to find alternative ways to keep him safe and supervised at all times. It is important to mention this information in the article to help readers connect with the family and understand their struggles. Step 2: Describing the shackling He Pengwei has taken a drastic measure to ensure Zili's safety by shackling both of their ankles together with a short, sturdy chain, allowing them to stay within close proximity. This prevents Zili from inadvertently wandering off and finding himself in more dangerous situations. Describe the chain's length and how the shackling affects their day-to-day activities. Step 3: The impact on the family The shackling has undoubtedly put a strain on the father, who is also the main breadwinner for the family. Despite the overwhelming physical and emotional challenges, He Pengwei remains committed to protecting his son, and his dedication has also garnered the support of their small, tight-knit community. Step 4: The community's reaction Neighbors and community members in their village have come forward with assistance, providing financial and emotional support to the family. Highlight the empathy and compassion exhibited by the locals, showcasing the true spirit of community during difficult times. Step 5: Exploring possible solutions As He Pengwei continues to tirelessly support his son, more attention is being directed to improving the family's situation. The story has sparked a debate on the availability and affordability of healthcare in rural regions such as Eastern Zhejiang province, giving hope for potential reforms. Conclusion: He Zili's plight and his father's unwavering dedication is an inspiring yet somber tale of unconditional love and the lengths a parent will go to for the sake of their child. It also serves as a reminder of the importance of accessible healthcare for all and the power of a supportive community in times of adversity."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

During the birth of her younger son, Farrow began bleeding badly. Dr. Paris managed to solve the problem in a delicate procedure. \\"Twenty years ago, she probably would have died,\\" he says. Today, when he performs school sports physical examinations for the Farrow boys, 10 and 11, he is always reminded that lives are changed forever by doctors just doing their jobs. To be a mix of country doc and somewhat adventurer, the 55-year-old family physician moved to Hailey after completing his residency . He hoped to practice medicine there and ski at nearby Sun Valley. Unfortunately, the only job opening was for an emergency-room doctor in Missoula, Montana, 300 miles away. Dr. Paris took it. \\"I'd ski all day and then drive all night to be in Missoula for a 48-hour shift,\\" he recalls. \\"I'm lucky to be alive.\\" Knowing he couldn't keep up with his eight-hour commute , he began taking flying lessons. In 1981, Dr. Paris joined a small medical practice in Hailey, a former mining town with a population at the time of 2,109. As Hailey grew in the shadow of Sun Valley's booming popularity, Dr. Paris's own practice expanded to seven physicians, including his wife, Kathryn Woods, who is also a family doctor. They met in 1986 at a certification exam in Denver when, in a room full of men in stodgy suits, Woods arrived wearing a Lycra biking outfit and carrying the front wheel of her bicycle (which she couldn't lock up outside). Dr. Paris asked her out on the spot. In 1989, they married. Question: Dr. Paris often reminds himself that _ .

Step 2: Collecting survey data on young people's awareness Gather data from surveys conducted among young people that assess their knowledge and understanding of the risks associated with military service. These surveys could be specifically conducted in high schools, colleges, and universities and can show young people's understanding of the potential dangers and challenges faced by military personnel. Step 3: Research on the influence of media and access to information Explore how the Internet and social media play a significant role in educating young people about military service risks. For example, exposure to news articles, documentaries, and personal stories of veterans may provide them with a better understanding of the physical, psychological, and emotional consequences of serving in the military and help them make informed decisions. Step 4: Investigate the impact of educational programs Present evidence of the effectiveness of educational programs and initiatives aimed at informing young people about military service risks. These programs could be implemented by independent organizations, government agencies, or even the military itself to provide an accurate portrayal of military life. Step 5: Analyzing recruitment policies and practices Review the policies and practices of military recruitment in recent years, focusing on the transparency and accuracy of information provided to potential recruits. This could demonstrate that the military is taking steps to ensure that young people are well-informed on the risks of service before making their decision. Step 6: Collect expert opinions and testimony Gather opinions from experts in the fields of psychology, sociology, and military studies. These experts can provide their insights on young people's awareness of risks and the likelihood of being misled by military personnel. Step 7: Analyze the decline in military enlistment numbers Examine trends in military enlistment numbers over the past years. If there is a decline in the numbers, it may suggest that young people are increasingly aware of the risks involved in military service, leading to a lower willingness to join. By following these steps, we can compile strong evidence supporting the claim that young people are aware of the risks of military service and would not be easily misled by military personnel. This evidence would include survey data, information from media and educational programs, expert opinions, and relevant trends in military enlistment numbers."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Birthday presents wrapped in colorful paper, brown paper packages mailed from a friend. No matter what kind of box it is, people like to open it up and see what's inside. In America, and in many other countries, one special kind of box contains the future. It's called a ballot box. What people put into the box on election day can change the course of history. Elections are the lifeblood of a democracy. The word democracy literally means \\"the people rule,\\" an important concept in American history. In the mid-1700s, England began passing laws that made the American colonies angry. The colonists had to pay more and more taxes and enjoyed less and less freedom. They felt the government of England didn't represent their interests. On July 4, 1776, the colonies declared their independence from England. They wanted to establish a democracy where people could have a voice in government. An effective democracy holds regular elections. In America, elections are held every two years for members of Congress. In these elections, all seats in the House of Representatives and one-third of the Senate seats are up for grabs. In addition, every four years, voters go to the polls to elect the nation's president and vice-president. Voters also regularly cast their ballots for state and city government leaders and local school board members. Sometimes they also have to vote on a proposed law. In the American electoral system, people don't really vote for presidential candidates. Instead, voters cast their ballots for \\"electors\\" who support each candidate. Each state has as many electors as the total number of its representatives in Congress. This equals two senators per state plus the number of its representatives in the House (which is based on the state's population). The candidate who has the most votes in a state wins all of the state's electors. To win the presidential election, a candidate must gain at least 270 of the 538 total electoral votes.

Throughout these changes, Yorkshire has continued to be recognised as a geographical territory and cultural region. The name is familiar and well understood across the United Kingdom and is in common use in the media and the military, and also features in the titles of current areas of civil administration such as North Yorkshire, South Yorkshire, West Yorkshire and East Riding of Yorkshire. - In England, a civil parish is a territorial designation which is the lowest tier of local government below districts and counties, or their combined form, the unitary authority. It is an administrative parish, in contrast to an ecclesiastical parish. - Newburgh Priory is a large house near Coxwold , North Yorkshire , England .

Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below. Which test would need higher temperature, case A or case B? Mike was interested in the science behind polar compounds. To that end, he collected two compounds, compound A and compound B. Compound A was a polar compound, but compound B was a nonpolar compound. He then conducted two tests, case A and case B. In case A, he changed the state of a polar compound from solid to liquid. And, in case B, he changed the state of a nonpolar compound from solid to liquid. Hint: Changes of state from solid to liquid and from liquid to gas occur when matter gains energy. The energy allows individual molecules to separate and move apart from one another. It takes more energy to bring about these changes of state for polar molecules. Although hydrogen bonds are weak, they add to the energy needed for molecules to move apart from one another, so it takes higher temperatures for these changes of state to occur in polar compounds. This explains why polar compounds have relatively high melting and boiling points. The Table below compares melting and boiling points for some polar and nonpolar covalent compounds.

I just want to go one night without watching a dang debate. Here is my recap of the last one. Won’t that suffice? If not, here is the Wednesday night Univision/Washington Post debate summarized for those of you who were not unexpectedly trapped when helping a seemingly friendly stranger move a large unwieldy piece of furniture into a van and forced to watch these debates FOREVER PLEASE HAVE MERCY SEND SNACKS AT LEAST. Clinton: Thank you for having me. I’ve been looking forward to this debate. Maria Elena Salinas: Secretary Clinton, why don’t people trust you? Clinton: Maybe it’s because I just said that I was looking forward to this debate, which is either a bald-faced lie or a sign that I am some kind of a sociopath. We had one of these three days ago. Why would we have another one now? Did you just want to torment me by putting me in another situation where a man makes unrealistic promises and waves his arms while I have to smile and look unruffled, all the while living with the knowledge that somehow he was what the people of Michigan wanted, not me? What does he have that I do not have? Does this answer your question? Salinas: Secretary Clinton, why don’t people like you? Clinton: HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO ANSWER THAT IS THERE AN ANSWER I CAN GIVE WHERE YOU STOP ASKING ME THIS QUESTION HOW WOULD YOU LIKE IT IF PEOPLE CAME UP TO YOU ONCE A WEEK AND ASKED YOU WHY NOBODY LIKED YOU Salinas: Where did you fail in Michigan? Clinton: (pinches herself repeatedly) Dang it. For a second I was hoping that this was my recurring nightmare where I lose a state and then I have to stand on national TV and look calm and say, “gee, I don’t know what went wrong, but I’m confident looking forward” but NOPE it’s my recurring REALITY where that is also true. Jorge Ramos: Senator Sanders, what’s your path forward? Sanders: My path forward is great! It’s a revolution! Jorge Ramos: Senator Sanders, now for a difficult question. What color is your suit? Sanders: Thank you, Jorge. I think it is blue, but mostly it is whatever color your dreams are. Salinas: Senator Sanders, are you loving this weather? Sanders: Thank you for asking. I sure am. Ramos: Secretary Clinton, what about your emails? Who gave you permission to do a thing like that? Will you drop out of the race if you are indicted? Clinton: Wait why am I getting these questions? Why aren’t you asking Bernie anything that remotely resembles this? Um, look, a lot of this was classified retroactively and we all know what that counts for. Remember when J. K. Rowling classified Dumbledore retroactively? A lot of people got quite upset about that. At a debate hosted by The Washington Post and Univision in Miami, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton answered a question about her private email server and a potential indictment by saying, \\"That's not going to happen.\\" (The Washington Post) Ramos: Senator Sanders, would you like to go after Secretary Clinton on this subject? Sanders: No, thank you. I would prefer to appear statesmanlike and say vague things about process. Karen Tumulty: Secretary Clinton, you know Donald Trump. Clinton: (chuckles) (laughs) (laughs more) (tears podium in half) (lights the halves on fire with her eyes while continuing to laugh) (watches the podium burn) (begins weeping) what was the question I’m sorry Karen Tumulty: Is Donald Trump racist? Clinton: Wow okay did not realize that was where this was going. Um. Everything he says is racist? His words are racist, definitely. Him? Who can say. Sanders: Don’t forget the Birther movement! That was crazy! Salinas: Secretary Clinton, are you pandering to Hispanics with your stance on the pathway to citizenship — or some might say, hispandering? Clinton: I refuse to answer this question on the grounds that the pun in it is too terrible. Look, there is no daylight between me and President Obama, unless you need there to be. Also Senator Sanders voted against Ted Kennedy’s immigration reform and he supports the Minutemen, a group of dangerous vigilantes! Sanders: The Minutemen? No way. I supported Nite Owl, but that was it. And Senator Kennedy was a friend of mine. I knew Ted Kennedy. You, ma’am, are no– Salinas: Oh, look, it’s time for commercial! Ramos: And we’re back. Secretary Clinton, will you deport children? Clinton: No! I won’t deport children! I think I was trying to give you a more nuanced answer about process but if you’re going to keep asking then, no, no I won’t. Sanders: I can confidently promise that a President Sanders will never deport children! Clinton: (hopefully) Are you saying that because you don’t believe President Sanders will happen? At a debate hosted by The Washington Post and Univision, Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton and fellow candidate Bernie Sanders said they would differ from President Obama in their plans for deporting immigrants who entered the country illegally. (The Washington Post) Salinas: Secretary, didn’t you at some point vote for a wall like Donald Trump? Clinton: No, no, he wants a — yuge beautiful tall wall. Tumulty: Is — is that supposed to be your Trump impression? Clinton: What’s wrong with it? ‘A beautiful tall wall’ ‘and Mexico will pay for it.’ Tumulty: Secretary Clinton, only 37 percent of Americans trust you. Why is that? Clinton: I WISH I KNEW Clinton: Look. No one who has ever watched me at any point, ever, would say I was a natural politician. They often say I am an “unnatural politician” or a “barely lifelike politician” or “why does she keep doing this? it’s painful to watch.” But I keep trying. Please just let me have this once. I am all too aware that when Bill walks into a room, everyone around him lights up like a Christmas tree, and when I walk into a room everyone wilts like a fern on a radiator. President Obama is a charismatic orator. I, on the other hand — frankly the least credible argument that Senator Sanders is pushing against me is this idea that somehow, in secret, I was able to give Wall Street an incredible, beautiful speech. Have I ever, even once in my life, given an incredible, beautiful speech? Ramos: Secretary Clinton, I’d like to ask about Benghazi? Clinton: ARE WE SERIOUS RIGHT NOW? WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS? WASN’T ELEVEN HOURS OF TESTIMONY ENOUGH? Ramos: NOTHING WILL EVER BE ENOUGH Tumulty: Florida is going to disappear if climate change continues! Here is a map! Sanders: Oh no! How awful! Do you know what will fix this? Clinton: Let me guess. A complete political revolution? Sanders: That’s exactly right! A complete political revolution! That will fix everything! Millions of people are going to stand up and tell the fossil fuel companies where they can shove it! Audience: YES THIS SOUNDS VIABLE! Sanders: DO YOU HEAR THE PEOPLE SING, SECRETARY? Clinton: And the same goes for your single-payer plan– Sanders: SINGING THE SONGS OF ANGRY MEN! Clinton: We’re just going to — not worry about the Republicans who want to repeal Obamacare, because we will have a guaranteed political revolution that will fix all of this. (pulls out a flask) Sure. Great. Ramos: Senator Sanders, here is some grainy old video of you saying that Cuba is great. What do you make of this? Sanders: Are you sure that’s not Bruce Rappaport? Clinton: You say you want a revolution, Senator Sanders? How about THAT revolution? Because I do NOT support this kind of revolution ONE BIT! No oppression! No disappearing people! None of these 1984 tactics! I hate Big Brother! Clinton: PLEASE ELECT ME PLEASE I’M GOOD ENOUGH I’M SMART ENOUGH I’VE COME AND STOOD THROUGH ALL THESE DEBATES I AM BEGGING YOU I DON’T THINK I CAN DO THIS AGAIN IN 2024. Sanders: I haven’t gotten to give my stump speech yet tonight! (clears throat) America is broken. The one percent and vulture capitalists have taken everything from the disappearing middle class, and we have a rigged economy! This is oligarchy! Free college for everyone, even and especially Donald Trump’s children! Clinton: (pinches herself again) Nope. Well, figured it was worth a try.

This is the most diverse group of seed plants, and examples include grasses, trees, herbs, and shrubs. As they produce seeds within a fruit rather than in cones, they do not fit the description provided in the paragraph. - Deciduous: Deciduous plants are those that shed their leaves during a specific season, typically in the fall. Deciduous is an attribute that can apply to different types of plants, including both angiosperms and gymnosperms. However, it is not a term used to describe seed production, so it cannot be the correct answer in this context. - Perennials: Perennial plants are those that live for more than two years, and they can be found among angiosperms and gymnosperms.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Wladyslaw Gomulka (Polish: [vwa'diswaf go'muwka]; 6 February 1905 - 1 September 1982) was a Polish communist politician. He was the de facto leader of post-war Poland until 1948. Following the Polish October he became leader again from 1956 to 1970. Gomulka was initially very popular for his reforms; his seeking a \\"Polish way to socialism\\"; and giving rise to the period known as \\"Gomulka's thaw\\". Wladyslaw Gomulka was born on 6 February 1905 in Bialobrzegi Franciszkanskie village on the outskirts of Krosno, into a worker's family living in the Austrian Partition (the Galicia region). His parents had met and married in the United States, where each had emigrated in search of work in the late 19th century, but returned to occupied Poland in the early 20th century because Wladyslaw's father Jan was unable to find gainful employment in America. Jan Gomulka then worked as a laborer in the Subcarpathian oil industry. Wladyslaw's older sister Jozefa, born in the US, returned there upon turning eighteen to join her extended family, most of whom had emigrated, and to preserve her US citizenship. Wladyslaw and his two other siblings experienced a childhood of the proverbial Galician poverty: they lived in a dilapidated hut and ate mostly potatoes. Wladyslaw received only rudimentary education before being employed in the oil industry of the region. Gomulka attended schools in Krosno for six or seven years, until the age of thirteen, when he had to start an apprenticeship in a metalworks shop. Throughout his life Gomulka was an avid reader and accomplished a great deal of self-education, but remained a subject of jokes because of his lack of formal education and demeanor. In 1922, Gomulka passed his apprenticeship exams and began working at a local refinery. The re-established Polish state of Gomulka's teen years was a scene of growing political polarization and radicalization. The young worker developed connections with the radical Left, joining the Sila (Power) youth organization in 1922 and the Independent Peasant Party in 1925. Gomulka was known for his activism in the metal workers and, from 1922, chemical industry unions. He was involved in union-organized strikes and in 1924, during a protest gathering in Krosno, participated in a polemical debate with Herman Lieberman. He published radical texts in leftist newspapers. In May 1926 the young Gomulka was for the first time arrested, but soon released because of worker demands. The incident was the subject of a parliamentary intervention by the Peasant Party. In October 1926, Gomulka became a secretary of the managing council in the Chemical Industry Workers Union for the Drohobych District and remained involved with that communist-dominated union until 1930. He around this time learned on his own basic Ukrainian. Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: Was he an activist at all?","completion":"Yes, Wladyslaw Gomulka was an activist.

Thomas Howell) horror filled trip through Texas at the mercy of a crazed murderer, he works as a police officer, but has recently been suspended for using excessive force on a kidnapping suspect. It is revealed his girlfriend, Maggie (Kari Wuhrer), has her own crop dusting business. Jim makes a call to retired Captain Estridge in Texas, who asks Jim to come down to Texas to talk to him face to face about his mental scars from the last movie. Maggie, who obviously does not know about the event, pleads with Jim to let her tag along.Arriving in Texas, the couple pick up a car that Estridge has left for them, and set off to his house. Jim notices a sign along the highway announcing DANGER: DO NOT PICK UP HITCHHIKERS which sets him into flashback mode. The two see an RV that has run off the road, with blood dripping through the door. Maggie wants to stop and help, but Jim speeds up, irritating her and making her more curious about his erratic behavior. Soon, a motorcycle speeds past them and wrecks. Maggie lets the driver into the back, against Jim's understandable protests. The hitcher (Jake Busey) reveals his name to be 'Jim', and after Maggie tells him her occupation he remarks \\"A farm girl!\\" He asks them what they are in Texas for, and Jim responds with \\"None of your damn business.\\" The Hitcher doesn't appear fazed by Jim's impolite behavior.

Question: Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: What city obtained strategic importance after the Byzantine invasion of 554 Context: A few centuries later, coinciding with the first waves of the invading Germanic peoples (Suevi, Vandals and Alans, and later the Visigoths) and the power vacuum left by the demise of the Roman imperial administration, the church assumed the reins of power in the city and replaced the old Roman temples with religious buildings. With the Byzantine invasion of the southwestern Iberian peninsula in 554 the city acquired strategic importance. After the expulsion of the Byzantines in 625, Visigothic military contingents were posted there and the ancient Roman amphitheatre was fortified. Little is known of its history for nearly a hundred years; although this period is only scarcely documented by archeology, excavations suggest that there was little development of the city. During Visigothic times Valencia was an episcopal See of the Catholic Church, albeit a suffragan diocese subordinate to the archdiocese of Toledo, comprising the ancient Roman province of Carthaginensis in Hispania.

What is the answer for the question: What is the name of the person since whose death only Samson et Dalila has been regularly staged? from the following article ? Discounting his collaboration with Dukas in the completion of Guiraud's unfinished Frédégonde, Saint-Saëns wrote twelve operas, two of which are opéras comiques. During the composer's lifetime his Henry VIII became a repertory piece; since his death only Samson et Dalila has been regularly staged, although according to Schonberg, Ascanio (1890) is considered by experts to be a much finer work. The critic Ronald Crichton writes that for all his experience and musical skill, Saint-Saëns \\"lacked the 'nose' of the theatre animal granted, for example, to Massenet who in other forms of music was his inferior\\". In a 2005 study, the musical scholar Steven Huebner contrasts the two composers: \\"Saint-Saëns obviously had no time for Massenet's histrionics\\". Saint-Saëns's biographer James Harding comments that it is regrettable that the composer did not attempt more works of a light-hearted nature, on the lines of La princesse jaune, which Harding describes as like Sullivan \\"with a light French touch\\".Although most of Saint-Saëns's operas have remained neglected, Crichton rates them as important in the history of French opera, as \\"a bridge between Meyerbeer and the serious French operas of the early 1890s\\". In his view, the operatic scores of Saint-Saëns have, in general, the strengths and weaknesses of the rest of his music – \\"lucid Mozartian transparency, greater care for form than for content ... There is a certain emotional dryness; invention is sometimes thin, but the workmanship is impeccable.\\" Stylistically, Saint-Saëns drew on a range of models. From Meyerbeer he drew the effective use of the chorus in the action of a piece; for Henry VIII he included Tudor music he had researched in London; in La princesse jaune he used an oriental pentatonic scale; from Wagner he derived the use of leitmotifs, which, like Massenet, he used sparingly. Huebner observes that Saint-Saëns was more conventional than Massenet so far as through composition is concerned, more often favouring discrete arias and ensembles, with less...","completion":"The name of the person you are looking for is Camille Saint-Saëns.

Licensed to serve the community of Pine Ridge , South Dakota , USA , the station is currently owned by Alleycat Communications . - Community radio is a radio service offering a third model of radio broadcasting in addition to commercial and public broadcasting. Community stations serve geographic communities and communities of interest. They broadcast content that is popular and relevant to a local, specific audience but is often overlooked by commercial or mass-media broadcasters. Community radio stations are operated, owned, and influenced by the communities they serve. They are generally nonprofit and provide a mechanism for enabling individuals, groups, and communities to tell their own stories, to share experiences and, in a media-rich world, to become creators and contributors of media. - South Dakota is a state located in the Midwestern region of the United States. It is named after the Lakota and Dakota Sioux Native American tribes, who compose a significant portion of the population and historically dominated the entire territory. South Dakota is the 17th most expansive, but the 5th least populous and the 5th least densely populated of the 50 United States. Once the southern portion of the Dakota Territory, South Dakota became a state on November 2, 1889, simultaneously with North Dakota. Pierre is the state capital and Sioux Falls, with a population of about 171,000, is South Dakota's largest city. - Communication (from Latin \\"commnicre\\", meaning \\"to share\\") is the act of conveying intended meanings from one entity or group to another through the use of mutually understood signs and semiotic rules. - Classic rock is a radio format which developed from the album-oriented rock (AOR) format in the early 1980s. In the United States, the classic rock format features music ranging generally from the late 1960s to the late 1980s, primarily focusing on commercially successful hard rock popularized in the 1970s. The radio format became increasingly popular with the baby boomer demographic by the end of the 1990s. - Album-oriented rock (abbreviated AOR) is an American FM radio format focusing on album tracks by rock artists. AOR evolved from progressive rock radio in the mid-1970s, using research and formal programming to create an album rock format with greater commercial appeal. - Radio waves are a type of electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths in the electromagnetic spectrum longer than infrared light. Radio waves have frequencies as high as 300 GHz to as low as 3 kHz, though some definitions describe waves above 1 or 3 GHz as microwaves, or include waves of any lower frequency. At 300 GHz, the corresponding wavelength is , and at 3 kHz is . Like all other electromagnetic waves, they travel at the speed of light. Naturally occurring radio waves are generated by lightning, or by astronomical objects. - A census is the procedure of systematically acquiring and recording information about the members of a given population. It is a regularly occurring and official count of a particular population. The term is used mostly in connection with national population and housing censuses; other common censuses include agriculture, business, and traffic censuses. The United Nations defines the essential features of population and housing censuses as \\"individual enumeration, universality within a defined territory, simultaneity and defined periodicity\\", and recommends that population censuses be taken at least every 10 years. United Nations recommendations also cover census topics to be collected, official definitions, classifications and other useful information to co-ordinate international practice. - A radio format or programming format (not to be confused with broadcast programming) describes the overall content broadcast on a radio station. Radio formats are frequently employed as a marketing tool, and are subject to frequent change. Music radio, old time radio, all-news radio, sports radio, talk radio and weather radio describe the operation of different genres of radio format and each format can often be sub-divided into many specialty formats. - Public broadcasting includes radio, television and other electronic media outlets whose primary mission is public service. In much of the world, funding comes from the government, especially via annual fees charged on receivers. In the United States, public broadcasters may receive some funding from both federal and state sources, but generally most financial support comes from underwriting by foundations and businesses ranging from small shops to corporations, along with audience contributions via pledge drives. The great majority are operated as private not-for-profit corporations. - The radio spectrum is the part of the electromagnetic spectrum from 3 Hz to 3000 GHz (3 THz). Electromagnetic waves in this frequency range, called radio waves, are extremely widely used in modern technology, particularly in telecommunication. To prevent interference between different users, the generation and transmission of radio waves is strictly regulated by national laws, coordinated by an international body, the International Telecommunication Union (ITU). - A fee is the price one pays as remuneration for rights or services. Fees usually allow for overhead, wages, costs, and markup. - The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is an independent agency of the United States government, created by Congressional statute (see and ) to regulate interstate communications by radio, television, wire, satellite, and cable in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and U.S. territories. The FCC works towards six goals in the areas of broadband, competition, the spectrum, the media, public safety and homeland security, and modernizing itself. - A radio station is a set of equipment necessary to carry on communication via radio waves. Generally, it is a receiver or transmitter, an antenna, and some smaller additional equipment necessary to operate them. Radio stations play a vital role in communication technology as they are heavily relied on to transfer data and information across the world. - A broadcast license is a type of spectrum license granting the licensee permission to use a portion of the radio frequency spectrum in a given geographical area for broadcasting purposes. The licenses generally include restrictions, which vary from band to band. - Pine Ridge (Lakota: \\"wazíbló\\") is a census-designated place (CDP) and the most populous community in Oglala Lakota County, South Dakota, United States.

It is the tribal headquarters of the Oglala Sioux Tribe on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation. - A census-designated place (CDP) is a concentration of population defined by the United States Census Bureau for statistical purposes only. CDPs have been used in each decennial census since 1980 as the counterparts of incorporated places, such as cities, towns, and villages for the purposes of gathering and correlating statistical data. CDPs are populated areas that generally include one officially designated but currently unincorporated small community, for which the CDP is named, plus surrounding inhabited countryside of varying dimensions and, occasionally, other, smaller unincorporated communities as well. CDPs include small rural communities, colonias located along the U.S. border with Mexico, and unincorporated resort and retirement communities and their environs. - Hard rock is a loosely defined subgenre of rock music that began in the mid-1960s, with the garage, psychedelic and blues rock movements. It is typified by a heavy use of aggressive vocals, distorted electric guitars, bass guitar, drums, and often accompanied with pianos and keyboards. - The term non-commercial educational (NCE) applies to a radio station or TV station that does not accept on-air advertisements (TV ads or radio ads), as defined in the United States by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). NCE stations do not pay broadcast license fees for their non-profit uses of the radio spectrum.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the last name of the person who was occupied intermittently from the mid 1920s until around 1938? Jean Sibelius's Symphony No. 8 was his final major compositional project, occupying him intermittently from the mid-1920s until around 1938, though he never published it. During this time Sibelius was at the peak of his fame, a national figure in his native Finland and a composer of international stature. A fair copy of at least the first movement was made, but how much of the Eighth Symphony was completed is unknown. Sibelius repeatedly refused to release it for performance, though he continued to assert that he was working on it even after he had, according to later reports from his family, burned the score and associated material, probably in 1945. Much of Sibelius's reputation, during his lifetime and subsequently, derived from his work as a symphonist. His Seventh Symphony of 1924 has been widely recognised as a landmark in the development of symphonic form, and at the time there was no reason to suppose that the flow of innovative orchestral works would not continue. However, after the symphonic poem Tapiola, completed in 1926, his output was confined to relatively minor pieces and revisions to earlier works. During the 1930s the Eighth Symphony's premiere was promised to Serge Koussevitzky and the Boston Symphony Orchestra on several occasions, but as each scheduled date approached Sibelius demurred, claiming that the work was not ready for performance. Similar promises made to the British conductor Basil Cameron and to the Finnish Georg Schnéevoigt likewise proved illusory. It is thought that Sibelius's perfectionism and exalted reputation prevented him ever completing the symphony to his satisfaction; he wanted it to be even better than his Seventh. After Sibelius's death in 1957, news of the Eighth Symphony's destruction was made public, and it was assumed that the work had disappeared forever. But in the 1990s, when the composer's many notebooks and sketches were being catalogued, scholars first raised the possibility that fragments of the music for the lost symphony might have survived.

UPDATED:. 09:34 EST, 9 October 2013. Three people convicted of murder in fatal crashes urged New York's highest court to throw out their convictions on Tuesday, arguing they were too intoxicated to know the threat they posed to others. The murder convictions of Martin Heidgen, Taliyah Taylor and Franklin McPherson all hinge on the prosecution's contention they acted with 'depraved indifference to human life' in the deadly incidents. All three crashes share a number of common threads: driving too fast in the wrong lane while under the influence. Jailed: Martin Heidgen in court in 2006 reacts after the jury found him guilty of two counts of murder in a DUI crash. Lawyers for Heidgen and two other drivers are trying to overturn the convictions, claiming their clients were 'too intoxicated' to know what they were doing. Defense attorneys argued prosecutors failed to prove their clients acted with depraved indifference and, in fact, their clients were too impaired to know what they were doing. Heidgen's attorney, Jillian Harrington, said her client had gotten lost when he drove his pickup the wrong way on Long Island's Meadowbrook State Parkway in 2005. He hit a limousine, killing the driver, Stanley Rabinowitz, and 7-year-old passenger Katie Flynn and injuring five others. 'We have no proof he realized he was going in the wrong direction,' Harrington told the Court of Appeals. Fatal: Taliyah Taylor was naked when she sped 80 mph down Staten Island's Forest Avenue in 2006 without headlights, ran a red light and killed pedestrian Larry Simon. Heidgen had a blood alcohol content of 0.28 percent, police said. Now 32, he's serving 19 years to life in prison. 'This is a question of fact for the jury,' Nassau County Assistant District Attorney Maureen McCormick countered. McCormick urged the court to uphold the juries' conclusions in the cases of Heidgen and McPherson, who was involved in a 2007 crash on Long Island's Southern State Parkway. McPherson hit another vehicle, killing driver Leslie Burgess. His BAC was 0.19 percent. Now 26, he's serving 25 years to life in prison. 'I'm saying they wanted to go where they wanted to go, and other people be damned,' McCormick said. Since there's always substantial traffic in Nassau County, there's 'no possibility' the drivers didn't know the threat, she said. Evidence: A Lincoln stretch limousine, left, and a Chevy Silverado pickup truck are put on display outside the Nassau County Courthouse where Martin Heidgen was convicted for murder in the drunken driving accident that killed two people. McPherson's attorney, Jonathan Edelstein, said evidence showed his client didn't attempt to brake before the crash, so unless prosecutors were to argue he was suicidal - which they didn't - 'that would have to mean he was oblivious.' 'Nobody who's not oblivious will plow head-on into another vehicle at 60 miles per hour,' Edelstein said. Taylor was naked when she sped 80 mph down Staten Island's Forest Avenue in 2006 without headlights, ran a red light and killed pedestrian Larry Simon. She had taken Ecstasy, smoked marijuana and drank beer. Defense attorney Erica Horwitz said her client made a number of irrational statements after the crash. 'She was driving naked because God wanted her to drive naked,' Horwitz said. Staten Island Assistant District Attorney Anne Grady argued that Taylor had made conscious choices despite her impairment, and showed no remorse later when the intoxication wore off. Cuffed: All three crashes share a number of common threads: driving too fast in the wrong lane while under the influence. The drivers were arrested and convicted for murder on DUI charges (as seen in this file photo) Now 31, Taylor was sentenced to 22 years to life. All three drivers were also convicted of lesser charges ranging from reckless endangerment to vehicular manslaughter that were not contested in the appeals. A mid-level court upheld all three murder convictions. The Court of Appeals rulings are expected next month.","completion":"1.

(CNN) -- Former House Majority Leader Eric Cantor's new gig on Wall Street will line his pockets, to the tune of more than 1 million per year. And for those who played an instrumental role in his defeat in Virginia's primaries, the justification of their concerns about the former congressman is quite fulfilling. Kevin Broughton, communications director of the Tea Party Patriots Citizens Fund, said, \\"many analysts accused Eric Cantor of paying more attention to Wall Street than to the people of Virginia's 7th District. He certainly didn't waste any time validating that theory.\\" Cantor, who was the No. 2 Republican in the House, lost his primary this year to unknown college professor David Brat. Part of the reason was voters thought he was disconnected from his Richmond, Virginia, district by focusing instead on his duties as a fundraiser and national leader for the Republican Party. He left Congress early, resigning his seat last month. Since 1999, the seven-term congressman had raised more than 3 million from the investment industry. And in his last campaign, the industry was his largest contributor, donating 785,000, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. For disaffected conservatives, especially among the tea party, which came to life early in the Obama administration and took on a populist message, Cantor's move to a boutique investment bank, Moelis & Co., as a vice chairman and board member is proof that their concerns were spot on. In a statement, Cantor said, \\"When I considered options for the next chapter of my career, I knew I wanted to join a firm with a great entrepreneurial spirit that focused on its clients.\\" 1.

Answer the question...who is the best rapper of the year??","completion":"Determining the best rapper of the year is subjective, as musical taste and appreciation vary from person to person. However, based on various factors such as album sales, chart performance, critical reception, and cultural influence, we can identify some of the most notable rappers in the past year. Before proceeding, it's important to note that the year isn't specified in the question, so I'll present a general analysis for rappers that have had recent success. In recent years, some standout rappers have captured the attention of both critics and audiences: 1. Kendrick Lamar: Kendrick has released several critically acclaimed albums, such as \\"To Pimp a Butterfly,\\" \\"Good Kid, M.A.A.D City,\\" and \\"DAMN.\\" He consistently delivers thought-provoking and impactful lyrics, along with intricate storytelling and unique production. Kendrick's commercial success and widespread recognition, including numerous Grammy Awards, have further solidified him as one of the top rappers in recent years. 2. J. Cole: J. Cole has maintained a dedicated fan base, achieved commercial success, and garnered praise for his lyricism, storytelling, and ability to address social and economic issues through his music. Albums like \\"2014 Forest Hills Drive,\\" \\"KOD,\\" and \\"The Off-Season\\" are examples of J. Cole's lasting influence on the rap scene. 3. Drake: Drake has enjoyed commercial success and widespread popularity over the past decade, with hit singles and albums dominating the music charts. His versatility in blending hip-hop, R&B, and pop elements has contributed to his immense fan base. While some critics argue that Drake's music may not always be as thought-provoking or poignant as other artists on this list, his undeniable influence on popular music cannot be overlooked. 4. Cardi B: Cardi B has emerged as one of the most successful female rappers in recent years. After releasing her debut album, \\"Invasion of Privacy,\\" she has consistently delivered successful singles, breaking several records in the process. Additionally, Cardi B's candid and unapologetic personality has garnered her a devoted following. 5. Travis Scott: Travis Scott has achieved both commercial and critical success, bridging the gap between hip-hop and mainstream music with his unique sound and stellar production skills. His album \\"Astroworld\\" gained immense praise and showcased his talent as a multifaceted artist. 6. Megan Thee Stallion: Megan has been on the rise in recent years, with her catchy singles and impressive performances catching the eye of both audiences and critics. She won several awards, including the Grammy Award for Best New Artist, and released her debut album, \\"Good News,\\" to widespread acclaim. These are just a few examples of rappers who have excelled in recent years, but it's crucial to remember that \\"the best rapper\\" is a matter of personal preference. Factors including lyrical ability, flow, storytelling, charisma, and social impact may all contribute to an individual's opinion on who deserves the title. Music is art, and art is subjective—so, ultimately, the \\"best rapper of the year\\" will depend on one's unique taste and interpretation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It is situated between the Firth of Tay and the Firth of Forth, with inland boundaries to Perth and Kinross and Clackmannanshire. By custom it is widely held to have been one of the major Pictish kingdoms, known as \\"Fib\\", and is still commonly known as the Kingdom of Fife within Scotland. - Lochaber is an area in the west of the Scottish Highlands. Historically it referred to the area between Loch Linnhe and Loch Leven, around the town of Fort William. It is now also used to refer to a much wider area, one of the 16 ward management areas of the Highland Council of Scotland and one of eight former local government districts of the two-tier Highland region. - Grampian Television (now legally known as STV North Ltd and referred to on-air as STV) is the ITV franchisee for the North and North East of Scotland. Its coverage area includes the Northern Isles, the Western Isles, the Highlands (except Fort William and Lochaber, which have always received Scottish Television), Grampian, Tayside (except the Kinross area), and parts of north Fife. The station has been in operation since 30 September 1961. - Kinross (Gaelic: \\"Ceann Rois\\") is a burgh in Perth and Kinross, Scotland. It was originally the county town of Kinross-shire. The site of the original parish church and churchyard are located down a small wynd overlooking Loch Leven, a little away from the town. Kinross was originally linked by railway to Perthshire, Fife and Clackmannanshire until the rail links gradually disappeared. At one time three independent railway companies had their termini at the town. The Fife and Kinross Railway came from the east, the Kinross-shire Railway came from the south and The Devon Valley Railway came from the west. Recently Kinross has expanded considerably, especially since the construction of the M90 motorway - the main north-south artery which bypasses the town. Many people working within a commuting radius of Kinross have settled in the town owing to its convenient central location and excellent local amenities.

The climate is cool and temperate and much influenced by the surrounding seas. There are two main island groups: Shetland and Orkney. There are a total of 26 inhabited islands with landscapes of the fertile agricultural islands of Orkney contrasting with the more rugged Shetland islands to the north, where the economy is more dependent on fishing and the oil wealth of the surrounding seas. Both have a developing renewable energy industry. They also share a common Pictish and Norse history. Both island groups were absorbed into the Kingdom of Scotland in the 15th century and remained part of the country following the formation of the Kingdom of Great Britain in 1707, and later the United Kingdom after 1801.

Yes, I admit I'm in many respects not as good as other people, but I don't think I'm always not good. When I find what I've done or written is okay, I'll remain pleased with myself for quite a few days, and in case I receive praise for it, I'll even become so excited as to add a few words to glorify myself. True, I'm not modest at all. People may call me conceited . But I think otherwise. I also appreciate other people. I appreciate anything good. Isn't it unfair to forget appreciating myself while appreciating others? We Chinese generally tend to be modest, and we take pride in being so. For example, a Chinese will call his own wife zhuojing, meaning \\"my humble wife\\", and his own writings zhuozuo, meaning \\"my poor writings\\". But if you should call his wife a \\"rustic woman\\" or his writings \\"trash\\", he would, I'm sure, slap the table in a rage and declare he would make a clean break with you. As a matter of fact, there is probably no difference at all between what is said by him and you respectively. I don't think it's wrong for you to freely praise yourself if you're really worthy of praise. As we know, there is an old Chinese saying disparaging a melon peddler , named Lao Wang, who keeps praising his own goods. Well, why can't he praise his melons if they are really sweet and juicy? Friends, Lao Wang sells melons for a living. How could he carry on business if he, by imitating the affectations of us intellectuals, were to show false modesty about his melons? He would sure enough die of starvation. Self-appreciation is therefore key to professional dedication and enjoyment of work. One will lose confidence in continuing with writing when he pauses to admire his own essays. Needless to say, the same is true of those who make a living with their pen.

Answer the following question: Information: - Philip II, known as Philip Augustus (21 August 1165 14 July 1223), was King of France from 1180 to 1223, a member of the House of Capet. Philip's predecessors had been known as kings of the Franks, but from 1190 onward, Philip became the first French monarch to style himself king of France. The son of King Louis VII and his third wife, Adèle of Champagne, he was originally nicknamed \\"Dieudonné\\" \\"God-given\\" because he was the first son of Louis VII, born late in his father's life. Philip was given the nickname \\"Augustus\\" by the chronicler Rigord for having extended the Crown lands of France so remarkably. - The House of Capet or the Direct Capetians, also called the House of France (\\"la maison de France\\"), or simply the Capets, ruled the Kingdom of France from 987 to 1328. It was the most senior line of the Capetian dynasty itself a derivative dynasty from the Robertians. Historians in the 19th century came to apply the name \\"Capetian\\" to both the ruling house of France and to the wider-spread male-line descendants of Hugh Capet. It was not a contemporary practice (see House of France). They were sometimes called \\"the third race of kings\\", the Merovingians being the first, and the Carolingians being the second. The name is derived from the nickname of Hugh, the first Capetian King, who was known as \\"Hugh Capet\\". The direct succession of French kings, father to son, from 987 to 1316, of thirteen generations in almost 330 years, was unparallelled in recorded history. - Louis VIII the Lion ( 5 September 1187 -- 8 November 1226 ) was a King of France from the House of Capet who reigned from 1223 to 1226 . He also claimed the title King of England from 1216 to 1217 . Louis VIII was born in Paris , the son of King Philip II of France and Isabelle of Hainaut , from whom he inherited the County of Artois . While Louis VIII only briefly reigned as king of France , he was an active leader in his years as crown prince . During the First Barons ' War of 1215 - 17 against King John of England , his military prowess earned him the epithet the Lion . After his victory at the Battle of Roche - au - Moine in 1214 , he invaded southern England and was proclaimed \`\` King of England '' by rebellious barons in London on the 2 June 1216 . He was never crowned , however , and renounced his claim after being excommunicated and repelled . In 1217 , Louis started the conquest of Guyenne , leaving only a small region around Bordeaux to Henry III of England . Louis 's short reign was marked by an intervention using royal forces into the Albigensian Crusade in southern France that decisively moved the conflict towards a conclusion .

Please answer the following question: I know that the answer to the question \\"What does the Case for Colorblind Justice recommend with respect to affirmative action?\\" is in \\"Terry Eastland, the author who wrote From Ending Affirmative Action: The Case for Colorblind Justice states, \\"Most arguments for affirmative action fall into two categories: remedying past discrimination and promoting diversity\\". Eastland believes that the founders of affirmative action did not anticipate how the benefits of affirmative action would go to those who did not need it, mostly middle class minorities. Additionally, she argues that affirmative action carries with it a stigma that can create feelings of self-doubt and entitlement in minorities. Eastland believes that affirmative action is a great risk that only sometimes pays off, and that without it we would be able to compete more freely with one another. Libertarian economist Thomas Sowell identified what he says are negative results of affirmative action in his book, Affirmative Action Around the World: An Empirical Study. Sowell writes that affirmative action policies encourage non-preferred groups to designate themselves as members of preferred groups [i.e., primary beneficiaries of affirmative action] to take advantage of group preference policies; that they tend to benefit primarily the most fortunate among the preferred group (e.g., upper and middle class blacks), often to the detriment of the least fortunate among the non-preferred groups (e.g., poor white or Asian); that they reduce the incentives of both the preferred and non-preferred to perform at their best – the former because doing so is unnecessary and the latter because it can prove futile – thereby resulting in net losses for society as a whole; and that they engender animosity toward preferred groups as well.:115–147\\". Can you tell me what it is? Answer:","completion":"In the book \\"From Ending Affirmative Action: The Case for Colorblind Justice\\", author Terry Eastland conveys her concerns regarding affirmative action. She argues that affirmative action often benefits those who do not require such aid, primarily the middle-class minorities, contrary to the founders' intentions. Eastland also points out the often-overlooked negative impacts of affirmative action, such as its potential to create feelings of self-doubt and entitlement in minorities. In her view, this infringes upon the ability of minorities to compete on equal grounds and can sometimes instill a destructive stigma on recipients. She describes affirmative action itself as a great risk that only sometimes pays off and without it, people would be able to compete more freely. In concurrence, economist Thomas Sowell sheds light on several negative outcomes of affirmative action in his book \\"Affirmative Action Around the World: An Empirical Study\\". He says this policy encourages non-preferred groups to label themselves as members of preferred, benefited groups. He also notes it often unjustly benefits the most fortunate in the preferred group (like upper and middle-class blacks), usually to the disadvantage of the less fortunate non-preferred groups (like poor white or Asian individuals). Sowell discusses how these policies can lead to reduced incentives for both preferred and non-preferred groups, as it may seem unnecessary for the former and futile for the latter, which ultimately results in overall societal losses. Lastly, he points out that affirmative action can breed resentment toward the preferred groups. In essence, both authors propose a more measured, possibly colorblind, approach to justice, highlighting the sometimes unintended and adverse consequences of affirmative action. They encourage re-evaluation and reform of these policies for a more equitably competitive society."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Write a text based on this summary: russian court jails three alleged members of banned extremist group Text:","completion":"Title: Russian Court Sentences Three Alleged Members of Banned Extremist Group to Prison In a recent development, a Russian court has handed down prison sentences to three alleged members of a banned extremist organization. The court's decision aims to showcase the nation's commitment to combating the rise of extremism and ensuring the safety of its citizens. The names of the individuals sentenced and the specifics of their involvement in the extremist group remain undisclosed in order to protect ongoing investigations. The extremist group in question, which has been officially banned by the Russian government, is believed to have been actively participating in the planning and execution of violent activities, including but not limited to, terrorist attacks. The Russian Federation has faced mounting challenges due to the growth of extremist ideologies within its borders and has pledged to take strict measures to address the situation. The three alleged members were arrested following a wide-ranging investigation conducted by Russian law enforcement agencies. Intelligence gathered over the duration of the investigation was crucial in identifying the suspects and their connection to the extremist group. Throughout the course of the investigation and trial, the accused maintained their innocence, claiming to have no affiliation with any extremist organization. However, the evidence against the suspects proved to be overwhelming, leaving the Russian court with no option but to impose lengthy prison sentences. The sentences ranged from 8 to 15 years, and the court also ordered the confiscation of the defendants' properties as part of the measures related to the conviction. The court's decision to sentence the individuals should send a strong message to the broader extremist community, warning them that the Russian government will not tolerate any attempts to undermine national security and public safety. The recent convictions are part of the Russian Federation's ongoing efforts to eradicate any form of violent extremism, as it seeks to maintain social harmony and promote cooperation among its diverse communities. The conviction of these three alleged members of the banned extremist group also serves to remind the international community of the importance of a collective approach to fighting radicalization and terror. As extremist groups and their activities pose a threat to global peace and stability, it is crucial that nations come together in order to ensure effective coordination and sharing of intelligence to thwart such groups' plans. Furthermore, the arrest and sentences of the individuals involved highlight the necessity of adequate resources for security forces and law enforcement agencies to ensure their effectiveness in combating terrorism and extremist ideology. The Russian Federation's actions in this instance should serve as an example for other countries facing similar threats from extremist groups. In light of the recent sentencing, the Russian government will likely continue its efforts to strengthen the nation's security measures and crack down on extremist groups. By doing so, it aims to create a safe and secure environment for its citizens and contribute to the global fight against terrorism and radical ideologies. In conclusion, the sentencing of the three alleged members of the banned extremist group by the Russian court marks a significant step in the nation's ongoing effort to address the growing threat of extremism and terrorism. While it is a positive development, it also serves as a reminder of the ongoing challenges faced by countries around the world in their fight against radical ideologies and the need for continued cooperation and collaboration among nations to ensure global security and harmony."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. FDA: Antibacterial soaps not 'healthier' than regular soap Antibacterial soaps and body washes containing the chemical triclosan don’t have extra health benefits compared with regular soap and water, the Food and Drug Administration said today on its Web site. In light of animal studies raising questions about triclosan’s safety — the chemical may affect hormone regulation -- the FDA has been reviewing its widespread use. Triclosan, a commonly used pesticide, also has been added to toothpaste, computer keyboards, clothing, shopping bags and hundreds of other consumer products. There’s also some concern that triclosan contributes to bacteria’s increasing resistance to antibiotics, the FDA said. The Environmental Protection Agency, meanwhile, is updating its own assessment of triclosan and has said it plans to work with the FDA to “better characterize the endocrine-related effects” of the compound. In some cases, triclosan provides a benefit, the FDA said. The data on Colgate Total toothpaste, for example, shows it effectively prevents gingivitis. But for other products, the FDA says it doesn’t have proof of an extra health benefit. The Soap and Detergent Association (SDA), which \\"expressed concern\\" with the FDA's consumer update, maintains that products with triclosan are essential, especially for those in hospitals, prisons, child care centers and preschools. It also says there’s no evidence that the products lead to antibiotic resistance and that, contrary to the FDA’s view, they are more effective than non-anti-bacterial soap. The FDA plans to release its findings in the spring of 2011.Until then, it says consumers concerned about triclosan’s effect on human health and the environment should simply wash with regular soap and water. That’s not as easy as it sounds. Triclosan and a related compound, triclocarban, are found in up to 76 percent of liquid soaps and 26 percent of bar soap according to a 2001 study in the American Journal of Infection Control. The percentages are likely higher today, but the SDA didn't have current research estimates. The chemicals are also added to products that could be cleaned with regular soap and water instead. The grocery store chain Schnucks’, for example, recently announced it will carry reusable “germ-protected” grocery bags made with a Microban antimicrobial lining containing triclosan. “Microban prevents odors and stains from developing and allows the bags to be reused for longer periods of time,” according to a press release. “Triclosan is a ubiquitous environmental pollutant,” said Rolf Halden, associate professor at the Center for Environmental Biotechnology at Arizona State University, one of the first researchers to show that triclosan and triclocarban persist in U.S. waterways. (Since then, the chemical has turned up in dolphins.) “Plastic bags already degrade very slowly in the environment, and the addition of triclosan will further increase their environmental persistence,” he said. Some products, such as Zytrel XP, a “multi-hour antimicrobial hand sanitizer,” are now being marketed as “triclosan-free.” But Zytrel contains benzalkonium chloride, “another compound that does not degrade well in the environment,” said Halden. “It shares the property of environmental persistence with triclosan and triclocarban. Halden’s advice? “Wash hands frequently and thoroughly, and do so with regular hand soap containing no antimicrobial additives.” (Graphic courtesy of the FDA) What was this article about?","completion":"This article is about how the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) says that antibacterial soaps with a chemical called triclosan are not healthier or better than regular soaps. There are concerns about the safety of triclosan because it may affect hormones and also might help bacteria become resistant to antibiotics. Some products with triclosan do have benefits, like preventing gum disease in toothpaste, but for other products, there is no proof of extra health benefits. The FDA suggests that people who are worried about triclosan should just use regular soap and water. However, triclosan is found in many soaps and different products today.

Here is an article: By Jon Swartz, USA TODAY Microsoft's pursuit of Yahoo is far from finished. Two weeks after withdrawing a 47.5 billion offer to buy the Internet icon, Microsoft (MSFT) said Sunday that it and Yahoo are discussing a transaction but not an acquisition of all of Yahoo (YHOO). Microsoft did not provide any details. Yahoo issued a statement late Sunday saying it was considering a \\"number of value-maximizing strategic alternatives\\" and would evaluate any Microsoft proposal. Despite its earlier insistence that its pursuit of Yahoo was finished, Microsoft's statement Sunday also left open the possibility of a full acquisition. \\"Microsoft is not proposing to make a new bid to acquire all of Yahoo at this time, but reserves the right to reconsider that alternative, depending on future developments and discussions that may take place\\" with Yahoo, its shareholders or with other third parties, Microsoft said. Yahoo and Microsoft reinitiated talks after billionaire investor Carl Icahn last week launched a plan to boot Yahoo's 10-member board of directors for \\"irresponsible\\" and \\"unconscionable\\" acts that prompted Microsoft to drop its 33-a-share bid to buy Yahoo. Microsoft's last offer was worth 2 a share more than its initial bid, but Yahoo had demanded 37 a share. Yahoo shares closed Friday at 27.66, down 1, or 3%, from where they were when Microsoft withdrew its offer. According to a source close to Microsoft, the renewed talks would involve a partnership of some kind. The source asked not to be named because Microsoft has not authorized others to speak publicly on its behalf. The most likely scenario, industry analysts say, would be an advertising accord in place of a similar arrangement that Yahoo and Google are now discussing. The Yahoo-Google talks have struck a sour note with some Yahoo followers because a deal with Google — dominant in the online advertising market — would face antitrust hurdles and would put Yahoo at a financial disadvantage, says Jonathan Yarmis, an analyst at AMR Research. \\"Yahoo needs to placate everyone out to shoot them because they jilted Microsoft, and there will be blood in the streets if Yahoo pursues a deal with Google,\\" Yarmis says. \\"A deal with Microsoft — even a partnership — would provide Yahoo with a graceful exit from Google,\\" he says. The Microsoft source said the software giant had not talked to Icahn since he began his bid to replace the board. Icahn's office did not return phone calls Sunday. Last week, several prominent Yahoo investors let their displeasure be known following Yahoo's persistent refusal to accept Microsoft's overtures, which were first announced on Feb. 1. Paulson & Co., a 30 billion hedge fund that has quickly amassed 50 million shares of Yahoo, said it hopes Yahoo and Microsoft work out a deal in lieu of Icahn's threat to lead a proxy fight to replace Yahoo's board with his own slate of directors at Yahoo's July 3 shareholders meeting. Ryan Jacob, a longtime Yahoo shareholder, said Icahn's bid was a positive move to bring shareholder value to Yahoo, which has struggled to compete with Google for online revenue. He supported a new board \\"amenable\\" to doing a deal with Microsoft. You share in the USA TODAY community, so please keep your comments smart and civil.

Read this article and answer this question Hoping to add to a six-game winning streak, the Broncos returned home for an interconference duel with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. The Broncos grabbed the early lead, when defensive tackle Mitch Unrein, lining up as a fullback, caught a 1-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Peyton Manning. The Buccaneers responded, with a 31-yard field goal by placekicker Connor Barth, then grabbed the lead at the end of the first quarter, with quarterback Josh Freeman connecting on an 11-yard touchdown pass to tight end Dallas Clark. After a scoreless second quarter, the Broncos re-claimed the lead for good with 21 unanswered points, consisting of two Manning touchdown passes to wide receiver Demaryius Thomas&#8212;from 8 and 10 yards, followed by linebacker Von Miller returning an interception off Freeman 26 yards for a touchdown. After a Manning interception late in the third quarter, a 50-yard field goal by Barth to begin the fourth quarter narrowed the gap to 28-13, but the Broncos countered with a 31-yard field goal by placekicker Matt Prater. With 4:37 remaining in the game, the Buccaneers tried to rally, with a 55-yard field goal by Barth, followed by a 5-yard touchdown pass from Freeman to wide receiver Mike Williams with 2:39 remaining. However, the Buccaneers' onside kick attempt was unsuccessful, and the Broncos subsequently ran out the clock. With the win, the Broncos exceeded their win total from 2011, and also clinched their second consecutive AFC West division title.

Frédéric François Chopin, also known as Fryderyk Franciszek Chopin, was a prominent composer and virtuoso pianist during the Romantic era. Born to a French father and Polish mother, he held dual citizenship in both countries. Chopin's musical career spanned a relatively short period, but his contributions to the world of classical music were immense. He is well-known for his unique piano compositions that pushed the boundaries of the instrument, showcasing his expertise and virtuosity as both a composer and performer. Chopin's focus was primarily on composing for solo piano, and his works encompass a wide range of genres, including études, preludes, nocturnes, sonatas, mazurkas, waltzes, and ballades, among others. His compositions were innovative, often characterized by expressive melodies, intricate harmonies, and striking emotions. They required great skill to be played, which is why Chopin's pieces remain challenging for pianists to this day. One of the reasons Chopin concentrated on composing for the piano was his deep connection with the instrument. He began learning piano at an early age, and his extraordinary talent quickly propelled him to the forefront of musical prodigies in Europe. With his vast knowledge and deep understanding of the capabilities and expressive qualities of the piano, Chopin was able to create complex and exquisite compositions that showcased the full potential of the instrument, bringing it to the center stage of classical music during the Romantic era. In conclusion, Frédéric François Chopin, a Polish and French composer, primarily composed music for the solo piano, with his pieces demonstrating his immense talent and virtuosity as both a composer and pianist. His remarkable and innovative works continue to captivate audiences and challenge pianists, guaranteeing his lasting legacy in the history of classical music."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Californian almond orchards require 1.5m beehives every year for pollination. They account for 80% of the world's almond crop. But farmers have seen the price of beehive hire triple in the last decade. The declining honey bee population is likely to push prices even higher. Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"Title: The Crumbling Cornerstone of Confectionery: Almond Crisis and its Impact on the Beekeeping Industry Introduction: Almonds, the tiny but essential ingredient found in the confectionery industry all around the globe, now face a crisis fueled by the declining honey bee population. As the cornerstone of many sweet treats and revered for their remarkable health benefits, almonds rely heavily on bees for pollination. Eighty percent of the world's almond crop comes from Californian almond orchards, which require an astounding 1.5 million beehives every year for pollination. However, as the honey bee population declines, the price for renting beehives has tripled over the past decade, squeezing farmers and threatening to push almond prices higher. The Importance of Almonds: Almonds are not only a beloved staple on their own, but are also used in a wide range of food products such as chocolate fillings, energy bars, and various pastries. These culinary gems not only enhance the flavor of confections but also boast various health benefits. Rich in protein, fiber, and healthy fats, they are an essential ingredient for maintaining a balanced and nutritious diet. The Honey Bee-Driven Almond Crisis: The intricate connection between almonds, bees, and beekeepers is often overlooked. Filbert farmers cannot solely rely on the wind for pollination, and honey bees play a critical role in ensuring successful almond production. In California, the world's largest almond producer, the beekeeping industry thrives, thanks in part to the ever-growing demand for almonds. However, this mutualistic relationship between almond growers and honey bees is facing an unprecedented threat. Declining Honey Bee Population: In recent years, the honey bee population has been experiencing an alarming decline. Beekeepers are losing bees at an astonishing rate due to various factors such as Colony Collapse Disorder, exposure to pesticides, disease, and climate change. This rapid decline in bee population has led to an increased demand for beehives, resulting in the skyrocketing cost of beehive rentals for almond farmers. As the prices triple over the last decade, the financial pressure on almond farmers continues to mount. With fewer bees available, the likelihood of securing essential pollination services decreases, meaning almond farmers could face lower crop yields. Economic Impact: The rising rental costs for beehives do not just affect farmers; they also have a significant impact on the global confectionery industry. The surging prices for almonds, with fewer nuts available, may translate into giddy costs for confections that rely on almonds, potentially affecting those businesses' profitability and causing a knock-on effect for the consumer. Furthermore, other industries dependent on almonds, such as the health and wellness sector or the burgeoning plant-based milk market, could face similar repercussions, causing economic ripples throughout the broader food system. What Can Be Done: To protect the future of almonds and the confectionery industry, long-term solutions need to be implemented in preserving honey bee populations. Researchers are actively investigating and implementing sustainable practices, including reducing pesticide use, promoting crop diversity, and encouraging the growth of flowering plants to provide continuous food sources for bees. Additionally, raising public awareness about the importance of bees and their role in our food system is vital in garnering support from communities and policymakers alike. Conclusion: As the almond crisis deepens, it highlights the importance of honey bees within our global food system. By understanding and addressing the challenges that bees and almond farmers face, we can begin to ensure a more sustainable future for almonds and the confectionery industry that relies on them. Without prompt action, this horrifying downfall in bee population stands not only to cripple the almond-based confections but also to disrupt the delicate balance of the global food ecosystem."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Options: A. full of people B. safety C. lie D. secure E. being safe The answer is:","completion":"D. secure This is based on a context of military or law enforcement operations where \\"securing a building\\" implies checking and ensuring it's free from potential threats so it can be used as a safe spot or base. Two important elements in this type of situation are security and secrecy. In the scenario given, \\"The soldiers were on the run and in danger, they entered a building to hold up but first they had to make sure it was...\\" their main goal is to identify a safe territory where they can remain protected from any potential threats. If they are in a war environment, the threat could be enemy combatants. If they are law enforcement, it could be criminals. Therefore, before settling in, they need to confirm that the building is 'secure'. In military parlance, a 'secure' building would be the one that has been cleared of hostiles, has no immediate threats, and strategically advantageous or at least not disadvantageous. Option A. full of people, is not correct as a crowded building can complicate matters. It could include enemy combatants or innocent civilians who could get caught in crossfire. In a typical secure operation, the soldiers evacuate all unnecessary people. Option B. safety, is grammatically incorrect and vague as it isn't clear what aspect of safety it refers to. Option C. lie, is not relevant to the military/security context of the situation. Soldiers do not generally seek buildings that \\"lie\\". This could be a plausible answer for a more abstract or figurative context, but not in the clearly literal and practical situation like this. Option D. secure, as explained above, is the most in line with common sense, given the mentioned scenario. Option E. being safe, though close, is not the precise or most common terminology in this type of operation. A building being 'safe' can mean lack of structural damage or a secure location but it is not typically used in this scenario. Also, it lacks the action of the soldiers making it safe, implying it was safe to begin with which would be an assumption they can't afford.

Answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What type of behavior are humpback whales known to display? ? Whales are known to teach, learn, cooperate, scheme, and grieve. The neocortex of many species of whale is home to elongated spindle neurons that, prior to 2007, were known only in hominids. In humans, these cells are involved in social conduct, emotions, judgement, and theory of mind. Whale spindle neurons are found in areas of the brain that are homologous to where they are found in humans, suggesting that they perform a similar function. Brain size was previously considered a major indicator of the intelligence of an animal. Since most of the brain is used for maintaining bodily functions, greater ratios of brain to body mass may increase the amount of brain mass available for more complex cognitive tasks. Allometric analysis indicates that mammalian brain size scales at approximately the ⅔ or ¾ exponent of the body mass. Comparison of a particular animal's brain size with the expected brain size based on such allometric analysis provides an encephalisation quotient that can be used as another indication of animal intelligence. Sperm whales have the largest brain mass of any animal on earth, averaging 8,000 cubic centimetres (490 in3) and 7.8 kilograms (17 lb) in mature males, in comparison to the average human brain which averages 1,450 cubic centimetres (88 in3) in mature males. The brain to body mass ratio in some odontocetes, such as belugas and narwhals, is second only to humans.Small whales are known to engage in complex play behaviour, which includes such things as producing stable underwater toroidal air-core vortex rings or \\"bubble rings\\". There are two main methods of bubble ring production: rapid puffing of a burst of air into the water and allowing it to rise to the surface, forming a ring, or swimming repeatedly in a circle and then stopping to inject air into the helical vortex currents thus formed. They also appear to enjoy biting the vortex-rings, so that they burst into many separate bubbles and then rise quickly to the surface. Some believe this is a means of communication. Whales are...

If you're like most people, you eat it. Maybe you follow the \\"5-second rule\\", which claims foods are safe to eat if you pick them up within 5 seconds after dropping them. But you might want to think again. Scientists now say that 5 seconds is all it takes for foods to become polluted with enough bacteria to make you sick. Bacteria can cause many kinds of illnesses. Some kinds of bacteria can grow on food. If you eat foods on which these bacteria are growing, you can become sick. One of these food-borne bacteria is Salmonella. It makes 1.4 million people sick every year. Salmonella is often found in raw eggs and chicken. Cooking kills these bacteria, which is why it is so important to cook eggs, chicken, and other foods thoroughly. But how long does it take these bacteria to pollute food?

B. positive.","completion":"The sentiment of this tweet can be classified as A. Negative. The sentiment behind a statement, review, tweet, or any form of user-generated content refers to the attitude, emotions or opinions that are conveyed within the content. In the context of this tweet, the user expresses a feeling of frustration and dissatisfaction which are typically associated with a negative sentiment. Exploring the tweet more deeply, we can see two main statements fueling this negative sentiment. Firstly, the user explicitly states they are \\"very frustrated,\\" which is a clear description of a negative emotional state. Frustration often emerges when expectations are not met or when an individual undergoes challenges without clear solutions. Secondly, the phrase \\"there's nothing to do today\\" also contributes to this negative sentiment. This sentence implies a sense of boredom or dissatisfaction with the current situation. When people have nothing to do or are bored, they often feel unproductive or unfulfilled, which again, are negative emotions. No positive emotions or statements are apparent in the tweet to balance or negate the clearly expressed negative feelings. There are no words indicating joy, satisfaction, or any form of positive sentiment. They are requesting help which suggests they are unable to find a solution or way to alleviate their current negative state independently, which further solidifies the classification as a negative sentiment. Therefore, based on the analysis of the specific words used and the overall tone of the tweet, we can conclude that the sentiment conveyed in the message is negative, not positive."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He told BBC Sport: \\"Things have turned full circle and I'm just delighted and grateful to be on the tour.\\" The South Africa-born right-hander also said he would prefer to bat at number three in the four-Test series. England play a three-day game against South Africa A in Pietermaritzburg starting on Sunday, their final warm-up match before the first Test in Durban begins on 26 December. Middlesex's Compton, the grandson of England legend Denis, scored 208 runs in eight Test innings in India on his debut tour in 2012, before making two centuries in New Zealand in March 2013. Having managed only 16, 15, one and seven in the return series two months later, he was discarded for the 2013 Ashes against Australia, which England won 3-0. Compton, who once likened being dropped to being dumped by a girlfriend, added: \\"There were times when I doubted that I would get selected again. \\"But I've kept persevering and just being as professional as I can with my counties. \\"I'm a couple of years on and got that experience and ability.

But unmarried couples shouldn't expect to find greater happiness through child-raising.The study, published in the Oct.14 online edition of the Journal of Happiness Studies, suggests that having children has little or no effect on boosting happiness among couples who aren't hitched . The findings contradict previous research that suggested that having more offspring doesn't lead to greater happiness and might even make people less satisfied with their lives.One theory behind the conclusion is that parents don't receive many rewards in return for the hard work of raising children.

News article: Mildred Loving, Who Battled Ban on Mixed-Race Marriage, Dies at 68 The certificate was from Washington, D.C., and under Virginia law, a marriage between people of different races performed outside Virginia was as invalid as one done in Virginia. At the time, it was one of 24 states that barred marriages between races. After Mr. Loving spent a night in jail and his wife several more, the couple pleaded guilty to violating the Virginia law, the Racial Integrity Act. Under a plea bargain, their one-year prison sentences were suspended on the condition that they leave Virginia and not return together or at the same time for 25 years. Judge Leon M. Bazile, in language Chief Justice Warren would recall, said that if God had meant for whites and blacks to mix, he would have not placed them on different continents. Judge Bazile reminded the defendants that “as long as you live you will be known as a felon.” They paid court fees of 36.29 each, moved to Washington and had three children. They returned home occasionally, never together. But times were tough financially, and the Lovings missed family, friends and their easy country lifestyle in the rolling Virginia hills. By 1963, Mrs. Loving could stand the ostracism no longer. Inspired by the civil rights movement and its march on Washington, she wrote Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy and asked for help. He wrote her back, and referred her to the American Civil Liberties Union. The A.C.L.U. took the case. Its lawyers, Bernard S. Cohen and Philip J. Hirschkop, faced an immediate problem: the Lovings had pleaded guilty and had no right to appeal. So they asked Judge Bazile to set aside his original verdict. When he refused, they appealed. The Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals upheld the lower court, and the case went to the United States Supreme Court. Mr. Cohen recounted telling Mr. Loving about various legal theories applying to the case. Mr. Loving replied, “Mr. Cohen, tell the court I love my wife, and it is just unfair that I can’t live with her in Virginia.” Mildred Delores Jeter’s family had lived in Caroline County, Va., for generations, as had the family of Richard Perry Loving. The area was known for friendly relations between races, even though marriages were forbidden. Many people were visibly of mixed race, with Ebony magazine reporting in 1967 that black “youngsters easily passed for white in neighboring towns.” Mildred’s mother was part Rappahannock Indian, and her father was part Cherokee. She preferred to think of herself as Indian rather than black. Mildred and Richard began spending time together when he was a rugged-looking 17 and she was a skinny 11-year-old known as Bean. He attended an all-white high school for a year, and she reached 11th grade at an all-black school. When Mildred became pregnant at 18, they decided to do what was elsewhere deemed the right thing and get married. They both said their initial motive was not to challenge Virginia law. “We have thought about other people,” Mr. Loving said in an interview with Life magazine in 1966, “but we are not doing it just because somebody had to do it and we wanted to be the ones. We are doing it for us.” In his classic study of segregation, “An American Dilemma,” Gunnar Myrdal wrote that “the whole system of segregation and discrimination is designed to prevent eventual inbreeding of the races.” But miscegenation laws struck deeper than other segregation acts, and the theory behind them leads to chaos in other facets of law. This is because they make any affected marriage void from its inception. Thus, all children are illegitimate; spouses have no inheritance rights; and heirs cannot receive death benefits. “When any society says that I cannot marry a certain person, that society has cut off a segment of my freedom,” the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. said in 1958. Virginia’s law had been on the books since 1662, adopted a year after Maryland enacted the first such statute. At one time or another, 38 states had miscegenation laws. State and federal courts consistently upheld the prohibitions, until 1948, when the California Supreme Court overturned California’s law. Though the Supreme Court’s 1967 decision in the Loving case struck down miscegenation laws, Southern states were sometimes slow to change their constitutions; Alabama became the last state to do so, in 2000. Mr. Loving died in a car accident in 1975, and the Lovings’ son Donald died in 2000. In addition to her daughter, Peggy Fortune, who lives in Milford, Va., Mrs. Loving is survived by her son, Sidney, of Tappahannock, Va.; eight grandchildren; and 11 great-grandchildren. Mrs. Loving stopped giving interviews, but last year issued a statement on the 40th anniversary of the announcement of the Supreme Court ruling, urging that gay men and lesbians be allowed to marry. An earlier version misstated the number of states in which interracial marriage was illegal in 1958, the year Richard and Mildred Loving married. It was 24 — not 16, which was the number of states in which interracial marriage was illegal in 1967, the year the Supreme Court ruled on their case.

This article: Lawrence Morton, in a study of the origins of The Rite, records that in 1907–08 Stravinsky set to music two poems from Sergey Gorodetsky's collection Yar. Another poem in the anthology, which Stravinsky did not set but is likely to have read, is \\"Yarila\\" which, Morton observes, contains many of the basic elements from which The Rite of Spring developed, including pagan rites, sage elders, and the propitiatory sacrifice of a young maiden: \\"The likeness is too close to be coincidental\\". Stravinsky himself gave contradictory accounts of the genesis of The Rite. In a 1920 article he stressed that the musical ideas had come first, that the pagan setting had been suggested by the music rather than the other way round. However, in his 1936 autobiography he described the origin of the work thus: \\"One day [in 1910], when I was finishing the last pages of L'Oiseau de Feu in St Petersburg, I had a fleeting vision ... I saw in my imagination a solemn pagan rite: sage elders, seated in a circle, watching a young girl dance herself to death. They were sacrificing her to propitiate the god of Spring. Such was the theme of the Sacre du Printemps\\".By May 1910 Stravinsky was discussing his idea with Nicholas Roerich, the foremost Russian expert on folk art and ancient rituals. Roerich had a reputation as an artist and mystic, and had provided the stage designs for Diaghilev's 1909 production of the Polovtsian Dances. The pair quickly agreed on a working title, \\"The Great Sacrifice\\" (Russian: Velikaia zhertva); Diaghilev gave his blessing to the work, although the collaboration was put on hold for a year while Stravinsky was occupied with his second major commission for Diaghilev, the ballet Petrushka.In July 1911 Stravinsky visited Talashkino, near Smolensk, where Roerich was staying with the Princess Maria Tenisheva, a noted patron of the arts and a sponsor of Diaghilev's magazine World of Art. Here, over several days, Stravinsky and Roerich finalised the structure of the ballet. Thomas F.

It has three carbon (C) atoms, eight hydrogen (H) atoms, and three oxygen (O) atoms. In order to determine the Lewis dot structure for glycerol, you would follow these steps: 1. Calculate the total number of valence electrons. Each carbon atom has 4 valence electrons, each hydrogen atom has 1 valence electron, and each oxygen atom has 6 valence electrons. Therefore, the total number of valence electrons for glycerol is (3x4) + (8x1) + (3x6) = 12 + 8 + 18 = 38 valence electrons. 2. Arrange the atoms to form a skeleton structure. Place the three carbon atoms in the center in a straight line, and connect them with single bonds. Attach the three oxygen atoms to the line of the carbon atoms, one oxygen for each carbon. Finally, add the hydrogen atoms around the carbon and oxygen atoms. 3. Distribute the valence electrons as both bonding electrons (shared in bonds) and non-bonding electrons (lone pairs). Following the octet rule, make sure that each atom has a stable electron configuration. Each carbon atom should have four bonds, each oxygen atom should have two bonds and two lone pairs, and each hydrogen atom should have one bond. 4. If needed, adjust multiple bonds to achieve full octets for the central atoms. In the case of glycerol, the octet rule is satisfied without the need for multiple bonds. By following these procedures, you can draw the correct Lewis dot structure for glycerol. The second question, on the other hand, asks for the Lewis dot structure of carbon disulfide (CS2). Carbon disulfide has a chemical formula of CS2, with one carbon (C) atom and two sulfur (S) atoms. To determine the Lewis dot structure for carbon disulfide, follow these steps: 1. Calculate the total number of valence electrons. The carbon atom has 4 valence electrons and each sulfur atom has 6 valence electrons. Thus, the total number of valence electrons for carbon disulfide is 4 + (2x6) = 4 + 12 = 16 valence electrons. 2. Arrange the atoms to form a skeleton structure. Place the carbon atom in the center and the two sulfur atoms on either side. Connect the carbon atom to each sulfur atom with single bonds. 3. Distribute the valence electrons as both bonding electrons and non-bonding electrons, following the octet rule. Each sulfur atom should have two bonds and two lone pairs, and the carbon atom should have four bonds. 4. Adjust multiple bonds, if necessary, to achieve full octets for the central atoms. In this case, changing the single bonds between carbon and sulfur atoms to double bonds will satisfy the octet rule for both carbon and sulfur atoms. By following these steps, you can determine the Lewis dot structure for carbon disulfide. As you can see, the two questions ask about entirely different chemical compounds and require separate processes to find their respective Lewis dot structures. Therefore, the answer is *no, the questions are not the same."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

It is set in 91 BCE, when Lucius Licinius Crassus dies, just before the Social War and the civil war between Marius and Sulla, during which Marcus Antonius Orator, the other great orator of this dialogue, dies. During this year, the author faces a difficult political situation: after his return from exile in Dyrrachium (modern Albania), his house was destroyed by the gangs of Clodius in a time when violence was common. This was intertwined with the street politics of Rome. - Lucius Licinius Crassus ( 140 BC -- 91 BC ) was a Roman consul . He was considered the greatest Roman orator of his day , by his pupil Cicero . He became consul in 95 BC. During his consulship a law was passed ( the lex Licinia Mucia ) requiring all but citizens to leave Rome , an edict which provoked the Social War . In 92 BC he was elected censor with Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus . Licinius Crassus was married to Mucia Tertia , younger daughter of the Consul Quintus Mucius Scaevola Augur by his wife Laelia , daughter of Gaius Laelius Sapiens . They had two surviving children : Licinia Crassa Prima or Major married to the Praetor of 93 BC , Publius Cornelius Scipio Nasica , the son of Publius Cornelius Scipio Nasica Serapio and descendant of Scipio Africanus and Scipio Nasica , and by whom she had issue Licinia Crassa Secunda or Minor , who married Quintus Caecilius Metellus Pius , eventually Pontifex Maximus who adopted Licinia Crassa Major 's son , who then became known as Metellus Scipio . According to both Plutarch and Cicero , a Licinia , daughter of this man , was married to Gaius Marius the Younger . The marriage may have taken place around 95 BC , though the date is pure supposition by scholars , based on the known political alliance between the two fathers ( Crassus and Gaius Marius ) , the fact that men could not marry before they turned 14 , but that leading families tended to marry early to cement alliances . Nothing is known of Licinia after Marius the Younger 's death in 82 BC , although in the time of Caesar Amatius , a Pseudo-Marius , appeared in Rome claiming to be their son - Cicero seems to have accepted the possibility that he might indeed be a Marius , though he tried not to involve himself in a politically difficult situation . He is also noted by Cicero in De Oratore that Licinius Crassus was a friend of Marcus Vigellius . - Marcus Tullius Cicero ( \\"Kikern\\"; 3 January 106 BC 7 December 43 BC) was a Roman philosopher, politician, lawyer, orator, political theorist, consul, and constitutionalist. He came from a wealthy municipal family of the Roman equestrian order, and is considered one of Rome's greatest orators and prose stylists. - Lucius Cornelius Sulla Felix (c. 138 BC 78 BC), known commonly as Sulla, was a Roman general and statesman. He had the distinction of holding the office of consul twice, as well as reviving the dictatorship. Sulla was awarded a grass crown, the most prestigious Roman military honor, during the Social War. Sulla was a skillful general, achieving numerous successes in wars against different opponents, both foreign and Roman. His life was habitually included in the ancient biographical collections of leading generals and politicians, originating in the biographical compendium of famous Romans published by Marcus Terentius Varro. In Plutarch's \\"Parallel Lives\\" Sulla is paired with the Spartan general and strategist Lysander. Given the information, choose the subject and object entities that have the relation of 'date of death'.

If the question isn't answerable, please output \\"Can't answer\\". Question: Where is Burgh_lzli hospital located? Title: A Dangerous Method Movie plot: Sabina Spielrein (Keira Knightley) arrives at the Burghölzli, the pre-eminent psychiatric hospital in Zurich, Switzerland with a typical case of hysteria and begins a new course of treatment with the young Swiss doctor, Carl Jung (Michael Fassbender). He is using word association and dream interpretation as part of his approach to Sigmund Freud's (Viggo Mortensen) radical new science of psychoanalysis, and finds that Sabina Spielrein's condition was triggered by the humiliation and sexual arousal she felt as a child due to her short-tempered father's habit of spanking her naked. These conflicting feelings were compounded by her instinctive knowledge (imparted by an angel's voice that speaks in German) that she had done nothing to deserve such a punishment and in fact that she may have been a stand-in for her mother in her father's abuse (since her mother was unfaithful). Also, her affluent Russian Jewish family afforded her an exceptional education in preparation for university study, although not on the subject of sex, and she was a virgin.Her intelligence and energy were immediately recognized and encouraged by Jung and Eugen Bleule (André Hennicker), the head of the hospital, and since she plans to study medicine they allow her to assist them in their experiments, including measuring the physical reactions of subjects during word association, to provide empirical data as a scientific basis for psychoanalysis and ameliorate the more sensational aspects of Freud's theories, which contend that all mental illness is rooted in childhood sexual experience, be it real or fantasy. She soon learns that much of this new science is founded on the doctors' observations of themselves, each other, and their families, not just their patients. The doctors correspond at length before they meet, and begin sharing their dreams and analysing each other, and Freud adopts Jung as his heir and agent.Jung finds in Sabina a kindred spirit with a unique perspective as her self-awareness sharpens, and their attraction deepens in...

Given the question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Australian cities can keep their native wildlife -- but only if they can kick their habit of urban sprawl . That's the finding of a new study by leading Australian environmental researchers Jessica Sushinsky, Professor Hugh Possingham and Dr Richard Fuller of The University of Queensland. \\"While urban development usually reduces the number of birds in a city, building more compact cities and avoiding urban sprawl can slow these reductions greatly,\\" says lead author Jessica Sushinsky. \\"Compact housing development leaves birds' homes untouched, leading to fewer losses of birds.\\" The researchers surveyed native and wild birds in Brisbane's urban areas, including living and industrial areas, public parks and gardens, major roadways and airports. They then used statistical modeling to find out what will happen to the birds as the city grows. The first setting was compact growth -- where multiple homes are built on land that previously had only one house. The second setting was sprawling growth -- a familiar pattern where homes are built here and there beyond the city's current boundaries. The team's forecasts showed that a much greater diversity of species was lost over 20 years in the sprawling setting compared to the more compact setting. \\"Urban sprawl resulted in the disappearance of many urban-sensitive birds -- birds that only live in areas where there is native vegetation , such as parklands and woodlands,\\" Ms Sushinsky says. \\"On the other hand, we found the city with the compact development attracted more birds because it kept more of its parks and green areas.\\" Now the Queensland Government has adopted the more compact urban growth strategy, which, Dr Richard Fuller says, is good news for Australia's native birds. These birds are environmental specialists -- they need a particular environment to do well. \\"While compact development means smaller backyards, it can also make our entire cities more biodiverse,\\" according to Dr Fuller. \\"The study shows that we should hold on to our green spaces instead of...

Photograph: J. Scott Applewhite/AP The finance chairman of the Republican national committee, Ray Washburne, travelled to Chicago last Wednesday to solicit money from two big funders who had reached their donation limit for this election cycle. While he was on the plane, the supreme court ruled that there would no longer be any limits. Washburne told the New York Times that when he landed and heard the news, he said: \\"Eureka\\". He came back with promises of more cash. It's the American Way. Just as the constitution ostensibly requires that AK47s be available on demand, it was also apparently designed to open the sluicegates to money in politics, until the entire landscape is flooded with cash and cynicism and the border between what is unethical and what is legal is washed away. It's what the funding fathers intended. There are lots of areas of American society that could do with more money: preschools, infrastructure, mental health clinics, homeless shelters. The one place it's not needed is in politics. Even in this most polarised of moments, this is one of the few things on which most Americans agree. Indeed, support for limits on campaign donations is high among all income and education levels, party allegiances and political philosophies, and has remained consistent over the last five years. During that time, the supreme court has systematically removed many of the restrictions that did exist. In 2008 spending on the presidential election almost doubled compared with 2004. In 2012 it almost quadrupled compared with 2008. \\"Every presidential election is the most expensive ever. Elections don't get cheaper,\\" the federal election chairwoman, Ellen Weintraub, told Politico. Last week's ruling was not as transformative as the case of Citizens United in 2010. Then, the supreme court determined that, since corporations had the same rights as people, they had the right to unfettered free speech under the first amendment and so should be able to spend as much money as they wanted on political campaigns. Last Wednesday's decision, building on Citizens United, argued that since money has been equated with speech, rich individuals should not be muzzled in their ability to speak cash to power. Previously, there was a limit of 123,200 that any individual could donate to candidates or parties in a two-year election cycle. There was also a limit on how much a person could give to each particular candidate. The cap on donations to a single candidate still stands. But now you can give to as many candidates as you like and up to 3.6m in an election cycle. They could buy up the whole of Congress if they wanted to. Relatively few people have both the desire and the ability to do that. Fewer than 600 donors gave the maximum in 2012. But raw numbers are deceptive. The rich, already powerful, punch way above their weight. In 2010 just 0.01% of Americans accounted for a quarter of all the money given to politicians, parties and political action committees. If anything this makes the loosening of donation rules more damning, not less. For at a time of escalating economic inequality and declining social mobility, the pool of politicians' paymasters will shrink even further. In a system where money is considered speech, and corporations are people, this trend is inevitable. Elections become not a system of participatory engagement determining how the country is run, but the best democratic charade that money can buy. People get a vote; but only once money has decided whom they can vote for and what the agenda should be. The result is a plutocracy that operates according to the golden rule: that those who have the gold make the rules. In his book Affluence and Influence: Economic Inequality and Political Power in America, Princeton professor Martin Gilens illustrates how the political class does the bidding of the rich. \\"Across multiple presidential administrations and a wide range of political conditions, two patterns remain constant,\\" he writes. \\"First, the poor never have as much influence as the middle class, and the middle class never has as much influence as the affluent. Second, over the last four decades, responsiveness to the affluent has steadily increased, while responsiveness to the middle class and the poor has depended entirely on the existence of [specific] circumstances.\\" This should come as no surprise. Rich people don't come by their wealth by giving it away for nothing. And these are not charitable donations. When they give cash to politicians they expect something in return. And they get it. Money buys access and access permits influence. At times this is blatant. Roughly 30% of diplomatic posts in Barack Obama's administration have gone to friends and donors. A study by Pennsylvania State University professors last year established an approximate price for ambassadorships. Ambassador to Portugal would set you back 341,160 in bundled contributions; Luxembourg 1.8m; while Britain could cost you anything up to 2.3m. In a recent segment called Diplomat Buyers Club, comedian Jon Stewart showed Obama's picks for the ambassadors of Argentina, Iceland and Norway (all donors), testifying that they have never been to the countries they sought jobs for. But it's also about who doesn't get to speak. Candidates are likely to hear less on the campaign trail about how the war on drugs is blighting black and Latino neighbourhoods, or how poverty is reducing the life expectancy of poor white women, because those people don't get a seat at the table. Either way, when chief supreme court justice John Roberts quotes the Citizen's United ruling, claiming \\"ingratiation and access … are not corruption\\", he is clearly working from a narrow and disingenuous definition of corruption. Last year, three members of the House of Representatives pleaded guilty to, or were convicted of, crimes – the highest number since 1981 – while the former mayors of Detroit and New Orleans, among others, were convicted of, or charged with, felonies. Earlier this year the former Virginia governor, Bob McDonnell, was indicted for accepting loans and gifts in return for favours. Just two weeks ago the mayor of Charlotte, North Carolina, resigned over a bribery scandal. Neither has been convicted of any offence. Corruption is already a major problem in American politics. The highest court in the land has just made it both more likely, and more legal.

Write highlights for this article: Consider the biggest stories in recent weeks: Three women in Cleveland end a decade's captivity. A Texas fertilizer plant explosion kills 15 people. A monster tornado strikes an Oklahoma suburb. A British soldier is savagely slain on a London street. Need an update on these important events? Welcome to CNN Reset, a new feature revisiting news that's been unforgettable. Here's the latest on video and online. Oklahoma twister. Science calls it an EF5. The people of Moore, Oklahoma, know it as the most powerful category of tornadoes. The twister's destruction was merciless: it struck the Plaza Towers Elementary School, killing seven children there. In all, 24 people perished, including 10 children. The human response to the catastrophe has been powerful too. Locals call it the \\"Oklahoma standard\\" -- \\"persistence and a great positive attitude by the people to never give in,\\" as University of Oklahoma football coach Bob Stoops puts it. Cleveland captivity. It was a horror worthy of Stephen King's imagination: three young women allegedly held captive in a house for roughly 10 years beginning at ages 21, 16 and 14. They were allegedly abducted off the street in a Cleveland neighborhood by the homeowner, Ariel Castro, 52, who's now facing four counts of kidnapping and three counts of rape. Alleged violence and threats made the captive women afraid to seek an escape. But one of the women -- the one who bore a child by Castro -- finally shouted for help after Castro left the house and forgot to lock a big inside door. Neighbors responded. The women and a 6-year-old girl were freed. Now tourists visit the neighborhood. And as the city seeks donations to support the women, it struggles with a dark legacy. Texas explosion. The explosion of a fertilizer plant shook the Earth like an earthquake. In fact, the blast in West, Texas, registered a 2.1 on the Richter scale, and people felt it 50 miles away. The first responders experienced a scene for which no training could ever prepare them: a mushroom-cloud fireball lay waste to 37 blocks, including a nursing home, the local high and middle school, and many houses. Fifteen people -- including 12 first responders -- were killed. Volunteer firefighter Robert Payne was blown out of his boots and knocked senseless. He woke up in intensive care wondering what happened. Now recovering from several injuries, he's thankful he's alive. As the town of 2,800 rebuilds, will it want the fertilizer plant back? The mayor doubts it. Boston Marathon bombings. Among those injured in the Boston Marathon bombings were two brothers. Paul and JP Norden have shared much in life. Now they are together in recovery: Each brother lost a right leg in the attack. As hard as the limb loss was for the brothers, equally difficult was not seeing other each for weeks as they underwent 12 surgeries in all. The siblings finally saw each other about two weeks ago for the first time since the marathon. They want the public to know their uncommon brotherhood is lifting them through an arduous recuperation. London slaying. The British soldier was well-liked by many. He was even a military recruiter and played the drum outside the Royal Palaces on behalf of his regiment, the Fusiliers. But the life of Drummer Lee Rigby, 25, came to a grisly end on a London street at the hands of a man with a meat cleaver and knife. What has shocked the world is how the alleged attacker -- Michael Adebolajo, 28, a British national of Nigerian descent -- made a video of the gory scene and spoke to the camera about the killing, saying it was \\"an eye for an eye\\" and \\"because Muslims are dying daily.\\" A total of five men have been arrested in the slaying. Now far-right activists are calling upon Muslims to leave the country. Capital calamities. The second term of President Barack Obama was supposed to be about immigration reform, gun control and the economy. Instead, it's seemingly been one scandal after another. The Justice Department secretly collected two months of telephone records from the Associated Press. Questions resurfaced about whether the administration downplayed the role of terrorism in the attack against the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya. And the IRS allegedly targeted politically conservative groups. The president says he's angry about it, too.

Why do internal combustion vehicle engines require transmission gears to optimize power output but electrical vehicle motors (i.e. cars, locomotives) don't? Why don't we use spherical tires for vehicles? Choose your answer. Are these two questions paraphrases of each other? (a). no; (b). yes;","completion":"(a). no First question: Think of an internal combustion engine like a bike. When you pedal, the bike has different gears to help you go faster or uphill easier. In a car, the engine uses transmission gears to control power and speed just like the gears on a bike. But electric cars are different, they are like a magic bike that can always go at any speed and uphill without needing gears, so it's more simple. Second question: Spherical tires would be like trying to roll a big ball instead of a wheel. A wheel is round and flat, so it rolls very smoothly and easily on the ground, helping the vehicle move with less effort. A ball can roll in any direction, making it harder to control and less stable. So, we use wheel-shaped tires because they are better at making vehicles go in the direction we want."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Movie title: Walking Tall: Final Chapter Movie plot: One year has passed since the ambush that killed his wife, and Buford still has difficulty dealing with it. At his wife's grave, he breaks down, telling her he regrets ignoring her request to not become sheriff. Buford visits the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation to find why Sam Norris is not in jail. They tell him they have no case against Witter. Pinky Dobson is paralyzed, and his girlfriend retracted her statement implicating Witter. Buford's friend, attorney Lloyd Tatum, tells Buford to be patient and let the TBI do their job. In New York City, Witter tells his boss that he will finally settle with Buford conclusively. The boss tells Witter he should accept that Pusser beat him and let it be at that. Because of Witter's mistakes, he is forced to cede 25% of his territory. While Buford and Grady stake out a still run by O. Q. Teal and his brother Udell, Buford witnesses O. Q. beat his son Robby. Buford intervenes and beats O. Q. in the same manner. After blowing up the still, he takes Robby to an orphanage. At his office, Buford finds a message from Luan Paxton, a prostitute who helped Buford defeat the state line gang. When he meets her at her hotel, he is surprised when she tells him she now works in real estate. At home, Buford's father, Carl, tells him that he has incurred too many expenses as sheriff, and Buford says he will ask for a raise after re-election. Carl asks if he really wants to remain sheriff, and Buford says it is the only thing he knows how to do. The next morning, O. Q.'s lawyer, French, demands he drop the charges against O. Q. to avoid police brutality charges; Buford refuses. Sheriff Clegg of Hardin County requests Buford investigate a new club, the 3 Deuces, in unincorporated land. As Buford reluctantly agrees, three boys steal his car and go on a joyride. After Buford and Clegg catch them, Buford handcuffs them and forces them to clean the courthouse lawn. French objects, but Buford says the alternative would be much worse. A witness phones Witter, who realizes he can use this to... Answer:","completion":"In \\"Walking Tall: Final Chapter,\\" Buford Pusser's death occurs off-screen and is not explicitly depicted in the film. At the end of the film, Pusser is seen leaving his home at night, responding to a late-night call. As he departs, the screen fades to black, and text appears, informing the audience of his tragic fate. On August 12, 1974, Buford Pusser died in an automobile accident after his car veered off the road and crashed into a tree. The circumstances surrounding the accident were mysterious and raised suspicions of foul play. Some speculated that his enemies, whom he made during his time as sheriff, orchestrated the accident as an act of vengeance. However, there is no definitive proof to support these claims, and the cause of the accident remains a topic of speculation and controversy. Buford Pusser's death serves as a dramatic and unexpected resolution to the events of the film, emphasizing the dangerous and violent world he inhabited as he pursued his quest for justice. It is a poignant reminder of the risks and sacrifices individuals like Pusser make when fighting against crime and corruption. When deciding whether to invest in this film proposal, it is essential to consider factors such as the story's appeal, the script's quality, the cast, the potential director, and the targeted audience demographic. The \\"Walking Tall\\" series has already found success in its previous installments, highlighting the public's interest in the story of a courageous sheriff who takes on corruption in the face of adversity.

Article: Three students from the International Correctional Management Training Center in Cañon City are reportedly missing, a news release said Sunday morning. According to its website, the International Correctional Management Training Center is a division of the Colorado Department of Corrections, \\"(that) has begun operation of a residential corrections training center to provide training to corrections officials from foreign countries.\\" On Sunday, Mark Fairbairn, the public information officer for CDOC said in an email that three of the programs' students failed to appear Saturday night at a designated pick up point in Colorado Springs after a sponsored trip. \\"The three students are part of a group from Afghanistan that are correctional staff who are authorized to be in the United States for training,\\" Fairbairn said in an email. The names and ages of the three students were not provided and where the students were before their designated pick up is known. However, Fairbairn stated, the U.S. State Department, \\"conducts background checks and thoroughly vet all of the students that attend the training center.\\" He said the students were in the U.S. on temporary visas, and the primary concern for the DOC is the safety of the missing students, \\"as would the case with any guest in our country.\\" No other information regarding this incident or the students is available at this time. Advertisement Sarah Matott: 719-276-7648, matottS@canoncitydailyrecord.com ||||| Three Afghan prison officials who traveled to Colorado on temporary training visas disappeared Saturday from a teaching program run by state prison tactical experts. It was the third time in four years that Afghanistan prison officials have fled from the same prison training program. “The Department of Corrections’ primary concern is the safety of the missing participants as would be the case with any guest in our country,” according to a news release by Mark Fairbairn, spokesman for DOC. The three unnamed Afghan prison officials failed to show up at a designated pickup point at 7 p.m. Saturday following a sponsored trip by the International Correctional Management Training Center on state prison grounds in Cañon City. Fairbairn said the men do not pose a terrorist or security threat. U.S. State Department authorities performed background checks on the three missing officials and other Afghan prison officials before allowing them to attend the training, Fairbairn said. Although 36 nations from around the world have now sent prison officials to the Cañon City for tactical and strategic training, only Afghan officials have ever fled. Previously, two high-ranking Afghan prison officials who came to Colorado to receive correctional tactical training disappeared. One was caught trying to sneak into Canada, but the other remains at large. One man walked away from the training center in September 2013 and the other did the same thing in February 2014. A state prisons document said both were to have constant supervision from an escort, but both men managed to sneak away while they claimed to be going out to smoke. State and federal officials have not released the names of any of the missing men, citing concerns for their safety and the safety of their families in Afghanistan. Prisons officials have notified the State Department and local law enforcement authorities. Colorado’s response was much different from one taken by Massachusetts authorities under a similar situation in September 2013, when three Afghan soldiers went missing during an excursion to the Cape Cod Mall during a “cultural exercise.” Police publicly released pictures and names of the men — Maj. Jan Mohammad Arash, Capt. Mohammad Nasir Askarzada and Capt. Noorullah Aminyar — and Massachusetts law enforcement officers investigated their disappearances as a missing persons case. The soldiers were caught trying to enter Canada illegally near Niagara Falls. The soldiers had traveled to Massachusetts for a U.S. Army-sponsored training exercise for foreign soldiers, which is intended to strengthen ties between nations. |||||Summary:","completion":"Three students from a training center in Cañon City have been reported missing.

John Hickenlooper offered an awkward apology and some colorful language to some of his fiercest rivals on the issue of gun control: Colorado’s sheriffs. The governor’s mea culpa came Friday when he spoke before an assembled group of sheriffs from around Colorado. The governor apologized to the sheriffs for not meeting with them prior to the passage of gun control bills they opposed. Hickenlooper also said his administration didn’t do a good job anticipating pushback on gun control, and he pledged better communication in the future. Pressed on the issue by Larimer County Sheriff Justin Smith, Hickenlooper reacted with exasperation. “What the f—?” Hickenlooper said. “I apologized!” On his Facebook page, Smith said he was taken aback by such language in that setting. “I’m a big boy and I won’t pretend for a moment that it’s not language that’s foreign to me — but I found that type of attitude and response to be well below the dignity of the office of governor,” Smith wrote. “This was a sitting governor, in a public meeting, responding to another elected official.” Hickenlooper spokesman Eric Brown said the governor intended the profanity to be taken in jest. “He meant no disrespect to Sheriff Smith or anyone else in the room,” Brown said. Some Colorado sheriffs are suing to overturn the gun control laws Hickenlooper signed last year, saying they violate the Constitution.","completion":"Title: \\"Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper Apologizes and Drops F-Bomb Over Gun Control Dispute with State Sheriffs\\" Article: In a surprising turn of events, Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper faced Colorado's sheriffs, some of his most vocal opponents on the issue of gun control, in an awkward exchange with colorful language. The governor's unexpected apology came during a meeting with assembled sheriffs from across the state on Friday. Governor Hickenlooper apologized to the sheriffs for not consulting with them prior to the passage of gun control bills they staunchly opposed. He admitted that his administration failed to anticipate the pushback on gun control legislation and promised to improve communication with the sheriffs in the future. However, it was when Larimer County Sheriff Justin Smith pressed Hickenlooper on the issue that the situation took an unexpected turn. The governor, reacting with exasperation, blurted out, \\"What the f---? I apologized!\\" This in response to Sheriff Smith's remarks, which left those in attendance taken aback by the governor's choice of words in a formal setting. Sheriff Smith later said in a post on his Facebook page that while he was no stranger to such language, the governor's response was below the dignity of the office, particularly during a public meeting between elected officials. Hickenlooper's spokesman Eric Brown later explained that the governor's use of profanity was meant to be taken in jest, stating that Governor Hickenlooper meant no disrespect to Sheriff Smith or anyone else present at the meeting. It should be noted that some Colorado sheriffs, including Sheriff Smith, are currently involved in a lawsuit seeking to overturn the gun control laws that Governor Hickenlooper signed last year, arguing that they are unconstitutional. The apology, coupled with the unexpected use of profanity, only add to the complexities of the already tense relationship between the state's top elected official and its law enforcement leaders on the issue of gun control."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Why does Emily set fire to the house? If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Case 39 Context: Social worker Emily Jenkins (Renée Zellweger) is assigned to investigate the family of ten year-old Lilith Sullivan (Jodelle Ferland), as her grades have declined and an emotional rift with her parents has emerged. Emily suspects that the parents have been mistreating Lilith, and proposes to her department to take the child away from her parents' custody. Emily's fears are confirmed when Lilith's parents try to kill her by roasting her in the oven at their home. Emily saves Lilith with the help of Detective Mike Barron (Ian McShane). Lilith is originally sent to a children's home, but she begs Emily to look after her instead. With the agreement of the board, Emily is assigned to take care of Lilith until a suitable foster family comes along. In the meantime, Lilith's parents, Edward and Margaret (Callum Keith Rennie and Kerry O'Malley), are placed in a mental institution.Not too long after Lilith moves in, strange things begin to happen around Emily. Two weeks later, another of Emily's cases, a boy named Diego (Alexander Conti), suddenly murders his parents, and Barron informs Emily that somebody phoned Diego from her house the night before the crime. As she is suspected of involvement in the incident, Lilith undergoes a psychiatric evaluation by Emily's best friend, Douglas J. Ames (Bradley Cooper). During the session, however, Lilith turns the evaluation around, asking Douglas what his fears are and subtly threatening him. That night while studying he receives a strange phone call in his apartment, Douglas is panicked by the sight of a mass of hornets coming out of his body and kills himself in his bathroom by snapping his own neck.Emily gradually becomes fearful of having Lilith in her home, so she heads to the mental asylum for answers from Lilith's parents. They tell her that Lilith is a demon who feeds on feelings, and that they tried to kill her in an attempt to save themselves. Lilith's father tells Emily that the only way to kill Lilith is to get her to sleep.

Does it follow that \\"The recent budgetary failures led Lott to side with Helms.\\"?","completion":"Yes, it appears that the recent budgetary failures influenced Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, a Republican from Mississippi, to side with Jesse Helms, who was a Republican from North Carolina and a leading conservative figure in the Senate. In order to provide a detailed and long answer, let's break down the situation and the context surrounding Lott's decision to side with Helms. 1. Budgetary failures: The term \\"budgetary failures\\" could refer to a specific instance or a series of instances where the budget process in Congress did not yield the desired results. Budgetary discussions involve multiple stakeholders, including lawmakers from both parties, and affect various government programs and policies. Failures in these discussions can create fiscal problems, lead to a government shutdown, or have other detrimental effects on a nation's stability and growth. 2. Trent Lott: Trent Lott was a prominent Republican politician from Mississippi who served in both the House of Representatives (1973–1989) and the Senate (1989–2007). He was elected as the Senate Majority Leader twice, first between 1996 and 2001 and then again between 2003 and 2007. As the Majority Leader, Lott was responsible for setting the Senate's agenda and coordinating legislative activities. 3. Jesse Helms: Jesse Helms was a conservative Republican senator from North Carolina who served in the Senate from 1973 to 2003. Helms was a staunch conservative known for his opposition to communism, liberalism, and civil rights legislation. He was also the chairman of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations from 1995 to 2001, where he often took hardline positions on issues related to national defense and foreign policy. 4. Lott siding with Helms: By siding with Helms, Lott may have believed this alliance would provide a more influential and robust conservative front in the Senate, thus furthering the policy objectives they both shared. The budgetary failures may have served as a catalyst for Lott's decision, potentially highlighting the need for a stronger conservative coalition to drive budget reforms and avoid future setbacks. 5. Implications: Lott's decision to side with Helms might have had a significant impact on the direction of the Senate during their tenure. Aligning with a conservative figure like Helms signals a more aggressive stance on budget negotiations, especially concerning the reduction of government spending and promotion of fiscal discipline. This alliance could also lead to a potential shift in power dynamics within the Republican Party and the Senate more broadly. In conclusion, the recent budgetary failures appear to have played a key role in Trent Lott's decision to side with Jesse Helms. This move illustrates the complex interplay between policy objectives, political alliances, and the need to address crucial issues like budget failures within the United States Senate. The consequences of this decision likely shaped the direction of both the Senate and the Republican Party at the time."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Azam had travelled ahead of his parents with an uncle and was seriously injured during the journey. His story sparked the social media campaign #FindAzam. Azam was not the only member of the family to be injured while making the journey from Syria to Europe. His reunion with his parents on Thursday took place in a German hospital, where his father is being treated for a broken leg that he sustained during the journey through Greece. John Sweeney met Azam in Serbia in September while making a documentary about the refugee trail for the BBC's current affairs programme Panorama. The boy was crying in pain because a car had run him over while he was asleep, breaking his jaw. But before completing his treatment in Belgrade, Azam vanished with his uncle. For the BBC Newsnight programme, Sweeney retraced the steps of the refugee trail that Azam and his uncle took, travelling from Serbia to Hamburg where the child was eventually found by a BBC team after a long search involving the crucial use of social media. The uncle told the BBC that a splinter had entered Azam's eye during shelling in Damascus and he was asked by the child's parents to take him as speedily as possible to Germany for it to be treated. He said that he was forced to take the child out of hospital in Serbia because the priority was to get him to Germany as quickly as possible.

Murdoch found a political ally in Sir John McEwen, leader of the Australian Country Party (now known as the National Party of Australia), who was governing in coalition with the larger Menzies-Holt-Gorton Liberal Party. From the very first issue of The Australian Murdoch began taking McEwen's side in every issue that divided the long-serving coalition partners. (The Australian, 15 July 1964, first edition, front page: \\"Strain in Cabinet, Liberal-CP row flares.\\") It was an issue that threatened to split the coalition government and open the way for the stronger Australian Labor Party to dominate Australian politics. It was the beginning of a long campaign that served McEwen well. After McEwen and Menzies retired, Murdoch threw his growing power behind the Australian Labor Party under the leadership of Gough Whitlam and duly saw it elected on a social platform that included universal free health care, free education for all Australians to tertiary level, recognition of the People's Republic of China, and public ownership of Australia's oil, gas and mineral resources. Rupert Murdoch's backing of Whitlam turned out to be brief. Murdoch had already started his short-lived National Star newspaper in America, and was seeking to strengthen his political contacts there. Asked about the Australian federal election, 2007 at News Corporation's annual general meeting in New York on 19 October 2007, its chairman Rupert Murdoch said, \\"I am not commenting on anything to do with Australian politics. I'm sorry. I always get into trouble when I do that.\\" Pressed as to whether he believed Prime Minister John Howard should continue as prime minister, he said: \\"I have nothing further to say. I'm sorry. Read our editorials in the papers. It'll be the journalists who decide that - the editors.\\" In 2009, in response to accusations by Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd that News Limited was running vendettas against him and his government, Murdoch opined that Rudd was \\"oversensitive\\". Murdoch described Howard's successor, Labor Party Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, as \\"...more ambitious to lead the world [in tackling climate change] than to lead Australia...\\" and criticised Rudd's expansionary fiscal policies in the wake of the financial crisis of 2008 as unnecessary. Although News Limited's interests are extensive, also including the Daily Telegraph, the Courier-Mail and the Adelaide Advertiser, it was suggested by the commentator Mungo MacCallum in The Monthly that \\"the anti-Rudd push, if coordinated at all, was almost certainly locally driven\\" as opposed to being directed by Murdoch, who also took a different position from local editors on such matters as climate change and stimulus packages to combat the financial crisis. Murdoch is a supporter of an Australian republic, having campaigned for one during the 1999 referendum. Answer this question \\"What type of political activities did Murdoch do in Australia?\\" by extracting the answer from the text above.","completion":"In Australia, Murdoch engaged in various political activities, which included: 1. Taking Sir John McEwen's side in every issue that divided the long-serving coalition partners, as seen in The Australian newspaper. 2.

Temporarily refraining from commenting on Australian politics in 2007. 4. In 2009, he responded to accusations from Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, stating that Rudd was \\"oversensitive\\" and criticized Rudd's expansionary fiscal policies in the wake of the financial crisis of 2008. 5.

The slightest move makes you jump with pain. Nothing could be worse than a pain in the neck. That is why we use the phrase to describe some people who give you the same feeling. We have all met such people. One is the man who always seems to be clapping his hands--often at the wrong time--during a performance in the theater. He keeps you from hearing the actors. Even worse are those who can never arrive before the curtain goes up and the play begins. They come hurrying down to your row of seats. You are comfortably settled down, with your hat and heavy coat in your lap. You must stand up to let them pass. You are proud of yourself-control after they have settled into their seats...Well, what now...God, one of them is up again. He forgot to go to the men's room, and once more you have to stand up, hanging on to your hat and coat to let him pass. Now, that is \\" _ \\". Another, well--known to us all, is the person sitting behind you in the movies. His mouth is full of popcorn ; he is chewing loudly, or talking between bites to friends next to him. None of them remain still. Up and down, back and forth, they go--for another bag of popcorn, or something to drink. Then, there is the man sitting next to you at lunch, smoking. He wants you to enjoy it too, and blows smoke across your food into your mouth. We must not forget the man who comes into a bus or subway and sits down next to you, just as close as you will let him. You are reading the newspaper and he gets closer so that he can read the paper with you. He may even turn the paper to the next page before you are ready for it.

(b). positive.","completion":"The sentiment of the tweet \\"need money\\" can be interpreted in different ways depending on the context and tone in which it was written. However, we can try to analyze it based on the words and potential implications. On one hand, the tweet could carry a negative sentiment due to the following reasons: 1. Financial issues: The need for money indicates financial problems or dissatisfaction with one's current economic situation, which often falls under negative experiences. 2. Urgency: The use of the word \\"need\\" suggests the person has urgent financial requirements, which might stem from unforeseen circumstances or financial instability. 3. Dependence: The requirement of external financial help can be seen as negative because it highlights that the individual cannot manage their financial needs independently. Alternatively, the tweet could carry a positive sentiment due to the following reasons: 1. Confidence: The person might be optimistic that they will receive help by expressing their needs. This optimism demonstrates that they have faith in their social networks or connections to support them and can be seen as a positive perspective. 2. Ambition: An individual may feel motivated to use the money for personal growth, such as starting a business, pursuing education, or investing in health and wellness – all of which are seen as positive ventures. Given these potential interpretations, it might be challenging to define the sentiment of this tweet as exclusively negative or positive without further context. Nevertheless, considering the likely connotations of \\"need money,\\" a more fitting answer among the choices provided would be: (a). negative. However, it is crucial to remember that sentiment analysis heavily depends on the context and tone in which the statement is made."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Choose the most suitable option to answer the above question. Options: - getting arrested - throw up - staggering - fall down - explode Answer:","completion":"The most suitable option to answer the above question is \\"throw up.\\" When you consume alcohol, your body can only process and metabolize a certain amount at a time. Going too fast with your alcohol consumption means your body will not have enough time to break down and process the alcohol, leading to a buildup of unprocessed alcohol in your system. This buildup can cause undesirable effects, such as dizziness, slurred speech, impaired judgment, and, in extreme cases, alcohol poisoning. One of the primary ways your body deals with this overload of alcohol is by triggering the vomiting reflex through the activation of the chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ) in the brain. The CTZ detects toxins within the bloodstream, and when the levels of alcohol rise too rapidly, it signals for you to throw up. Vomiting serves to expel the unprocessed alcohol from your stomach, preventing further absorption into your bloodstream and thus protecting your body from more harm. While the other options mentioned - getting arrested, staggering, falling down, and, metaphorically, exploding - are potential consequences of excessive alcohol consumption, they are not the direct result of the body's inability to process alcohol at a fast rate. Throwing up is the most appropriate answer because it directly addresses the physiological response to the issue at hand, which is an overloaded system that cannot keep up with the amount of alcohol consumed."},{"prompt":"Where could you see someone pretending to be an action figure but not trying to sell action figures?

Question: The answer to the question: What authority did Neilston remain under until 1975? is inside the article: Neilston is represented by several tiers of elected government. Neilston Community Council forms the lowest tier of governance whose statutory role is to communicate local opinion to local and central government. It is one of ten community councils of the East Renfrewshire council area. East Renfrewshire Council, the unitary local authority for Neilston, is based at Giffnock, close to the border with the City of Glasgow, and is the executive, deliberative and legislative body responsible for local governance. The Scottish Parliament is responsible for devolved matters such as education, health and justice, while reserved matters are dealt with by the Parliament of the United Kingdom. The territory of what became Neilston anciently formed part of the Kingdom of Strathclyde. It has lain within the county boundaries of Renfrewshire from a very early time. Neilston emerged as a parish and administrative unit in 1170, and was for many years under the lordship of the Mures of Caldwell whose tombs are at the parish church. The parish was 8 miles (13 km) in length and by from 2 miles (3 km) to 4 miles (6 km) in breadth, encompassing six sevenths of what is now the town of Barrhead.

The answer to the question: What is the partial collection that the government received from Steamtown that is still on display in Scranton? is inside the article: Steamtown, U.S.A., was a steam locomotive museum that ran steam excursions out of North Walpole, New Hampshire, and Bellows Falls, Vermont, from the 1960s to 1983. The museum was founded by millionaire seafood industrialist F. Nelson Blount. The non-profit Steamtown Foundation took over operations following his death in 1967. Because of Vermont's air quality regulations restricting steam excursions, declining visitor attendance, and disputes over the use of track, some pieces of the collection were relocated to Scranton, Pennsylvania, in the mid-1980s and the rest were auctioned off. After the move, Steamtown continued to operate in Scranton but failed to attract the expected 200,000–400,000 visitors. Within two years the tourist attraction was facing bankruptcy, and more pieces of the collection were sold to pay off debt. In 1986, the United States House of Representatives, under the urging of Pennsylvania Representative Joseph M. McDade, voted to approve 8 million to study the collection and to begin the process of making it a National Historic Site. As a result, the National Park Service (NPS) conducted historical research on the equipment that remained in the Foundation's possession. This research was used as a Scope of Collections Statement for the Steamtown National Historic Site. The scope was published in 1991 under the title Steamtown Special History Study. The report provided concise histories of each piece of equipment and made recommendations as to whether or not each piece belonged in the soon-to-be government-funded collection. By 1995, Steamtown had been acquired and developed by the NPS with a 66 million allocation. Several more pieces have been removed from the collection as a result of the government acquisition.

A:","completion":"Based on the hints provided by your teacher, the best answer to the question \\"What occurs through birth and death?\\" would be [VIII] evolution. Evolution is a process that occurs at the population level over time, and is driven by various mechanisms, one of which is natural selection. Natural selection is the differential survival and reproduction of individuals within a population due to differences in their inherited traits, leading to changes in the genetic makeup of the population over time. Birth and death are indeed natural processes and are integral components of the life cycle of organisms. These processes can play a significant role in shaping the evolutionary dynamics of populations. For example, as individuals are born into a population, they bring in new genetic material through mutation and recombination. This increases the genetic variation within the population and provides the raw material for natural selection to act upon. Conversely, when individuals die, their genetic material is removed from the population. If certain individuals have traits that increase their likelihood of survival and reproduction, they will pass those traits on to more offspring. Over time, these advantageous traits will become more common in the population, driving the process of evolution. While the other answer options like sleep, illness, anemia, tearing, Leptospirosis, nature, and starvation are all natural phenomena or aspects of life, they do not directly answer the question about what occurs through birth and death. Evolution as a process is most closely linked to birth and death as it encompasses the continuous changes in species over time driven by natural selection."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The next night he prepares a satchel with supplies and a Polaroid camera, but is surprised when six dwarves spill out of the wardrobe. Kevin quickly learns the group has stolen a large, worn map, and are looking for an exit from Kevin's room before they are discovered. They find that Kevin's bedroom wall can be pushed, revealing a long hallway. Kevin is hesitant to join until the visage of a menacing head â the Supreme Being â appears behind them, demanding the return of the map. Kevin and the dwarves fall into an empty void at the end of the hallway. They land in Italy during the Napoleonic Wars. As they recover, Kevin learns that Randall is the lead dwarf of the group composed of Fidgit, Strutter, Og, Wally, and Vermin. They were once employed by the Supreme Being to repair holes in the spacetime fabric, but instead realized the potential to use the map to steal riches. With the map and Kevin's help, they visit several locations in spacetime, and meet figures such as Napoleon Bonaparte and Robin Hood; Kevin uses his camera to document their visits. They are unaware, however, that their activities are being monitored by Evil, a malevolent being who is able to manipulate reality and is attempting to acquire the map himself so that he can remake the universe to his design. Through Evil's actions, Kevin becomes separated from the group and ends up in Mycenaean Greece, meeting King Agamemnon. After Kevin inadvertently helps Agamemnon kill a minotaur,...

If we analyze the context, the word \\"although\\" implies some level of contrast or contradiction in the situation. (I) isn't a contradiction because if Erin has a talent in construction, it's logical for her to help Natalie. Therefore, it doesn't provide any contrast. (II) however brings out an interesting contrast, where Natalie is already talented at construction, yet Erin is offering her help.

If \\"Two Asian young women walk through strip mall.\\", does this mean that \\"Two women are walking.\\"?","completion":"Yes, the statement \\"Two Asian young women walk through strip mall\\" implies that \\"Two women are walking.\\" To elaborate, let's break down the information given in the original sentence: 1. \\"Two Asian young women\\": This part of the sentence provides information about the number, ethnicity, and age group of the women. There are two individuals, both of Asian ethnicity, and they are both young. 2. \\"walk through\\": This part of the sentence informs us of the action being taken by the women: walking. Therefore, we know that the two women are in the act of walking. 3. \\"strip mall\\": This phrase tells us the location where these women are walking. A strip mall is a shopping area containing multiple stores or businesses in a connected strip and typically has parking spaces in front of the stores. When we extract the core information from the sentence, we can see that there are indeed two women walking. However, when reducing the original sentence to \\"Two women are walking,\\" some essential details are omitted: their age, ethnicity, and the location where the walking is taking place.

Many of those arrested were found at motorway service stations and truck stops, having hidden in lorries. The Home Office said it wanted \\"long-term solutions\\" to illegal migration. Four forces - including Police Scotland - did not provide data, while some only provided partial information. Commons Home Affairs Committee chairman Keith Vaz called for \\"urgent action\\" to tackle the problem, while former Special Branch ports officer Chris Hobbs called the figures \\"appalling\\". BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw said the figures were the most comprehensive yet to be compiled, and highlighted the increasing burden placed on police by migrants who have slipped through border controls. The figures, released under the Freedom of Information (FOI) Act, show officers made 7,709 arrests for illegal entry in 2013. The number increased slightly to 7,913 the following year and rose to 9,600 in 2015, when many countries in Europe were struggling to deal with the refugee crisis. The total over the period from January 2013 to April this year was 27,800. This does not include people arrested for staying longer in the country than their visa entitled them to, nor those detained at ports and airports, who are dealt with by Border Force staff. Meanwhile, a separate FOI request showed that across the Channel, officials at ports in France, Belgium and the Netherlands intercepted 145,157 would-be migrants to the UK from 2013 to the end of March 2016. By BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw If you want to find figures on legal immigration, the Office for National Statistics has plenty. Illegal immigration is a different matter. Clandestine migrants don't want to be found, let alone counted for statistical purposes. Besides, the government wouldn't be keen to advertise how many people are in the country who shouldn't be. But the police arrest figures provide a good indicator of the scale of the problem. Of course the numbers don't include illegal entrants who've managed to stay under the radar. But they do highlight the increasing burden on police presented by those who've slipped through border controls unnoticed. Metropolitan - 6,834 Thames Valley - 2,107 Kent - 2,092 West Midlands - 1,692 Greater Manchester - 1,538 Surrey - 1,425 Mr Hobbs said: \\"Obviously these people are still getting through. \\"And these are the ones that are being detected by police. What about the ones who are getting through undetected, who simply disappear?\\" \\"The figures really are unacceptably high. We are an island and really we're not making full advantage of the fact that we are surrounded by sea. We should be doing far better, and the figures are appalling.\\" Mr Vaz told the BBC the \\"astonishing\\" figures \\"basically show[ed] that our border is not secure\\". \\"The government keeps maintaining that they have got water-tight security at our borders,\\" he said. \\"If 27,000 people have been arrested for entering the country illegally by our police forces, then it shows that this problem is even worse than we had anticipated and we expect urgent action to be taken.\\" Mr Vaz said the problem meant \\"greater pressure\\" on the UK's police forces, as they were \\"having to do the work of border security\\". More resources were needed, he added. Dover's Conservative MP Charlie Elphicke has called for further patrols in the Channel. He said: \\"We need to not just dismantle the Jungle at Calais. \\"We need to deal with the camps at Dunkirk and elsewhere and by the Channel ports. We also need to deal with the problem of people-trafficking by small craft. \\"That's why I've been calling for a marine-led new Dover patrol to make sure that the English Channel is kept safe and secure.\\" The Home Office said where someone is found to have no right to remain in the UK, it will take action to remove them. \\"As part of the ongoing action we are taking to secure our borders, we have invested tens of millions of pounds to bolster security at ports in northern France,\\" a spokesman said. \\"We are also committed to finding long-term solutions to the problem of illegal migration, which is why we created the Organised Immigration Crime Taskforce last year to work with law enforcement and international partners to target the organised crime gangs behind people smuggling.\\" There were \\"clear signs\\" that the action was working, he added.

Joe started the no-till gardening method, while Kat applied conventional gardening methods. But I can use this background: The benefits provided by no-tillage to predators may lead to larger predator populations, which is a good way to control pests (biological control), but also can facilitate predation of the crop itself. In corn crops, for instance, predation by caterpillars can be higher in no-till than in conventional tillage fields.In places with rigorous winter, untilled soil can take longer to warm and dry in spring, which may delay planting to less ideal dates. Another factor to be considered is that organic residue from the prior year's crops lying on the surface of untilled fields can provide a favorable environment to pathogens, helping to increase the risk of transmitting diseases to the future crop. And because no-till farming provides good environment for pathogens, insects and weeds, it can lead farmers to a more intensive use of chemicals for pest control. Other disadvantages of no-till include underground rot, low soil temperatures and high moisture.Based on the balance of these factors, and because each farm has different problems, agroecologists will not attest that only no-till or complete tillage is the right way of farming. Yet, these are not the only possible choices regarding soil preparation, since there are intermediate practices such as strip-till, mulch-till and ridge-till, all of them – just as no-till – categorized as conservation tillage. Agroecologists, then, will evaluate the need of different practices for the contexts in which each farm is inserted.

Answer the following question: U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis on Saturday slammed China's militarization of disputed South China Sea islands, insisting that weapons systems recently deployed in the area were meant to intimidate and coerce Beijing's neighbors. The comments came during a speech at the Shangri-La Dialogue, an annual Asian defense forum in Singapore. In the speech, Mattis laid out the broader U.S. strategy for a \\"free and open\\" Indo-Pacific region. \\"China's policy in the South China Sea stands in stark contrast to the openness our strategy promotes. It calls into question China's broader goals,\\" Mattis said. Specifically, the Pentagon chief mentioned China's deployment of anti-ship and surface-to-air missiles, electronic jammers, and the landing of a bomber aircraft at the Paracel Islands off the coast of Vietnam. \\"Despite China's claim to the contrary, the placement of these weapon systems is tied directly to military use for the purposes of intimidation and coercion,\\" Mattis added. Though much of the world is focused on an upcoming summit between North Korea and the United States, this year's Shangri-La Dialogue has focused primarily on the region's long-term future and how to deal with a more assertive China. Beijing has begun projecting power beyond its borders, most notably through the construction and militarization of islands in disputed areas of the South China Sea. China claims nearly the entire South China Sea, despite overlapping claims by countries including Vietnam, the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia and Taiwan. Last week, the United States disinvited China from the Rim of the Pacific exercise (RIMPAC), a major international maritime exercise to be held later this year, citing Beijing's behavior in the South China Sea. Mattis on Saturday referred to that disinvitation as an \\"initial response\\" to China, but he did not outline any additional steps that might be taken. \\"The U.S. will continue to pursue a constructive, results-oriented relationship with China, cooperating when possible and competing vigorously where...

Your task is to generate question for given answer based on set of context paragraphs, supporting facts and an answer. Q: Context_1 : William Norton \\"Bill\\" Holsworth is an Australian mammalogist and philanthropist. Since 1989, he and his wife Carol Holsworth have managed the Holsworth Wildlife Research Endowment to fund wildlife research by Australian postgraduate researchers. Context_2 : In computer science, the scientific community metaphor is a metaphor used to aid understanding scientific communities. The first publications on the scientific community metaphor in 1981 and 1982 involved the development of a programming language named Ether that invoked procedural plans to process goals and assertions concurrently by dynamically creating new rules during program execution. Ether also addressed issues of conflict and contradiction with multiple sources of knowledge and multiple viewpoints. Context_3 : The Moni (also known as the Migani, the Megani, the Djonggunu, or the Jonggunu) are an indigenous people in the Indonesian Paniai regency (kabupaten) of the Papua province (formerly Central Irian Jaya) of West Papua (western part of the island of New Guinea). They speak the Moni language. They revere a large black and white whistling tree kangaroo called a bondegzeu as an ancestor. The bondegzeu was unknown to the scientific community until the zoologist Tim Flannery described it in 1995. Context_4 : Richard Leslie Thompson, also known as Sadaputa Dasa (February 4, 1947 – September 18, 2008), was an American mathematician, author and Gaudiya Vaishnava religious figure, known principally for his promotion of Vedic creationism and as the co-author (with Michael Cremo) of \\"Forbidden Archeology: The Hidden History of the Human Race\\" (1993), which has been widely criticised by the scientific community. Thompson also published several books and articles on religion and science, Hindu cosmology and astronomy. He was a member of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (popularly known as the \\"Hare Krishna movement\\" or \\"ISKCON\\") and a founding member of the Bhaktivedanta Institute, the branch of ISKCON dedicated to examining the relationship of modern scientific theories to the Vaishnava worldview. In the 'science and religion' community he was known for his articulation of ISKCON's view of science. Danish historian of religion Mikael Rothstein described Thompson as \\"the single dominating writer on science\\" in ISKCON whom ISKCON has chosen to \\"cover the field of science more or less on his own\\". C. Mackenzie Brown, professor of religion at Trinity University, San Antonio, Texas, described him as \\"the leading figure\\" in ISKCON's critique of modern science. Context_5 : A superseded, or obsolete, scientific theory is a scientific theory that the mainstream scientific community once widely accepted, but now considers an inadequate or incomplete description of reality, or simply false. This label does not cover protoscientific or fringe science theories that have never had broad support in the scientific community. Also, it does not mean theories that were never widely accepted. Some theories that were only supported under specific political authorities, such as Lysenkoism, may also be described as obsolete or superseded. All of Newtonian physics is so satisfactory for most purposes that it is more widely used except at velocities that are a significant fraction of the speed of light, and simpler Newtonian but not relativistic mechanics is usually taught in schools. Another case is the belief that the earth is approximately flat. For centuries, people have known that a flat earth model produces errors in long distance calculations—but considering moderately-sized areas as flat for the purposes of mapping and surveying does not introduce significant errors. Context_6 : The Design Revolution: Answering the Toughest Questions about Intelligent Design is a 2004 book by William A. Dembski, who supports intelligent design, and the idea that certain features of the universe and of living things are best explained by an intelligent cause, not a naturalistic process such as natural selection. The book is written in question/answer format from Dembski's point of view as one of the conceptual leaders in the movement. Each chapter is about 4 pages long and addresses one specific question. Dembski describes these questions as from his prior ten years experience in lectures, media interviews, and published criticism by the scientific community opposed to intelligent design, who constitute the majority of the scientific community and science education organizations. The foreword was written by Charles W. Colson. Context_7 : Phillip E. Johnson (born June 18, 1940) is a retired UC Berkeley law professor and author who is considered the father of the intelligent design movement. He is a critic of Darwinism, which he has described as \\"fully naturalistic evolution, involving chance mechanisms and natural selection\\". Johnson has said he believes \\"that a God exists who could create out of nothing if He wanted to do so, but who also might have chosen to work through a natural evolutionary process instead\\". Johnson rejects that evolution is a fact and favors neo-creationary views known as intelligent design (ID). He was a co-founder of the Discovery Institute's Center for Science and Culture (CSC) and is credited with establishing the wedge strategy, which aims to change public opinion and scientific consensus, and seeks to convince the scientific community to allow a role for theism, or causes beyond naturalistic explanation, in scientific discourse. The consensus of the scientific community considers Johnson's opinions on evolution to be pseudoscience. Johnson has argued that scientists accepted the theory of evolution \\"before it was rigorously tested, and thereafter used all their authority to convince the public that naturalistic processes are sufficient to produce a human from a bacterium, and a bacterium from a mix of chemicals.\\" Context_8 : Timothy Fridtjof \\"Tim\\" Flannery (born 28 January 1956) is an Australian mammalogist, palaeontologist, environmentalist and global warming activist. He was the Chief Commissioner of the Climate Commission, a Federal Government body providing information on climate change to the Australian public. On 23 September 2013, Flannery announced that he would join other sacked commissioners to form the independent Climate Council, that would be funded by the community. Context_9 : Parascience is the study of subjects that are outside the scope of traditional science because they cannot be explained by accepted scientific theory or tested by conventional scientific methods. This study may be concerned with phenomena assumed to be beyond the scope of scientific inquiry or for which no scientific explanation exists. Parascience can also be defined as a subject, method, etc., purporting to be scientific but regarded as unorthodox or unacceptable by the scientific community; an \\"alternative\\" science. Context_10 : The relationship between intelligent design and science has been a contentious one. Intelligent design (ID) is presented by its proponents as science and claims to offer an alternative to evolution. The Discovery Institute, a politically conservative think tank and the leading proponents of intelligent design, launched a campaign entitled \\"Teach the Controversy\\" which claims that a controversy exists within the scientific community over evolution.

This suggests that the answer should be a term that represents a negative consequence for individuals displaying excessive or unrestrained behavior. Step 2: Examine the choices - severe - harsh - hard - strict - self-denying Step 3: Evaluate each choice in relation to the question - Severe: This term implies a strict, substantial, or significantly negative consequence. - Harsh: Harsh suggests a stern or unforgiving consequence but may not convey the same level of intensity as severe. - Hard: This term may convey a sense of difficulty or challenge but does not explicitly convey the severity or intensity of the punishment. - Strict: While strict does indicate rigidity and a lack of tolerance, it does not necessarily convey the specific severity of the punishment. - Self-denying: This term implies a self-imposed limitation or restraint, which does not directly relate to the notion of punishment or its severity. Step 4: Select the most fitting choice Based on the evaluation in step 3, the term \\"severe\\" is the most appropriate answer because it directly conveys the idea of severity and intensity in a punishment.

Detective Chan, an honest, hardworking cop, has been tirelessly trying to bring Lau's criminal empire down. Unbeknownst to Lau, his Second-in-command, Kenji, has been secretly plotting against him. Kenji, raised by Lau since he was a young boy, has always been loyal to the syndicate. However, after a recent operation went awry and several members of their crew were killed, Kenji has grown disillusioned with Lau's leadership. Moreover, Kenji has discovered that Lau was responsible for the death of his parents, which sparked his desire for vengeance. When Kenji overhears a conversation that divulges Lau's plan to betray his own organization and form an alliance with a rival syndicate, he decides to put an end to Lau's tyranny. Kenji contacts Detective Chan and offers him valuable information about Lau's operations in return for the police's assurance of immunity from prosecution. As Kenji carefully gathers the necessary evidence to bring down Lau and his empire, he encounters various challenges, like dodging ambitious gang members who are suspicious of his motives and avoiding the ruthless hitmen working for Lau.

Question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who documented the poaching of buffalo, deer, elk, and antelope for hides? There was considerable local opposition to the Yellowstone National Park during its early years. Some of the locals feared that the regional economy would be unable to thrive if there remained strict federal prohibitions against resource development or settlement within park boundaries and local entrepreneurs advocated reducing the size of the park so that mining, hunting, and logging activities could be developed. To this end, numerous bills were introduced into Congress by Montana representatives who sought to remove the federal land-use restrictions.After the park's official formation, Nathaniel Langford was appointed as the park's first superintendent in 1872 by Secretary of Interior Columbus Delano, the first overseer and controller of the park. Langford served for five years but was denied a salary, funding, and staff. Langford lacked the means to improve the land or properly protect the park, and without formal policy or regulations, he had few legal methods to enforce such protection. This left Yellowstone vulnerable to poachers, vandals, and others seeking to raid its resources. He addressed the practical problems park administrators faced in the 1872 Report to the Secretary of the Interior and correctly predicted that Yellowstone would become a major international attraction deserving the continuing stewardship of the government. In 1874, both Langford and Delano advocated the creation of a federal agency to protect the vast park, but Congress refused. In 1875, Colonel William Ludlow, who had previously explored areas of Montana under the command of George Armstrong Custer, was assigned to organize and lead an expedition to Montana and the newly established Yellowstone Park. Observations about the lawlessness and exploitation of park resources were included in Ludlow's Report of a Reconnaissance to the Yellowstone National Park.

Q:Question: \\"Where did Mahayana Sutras spread to second, China or Japan?\\" Context: \\"In the 2nd century CE, Mahayana Sutras spread to China, and then to Korea and Japan, and were translated into Chinese. During the Indian period of Esoteric Buddhism (from the 8th century onwards), Buddhism spread from India to Tibet and Mongolia.\\" Answer: A:","completion":"The Mahayana Sutras, a collection of essential Buddhist scriptures, played an important role in the dissemination of Buddhism throughout East Asia. Based on the context provided, it can be inferred that Mahayana Sutras initially spread to China before reaching other East Asian countries such as Korea and Japan. In the 2nd century CE, Mahayana Sutras spread to China, where Buddhism was initially introduced to Chinese society through Silk Road traders and Buddhist missionaries who arrived from Central Asia. The cultural and religious exchanges between China and Central Asia greatly facilitated the transmission of Buddhism into China, and the Chinese people were eager to adopt these new ideas and integrate them into their philosophical and religious practices. As Buddhism grew in popularity within China, Chinese monks undertook the translation of Sanskrit Buddhist texts, including the Mahayana Sutras, into the Chinese language. Such translations were instrumental in the spread and establishment of Buddhism in China, as they allowed Chinese practitioners to access the wisdom and teachings of the religion in their native language. The process of translation also led to the emergence of various distinctive Chinese schools of Buddhism like Pure Land and Chan (Zen) Buddhism, which later influenced the development of Buddhism in East Asia. After the introduction of Mahayana Sutras to China, its teachings began to spread to the neighboring countries of Korea and Japan, where they reached between the 4th and 7th centuries CE. The spread of Buddhism in these regions, as in China, was facilitated by the exchange of cultural ideas and the movement of Buddhist monks, missionaries, and scholars. Buddhism was introduced to the Korean peninsula through its contacts with China, and by the late 4th century, it had gained a strong following within the Korean kingdom of Goguryeo (37 BCE – 668 CE). From Korea, Mahayana Buddhism then spread to Japan by the mid-6th century through diplomatic exchanges, tribute missions, and the travel of scholars between the two regions. The introduction of Buddhism to Japanese society coincided with the early stages of Japanese state formation, which saw the rapid adoption and adaptation of continental cultural and political practices. Japanese ruling elites were receptive to the ideas and principles of Buddhism and integrated these with the native Shinto beliefs, shaping the unique development of the religion in Japan. In summary, according to the context provided, Mahayana Sutras initially spread to China in the 2nd century CE. From China, they later spread to Korea and then to Japan. As Buddhism continued to expand beyond its Indian origins, it became an influential spiritual and cultural force in East Asia, where it left an indelible impact on societies, philosophies, and artistic expressions across many centuries."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the title of this article: Under the Bretton Woods system established after World War II, the value of gold was fixed to 35 per ounce, and the value of the U.S. dollar was thus anchored to the value of gold. Rising government spending in the 1960s, however, led to doubts about the ability of the United States to maintain this convertibility, gold stocks dwindled as banks and international investors began to convert dollars to gold, and as a result the value of the dollar began to decline.

Complete the next sentence: We see a newscaster speaking in a studio. we","completion":"We can deduce that the newscaster is likely reporting on current events, breaking news, or sharing information about a particular topic to the audience tuning in. Newscasters play an essential role in disseminating news and updates to the public, often through television, radio, or online platforms. In a professional studio setting, the newscaster is likely seated at a news desk, with cameras, teleprompters, and other production equipment arranged around them. They may be wearing formal attire suitable for on-camera appearances and adhering to a polished presentation style to establish credibility and maintain viewers' engagement. As they communicate the news, the newscaster may employ various storytelling techniques, including relaying facts, sharing interviews, or presenting relevant images and video footage to help illustrate the information being shared. They may also engage with expert guests or correspondents, who can offer additional insights or analysis on specific topics. Newscasters may cover various domains, such as politics, science, sports, entertainment, and health, depending on their expertise and the focus of the news program they are part of. They are responsible for delivering accurate and unbiased news coverage while adhering to ethical journalism practices. Behind the scenes, a team of producers, writers, and researchers work tirelessly to gather and verify information from various sources, such as press releases, public statements, and eyewitness accounts. They often collaborate with newscasters to craft cohesive news scripts that convey the necessary information in a clear and concise manner. In addition to the physical appearance of the newscaster and the news program's content, the studio itself serves as a critical component of news broadcasting. Lighting, sound, and visual elements are all carefully adjusted to ensure the best possible viewing experience for the audience. News studios often make use of chroma key or green screen technology to project various backgrounds and graphics, allowing for seamless transitions between segments and creating an engaging visual environment for the viewers at home. The role of the newscaster and the wider news team extends beyond simply sharing information. They act as trusted sources of reliable information, helping the audience stay informed and make educated decisions in their daily lives. As the world becomes increasingly connected and events across the globe impact everyday people, the importance of well-executed news reporting cannot be overstated."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A squirrel's home is called a drey. Patch's drey was very comfortable. He lived high up an old oak tree, in a hollowed-out stump of a big branch that had long ago been cut off by humans. The entrance was only just big enough for Patch to squeeze in and out, but the drey itself was spacious, for a squirrel. Patch had lined his drey with dry leaves, grasses and bits of newspaper. It was warm and dry, and on that cold morning he would have liked nothing better than to stay home all day and sleep. But he was so hungry. Hunger filled him like water fills a glass. The cherry and maple trees had not yet started to bud; flowers had not yet begun to grow; the juicy grubs and bugs of spring had not yet emerged; and it had been two days since Patch had found a nut. Imagine how hungry you would feel if you went two whole days without eating, and you may have some idea how Patch felt that morning. Patch poked his head out of the drey into the cold air and shivered as he looked around. Clumps of white, crumbly ice still clung to the ground. Gusts of cold wind shook and rustled the trees' bare branches. The pale and distant sun seemed drained of heat. Patch took a moment to satisfy himself that there were no dangers nearby, no hawk circling above or unleashed dog below. Then he emerged from his drey and began to look for acorns.

Write a negative yelp review (OPTIONS: - negative; - positive;).","completion":"Title: Expectations Fell drastically short in every aspect Review: I wouldn't wish anyone the experience I recently had at [Establishment Name] last weekend. I rarely leave negative reviews, but when a place truly fails to meet basic standards of hospitality, I feel it's necessary to warn others about what to expect. The food, service, and overall atmosphere at this restaurant were all far below satisfactory levels. As a fan of dining out, I always get excited about trying new places, and I had heard good things about [Establishment Name] from a few friends. I decided to give it a try to celebrate my sister's birthday. The first red flag was the parking situation - we circled around for twenty minutes trying to find a spot, which just added to our growing frustration. Upon entering the restaurant, we were not greeted with much effort, the hostess barely looked up from her phone as she mumbled \\"Welcome\\" - not a great start, but we brushed it off with the hopes that our dinner would make up for it. Once seated, we couldn't help but notice how loud the restaurant was. It wasn't lively, it was just noisy, and the loud music didn't help. We couldn't even hold a conversation without constantly repeating ourselves. The menu had a decent variety, but the prices were much higher than I expected for an average establishment. After waiting ages for our server to acknowledge us, we ordered our drinks and appetizers. The server didn't seem to have any knowledge about the menu, as they responded to our questions with vague and unhelpful answers. It took far longer than necessary for our drinks to arrive, which wouldn't have been an issue had they been prepared correctly. Unfortunately, my cocktail was watered-down and tasteless, and my sister's glass of wine seemed like it had been sitting out for days. Once the appetizers finally arrived, we were hoping for a redeeming element to our evening. Instead, calamari was chewy and tasted like it had been fried in old, dirty oil. The bruschetta was bland and difficult to eat, mainly because the bread was so hard, it could have passed as a rock. When our main courses were served, I was at least expecting the food to come out hot and fresh. Sadly, my sister's pasta dish was lukewarm, and my steak was overcooked and not seasoned properly. The sides were just as disappointing - the mashed potatoes were tasteless and lumpy, while the vegetables seemed as if they had been boiled beyond recognition. As for the dessert, which was intended to be a special birthday treat for my sister, well, that was entirely uninspired. They brought out an obviously store-bought slice of cake with a single, half-hearted candle stuck into it. To wrap up, our experience at [Establishment Name] was utterly disappointing, and I cannot recommend this place to anyone looking for a pleasant dining experience. The horrible service, unappetizing food (not to mention overpriced), and an unbearable noise level truly make this one of the worst dining experiences I've ever had.

When my wife and I went to Vegas for our anniversary, Yellowtail at Bellagio very nearly ruined it. For background: My mother is Japanese, and I've been fortunate enough to visit many times. I don't need my Japanese food to be authentic, but it does have to taste good. Yellowtail's food is neither authentic nor good. The glazed salmon I ordered was soaked in a sugar sauce, sweet to the point of being inedible. (My theory: To cover up the fact they serve cheap salmon.) To their credit, when my waiter came over, he immediately asked me what was wrong. When I told him, he quickly replaced the dish with something edible but completely forgettable. (The good service is the only thing that brings Yellowtail up to two stars.) My wife had a similar experience. The food is more \\"Japanese-y\\" than Japanese. Unfortunately for me, I had a severe stomach ache for the rest of the night - a distraction to say the least when I was trying to enjoy Cirque du Solei. The Bellagio hotel staff were completely unhelpful to the point of belligerence, but that's a story for another time. My wife and I are already planning our next trip to Vegas.

I thought I had moved past it for the most part, thanks to supportive family and lots of counseling and medication to treat my treatment resistant depression I’ve struggled over the last 25 years. I will be 40 this year. My son, the oldest, turned 15 this year … the same age I was when it began. I see how young he is and recognized for the first time just how young I had been when I was abused. That was really hard for me, emotionally. Now, I look at my two girls, ages 9 and 3, and worry for their safety - probably more than I should, but understandable given what I went through. We have had lots of “body safety” talks and my older daughter understands the very basics of what I went through, mainly because I have spent a great part of this past year writing a memoir about my experiences and have begun speaking publicly about what I went through and what it means to be a survivor. This is challenging because it’s hard to talk about and explain to a child in a way that they understand without making them fear the world. I struggle with this often. I’ve chosen to use it as an opportunity to teach them about activism and the power of speaking the truth, what it means to be a survivor instead of a victim. I hope they grow up and see just how strong their mother is and how she has worked in the community to raise awareness and help others. Question: How does the mom feel about the world? Options: A.

It has antiseptic, anti-fungal, antibacterial, and anti-inflammatory properties. You can apply tea tree oil directly onto the hard pimples, or you can dilute it in a non-comedogenic oil, such as mineral oil, argan oil, or olive oil. Put some tea tree oil on a cotton ball or a Q-tip and apply directly to the deep pimple. If you have a sensitivity to tea tree oil, use a carrier oil. Tea tree oil has been shown to be just as helpful as benzoyl peroxide in treating acne. Be careful not to get any tea tree oil near your eyes. Always test for sensitivity to essential oils. Put a single drop of the oil on your wrist and wait for 10 to 15 minutes. If there is no irritation, you should be able to use the oil. Green tea has a lot of properties to help treat acne. It is anti-inflammatory and has been shown to help reduce oil production. Studies have shown that green tea is a good natural acne remedy. Soak green tea bags in warm water and apply them directly to the hard pimple. The tea will act as an astringent to draw out the pimple and help reduce inflammation. You can also use the brewed tea on your face. Put some on a cotton ball to spot treat the hard pimple. Apple cider vinegar can help reduce the size and heal hard pimples. Apple cider vinegar has antibacterial and antiseptic properties. You can use it to spot treat pimples or make a toner with it. To spot treat, pour some apple cider vinegar on a cotton ball or a Q-tip. Apply it directly to the hard pimple. To make a toner, combine ½ cup of apple cider vinegar with ½ cup of water. Wipe the mixture over the affected area with a cotton ball. Let it dry and do not rinse it off. Herbal masks can help the skin heal while reducing the size of hard pimples. Astringent herbs tighten the skin while the antibacterial herbs help kill off bacteria. This oil can be made with things in your kitchen, and you can add essential oils if you wish. Mix 1 tablespoon of honey, 1 egg white, and 1 teaspoon of lemon juice. Honey has antibacterial and healing properties. Since lemon juice is a bleaching and whitening agent, you can substitute witch hazel if you don’t want to use lemon juice. Add ½ teaspoon of either peppermint, spearmint, lavender, calendula, or thyme oil. Spread the mixture over your face or wherever else you have a problem. If you want, use a Q-tip to spread the mixture over specific problem areas. Allow the mixture to dry for 15 minutes. Then rinse off completely with lukewarm water. Pat dry with a clean towel and apply a non-comedogenic moisturizer. Exfoliation is often not recommended by many skin specialists because skin cells fall off naturally. Exfoliation can cause scarring and it can often make acne worse. However, if the hard pimple comes to a head, you can use a very gentle exfoliation technique. Gently exfoliating the skin around hard pimples can help remove any embedded hair, sebum, and cell debris and can accelerate healing. Try the following natural exfoliants that you can make yourself. When using a homemade exfoliant, apply it to your face or affected areas in gentle, circular motions. You can also use a Q-tip or cotton ball to apply to smaller areas. Gently work the mixture into the area for two to three minutes, and then rinse with warm water. Make a honey-baking soda exfoliant by mixing ¼ cup of honey with enough baking soda to make a paste. For an oatmeal exfoliant, grind ¼ to ½ cup of rolled whole oats in a food processor or coffee grinder. Add enough olive, jojoba, vitamin E, avocado, or almond oil to make a paste. To make a sugar-olive oil exfoliant, mix a teaspoon of sugar with ½ cup of olive oil. You can also use castor, jojoba, vitamin E, avocado, or almond oil. Make a sea salt exfoliant by putting one to two teaspoons of sea salt in enough olive, jojoba, vitamin E, avocado, or almond oil to make a paste. For some people, processed sugars and dairy products may cause acne. These foods may lead to inflammation and encourage bacteria to grow. Studies have shown low-glycemic index, or low sugar, foods can reduce acne. Consider eliminating sugary soft drinks from your diet. Also reduce the amount of foods you eat with processed sugar, like candy, donuts, baked goods, and other similar foods. Consider switching dairy products and fatty foods for more vegetables in your diet. Eating more low GI foods may help you reduce your acne. These foods include rolled oats and bran cereals; whole wheat and whole grain breads; vegetables, except beets, pumpkin, and parsnips; nuts; fruits aside from watermelon and dates; legumes; yogurt; and brown rice, barley, and whole grain pasta. Vitamins A and D are the most important vitamins for overall skin health. Omega-3 fats are another nutrient that can help reduce acne due to their anti-inflammatory properties. Vitamin A rich foods include spinach, carrots, broccoli, red peppers, sweet potatoes, and summer squash. Fruits that contain vitamin A include mangoes, cantaloupe, and apricots. Legumes are a good source of vitamin A, as well as meat, and fish, such as herring and salmon. The best way to get Vitamin D is to go out into the sun for 10 to 15 minutes in the morning or late afternoon a few times a week. Foods with high levels of vitamin D include fish like salmon and tuna, along with cod liver oil. Vitamin D is also found in dairy, such as milk, yogurt, and cheese. Omega-3 fatty acids are found in nuts and seeds, such as flaxseeds, flaxseed oil, chia seeds, butternuts, and walnuts. Other great sources for omega-3s are salmon, sardines, mackerel, and whitefish. Vegetables like spinach and Chinese broccoli also contain omega-3s. Even if you take proper care of your skin, there are certain things that will make pimples worse. Excessive sweating can make hard pimples worse, as can tight clothing. Makeup or cosmetics on or even near your skin can make hard pimples worse. Makeup can clog pores or cause irritation. Some facial or body cleansers can further irritate and inflame the skin due to the chemicals or the mixtures of chemicals used. Cosmetics with alcohol can dry and irritate your skin. For some people, certain foods, such as dairy products and diets high in processed sugars, increase the risk for acne by increasing inflammation and providing an environment where bacteria can flourish. Summary:","completion":"The article provides a comprehensive guide on various natural remedies and lifestyle changes that can help in removing hard pimples or treating acne.

Given the following context: By the reign of Henry VII the cathedral was complete, appearing much as it does today (though the fittings have changed). From 1508 to 1546, the eminent Italian humanist scholar Polydore Vergil was active as the chapter's representative in London. He donated a set of hangings for the choir of the cathedral. While Wells survived the Dissolution of the Monasteries better than the cathedrals of monastic foundation, the abolition of chantries in 1547 resulted in a reduction in its income. Medieval brasses were sold, and a pulpit was placed in the nave for the first time. Between 1551 and 1568, in two periods as dean, William Turner established a herb garden, which was recreated between 2003 and 2010.Elizabeth I gave the chapter and the Vicars Choral a new charter in 1591, creating a new governing body, consisting of a dean and eight residentiary canons with control over the church estates and authority over its affairs, but no longer entitled to elect the dean (that entitlement thenceforward belonged ultimately to the Crown). The stability brought by the new charter ended with the onset of the Civil War and the execution of Charles I. Local fighting damaged the cathedral's stonework, furniture and windows. The dean, Walter Raleigh, a nephew of the explorer Walter Raleigh, was placed under house arrest after the fall of Bridgwater to the Parliamentarians in 1645, first in the rectory at Chedzoy and then in the deanery at Wells. His jailor, the shoe maker and city constable, David Barrett, caught him writing a letter to his wife. When he refused to surrender it, Barrett ran him through with a sword and he died six weeks later, on 10 October 1646. He was buried in an unmarked grave in the choir before the dean's stall. During the Commonwealth of England under Oliver Cromwell no dean was appointed and the cathedral fell into disrepair. The bishop went into retirement and some of the clerics were reduced to performing menial tasks. answer the following question: What was the full name of the person who died on 10 October 1646?

Deadly levels of radiation were detected Monday outside the stricken Japanese nuclear power plant as workers fought a frantic and increasingly futile battle to prevent a total meltdown. The pool of highly radioactive water found leaking from the crippled Fukushima Daiichi plant was so toxic that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said four hours of exposure could lead to death within two months. Also, plutonium - which is more toxic than pure uranium - was found in soil sampled last week, the Tokyo Electric Power Co. admitted. \\"There's not much good news right now,\\" Gennady Pshakin, a former official with the International Atomic Energy Agency, told Reuters. \\"It's becoming less predictable.\\" \\"The radiation seems to have come from the fuel rods that were partially melted down and came into contact with the water used to cool the reactor,\\" added government spokesman Yukio Edano. Trace amounts of radiation from the Japanese plant made it to the East Coast and were detected in rainwater that fell on Boston and in parts of Pennsylvania and Maryland. The EPA said it posed no health risks, noting that passengers on a plane get bigger doses of radiation when they fly. Blasts at three reactors in the Fukushima power station - sparked by the massive March 11 earthquake and tsunami - caused the world's worst nuclear crisis since Chernobyl. Since then, emergency crews have contended with malfunctioning pumps and dangerous radiation spikes. Two workers who were burned last week after they waded into highly radioactive water inside the plant's No. 3 reactor were released from the hospital yesterday. Meanwhile, the death toll from the killer quake and tsunami climbed Monday to over 11,000. The already staggering figure is expected to rise rapidly this week with the National Police Agency reporting that another 17,339 people are still missing and feared dead. What is a short summary of the above article?","completion":"The article reports a crisis at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in Japan, where a pool of highly radioactive water leaked and was found outside the facility.

Additionally, plutonium, which is more toxic than uranium, was detected in soil samples. The radiation appears to have come from partially melted fuel rods that came into contact with cooling water. Further, traces of radiation from the Japanese plant reached the East Coast of the United States, but posed no health risks. The Fukushima crisis, triggered by the massive earthquake and tsunami in March 2011, has become the world's worst nuclear crisis since Chernobyl. Emergency crews have faced numerous challenges, including malfunctioning pumps and radiation spikes. The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami surpassed 11,000, with 17,339 people still missing and feared dead."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: When was the last time your family sat down together to have a dinner? The speed at which we live today no longer allows for slow eating habits. Most people work long hours. There is lots of fast food and eating out is now on the increase. Often, food is eaten in front of the television in silence, or a child eats alone in front of the computer. When I was a child, every evening around the same time, one of the children would be asked to set the table, and then we'd go and wash our hands: before the meal. This was the time of day when we would talk about our day at school. But now things have changed a lot. A family environment plays an important role for children in learning to communicate with others and understanding table manners, such as waiting for others to finish before leaving the table and not speaking with a mouth full of food. Parents' likes and dislikes of a certain food will also influence a child's own likes and dislikes. Studies have shown that children who often eat with their families have better results at school than children who eat with their families less than twice a week. Regular meal times give children the chance to discuss their problems with family members. They can also learn to respect others around the table. Talking to your children over dinner is the best way of having their-trust. Children learn good eating habits from their parents at a very young age. Family meals are important. Prepare them for your children. Some families eat less together because _ . A) most children live in a school B) people are busy with their work C) table manners change a lot D) food in the restaurant is better Answer:","completion":"B) people are busy with their work"},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

The doctor decided to take images of the men's jejunum to try and diagnose the issues. He discovered that Robert has more villi covering his jejunum compared to John. But I can use this background: The jejunum is the second part of the small intestine, where most nutrients are absorbed into the blood. As shown in Figure below , the mucous membrane lining the jejunum is covered with millions of microscopic, fingerlike projections called villi (singular, villus). Villi contain many capillaries, and nutrients pass from the villi into the bloodstream through the capillaries. Because there are so many villi, they greatly increase the surface area for absorption. In fact, they make the inner surface of the small intestine as large as a tennis court! What is an answer for this question: Who has more surface area available for absorption of nutrients?

Title: Horror Express Movie plot: Professor Alexander Saxton (Christopher Lee) is an anthropologist returning home to Europe via the Trans-Siberian Railway. He brings with him a large crate containing the prize from his expedition to the Himilayas: the frozen remains of a primitive humanoid creature, which Saxton is sure is the missing link in the evolutionary chain. Also on board is Dr. Wells (Peter Cushing), another Englishman and a colleague of Saxton's.Mysterious deaths occur even before the train sets out. A known thief is found dead on the platform after having looked into the crate. His corpse is discovered bleeding from the eyes, which have turned blank and white. A slightly unbalanced monk named Pujardov (a Rasputin-esque figure, played by the Argentine actor Alberto de Mendoza), claims that the crate is evil. Pujardov is the spiritual adviser for Count Maryan Petrovski (George Rigaud) and his wife, Irina (Silvia Tortosa), and he tries to demonstrate to them that the crate is an omen of evil: in a bizarre rationalization, he claims that where there is evil, there is no place for the sign of the cross, and a piece of chalk fails to make the marking of the cross on the side of the crate. Saxton dismisses it as a trick and discredits the monk.Saxton is eager to keep his find a secret from everyone, especially Dr. Wells, but Wells pays the baggage man to look into the crate when everyone is gone and tell him what's inside. Later, the man does this and is also killed by the creature, which possesses a glowing red eye. After gazing at the red eye, the man's eyes begin to bleed and turn white until he falls down dead. The ape-man quickly picks the lock of the crate just like the Chinese thief did back at the beginning of the train's voyage. The creature leaves the crate and places the baggage man's corpse inside instead; the others discover it later and Saxton is forced to come clean about his discovery. Inspector Mirov (Julio Peña) represents authority on the train, and he tries to keep the news of the death quiet among the passengers,...

You know how you have toys that you can move around? Like your robots or dolls? We have parts in our body that move too, like our arms, our legs, and our neck. Physical therapy is like a special exercise program for these parts when they get too tired, or when they hurt. A friendly, trained person called a physical therapist helps us do these exercises to make our moving parts work better and feel good. Now, about spinal manipulation, I know it sounds a bit scary, doesn't it? But it's not. You remember the long thing running down your back? That's your backbone or spine that helps you sit, stand, and do all sorts of fun stuff! Well, sometimes it doesn't do its job right and that's when we might need spinal manipulation. It's like a special massage where a person called a chiropractor gently pushes and pulls on your spine to help it work properly again, just like how you fix your bendy toys. Lastly, let's discuss acupuncture. Imagine you have a map of your body, and on this map, there are tiny, special points. In acupuncture, a professional, kind-hearted person called an acupuncturist gently places very thin needles on these points. This may sound a bit uncomfortable, but it's really not! It helps your body heal itself quicker and makes you feel stronger. It's as if it's magic! Remember, all these are ways to help our body feel better when its parts aren't working well. And like always, before doing any of these, it is important to talk to a doctor, who is like a super wizard who protects us from the bad germs and helps keeps us healthy and happy! So, there we have it, sweetie. That's what physical therapy, spinal manipulation, and acupuncture are all about! They're lots of long, strange words, aren't they?

The Chinese New Year is now known as the Spring Festival because it starts from the beginning of spring. Though there are some sayings about its origin, all agree that the word Nian, which in modern Chinese means \\"year\\", was originally the name of a beast that started to eat people the night before the beginning of a new year. One story goes that the beast Nian had a very big mouth that would take in a great many people at one time. People were very afraid. One day, an old man came to their help and said he would stop all this. He said to Nian, \\"I hear that you are very strong, but can you eat up all the beasts on earth instead of people who are too weak to be your enemies?\\" \\"Yes,\\" Nian agreed with him and went to kill many of the beasts on earth. People were very happy because those beasts also did bad things to people and killed their farm animals from time to time. After that, the old man, who was a god, rode on the beast Nian and left. Nian was gone, and other beasts also went into forests; people began to enjoy their happy life. Before the old man left, he had told people to put up red paper-cuts on their windows and doors at each year's end to drive Nian away, because red is the color the beast felt most afraid of. From then on, every year at the beginning of spring, people prepare to \\"Guo Nian\\". The word \\"Guo Nian\\" means \\"go through the Nian safely\\".

The Texas hospital where two nurses were infected treating Ebola-patient Thomas Eric Duncan has apologized for the first time in their mismanaged handling of the outbreak. But it may be too little too late for the Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital's nursing staff, who are threatening to stage a walk off after inadequate guidelines left them exposed to the virus for two days. The Dallas hospital's Chief Clinical Officer Dr Daniel Varga admits they 'made mistakes' when Duncan first showed up at the hospital with Ebola symptoms. He was initially sent away with antibiotics, despite telling health care workers that he had recently arrived from Liberia - one of the three countries currently battling the largest outbreak of the disease in history. 'Unfortunately, in our initial treatment of Mr. Duncan, despite our best intentions and a highly skilled medical team, we made mistakes. We did not correctly diagnose his symptoms as those of Ebola. We are deeply sorry,' Dr Varga says in a statement to Congress, released Wednesday. Scroll down for videos. 'We are deeply sorry': Dr Daniel Varga, chief clinical officer at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital, has apologized for the first time in their handling of Ebola patient Thomas Eric Duncan (pictured) Regrets: Dr Varga's apology comes in a letter written in Congress. Pictured above in Dallas on Wednesday. A Congressional committee had called Dr Varga to testify on Thursday, but he said he would not be able to make the meeting in person since he is busy dealing with the crisis at his hospital. While Dr Varga apologized for the initial misdiagnosis of Duncan, he says once the patient was brought back to the hospital he was 'treated with the most appropriate and available medical interventions'. When Duncan succumbed to the disease last week, the entire hospital grieved. 'It was devastating to the nurses, doctors, and team who tried so hard to save his life. We keep his family in our thoughts and prayers,' Dr Varga said. Included in the statement, is a section on 'lessons learned and steps taken' in the aftermath of Duncan's death, and the subsequent diagnosis of two nurses. Dr Varga writes that staff are now taking travel history from patients at 'first point of contact' in the emergency room. They are also taking a more 'proactive, intensive' approach to training staff on how to deal with Ebola. 'We are determined to be an agent for change across the US healthcare system by helping our peers benefit from our experience,' Dr Varga wrote. Meanwhile, representatives of the National Nurses Union told CNN they are threatening to stage a walk off after nurses Nina Pham, 26, and Amber Vinson, 29, contracted the disease this week. Sickened: Amber Vinson (left) and Nina Pham (right) both cared for Thomas Eric Duncan and both have been diagnosed with Ebola. 'Nurses have the right, if we're going to risk our lives caring for these patients, to have . . . optimal equipment, including Hazmat suits,' Katy Roemer said Wednesday on CNN's Erin Burnett Out Front. It's still unknown how Pham and Vinson became infected with the disease, but they were two of the. Despite suspecting that Duncan, a Liberian national, was sick with the highly contagious disease, hospital staff did not suit up to protect themselves until his diagnosis was confirmed by lab tests, the Dallas Morning News reported. The shocking revelation, culled from Duncan's medical records that were given to the Associated Press, is just the latest report of shortcomings in the protection of hospital workers who were looking after America's Ebola 'patient zero.' Combined, they paint a picture of how two nurses might have become infected with the deadly virus, despite claims that the hospital staff were the 'best in the world' and taking every precaution. Proper protection: These nurses at Bellevue Hospital in New York City demonstrated the garb needed to protect nurses treating Ebola patients during a drill. Exposed: This picture of a nurse at Presbyterian Hospital transporting a Dallas County sheriff's deputy who feared he had Ebola last week, shows that the protective garb exposes the neck below the face mask. On Tuesday, the National Nurses Union revealed that several nurses from Presbyterian Hospital had come to them with reports that, among other things: some supervisors told hospital staff that masks were not necessary when dealing with Duncan, that gloves and face masks left skin partially exposed and that Duncan was not isolated for hours after being taken to the hospital. RoseAnn DeMoro, director of the union, blasted the Centers of Disease Control for seemingly blaming the nurses for their own infections. 'Our nurses are not protected, they're not prepared to handle Ebola or any other pandemics,' she said on Tuesday. 'The protocols that should have been in place in Dallas were not in place and are not in place anywhere in the United States, as far as we can tell.' Hospital investigators are focusing on September 28 - the day Duncan was admitted - to September 30 - the day that Ebola was confirmed - as a likely window for both Ms Pham and Ms Vinson being infected, the Morning News reports. Lapses: The National Nurses Union says nurses at Texas Presbyterian Hospital have reported that protective suits left their necks exposed below the face mask. Gloves were not tapped to protective suits, exposing wrists and hands to exposure from bodily fluids. Shockingly, some supervisors reportedly told nurses that they didn't need protective masks at all. Ms DeMoro and co-director Deborah Burger revealed that nurses from Texas Presbyterian Hospital have reported several grievous lapses in protection for healthcare workers who looked after Duncan. The union, which does not represent any of the nurses at Texas Presbyterian, said the healthcare workers came to them because they believed they had no other way to report the dangerous security lapses. The startling claims include:. Ebola is a virus that spreads by touching the blood, sweat, saliva or other bodily fluids of an infected person. Even a small amount of infected fluid on the skin can cause an infection. All of the Americans who have contracted the disease, including trained healthcare workers who were in Liberia, have said they took meticulous precautions to protect themselves and have no idea how or when they became infected. The nursing union says that Thomas Eric Duncan was left in an open area of a Dallas emergency room for hours, and the nurses treating him worked for days without proper protective gear and faced constantly changing protocols. It says nurses were also forced to use medical tape to secure openings in their flimsy garments, worried that their necks and heads were exposed as they cared for a patient with explosive diarrhea and projectile vomiting. They also make the frightening allegation that nurses treating Duncan were also caring for other patients in the hospital at the same time. Burger convened a conference call with reporters to relay what she said were concerns of nurses at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital, where Thomas Eric Duncan - the first person to be diagnosed with Ebola in the U.S. - died last week. RoseAnn DeMoro, executive director of Nurses United, said the statement came from 'several' nurses, but she refused repeated inquiries to state how many. She said the organization had vetted the claims, and that the nurses cited were in a position to know what had occurred at the hospital. She refused to elaborate. Nurses say 'the guidelines were constantly changing' at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital - and claims hazardous waste was left to pile to the ceiling in the room that Duncan was being treated. The emergency entrance to Texas Health Presbyterian hospital in Dallas. Hospital officials have said they are no longer accepting new patients at this time after a healthcare worker, who was caring for Ebola patient Thomas Eric Duncan, tested positive for the disease. Speaking at the hastily arranged press conference call on Tuesday, DeMoro and union co-director Deborah Burger alleged an unprofessional and careless approach to Ebola at Texas Health Presbyterian hospital. Ultimately, according to DeMoro and Burger, the nurses feel 'unsupported, unprepared, lied to and deserted', especially in light of CDC Director Thomas Frieden's assertion that a 'breach in protocol' led 26-year-old nurse Nina Pham to become infected. 'This nurse was being blamed for not following protocols that did not exist. ... The nurses in that hospital were very angry, and they decided to contact us,' DeMoro said. Texas Health Presbyterian spokesman Wendell Watson denied all of these allegations from the nurses union. 'We have numerous measures in place to provide a safe working environment, including mandatory annual training and a 24-7 hotline and other mechanisms that allow for anonymous reporting,' Watson said in a written statement. Pham treated Duncan from the day he was admitted to the hospital, to when he died last Wednesday. She carefully monitored her temperature and went to the hospital on Friday when she noticed a spike. On Tuesday, her condition was upgraded from 'stable' to 'good'.

Euronymous returns home and finds the body but instead of calling the police, he takes photos of the body and moves the knife and shotgun around. After Dead's body is taken away, Euronymous gives necklaces to the other band members which he claims are pieces of Dead's skull; this disgusts Necrobutcher, prompting him to leave the band.

Write some highlights for the following article: By. Hugo Gye. UPDATED:. 09:18 EST, 9 September 2011. MPs from Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland may be barred from voting on laws which only affect England, as the Government moves to tackle the thorny 'West Lothian question' for the first time. An independent commission will be set up to consider the issue, which was first raised 34 years ago by Tam Dalyell, the Labour MP for West Lothian. The question has become more pertinent since the advent of devolution in 1997, when separate administrations were set up for Scotland and Wales. Parliament: MPs from Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland could be barred from voting on England-only legislation. Since then a large number of policy issues, particularly relating to public services, have been devolved to the Scottish Parliament, Welsh Assembly and Northern Ireland Assembly. English MPs sitting at Westminster have no say over the policies set outside of English borders. However, English policies on issues like education and healthcare are still decided by the UK Parliament, and are voted on by MPs who make up the chamber meaning they can come from all the countries of the Union. In 1977, Tam Dalyell, pictured above, the Labour MP for West Lothian, pointed out that Scottish devolution could mean Scottish MPs voting on English affairs, with English MPs unable to vote on Scottish affairs. In response, controversial right-wing MP Enoch Powell said: 'Let us call it the West Lothian question.' The introduction of Scots and Welsh devolution in 1997 meant that responsibility for many policy areas was taken out of the hands of Westminster, but that MPs from those countries could still vote on purely English issues. Solutions which have been suggested for the problem include the establishment of a purely English parliament, and banning Scottish MPs from votes which do not affect their constituents. However, every possible answer has its drawbacks, and none has been very widely accepted despite it being an issue which has rumbled on for 34 years. Since devolution, there have been growing calls for 'English votes for English laws', so that MPs should no longer be able to vote on laws which will not apply in their consistuencies. The controversial voting issue became particularly heated in 2004, when Labour's policy on top-up fees was passed only with the support of Scottish MPs, even though the controversial policy did not apply in Scotland. Now after 34 years the current Government is determined to take action to end the anomaly. Constitutional reform minister Mark Harper announced in a statement to MPs that a formal proposal for the commission's work, and its terms of references, will be announced soon after Parliament returns from the party conference season. It will be made up of a small group of non-partisan experts with constitutional, legal and parliamentary expertise. Their primary task will be to examine how the Westminster Parliament can 'deal most effectively with business that affects England wholly or primarily, when at the same time similar matters in some or all of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are lawfully and democratically the responsibility of the separate parliament or assemblies,' Mr Harper said. Ministers will consult with Commons Speaker John Bercow and other parliamentary authorities before the launch of the commission, he added. All political parties will be given 'a full opportunity to have their say' following the completion of the commission's work. The commission will not consider the funding of different parts of the UK, nor the balance between English, Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish MPs in the House of Commons. Plaid Cymru MP Elfyn Llwyd said: 'England deserves to have its own administration to deal with issues which affect England only. 'This would then ensure that there is a clear distinction between what is a matter for England and what is a matter for other countries too. The lines are too blurred as they are.'","completion":"This article talks about a problem called the \\"West Lothian question\\". It's about how members of Parliament (MPs) from Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland can vote on laws that only affect England, but English MPs can't vote on laws that only affect those other countries. This problem started 34 years ago and has become more important since 1997 when separate governments were set up for Scotland and Wales. Now the government wants to create an independent commission to find a solution for this problem. Some people think there should be a separate English parliament, or that MPs from Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland shouldn't be allowed to vote on laws that don't affect their own areas. The commission will be made up of experts who will talk to lots of different people and try to come up with a good way to handle this problem. They won't be looking at things like how much money each part of the UK gets, or how many MPs there are from each area, just at how voting on laws can work better for everyone."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Summarize the following: For grinding, attach grinding stones which can be fixed to the mandrel/shaft. Slide the grinding stone into the front of the tool where it is fully inserted and tighten. Turn your Dremel on and grind on a low setting so you don't overheat the material. Gently hold the grinding stone against the material until it wears down. You can use grinding stones, grinding wheels, chain saw sharpening stones, abrasive wheels and abrasive points to grind a material. Carbide bits tend to work best on metal, porcelain, or ceramic. Use cylindrical or triangular tips for round grinds. To grind a notch into something or grind an inside corner, use a flat disc shape. Or, use cylindrical or triangular tips for round grinds. Select a sandpaper bit and secure it in your Dremel. Sandpaper bits are available in fine through course grits, and all grades should fit on the same mandrel. Tighten the screw at the end of the sandpaper bit. Turn on your Dremel and set it between 2 and 10. Choose lower settings if you're sanding or polishing plastics or woods. Select a higher setting if you're sanding metal. While holding the material secure, run the bit across the material so that the sandpaper bit completely comes into contact with your material and sharpens or sands it. Make sure that the sanding bits are in good shape so they don't scuff or mark your material. They should fit in the drill snugly and shouldn't be worn. Have several sanding bits on hand so you can quickly replace them. To sand, you can use sanding bands, sanding discs, flap wheels, shaping wheels and finishing and detail abrasive brushes. If you've got a big job, begin with coarser bits before moving to softer bits. This can help you sand out larger scratches quickly and then you can have more control over working through the material. If you skip the coarse bit and begin with a softer bit, it will take you longer and you'll wear out the softer bit. Check the bit every minute or two to see if the bit is worn or torn. Remember to turn off and unplug the Dremel while you do this. The Dremel is an excellent tool for fine-detail polishing or polishing in tight spots. Rub a polishing compound over the surface of your object and fit your Dremel with a felt polishing tip or wheel. Start your drill at a low speed (2) and run it against the polishing compound. You should work the wheel in circles until the material is polished. Avoid using a much higher speed (don't go over 4). You can polish without using a compound, but you'll get shinier results with it. For cleaning and polishing jobs, use rubber polishing points, cloth or felt polishing wheels, and polishing brushes. Be sure to get the right kind of coarse polishing brush for the job. These bits are good for taking old paint off of metal furniture or cleaning up tools and grills.","completion":"To grind and sand things with a special tool called Dremel, you need to attach different parts to it, like grinding stones or sandpaper bits.

For sanding, use the right type of sandpaper and always check if it's in good shape. You can also use the Dremel to make things shiny, by using a felt part and some special polish.

Given the question: This article: Thomson was largely self-taught. His experiences as a graphic designer with Toronto's Grip Ltd. honed his draughtsmanship. Although he began painting and drawing at an early age, it was only in 1912, when he was well into his thirties, that he began to paint seriously. His first trips to Algonquin Park inspired him to follow the lead of fellow artists in producing oil sketches of natural scenes on small, rectangular panels for easy portability while travelling. Between 1912 and his death in 1917, Thomson produced hundreds of these small sketches, many of which are now considered works in their own right, and are mostly found in the Art Gallery of Ontario in Toronto, the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa, the McMichael Canadian Art Collection in Kleinburg and the Tom Thomson Art Gallery in Owen Sound.Thomson produced nearly all of his works between 1912 and 1917. Most of his large canvases were completed in his most productive period, from late 1916 to early 1917. The patronage of James MacCallum enabled Thomson's transition from graphic designer to professional painter. Although the Group of Seven was not founded until after his death, his work was sympathetic to that of group members A. Y. Jackson, Frederick Varley, and Arthur Lismer. These artists shared an appreciation for rugged, unkempt natural scenery, and all used broad brush strokes and a liberal application of paint to capture the beauty and colour of the Ontario landscape. Thomson's art also bears some stylistic resemblance to the work of European post-impressionists such as Vincent van Gogh. Other key influences were the Art Nouveau and Arts and Crafts movements of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, styles with which he became familiar while working in the graphic arts. contains an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person whose art also bears some stylistic resemblance to the work of European post-impressionists such as Vincent van Gogh?, what is it ?

Royce said that \\"by shutting down North Korea's illicit activities, we deprive the Kim regime of the money he needs to pay his generals and to conduct nuclear weapons research.\\" Royce also argued that \\"North Korea is undoubtedly one of the most significant security threats that we here face and our allies face.\\" On June 27, 2013, Royce introduced the Electrify Africa Act of 2013 (H.R. 2548; 113th Congress), a bill that would direct the President to establish a multiyear strategy to assist countries in sub-Saharan Africa develop an appropriate mix of power solutions to provide sufficient electricity access to people living in rural and urban areas in order to alleviate poverty and drive economic growth. On November 13, 2013, Royce introduced the Taiwan Relations Act Affirmation and Naval Vessel Transfer Act of 2014 (H.R. 3470; 113th Congress) into the House. The bill would allow the sale of several Oliver Hazard Perry-class frigates to Mexico, Thailand, and Taiwan. Four naval vessels would be sold to Taiwan for about 10 million each. Mexico and Thailand would each receive two vessels as a grant. Royce argued in favor of the bill saying that \\"these ships would bolster Taiwan's defense.\\" Royce also said that \\"these transfers help support the priorities of the U.S. Navy while strengthening the capability of allies and our close partners to meet our share maritime security objectives.\\" Question: In what year did he have dealing with the poverty?

Write highlights for this article: Beach bums beware: 10% of water samples collected from U.S. beaches failed to meet the government benchmark for swimmer safety, according to a new report. It's an icky thought, especially considering the popularity of several of the failing beaches included in the Natural Resources Defense Council's 24th annual \\"Testing the Waters\\" report. Beach choices matter: the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency estimates up to 3.5 million people become ill from poor water treatment each year, largely because of contact with \\"raw sewage from sanitary overflows.\\" \\"Sewage and contaminated runoff in the water should never ruin a family beach trip,\\" said NRDC senior attorney Jon Devine in a statement. \\"But no matter where you live, urban slobber and other pollution can seriously compromise the water quality at your favorite beach and make your family sick.\\" So which beaches are \\"superstars\\" and which are \\"repeat offenders\\"? Here's the good, the bad and the ugly. The good. At 4%, the eastern coastline comprised of beaches in Delaware, Maryland and Virginia boasts the lowest failure rate of beach water samples in the country. All samples were tested against the new EPA water quality standard, called the \\"Beach Action Value.\\" For individual states, Delaware, New Jersey and New Hampshire tied for the top marks, each with a 3% failure rate. Additionally, the NRDC selected 35 beaches as \\"superstars\\" -- meaning popular spots that consistently meet water quality safety thresholds. These locations spanned 14 states and showed at least a 98% water safety record over five years:. -- Alabama: Gulf Shores Public Beach in Baldwin County, Gulf State Park Pavilion in Baldwin County, Dauphin Island Public Beach. -- California: Newport Beach in Orange County (one of three monitored sections). -- Delaware: Dewey Beach-Swedes in Sussex County. -- Florida: Bowman's Beach in Lee County, Coquina Beach South in Manatee County, Fort De Soto North Beach in Pinellas County. -- Georgia: Tybee Island North in Chatham County. -- Hawaii: Hapuna Beach State Recreation Area on the Big Island, Po'ipu Beach Park on Kauai, Wailea Beach Park on Maui. -- Massachusetts: Singing Beach in Essex County. -- Maryland: Point Lookout State Park in St Mary's County, Assateague State Park in Worcester County. -- North Carolina: Ocean Pier at Main Street and Sunset Boulevard in Brunswick County, Beach at Cape Hatteras Lighthouse in Dare County, Ocean Pier at Salisbury Street at Wrightsville Beach in New Hanover County, Ocean Pier at Ocean Boulevard and Crews Avenue in Topsail Beach in Pender County. -- New Hampshire: Hampton Beach State Park in Rockingham County, Wallis Sands Beach at Wallis Road in Rockingham County, Wallis Sands State Park in Rockingham County. -- New Jersey: Washington (Margate) in Atlantic County, 40th Street (Avalon) in Cape May County, 40th Street (Sea Isle City) in Cape May County, Stone Harbor at 96th Street in Cape May County, Upper Township at Webster Road in Cape May County, Wildwood Crest at Orchid in Cape May County, Broadway (Point Pleasant Beach) in Ocean County. -- New York: Long Beach City in Nassau County. -- Virginia: Virginia Beach at 28th Street in Virginia Beach County, Virginia Beach at 45th Street in Virginia Beach County, Back Bay Beach in Virginia Beach County, Virginia Beach -- Little Island Beach North in Virginia Beach County. -- Washington: Westhaven State Park, South Jetty in Grays Harbor. The bad. The new \\"Beach Action Value\\" resulted in a significant increase in failure rates in 2013, especially in certain states. The Great Lakes region had the highest rate of beach water impurities, with 13% of all samples failing to pass safety standards. The region was also home to the worst individual state offender, Ohio, which posted a 35% failure rate. Next closest states were Alaska and Mississippi, with 24% and 21% failure, respectively. Under the old, less-stringent standard, 7% to 8% of beaches failed to meet water quality standards. This year, the number jumped to 10%. The report detailed the disastrous effects swimming in infected waters could have. \\"Beach water pollution nationwide causes a range of waterborne illnesses in swimmers including stomach flu, skin rashes, pinkeye, ear, nose and throat problems, dysentery, hepatitis ... and other serious health problems,\\" it said. \\"For senior citizens, small children and people with weak immune systems, the results can even be fatal.\\" The ugly. Some beaches just don't get the hint. Over the past five years of analyzing over 3,500 beach water samples, the NRDC has identified 17 U.S. beaches that have \\"consistent contamination problems.\\" To qualify for this \\"repeat offender\\" list, a beach has failed to meet public standards for water quality more than 25% of the time since 2009 -- a dubious distinction. Here they are:. -- California: Malibu Pier, 50 yards east of the pier, in Los Angeles County. -- Indiana: Jeorse Park Beach in Lake County (both monitored sections): Lake Jeorse Park Beach I, Lake Jeorse Park Beach II. -- Massachusetts: Cockle Cove Creek in Barnstable County. -- Maine: Goodies Beach in Knox County. -- New Jersey: Beachwood Beach in Ocean County. -- New York: Main Street Beach in Chautauqua County, Wright Park -- East in Chautauqua County, Ontario Beach in Monroe County. -- Ohio: Lakeshore Park in Ashtabula County, Arcadia Beach in Cuyahoga County, Euclid State Park in Cuyahoga County, Noble Beach in Cuyahoga County, Sims Beach in Cuyahoga County, Villa Angela State Park in Cuyahoga County, Edson Creek in Erie County. -- Wisconsin: South Shore Beach in Milwaukee County. What you can do. Strictly swimming in \\"superstar\\" beaches would be a plus, but the NRDC has other recommendations on how to remain safe in troubled waters. Here are two suggestions:. -- \\"Stay away from beaches with visible discharge pipes and avoid swimming at urban beaches after a heavy rainfall.\\" -- \\"A good rule of thumb is to avoid swimming at the beach for at least 24 hours after it rains and 72 hours after heavy rains.\\" For the full list of tested waters, policy recommendations to improve quality and a ZIP code searchable map, go to http://www.nrdc.org/beaches.","completion":"- A new report finds that 10% of water samples collected from U.S. beaches failed to meet the government benchmark for swimmer safety. - Up to 3.5 million people become ill from poor water treatment each year, largely due to contact with raw sewage. - Top performing states, with only a 3% failure rate, included Delaware, New Jersey, and New Hampshire. - The Great Lakes region had the highest rate of beach water impurities, with Ohio being the worst individual state offender, with a 35% failure rate. - Swimming in contaminated waters can cause a range of illnesses, including stomach flu, skin rashes, pinkeye, ear, nose, and throat problems, dysentery, hepatitis, and other serious health problems. - The Natural Resources Defense Council identifies 17 U.S. beaches with consistent contamination problems and provides recommendations on how to remain safe in troubled waters."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Who defeats the alien Movie title: Predator Movie plot: Dutch (Arnold Schwarzenegger) and his elite commando team arrive in an unnamed Central American country. They meet a general, Phillips, whom Dutch has worked for in the past, and with a CIA agent, Dillon (Carl Weathers), whom Dutch also knows. Dillon tells Dutch that a high-ranking \\"cabinet minister\\" traveling by helicopter nearby has gone missing in the jungle, presumably shot down by a rebel guerrilla group operating in the area. Dutch's team has been charged with going over the border and into rebel territory to rescue the man.Dutch's team are dropped into the jungle by helicopter and they hike toward the rebel camp. En route, they find the downed helicopter. Dutch's tracker, Billy (Sonny Landham), is able to determine that the rebels indeed took the cabinet minister away but another group of men also passed through, likely more American soldiers. Later, Billy senses something wrong nearby and finds the bodies of three men who have been flayed and hung upside-down. In a pile of entrails, another of Dutch's men, Mac (Bill Duke), finds a set of dog tags. Dutch recognizes the name on them; Jim Hopper, a Green Beret. Dutch is puzzled and looks to Dillon for information; Dillon says he knows nothing about another team.The team arrives at the rebel camp without being detected. Dutch and his team destroy the camp in an all-out assault and kill all the rebels. There are no hostages alive (Dutch sees a rebel execute one), however, Dutch finds a lone, terrified girl, Anna (Elpidia Carrillo). They take her along as a prisoner. Dutch realizes they have been set up and confronts Dillon. Dillon confirms that Dutch and his team were merely pawns to destroy the camp and its men. With no choice, the team heads to the chopper pick-up point.

Dutch eventually faces the Predator in a one-on-one confrontation, where he lures the creature into a trap he constructed using a log and counterweight system. The trap crushes the Predator, critically injuring it. In its final moments, the Predator activates a self-destruct mechanism and Dutch barely manages to escape the blast radius before the explosion.

D'Angelo was born Michael Eugene Archer, in Richmond, Virginia on February 11, 1974, to a Pentecostal preacher father. He was raised in an entirely Pentecostal family. Archer's musical talents were discovered very early on. At 3, he was spotted by his 10-year-old brother Luther, playing the house piano. D'Angelo signed a publishing deal with EMI Music in 1991 after catching the attention of record executives through a demo tape, which was originally by the group. After an impressive audition for EMI execs, a three-hour impromptu piano recital, D'Angelo was signed to a recording contract in 1993. A&R-man Gary Harris was primarily responsible for his signing, while manager Kedar Massenburg helped negotiate the contract as well. Massenburg became D'Angelo's manager after hearing of him through \\"the buzz on the streets\\". He had previously managed hip hop group Stetsasonic and formed the artist management-firm Kedar Entertainment in 1991, which he diversified into production, music publishing and publicity. In 1994, his first significant success came in the form of the hit single \\"U Will Know\\". D'Angelo co-wrote and co-produced the song for the all-male R&B supergroup Black Men United, which featured R&B singers such as Brian McKnight, Usher, R. Kelly, Boyz II Men, Raphael Saadiq and Gerald Levert. D'Angelo composed the music for \\"U Will Know\\", while his brother, Luther Archer, wrote the lyrics. Originally featured on the soundtrack to the film Jason's Lyric (1994), the single peaked at number 5 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks and at number 28 on the Billboard Hot 100. The music video for \\"U Will Know\\" featured D'Angelo as the group's choir director; he reprised the role for the live performance of the song at the Soul Train Music Awards. That same year, he wrote and produced the song \\"Overjoyed\\" for the Boys Choir of Harlem, which appeared on their studio album The Sound of Hope (1994). The success of \\"U Will Know\\" helped build the buzz surrounding D'Angelo, which was followed by a number of highly promoted showcases, and added to the buzz among music industry insiders. Brown Sugar was released in June 1995. Although sales were sluggish at first, the album was eventually a hit.

I hope so, because this is a good one: I was 21 years old. I worked for a major commercial airline. A friend of mine and I decided to go to Puerto Rico for a long weekend. It was our first trip to Puerto Rico. The hotel at which we stayed had a lovely (classy/expensive) restaurant serving continental fare. So, we decided to have our first dinner there. We dressed to the nines. Our hair and makeup were perfect. I had fake fingernails (not acrylic - those were fairly new back then. I had the type one glues on). Those fingernails were long, and painted a very bright - and obvious - red. When the waiter came to take our drink order, we both ordered glasses of wine. The waiter brought the wine, set it down on the table, and waited to take our meal orders. I smoked back then, and at the time, smoking was still allowed in restaurants. In a 21-year-old attempt to look classy and sophisticated, at that moment I took out a cigarette, put it between my lips, picked up my lighter, and lit my cigarette - or so I thought. Unfortunately, my long, red, fake thumbnail got in the way of the flame, and it caught on fire. The waiter’s mouth dropped open, his eyes wide. He froze in place. I was horrified. The flame was literally shooting up from my nail! And smoke; the nail was plastic! Quickly scanning the table for the closest thing with which I could extinguish the flame, I spied my glass of wine. As nonchalantly as possible, I stuck my thumb in the glass. There was a sizzle as the flaming nail hit the wine. When I withdrew my thumb from the glass, the nail was melted, black, and curled under. Ever the professional, the waiter regained his composure and proceeded to take our orders without missing a beat - but I’m sure I was the talk of the kitchen for the rest of the evening.

[B]. yes.","completion":"[B]. yes. \\"La Belle Dame sans Merci\\" is indeed a ballad, as mentioned in the text provided. Written by the English poet John Keats in 1819, this narrative poem adheres to the traditional form of a ballad, a genre known for relating a story or tale in verse usually through the use of quatrains (four-line stanzas). The ballad form is designed to be rhythmic and repetitive, ideal for memorization and singing, with the story in the poem often dramatic or emotional, and it's usually told through dialogue and action. This all holds true to the structure and essence of \\"La Belle Dame sans Merci\\". The fact that it exists in two versions with minor differences does not deter from its classification as a ballad. Interestingly, Keats borrowed the title from the 15th-century piece called \\"La Belle Dame sans Mercy\\" by Alain Chartier.

The problem is that I can't abide the giant attitude we get from Walter, the Mau00eetre d. It has ruined the last few experiences for me. Yes, the food is good, but not nearly as good as Rao's, Las Vegas, where Carla Pellegrino worked before. I have never seen her at Bratalian in my six or more visits, but her name is on the sign. I guess her various attempts at being a celebrity chef are more important than actually being at the restaurant where she is executive chef, but I won't get too into her career here. Who knows... maybe she's hiding in the back?? I don't know if it's that they just don't get the same quality product, but it just isn't as good as Rao's, despite \\"borrowing\\" several dishes from the world-famous Italian eatery. The meatballs, the pork chop, the salads... pretty good, but not quite as good, despite the same recipe and same executive chef. That said, it's way more affordable than Rao's, so I guess you get what you pay for! I often order the pork chop with cherry peppers, and it's pretty good, but usually quite dry. I recently had the same dish at Rao's, and learned what it is supposed to be. The waiter at Rao's suggested I order it medium, so I did. It was the best pork chop I have ever eaten. Next trip back to Bratalian, I asked Walter to bring one cooked to medium, which was met with an incredulous, \\"OH NOOO!!!!! we have to cook pork all the way through until it's white!\\" How DARE I suggest such a stupid, stupid thing! Really, dude? his comment, and misled belief demonstrates that he just doesn't know about fine food like he pretends to... Italian or otherwise. While his demeanor might suffice for the front of house, seating people, he could stand to learn a little about food if he intends to wait tables as well. Thank God he isn't cooking!! He went so far as to say, \\"We cannot be responsible for what might happen if you order pork medium.\\" What, is he afraid of? Trichinosis? This isn't 1979, and pork is no longer \\"the new white meat\\". Even the USDA has relaxed their guidelines for the safe cooking temp of pork. Any fine restaurant with good product will serve pork a little pink. If it isn't served that way, it's over-cooked in my opinion. Despite the table side debate, and Walter agreeing to have it cooked to medium, this pork chop was delivered well-done as usual. If food were enough, I would go back. It's not. The biggest negative issue I have with this restaurant is the arrogance. I don't know if Walter is part owner, or what, but he must be, because no hired employee would be so smug. He acts like he's doing us a huge favor by affording us the privilege of eating in his restaurant.

She was just trying to help make this a better experience for everyone, but Walter seemed to take this as a personal affront, and dismissed her, appearing very insulted. He told her there was nothing that could be done in his typical \\"how-dare-you-make-a-suggestion-you-idiot-American\\" tone. The next time we came back, he had a palpable attitude toward us. Though he tries to hide behind a paper thin veneer of a positive laid back guy, his true colors come shining through. This should have been the last straw for us, but our friends and neighbors like the place, so we went back one more time with them.

On one hand, the reviewer appreciates the food quality and finds it pretty good by stating it's more affordable than Rao's and pointing out the dishes they have tried. However, the sentiment is predominantly negative due to the strong emphasis on the unpleasant experiences with Walter, the Maître d'. The reviewer expresses dissatisfaction with Walter's attitude, knowledge about food, and reaction to their suggestions. Moreover, the comparison with other Italian fine dining options such as Gaetano's and Ventano's also showcases a negative sentiment towards Bratalian, as the reviewer highlights better food and customer service in those establishments. Overall, the sentiment of the review leans heavily towards the negative side, with some minor positive aspects, on the account of good food."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Review: I've been waiting for a superhero movie like this for a long time. \\"Mystery Men\\" takes its place among the classic comic-strip spoofs on TV like \\"Batman\\" and \\"Captain Nice\\" and cartoons like \\"Underdog\\" and \\"Super Chicken.\\" The same spirit lives in all of them: the comic tongue-in-cheek tone; the courage to aim for the heroic in life at the risk of looking ridiculous; the not-so-sure-footed way that these characters manage to prevail over their adversaries. It's the misfired spark of nobility igniting in the weak and the ordinary, and it's wonderful to see it glow so high and bright here. \\"Mystery Men\\" opens on a party at a nursing home. I wish Kinka Usher had had the sense to give more energy and life to the old people in the scene. As it is, it looks like something George Romero might have devised. We need to get the feeling that these old people are as sharp as everyone else, or it feels patronizing. By the time the Red Eyes crash the festivities, you half expect Tom Waits who plays a weapons inventor with a penchant for ladies in their eighties to stand up and shout: \\"Just what this party needs--a little excitement!\\" If writer Neil Cuthbert had any sense, he would have had Waits mixing it up with the intruders and egging on the partiers to do the same. It would have made for a rousing beginning, and a better introduction of the troublesome trio: the Shoveler (William Macy); the Blue Raja (Hank Azaria); and Mr. Furious (Ben Stiller), who seem to come out of nowhere to save the day. There are many other problems to \\"Mystery Men\\" than I care to go into; among them that the villain Casanova Frankenstein needs to have as cultivated a sense of the absurd as the rest of the people in this movie, and he doesn't. Geoffrey Rush is the wrong actor for the part; he needs to be way over the top to make the conflict between good and evil a galvanic one. And Rush has never exhibited a talent for the outre. You hope for the ripe theatrics of a John Lithgow in \\"The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai\\" or the dry, debonair diffidence of a Paul Freeman in \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark.\\" Instead what we get is pastiche; something half-baked and not fully realized. There are too many ideas running through \\"Mystery Men\\" for anyone to tie them neatly together, and that may be its deepest problem. But whatever kind of a mess it is is the kind of mess I love. Ben Stiller has always seemed to be slumming in the roles he takes. This one is no exception, but he goes at it with such conviction that you come away feeling that he'd learned something about comedy growing up in a household run by Jerry Stiller and Anne Meara. His Roy is related to all the put-upon, overly sensitive, chronically defensive types that Woody Allen made popular. And whether it's wheedling his way into the affections of the waitress at his favorite hangout (the sleek Claire Forslani), or questioning the wisdom of a fellow superhero (Wes Studi as the Sphinx), or giving a new member of their \\"elite\\" group (Jeaneane Garofalo in what are possibly her funniest moments on screen) a hard time, he makes it always fun to watch. I couldn't exactly say that about him in \\"There's Something About Mary.\\" Jeaneane Garofalo proves with this performance that she should have been the star of \\"One True Thing,\\" not Renee Zellweger. I don't think I have ever seen funnier exchanges between a daughter and father (okay, so he's dead and his skull is in a bowling ball, so sue me) in the movies. And the funny part about this role is that it feels like a screwball reprise of Emily Watson's spellbinding talks with God in \\"Breaking the Waves.\\" And in this version, the girl doesn't die, and bells don't ring in your head. William H. Macy does something very difficult; he makes stolid magnetic. You understand right away what's attracted Jenifer Lewis' Lucille to Eddie. You can also understand her exasperation. The barbecue alone would be enough to drive me over the edge, but when Eddie's adorable, half-breed son looks up at his father and says \\"I believe in you, Daddy.\\" to which Lucille sighs and exclaims, \\"Roland, don't encourage your father,\\" you feel like standing and hailing Neil Cuthbert as a first-rate wit. With Hank Azaria (whose only moment of note in film up to this point was his bare behind in \\"The Birdcage\\") and Louise Lasser (Has it been more than two decades since we first took note of her in \\"Bananas\\" and \\"Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman?\\") as son and mother who share a fondness for silverware; Greg Kinnear as Captain Amazing and Ricky Jay as his publicist; Kel Mitchell as \\"Invisible Boy\\"; Paul Reubens as \\"The Spleen;\\" and Lena Olin who, if she didn't have the few lines in this movie that she has, would seem to be visiting the set.

(CNN) -- Two Mexican nationals were charged Monday in the death of a U.S. Coast Guardsman, whose succumbed to a traumatic head injury after his boat was rammed off the Southern California coast. The suspects -- Jose Meija-Leyva and Manuel Beltran-Higuera -- are charged with killing a U.S. government officer while that officer was on duty in the death of Chief Petty Officer Terrell Horne III, the U.S. attorney's office for the central district of California said in a news release. Neither man was asked to enter a plea when they appeared Monday afternoon in federal court, where Magistrate Judge Victor Kenton ordered them held without bond, U.S. attorney's office spokesman Thom Mrozek said. A preliminary hearing is set for December 17, and their arraignment is set for December 21. The same day the two suspects were in court, colleagues of Horne remembered him as a devoted","completion":"husband, father, and dedicated Coast Guardsman, who selflessly served his country for over 20 years. Fellow officers and friends gathered at a memorial service to pay their respects and honor Horne's memory. The incident that led to Horne's death occurred when the Coast Guard received a tip about possible drug smuggling in the area on December 7. A pursuit ensued, during which the suspects' boat reportedly struck the Coast Guard vessel, causing Horne to sustain the fatal head injury as a result of the impact. As the investigation into the incident continues, U.S. Attorney Nick Hanna emphasized the gravity of the charges, stating that both Meija-Leyva and Beltran-Higuera face a possible life sentence or even the death penalty if convicted. Hanna went on to say that the U.S. government will continue to work alongside its Mexican counterparts to ensure that justice is served and that similar crimes are prevented in the future. In the meantime, the U.S. Coast Guard has increased patrols and surveillance in the area, as part of ongoing efforts to combat drug smuggling and illegal maritime activities along the Southern California coast. The tragic loss of Chief Petty Officer Terrell Horne III serves as a stark reminder of the danger faced by those in service to their country, as well as the urgent need for international cooperation in addressing these persistent threats.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Dabo Swinney: Cole Stoudt to be Clemson's starting QB Updated APR 15, 2014 3:28p ET The three-man quarterback battle at Clemson is now down to one. In a phone conversation Tuesday morning, head coach Dabo Swinney told Fox Sports that Cole Stoudt will officially be named the starter when he addresses his team at a meeting next Monday morning. \\"It should be pretty obvious that he won the job,” Swinney said. “He's a great leader who is highly respected by his teammates. He never once complained. He was always ready when we needed him. He's earned it and he will be named the starter.\\" The quarterback competition was between Stoudt, who backed up Tajh Boyd backup last season, Chad Kelly (third string in 2013) and dynamic true freshman Deshaun Watson. But Swinney dismissed Kelly from the program on Monday for \\"conduct detrimental to our program,\\" and Watson recently suffered a collarbone injury that kept him out of the spring game. While Watson will continue to learn the system and develop into the quarterback of Clemson’s future, it is Stoudt who will take the reins to begin 2014. I was at Clemson's spring game last weekend, where Stoudt stood out, and here are a few positive attributes that caught my attention: At 6-foot-5, Stoudt stands tall in the pocket and has great vision of the field. His height alone sometimes allows him to have passing lanes that shorter quarterbacks may not have. Stoudt also has the ability to be a weapon on the ground as well. While Clemson ran the ball on only about one-third of its snaps last year, the read option is one of offensive coordinator Chad Morris’ most potent tactics. The Tigers have a run-first mentality on offense, using the run game to set up the pass, and that will be enhanced with Stoudt. “The thing that people might not realize about Cole is that he actually runs better than Tajh,” Swinney told me. “He may be tall and appear to be a bit gangly, but he can run really well.” Stoudt’s accuracy in the spring game was impressive. He went 15 of 23 passing, despite the pressure from an aggressive pass rush and having extremely small windows in which to hit receivers. He can hit the deep dig. He can hit the honey hole versus Cover 2 -- the sweet spot on the sideline between the corner sinking back and the safety over the top. Stoudt showed the ability to make great decisions, which comes from an in-depth understanding of Morris’ offense. While Clemson didn’t show many elaborate schemes or coverages in the spring game, Stoudt was quick to analyze the defense and determine which coverage it was playing. He displayed the ability to know if, when and where a wide receiver will be open based on what the defense showed him. \\"The thing I like about Cole is that he's very disciplined,” Swinney said. “He lives by the motto that, ‘You don't ever go broke by making a profit.’ If it's just a simple check down that the defense will give him, he will take it. He doesn’t force anything, he'll just keep moving the chains.” Swinney noted that unfortunately for Stoudt, he had to be a reserve for his first three seasons at Clemson and is now left with only one remaining year of eligibility. “But it has prepared him,” Swinney said. “He’s a little bit of a gamer, too.” There’s no more waiting for Stoudt or Clemson fans now – they know who will be leading the Tigers into Athens, Ga., to face the Bulldogs on Aug. 30.

Output:","completion":"Part 1: Identify the numbers in the text and their corresponding meaning. Usage: 4 books a day, 6 weeks. The numbers 4 and 6 are mentioned in the text. 4 books a day represent the number of books John reads each day, and 6 weeks represent the duration for which we need to calculate the total number of books he reads. Part 2: Understand the time frame and frequency of reading. Usage: John reads every Monday and Tuesday. This part tells us that John reads books only on two specific days of the week, every Monday and Tuesday. Part 3: Calculate the total number of reading days in the given time frame. Usage: 6 weeks * 2 days per week = 12 total reading days. Since John reads on 2 days a week and the question asks for 6 weeks, we can multiply these numbers to find out that John will have 12 reading days in total. Part 4: Apply addition or subtraction mathematical operators to find the final numerical answer. Usage: 12 reading days * 4 books a day = 48 books. Since there are 12 reading days and John can read 4 books a day, we apply multiplication to find the total number of books John reads in 6 weeks, which is 48 books.

Police converge on the night club, but the officers, including tough but cynical NYPD cop Lieutenant John Moss (James Woods), are unable to stop the gunshot killing of an innocent person. The Party Crasher flees in the ensuing chaos, and Moss is thrown off a car while trying to stop the killer. While Moss has his injuries tended to, he barks some obscene comments at media members and cameras. In Hollywood, Nick Lang (Michael J.

Nick vows to \\"prepare\\" for the role by attempting to be an actual cop. After seeing Moss's outburst on TV, Nick pulls strings with NYC Mayor David Dinkins to be assigned as Moss's new partner on the force.

(CNN) -- Forecasters are expecting warmer than normal temperatures and gusty winds Tuesday in a northern Colorado area already ravaged by a wildfire, not a good combination for the legion of firefighters trying to extinguish the blaze. The High Park Fire had consumed more than 58,700 acres of woodland by Monday evening, but it was about 50% contained, authorities reported. Tuesday's forecast by the National Weather Service is similar to Monday's blazing heat and winds that whipped up the blaze. But firefighters say they can handle the weather conditions because winds are expected to be less \\"tough\\" than what they experienced on Sunday. iReport: Photos capture smoke choking Colorado sky \\"The expected winds were not as strong as they were. The amount of fire activity in the big timber on the western perimeter was not as extreme,\\" fire information officer Brett Haberstick said, according to CNN affiliate KCNC. \\"We have a lot less smoke and a lot better working conditions for the crews.\\" More than 1,700 personnel were battling the blaze. Lighting ignited the fire that started on June 9 and has destroyed 189 homes. That number is expected to grow, and firefighters are also concerned that the blaze could shift toward dense stands of trees that have been killed by beetle infestations, according to InciWeb, a U.S. multiagency fire response website. The blaze has moved through forests and neighborhoods, forcing thousands of evacuations and leaving a trail of destruction. It has claimed the life of a 62-year-old woman found dead in her burned home last week. Elsewhere in Colorado, firefighters are battling a fire near Pagosa Springs that broke out last month. That blaze, also blamed on lightning, had grown to more than 13,000 acres by Monday night and was 30% contained. And a new fire broke out Sunday and quickly spread to 200 acres near Pueblo, forcing some evacuations of residents. In New Mexico, the Whitewater Baldy Fire has scorched more than 296,000 acres, the agriculture secretary said. More than 3,200 fire personnel from across the United States are helping local departments battle the fire, which began on May 16. The blaze was 82% contained as of Monday. In North Carolina, a wildfire doubled overnight in the Croatan National Forest along the Atlantic coast, U.S. Forest Service officials said Tuesday. Donald Simon, a Forest Service spokesperson, said the blaze has consumed 21,248 acres since Saturday, including 6,000 acres that were intentionally set afire Monday night in a fire-control effort. The wildfire is 20% contained and isn't threatening structures, officials said.

Q:The following article contains an answer for the question: What was the name of the work that was likely influenced by Musidora? , can you please find it? By the time Etty exhibited Musidora, the theme was becoming something of a cliche, such that by 1850 it was described by The Literary Gazette as \\"a favourite subject for a dip of the brush\\". As interest in studies of Musidora waned, its role as a pretext for nude paintings by English artists was replaced by Lady Godiva, who had become a topic of increased interest owing to Alfred, Lord Tennyson's poem Godiva. After the death of William Wordsworth in 1850, James Thomson ceased to be a major influence on writers. From the 1870s his popularity with readers waned, and by the end of the 20th century his works other than Rule, Britannia! were little known.When Etty died in 1849, despite having worked and exhibited until his death, he was still regarded by many as a pornographer. Charles Robert Leslie observed shortly after Etty's death that \\"[Etty] himself, thinking and meaning no evil, was not aware of the manner in which his works were regarded by grosser minds\\". Interest in him declined as new movements came to characterise painting in Britain, and by the end of the 19th century the value of his paintings had fallen. It is likely that the composition and style of John Everett Millais's controversial The Knight Errant was influenced by Musidora, but other than Millais, and Etty's admirer and imitator William Edward Frost, few other artists were directly influenced by Etty's work. In 1882 Vanity Fair commented on Musidora that \\"I know only too well how the rough and his female companion behave in front of pictures such as Etty's bather. I have seen the gangs of workmen strolling round, and I know that their artistic interest in studies of the nude is emphatically embarrassing.\\" By the early 20th century Victorian styles of art and literature fell dramatically out of fashion in Britain, and by 1915 the word \\"Victorian\\" had become a derogatory term. Frederick Mentone's The Human Form in Art (1944) was one of the few 20th-century academic works to favourably view Musidora. A:","completion":"The work that was likely influenced by Musidora was \\"The Knight Errant\\" by John Everett Millais. Millais was a prominent English painter and one of the founders of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. His painting, \\"The Knight Errant\\", is known for its controversial subject matter, which includes nudity. It is suggested in the text that Millais' composition and style for this particular painting may have been influenced by Musidora.

Rocks glasses, the classic whiskey cup, are short, round glasses made for 12-14 oz or liquid. Tulip glasses are curved wide at the bottom and thinner up top, concentrating the smells near your nose, and are used for more high-class whiskey tastings. Can we draw the following conclusion? The classic whisky cup is a tulip cup.","completion":"Based on the information provided, we cannot definitively draw the conclusion that the classic whiskey cup is a tulip cup. While both the rocks glass and the tulip glass are mentioned as suitable options for consuming whiskey, the rocks glass is specifically referred to as the \\"classic whiskey cup.\\" However, the tulip glass does offer certain advantages, particularly when it comes to whiskey tastings. To further elaborate on the different types of whiskey glasses and their usage, let us explore them more in detail: 1. Rocks Glass (also known as an Old Fashioned glass or a Lowball glass): This is a short, round glass with a thick bottom and is typically used for cocktails or consuming whiskey on the rocks (with ice) or neat (without ice). The rocks glass is widely regarded as the classic whiskey cup, as it lends itself well to everyday whiskey drinking and casual sipping. 2. Tulip Glass (also known as a Glencairn Glass or Whiskey Snifter): This type of glass is characterized by its curved wide bottom and thinner top, which helps concentrate the whiskey's aroma near the nose, allowing for a more immersive sensory experience. Tulip glasses are typically used for high-class whiskey tastings and are preferred by whiskey connoisseurs for nosing and appreciating the nuances of the spirit. 3. Highball Glass: A tall and cylindrical glass, the highball glass is used when whiskey is mixed with a sweet or soda-based mixer, such as ginger ale or cola, which creates a whiskey highball cocktail. This glass allows the consumer to comfortably hold the drink while maintaining a proper mix of the spirits as they sip from it. 4. Copita Glass: A small, stemmed glass with a tapered rim, the Copita glass is traditionally used for tasting sherry but is also sometimes used for whiskey tasting. The tapered rim focuses the whiskey's aroma to the nose, and the stem ensures that the warmth of the hand will not affect the temperature of the whiskey. 5. Tumbler Glass: A simple and sturdy glass with a thick, heavy base, the tumbler glass is often used for everyday whiskey drinking and mixing of cocktails. Although it may not enhance the whiskey's aroma and flavors as much as a tulip glass, it is a popular and practical choice for enjoying whiskey in an informal setting. In summary, although the tulip glass provides specific advantages when it comes to whiskey tastings, it cannot be concluded that it is the classic whiskey cup. The rocks glass, also known as an Old Fashioned glass, is more widely recognized as the classic whiskey cup due to its prevalence in everyday whiskey drinking and casual settings."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Here are the options: Available choices: 1). yes. 2). it is not possible to tell. 3). no. Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","completion":"In order to evaluate whether, if the premise is true, the hypothesis is true as well, we need to analyze the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis. Premise: \\"No yeah, I agree with that.\\" The premise is based on the speaker's agreement with an unstated contention or viewpoint. The phrase \\"no yeah\\" can be seen as an informal way of expressing agreement, essentially conveying \\"yes.\\" Since the focus of the statement is unclear, the premise in itself does not provide us with detailed information to make any concrete conclusions. Hypothesis: \\"I don't agree with that at all.\\" The hypothesis is in direct contrast to the premise. Here, the speaker is expressing complete disagreement with the unidentified stance. Now let's examine the three available choices to determine if it is possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then the hypothesis is true as well. 1) Yes. This choice implies that there is a direct correlation between the premise and the hypothesis, which, as we discussed earlier, is not the case. The premise represents agreement, whereas the hypothesis signifies disagreement. Therefore, this option is not correct. 2) It is not possible to tell. The second option highlights the uncertainty regarding the connection between the two statements. Since the subject of agreement or disagreement remains unknown in both premise and hypothesis, it leaves us with little to work with in terms of a conclusion. This choice seems like a plausible answer. 3) No. This choice suggests that there is no correlation between the truth of the premise and the truth of the hypothesis. As mentioned earlier, the premise and hypothesis are opposing viewpoints. Consequently, if the premise is true, the hypothesis is false and vice versa. In this sense, this choice is also correct. In summary, determining that the premise's truth directly leads to the hypothesis's truth is not possible. There is no clear connection between the two statements, so it is difficult to draw any conclusions. Therefore, it is not correct to say that if the premise is true, the hypothesis is true as well. Considering the available choices, the correct answer would be a combination of choices 2 and 3: 2) It is not possible to tell. 3) No. This is because the connection between the premise and hypothesis is uncertain, and the statements' opposing nature does not automatically make one true if the other is true."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

But Mrs Cannings, 29, was left devastated after her mother spotted the family nanny Pascale Sherwin, 23, on Facebook - wearing her stolen clothes and jewels on nights out.

Pascale Sherwin had gained the trust of the Cannings and appeared to be a responsible and caring nanny. Little did they know that their possessions were disappearing due to her secret actions. When Becki's mother found Pascale Sherwin's Facebook page, she immediately informed her daughter about the disturbing images featuring their stolen items. When the couple confronted Pascale Sherwin about the theft, she initially denied the accusations. However, as more evidence surfaced from her Facebook page and other sources, it became impossible for her to continue hiding the truth. Ultimately, the situation escalated to a legal case, where Sherwin was charged with theft and faced the consequences of her actions. The Cannings could not believe their beloved nanny — who had taken care of young Olivia for such an extended time — would betray them like this. In light of these events, Becki and Bradley Cannings have become more cautious about who they trust with the care of their daughter. Furthermore, they have made sure to emphasize the importance of background checks and thorough interviews in hiring childcare providers. It's a significant lesson for them, as well as a reminder for parents everywhere to be vigilant about who they allow to enter their homes and care for their children. In conclusion, the most logical way to complete the passage is by mentioning the baby daughter, Olivia, as the primary focus of Pascale Sherwin's career as their nanny. This addition underscores the emotional impact of Sherwin's actions as she betrayed the trust of the family she was supposed to support."},{"prompt":"Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: It was 1504,and Columbus was making another trip to the New World.

Like all brass instruments, sound is produced when the player's vibrating lips (embouchure) cause the air column inside the instrument to vibrate. Nearly all trombones have a telescoping slide mechanism that varies the length of the instrument to change the pitch. Many modern trombone models also utilize a rotary valve as a means to lower pitch of the instrument. Variants such as the valve trombone and superbone have three valves like those on the trumpet. - A trumpet is a musical instrument commonly used in classical and jazz ensembles. The trumpet group contains the instruments with the highest register in the brass family. Trumpet-like instruments have historically been used as signaling devices in battle or hunting, with examples dating back to at least 1500 BC; they began to be used as musical instruments only in the late-14th or early 15th century. Trumpets are used in art music styles, for instance in orchestras, concert bands, and jazz ensembles, as well as in popular music. They are played by blowing air through almost-closed lips (called the player's embouchure), producing a \\"buzzing\\" sound that starts a standing wave vibration in the air column inside the instrument. Since the late 15th century they have primarily been constructed of brass tubing, usually bent twice into a rounded rectangular shape. - Don Lang ( born Gordon Langhorn , 19 January 1925 -- 3 August 1992 ) was an English trombone player and singer , who led his own band , Don Lang & his Frantic Five . - The embouchure is the use of facial muscles and the shaping of the lips to the mouthpiece of woodwind instruments or the mouthpiece of the brass instruments. The word is of French origin and is related to the root \\"bouche\\" (fr.), 'mouth'. The proper embouchure allows the instrumentalist to play the instrument at its full range with a full, clear tone and without strain or damage to one's muscles. - A brass instrument is a musical instrument that produces sound by sympathetic vibration of air in a tubular resonator in sympathy with the vibration of the player's lips. Brass instruments are also called \\"labrosones\\", literally meaning \\"lip-vibrated instruments\\".

If they don't allow oxygen to pass, the amount of oxygen that reaches the lungs will be reduced.

The authorities had already heard of the capture of the _Columbia_ from the Russians, and said that the schooner would have to remain at Nagasaki until the whole case could be adjusted. The Japanese were inclined to favor both the Richmond Importing Company and the owners of the vessel, so it was not likely that our friends would lose much in the end. In the meantime the _Columbia_ could be put in a dry-dock and given the overhauling that she needed. \\"We shall do all we can to locate Shamhaven and Peterson and get back your money,\\" said an official of the secret service department. But his hands were so full with other matters of greater importance that little attention was paid to the disappearance of the two rascals. \\"Well, this will tie me up at Nagasaki for some time to come,\\" said Captain Ponsberry to Larry, on the third day after arriving at the Japanese port. \\"Which means, I suppose, that I can join the Japanese navy if I wish,\\" returned the young second mate, quickly. \\"I don't want to force you to leave the ship, lad.

His theatrical works were written between 1604 and 1643 and included ten operas, of which three—L'Orfeo (1607), Il ritorno d'Ulisse in patria (1640) and L'incoronazione di Poppea (1643)—have survived with their music and librettos intact. In the case of the other seven operas, the music has disappeared almost entirely, although some of the librettos exist. The loss of these works, written during a critical period of early opera history, has been much regretted by commentators and musicologists. Opera, as a musical and theatrical genre, began to emerge during the early part of Monteverdi's career, initially as a form of courtly entertainment. With other composers, he played a leading part in its development into the main form of public musical theatre. His first opera, L'Orfeo, written in 1607 for the Mantuan court, which employed him, was a major success. In the years that followed, at Mantua and in his later capacity as maestro di cappella (director of music) at St Mark's Basilica in Venice, Monteverdi continued to write theatrical music in various genres, including operas, dances, and intermedi (short musical interludes inserted into straight plays). Because in Monteverdi's times stage music was rarely thought to have much utility after its initial performance, much of this music vanished shortly after its creation. Most of the available information relating to the seven lost operas has been deduced from contemporary documents, including the many letters that Monteverdi wrote. These papers provide irrefutable evidence that four of these works—L'Arianna, Andromeda, Proserpina rapita and Le nozze d'Enea con Lavinia—were completed and performed in Monteverdi's lifetime, but of their music, only the famous lament from L'Arianna and a trio from Proserpina are known to have survived. The other three lost operas—Le nozze di Tetide, La finta pazza Licori and Armida... answer the following question: What is the last name of the person who had three operas survive with their music and librettos intact?

Rushing here and there, being constantly on call, balancing multiple layers of responsibility may give you a sense of accomplishment – even make you feel important, but it takes a huge toll on every aspect of life. When you constantly push yourself to take on more and more challenges, it is easy to lose sight of why you wanted to be successful in the first place. For many, the reason was to be able to spend less time working and enjoy life more. A frenetic, high-pressure lifestyle creates exactly the opposite. There is a very dark side to constantly pushing yourself to produce more and more. Unfortunately, it creeps up on you and becomes a serious case of self-negligence. When you are busy and driven every minute of every day and well into the evening, it is easy to neglect important things in life that keep you healthy, happy, and create quality of life. A continual stream of urgent tasks that must be completed will overshadow the not-so-urgent, but important activities that make life worth living. It is not just physical well-being that is neglected – mental and emotional well-being also suffer when there is no time for self-care. When your daily schedule is crammed to overflowing one of the first areas of neglect is your diet. Eating regular, nutritious meals become a thing of the past. You are not only too busy to sleep or even take a deep breath now and then, there is no time to prepare decent meals Convenience foods, frozen dinners, take out and fast foods become the norm. It is a steady diet of additive filled, sugar and fat-filled dishes, loaded with empty calories that provide minimal nutrition and damage the body. It is impossible to sustain any level of good health on such a diet. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.

Context: Support of episcopacy was strong in the north-east and became the centre of a Jacobite party led by John Graham of Claverhouse who had been made Viscount Dundee by James VII. Dundee raised a force that held Edinburgh Castle for the deposed king and then organised an army that was mainly made up of Highlanders. They were confronted in Perthshire by a force from the new government that was led by General Hugh Mackay, but in the ensuing Battle of Killiecrankie which took place on 27 July 1689 the government force was overwhelmed by the Jacobite Highlanders and defeated. However, the Jacobites sustained heavy losses as well, including their leader the Viscount Dundee. This victory raised the hopes of the Jacobite rebels, but their army of 5,000 men was defeated by government forces at the Battle of Dunkeld on 21 August 1689 by 1,200 men of the Cameronian Regiment . During the battle the leader of the government force, William Cleland, was killed and so command fell to Captain George Munro, 1st of Auchinbowie who led them to victory.

The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the opera that ultimately brought the Théâtre Lyrique little financial success, though Bizet had won admiration from his peers? , can you please find it? The premiere, originally planned for 14 September 1863, was postponed to the 30th because of the illness of the soprano lead, Léontine de Maësen. The first-night audience at the Théâtre Lyrique received the work well, and called for Bizet at the conclusion. The writer Louis Gallet, who later would provide several librettos for Bizet, described the composer on this occasion as \\"a little dazed ... a forest of thick curly hair above a round, still rather childish face, enlivened by the quick brown eyes...\\" The audience's appreciation was not reflected in the majority of the press reviews, which generally castigated both the work and what they considered Bizet's lack of modesty in appearing on stage. Gustave Bertrand in Le Ménestrel wrote that \\"this sort of exhibition is admissible only for a most extraordinary success, and even then we prefer to have the composer dragged on in spite of himself, or at least pretending to be\\". Another critic surmised that the calls for the composer had been orchestrated by a \\"claque\\" of Bizet's friends, strategically distributed.Of the opera itself, Benjamin Jouvin of Le Figaro wrote: \\"There were neither fishermen in the libretto nor pearls in the music\\". He considered that on every page the score displayed \\"the bias of the school to which [Bizet] belongs, that of Richard Wagner\\". Bertrand compared the work unfavourably with those of contemporary French composers such as Charles Gounod and Félicien David. \\"Nevertheless\\", he wrote, \\"there is a talent floating in the midst of all these regrettable imitations\\". Hector Berlioz was a voice apart in the general critical hostility; his review of the work in Journal des Débats praised the music's originality and subtlety: \\"The score of Les pêcheurs de perles does M. Bizet the greatest honour\\", he wrote. Among Bizet's contemporaries, the dramatist Ludovic Halévy wrote that this early work announced Bizet as a composer of quality: \\"I persist in finding in [the score] the rarest virtues\\". The youthful composer Émile Paladilhe told his father...","completion":"The opera referred to in the provided article is \\"Les pêcheurs de perles\\" (The Pearl Fishers) composed by Georges Bizet. The premiere took place at the Théâtre Lyrique on September 30, 1863, after being postponed due to the illness of the soprano lead, Léontine de Maësen. Although the first-night audience received the work positively and Bizet gained admiration from his peers, including the praise of Hector Berlioz, the opera brought little financial success to the Théâtre Lyrique. The majority of the press reviews were critical of both the work and the composer's perceived immodesty. Critics unfavorably compared \\"Les pêcheurs de perles\\" to the works of contemporary French composers such as Charles Gounod and Félicien David. Some critics even accused the composer of imitating the style of Richard Wagner. Despite the mixed critical reception, Bizet's contemporaries, including the dramatist Ludovic Halévy, recognized the quality of Bizet's composition and saw it as a display of his rare talent. The young composer Émile Paladilhe also shared his admiration for Bizet's work with his father. In summary, the opera in question is called \\"Les pêcheurs de perles\\" by Georges Bizet. Though it ultimately brought little financial success to the Théâtre Lyrique, it earned Bizet admiration from his peers, and the opera remains a significant work in his oeuvre."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Would the following phrase be considered positive or negative? that the debate it joins is a necessary and timely one","completion":"The phrase \\"that the debate it joins is a necessary and timely one\\" is generally considered to be positive in nature. Although it does not express overt enthusiasm or excitement, it indicates the speaker's belief in the importance and relevance of the debate it refers to. There are several factors that support this positive interpretation, which include: 1. The use of the word \\"necessary\\": Describing a debate as necessary signifies its importance to the speaker. It suggests that the subject being discussed is significant and requires attention from the parties involved. This implies that the outcomes of the discussion could potentially contribute to resolving issues or identifying solutions. 2. The use of the word \\"timely\\": Calling the debate timely indicates that the speaker believes it is occurring at the right time and addresses current concerns. Timely debates often relate to emerging or relevant issues, demonstrating an awareness and willingness to tackle pressing questions or challenges. 3. The mention of joining a debate: The phrase implies that the subject is being connected to an existing conversation, which may be a larger discourse in society. This suggests that the speaker views the debate not as an isolated event, but as part of an ongoing discussion that involves multiple perspectives. It shows that they acknowledge the importance of participating in dialogue and sharing ideas. 4. The focus on debates as a productive component of society: Debates can be seen as crucial conduits for the exchange of ideas and information, fostering informed decision-making and helping to shape collective opinions and direction. By highlighting a debate as necessary and timely, the speaker underscores the value of such discussions in generating a more thorough understanding of a topic. 5. Encouragement to participate: Finally, this phrase may serve as an invitation for others to get involved in the debate, promoting active engagement and critical thinking. By framing the debate as necessary and timely, the speaker may be implicitly encouraging their audience to consider the subject, voice their opinions, and take part in the conversation. In conclusion, while the phrase \\"that the debate it joins is a necessary and timely one\\" might not express overwhelming positivity or enthusiasm, it does convey a sense of importance and relevance, positioning the debate as a valuable opportunity for discussion and potential growth. This ultimately makes it a positive statement, reflecting the speaker's belief in the significance and timeliness of the discourse at hand."},{"prompt":"Definition: In this task, you are given an input list A.

Hypothesis: A young girl stands outside a restaurant in the middle of the day. .Given the premise, can we conclude the hypothesis?","completion":"No, we cannot conclude the hypothesis given the provided premise. The premise and hypothesis present two different scenarios that have key differences in both the time of day and the context. According to the premise, we are given the following information: 1. A young girl is the main subject. 2. She is standing outside a restaurant. 3. The time is night. On the other hand, the hypothesis provides us with a different set of conditions: 1. The same young girl is the main subject. 2. She is also standing outside a restaurant. 3. However, the time in this situation is the middle of the day. These differences between the premise and hypothesis are critical, and thus we cannot draw a conclusion that links the information given in the premise to the hypothesis scenario. The premise sets a scene of a young girl standing outside a restaurant during the night. Factors that could be taken into consideration here are the dimmer lighting, the possible closure of the restaurant, or perhaps a different atmosphere or fewer people around compared to what might typically be seen during the day. On the other hand, the hypothesis places the girl outside the restaurant at midday, which implies that the scene would be brighter and more likely busier. It might be more common to see people around or even a line in front of the restaurant due to the lunch rush. In summary, since there are fundamental differences between the premise and the hypothesis, particularly concerning the time of day, we cannot conclude the hypothesis based on the given premise."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The statement \\"A dog jumps\\" provides minimal information about the context or environment surrounding the dog's actions. With only this statement, we can only understand that the dog is performing a jumping action. One cannot assume anything beyond this as there could be a variety of reasons or settings related to the dog's jumping. On the other hand, the more detailed description, \\"A dog is being squirted with a hose as it jumps into a paddling pool,\\" provides a much more specific scenario taking place. It describes not only the dog's action (jumping) but also the surroundings (being squirted with a hose and jumping into a paddling pool). To conclude that the detailed description is accurate based on the given statement, we would need more information. For example, if the statement included information about the hose or the paddling pool, it would be more reasonable to make such a conclusion.

Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers: Nervous systems throughout the animal kingdom vary in structure and complexity, as illustrated by the variety of animals shown in Figure 35.2. Some organisms, like sea sponges, lack a true nervous system. Others, like jellyfish, lack a true brain and instead have a system of separate but connected nerve cells (neurons) called a “nerve net. ” Echinoderms such as sea stars have nerve cells that are bundled into fibers called nerves. Flatworms of the phylum Platyhelminthes have both a central nervous system (CNS), made up of a small “brain” and two nerve cords, and a peripheral nervous system (PNS) containing a system of nerves that extend throughout the body. The insect nervous system is more complex but also fairly decentralized. It contains a brain, ventral nerve cord, and ganglia (clusters of connected neurons). These ganglia can control movements and behaviors without input from the brain.

To do this, we'll add 78*c to both sides of the equation to eliminate c from the right side. At the same time, we'll subtract 199 from both sides to remove the constant from the left side. 5*c + 78*c + 199 - 199 = -78*c + 78*c + 33 - 199 Step 3: Simplify both sides of the equation. 83*c = -166 Step 4: Now, the equation has the form Ax = B, where A = 83 and B = -166. To find the value of x, which is c in this case, we divide both sides of the equation by A(= 83). c = -166 / 83 Step 5: Perform the division c = -2 So, the solution of the equation 5*c + 199 = -78*c + 33 is c = -2."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It wasn't an ideal situation, but it was the best they could make of it; the closest medical help was miles away. As the morning sun peeked through the dense forest, they found themselves near an abandoned cabin which would have to serve as an impromptu medical facility. Nick, who was quite pale due to the loss of blood from the deep gash on his leg, winced with every step as they approached the cabin. Ryan, a strong-willed and dependable friend, felt responsible for Nick's injuries. They had been hiking for their annual friends trip when Nick slipped and fell against some sharp rocks, causing the painful wound. As they entered the dusty cabin, Ryan quickly scanned the space for any useful materials. He managed to find some old towels which he could use to help clean the wound and staunch the bleeding. He sent a silent prayer of thanks to his past self for enrolling in those first aid classes last year. Ryan washed his hands thoroughly and used some of the bottled water they brought along to moisten the antiseptic wipes from their first aid kit. He carefully cleaned the affected area, trying not to think about how much pain Nick must be in. He then took a deep breath, preparing himself to use the scalpel. It was a daunting prospect, but he knew this was not a task to be rushed. With surgical precision, Ryan sliced away some of the jagged skin and damaged tissue, careful to leave a clean edge that would promote healing. As he stitched up the wound with a sterilized needle and thread, he was incredibly gentle, knowing that there was no room for error. Despite the pain and blood loss, Nick remained strong. He could tell that Ryan was doing his best, and he was grateful for his friend's medical knowledge in this desperate situation. The atmosphere in the cabin was tense as they both focused on the task at hand. Ryan continued with the treatment, his hands steady and his dedication intense. After what seemed like an eternity, Ryan finally tied the last knot on the sutures. The wound was closed. He covered it with a sterile dressing from the first aid kit, securing it in place with some adhesive strips. He then helped Nick elevate his leg and instructed him to rest while he scoured the cabin for anything they could use for a makeshift splint. They spent the rest of the day in the cabin, with Ryan frequently checking on Nick's wound, making sure it didn't get infected and that the bleeding had subsided. As evening approached, they decided to stay in the cabin overnight, not wanting to risk moving Nick in his current condition. The following day, they would attempt to find their way back to civilization and seek proper medical help. Throughout this harrowing experience, the bond between Ryan and Nick only grew stronger. It was a testament to their friendship that they could face adversity together and emerge from it even closer than before. In the days that followed, they would always look back on this event with a mix of fear and gratitude, knowing that they had each other's backs no matter what challenges life threw their way."},{"prompt":"Given the following passage \\"According to a study by Dr. Paul Brest, Hispanics or \\"Latinos\\" include immigrants who are descendants of immigrants from the countries comprising Central and South America.

However, if you convince yourself beforehand that the pain won't be so bad, you might not suffer as much. According to a recent study, the part of your brain that reacts to severe pain is largely the same part that reacts to expectation of pain. Researchers in this study worked with 10 volunteers, aged 24 to 46. Each volunteer wore a device that gave out 20-second-long pulses of heat to the right leg. There were three levels of heat, producing mild, moderate, or strong pain. During training, the volunteers would first hear a tone, followed by a period of silence, and then feel a heat pulse. They then learned to associate the length of the silent pause with the intensity of the upcoming heat pulse. The longer the pause, the stronger the heat pulse would be, causing more severe pain. A day or two later, the real experiment began. The researchers found that the parts of the brain involved in learning, memory, emotion, and touch became more active as the volunteers expected higher levels of pain. These were mainly the same areas that became active when participants actually felt pain. Interestingly, when the volunteers expected only mild or moderate pain but experienced severe pain, they reported feeling 28 percent less pain than when they expected severe pain and actually got it. The new study emphasizes that pain has both physical and psychological elements. Understanding how pain works in the mind and brain could eventually give doctors tools for helping people cope with painful medical treatments. How did the volunteers learn to expect different levels of heat? A) From the loudness of the tone they heard. B) From the instruction given to them by the researchers. C) From the color1 of a light flashing on the device they wore. D) From the length of the pause between a tone and the heat pulse.

Q:Question: how big or small a visible light can get I found the following answer on Google: The optical window is also called the visible window because it overlaps the human visible response spectrum. Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. A:","completion":"To accurately answer your question, I will first explain some key points. Visible light is a portion of the electromagnetic spectrum that corresponds to wavelengths that are visible to the human eye, typically ranging from around 380 to 740 nanometers. The size of a visible light refers to its wavelength, not its physical size, so it's essential to understand that the question \\"how big or small a visible light can get\\" pertains to the range of wavelengths within the visible light spectrum. Now, analyzing the Google answer you provided: \\"The optical window is also called the visible window because it overlaps the human visible response spectrum.\\" This statement is factually correct. The optical window indeed refers to the range of wavelengths in the electromagnetic spectrum that can be conveniently transmitted through Earth's atmosphere without being absorbed or scattered too much. This optical window overlaps with the wavelengths of visible light (visible spectrum) that we can see. However, the answer does not directly address the question about how big or small visible light can get. The information provided is related, but it does not give a specific range of wavelengths as requested in the question. So, the answer to whether the provided statement is a correct answer to the question is: No. However, the information is factually accurate and related but does not directly answer the question. The correct answer should provide the range of wavelengths for visible light (approximately 380 to 740 nanometers)."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

When you cut the ugli fruit open, the inside should look similar to that of an orange, but the fruit should appear slightly fleshier than an orange would. Unlike grapefruit, the ugli fruit is sweet enough on its own and does not need any added sugar. If you do add sugar to the fruit, you may even find it too sweet.

If you want to use the fruit for a light yet exotic lunch or dessert, you can cut it in half and drizzle it with a bit of sherry or kirsch before enjoying it. Peel the skin off the ugli fruit and separate it into sections, like you might expect to do with a tangerine. The segments can be eaten one by one. The skin is thick yet loose and puffy, so you should be able to remove it with your fingers. There are seldom any seeds, so you should not have to worry about removing seeds before enjoying the fruit.

Sometimes it can be fun to stay at home and play your favorite games, right? But did you know that always staying inside might not be very good for your health! Just like eating too much candy can give you a tummy ache. Does it mean you should never stay indoors? Of course not, but let's understand why going outside can be good for you too. Think of your body like a big, friendly pet dog. You know how your doggie loves going out for walks and bounds around in the open air? Just like your pet, our bodies also love being outdoors and moving around. That's because it helps us stay strong and healthy. When we play inside too much, we breathe in the same air over and over again. Would you want to eat the same food every day? Probably not, right? Well, our lungs - those are the big bags of air inside your chest that help you breathe - also enjoy fresh air. Going outside gives your lungs a chance to breathe in lots of fresh air. Also, when you spend time inside all day, your body can't soak up as much sunshine. Sunshine is how your body makes something called Vitamin D. Think of Vitamin D like a superhero that keeps your bones strong and healthy. Bones are the little hard parts inside your body that make up your skeleton. If you don't get enough Vitamin D, then your superhero can't do its job well. Plus, when you stay indoors and sit or lie down too much, it's like leaving your favorite toy in the toy box all day. It doesn't get to move, stretch, or use its special skills. Our bodies and muscles are like toys that need to have fun and exercise. Going outside to play helps our muscles grow strong and stretchy. Playing outdoors is also lot of fun! There's so much to see and do - you can run around, play catch, explore, or even just lie down and watch the clouds float by. All these fun activities might not be possible inside the house. So, it's important to balance your time between staying indoors and stepping outside. If it isn't raining too hard or too hot outside, try to spend some time every day playing, exploring, or just walking around. Your body will be very happy, just like your doggie after a good walk! Remember, staying indoors all the time is not bad, but try to mix it up and get some fresh air too.

Summarize this article: Rabbits are likely to feel threatened by other household pets, even the scent of them. So wash your hands after handling your other pets and before touching your rabbit. Once your rabbit has had a chance to settle in and a few days have gone by, start hand-feeding her. Start by sitting next to her cage and just talk to her in a calm voice. If she bolts, just keep quietly talking and wait for her to come to you. Open the door and offer her a tasty treat, like a dandelion. If your rabbit doesn't have the confidence to come up to the dandelion, set it halfway between the two of you. When you feed or talk to your rabbit, rest your hand on the straw near the door. This way, she'll get used to your company while she eats. Top up her food bowl and chat to her as you do. Since rabbits learn by experience, she will soon associate you with food (a good thing). This will help calm your rabbit. Once she's comfortable eating in your presence, you can start to gently touch her. Don't overdo it by trying to pick her up. She may become stressed and try to fight back. Instead, quietly reach inside the hutch and touch her back or flank. If she doesn't run away, gently stroke her. Avoid putting your hand over the top of her head. Objects passing over the rabbit's head signal danger (such as a hawk flying over a rabbit). This is likely to make the bunny scared. Make sure to approach her from the side or back. Once she's used to being stroked in her hutch, you can try picking her up. Sit on the ground, lift the rabbit out and put her on your lap on ground level. Keep some dandelions handy so that she has something tasty to nibble to distract her. Keep the session short, about one minute to start with. This way she won't start to panic. With practice you can keep your rabbit out longer and longer. You should also keep a towel nearby in case your rabbit gets distressed. Then you can cover her with a towel. This will calm her. You can also scoop her up in the towel, which means you are less likely to get scratched if she panics. Once your rabbit is used to your presence and being picked up, you may want to let her roam in the house. Always supervise her, and start with one small room so that she doesn't feel overwhelmed. Check the room first and make sure there are no gaps for her to hide and get stuck in. Make sure there are no electrical cables for her to chew. Rabbits will chew anything, so be alert and remove anything you don't want damaged. While your rabbit checks out her new environment, you should lie flat on the floor. This makes your height less intimidating for your rabbit and lets her sniff and investigate without feeling threatened. A good tip is to keep a treat in your pocket or hand, and reward her brave behavior with a snack. Keep the sessions short and sweet at first, no longer than 10 - 15 minutes. This way your rabbit won't get overtired.","completion":"This article provides tips on acclimating a rabbit to your presence and handling, as well as introducing it to your home environment.

American Folk Art Museum to Offer Exhibition at Seaport With Museum of the City of New York Having survived a near-death experience last fall, the American Folk Art Museum will present an exhibition starting June 20 at the South Street Seaport Museum with the Museum of the City of New York, which now operates the Seaport Museum.

First, we need to deal with the numbers without the letter \\"i.\\" So let's do some adding and subtracting: 60450 (this is a big number) + 61174 (another big number) - 28234 (a smaller number) These might be hard for you to do with such big numbers, so you can ask an adult or use a calculator. But the answer for this part is: 93390. Now let's look at the other part of the problem with the letter \\"i.\\" -1818 (this is a negative number that's not as big) * i - 42960 (another big number) We want to find the value of i, so let's move 42960 to the other side of the equal sign. In math, when we move a number to the other side, we change its sign, so we have: 93390 + 42960 = -1818 * i Now add 93390 and 42960, and you get: 136350. Now our equation looks like this: 136350 = -1818 * i We want to figure out what i is, so we need to divide 136350 by -1818. When we divide a positive number by a negative number, we get a negative answer. So after dividing 136350 by -1818, you should get: i = -75. And there we have it! Even though these numbers might seem big and scary, with a little bit of help, we figured out the value of i, which is -75. Good job!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

As he is sitting on the transport boat taking him back to America, he is asked by a reporter about his experiences during the war. Johnson begins to tell his story, beginning in 1941. Johnson is the chief surgeon at a hospital, a man free of emotional attachment to his patients. He joins the Army and has a cocktail party with his wife, Penny (Anne Baxter). During the party, a colleague of his, Dr. Robert Sunday (John Hodiak), accuses Johnson of being unsentimental, a hypocrite, and joining the Army out of purely selfish motives. Penny breaks up the fray and she and Johnson spend their last night together sipping cocktails. Johnson then boards a transport ship, where he meets Lt. Jane \\"Snapshot\\" McCall (Lana Turner). Although they initially do not get along, they eventually find they have a lot in common and become fast friends. Their friendship is at numerous moments tested as they begin to fall in love with one another. After taking a trip to bathe, Johnson and Snapshot come back to the base to find that a friend of Johnson's, Sergeant Monkevickz (Cameron Mitchell), is dying from a malaria-ruptured spleen. Johnson remembers that during his argument with Dr. Sunday, Sunday mentioned that people in Chester Village, where Monkevickz was from, were dying from malaria and being neglected by physicians. Johnson tells Snapshot that he treated Monkevicks without enough care as to treat him like a human being. To atone, Johnson asks Penny to visit Monkevickz's father. When Penny arrives at the house, she finds Doctor Sunday there and confesses that she is jealous of Snapshot, whom Johnson has mentioned in letters, and believes that Johnson and Snapshot are having an affair.

Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. Answer:","completion":"No. The answer you found regarding the Gospel of Mark being used as a source for Matthew and Luke does not directly answer the specific question of where in the Gospel of Mark the disciples question Jesus' divinity. Instead, it gives general information about the relationship between the synoptic gospels. Let me find the correct information for you. After researching, I found that the disciples don't explicitly question Jesus' divinity in the Gospel of Mark. However, there are instances where they express doubt, confusion, or lack of understanding concerning Jesus' actions and teachings which could be taken as questioning his divine nature. One such instance can be found in the calming of the storm episode in Mark 4:35-41: 35 That day when evening came, he said to his disciples, “Let us go over to the other side.” 36 Leaving the crowd behind, they took him along, just as he was, in the boat. There were also other boats with him. 37 A furious squall came up, and the waves broke over the boat so that it was nearly swamped. 38 Jesus was in the stern, sleeping on a cushion. The disciples woke him and said to him, “Teacher, don’t you care if we drown?” 39 He got up, rebuked the wind, and said to the waves, “Quiet! Be still!” Then the wind died down and it was completely calm. 40 He said to his disciples, “Why are you so afraid? Do you still have no faith?” 41 They were terrified and asked each other, “Who is this? Even the wind and the waves obey him!” In this passage, the disciples show fear and uncertainty, not fully grasping the divine power that Jesus possesses. Their question, \\"Who is this? Even the wind and the waves obey him!\\" demonstrates a lack of understanding about Jesus' true nature."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Bacteria such as Mycobacterium leprae and Treponema pallidum can be grown in animals, although serological and microscopic techniques make the use of live animals unnecessary. Viruses are also usually identified using alternatives to growth in culture or animals. Some viruses may be grown in embryonated eggs. Another useful identification method is Xenodiagnosis, or the use of a vector to support the growth of an infectious agent. Chagas disease is the most significant example, because it is difficult to directly demonstrate the presence of the causative agent, Trypanosoma cruzi in a patient, which therefore makes it difficult to definitively make a diagnosis. In this case, xenodiagnosis involves the use of the vector of the Chagas agent T. cruzi, an uninfected triatomine bug, which takes a blood meal from a person suspected of having been infected.

Write a title for this article: In the latest volley over the contraceptive Plan B, a federal judge reversed the Department of Health and Human Services decision to restrict over-the-counter availability of the morning after pill to those 17 years or older . Judge Edward Korman of the District Court of Eastern New York overturned Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Kathleen Sebelius’ decision to add an age limit to obtaining Plan B without a prescription; citing concerns over the safety of the emergency contraceptive, which is effective about 50% of the time in preventing pregnancy before the fertilized egg implants in the uterus, being taken by girls as young as 11 years old, Sebelius required anyone under 17 to provide a prescription in order to purchase Plan B, while allowing those 17 and older to buy the contraceptive over-the-counter. It’s the latest development in a contentious regulatory battle that dates to 2009, when Plan B’s manufacturer, Teva Pharmaceuticals, filed an application with the Food and Drug Administration to change the drug’s status from a prescription medication to an over-the-counter one. At the time, only women 17 years or older could obtain Plan B without a prescription, and the company wanted to remove the restriction and expand over-the-counter access to women of all ages. After reviewing the application and available studies on the pill, the FDA‘s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) determined that Plan B was safe and effective for adolescents, and concluded that younger girls were capable of correctly using and understanding the risks of Plan B without doctor intervention. (MORE: U.S. Rejects FDA Advice to Sell Plan B One-Step Over the Counter) Based on the CDER conclusions, FDA commissioner Margaret Hamburg recommended that the contraceptive be sold without a prescription for “all females of child-bearing potential.” In an unprecedented move, however, Sebelius invoked her authority as Secretary of HHS, which oversees the FDA, and overruled the recommendation, noting that the company failed to provide research showing that young girls could use the drug safely. Her decision was backed by President Obama, who said, “As I understand it, the reason Kathleen made this decision was she could not be confident that a 10-year-old or an 11-year-old going into a drugstore should be able — alongside bubble gum or batteries — be able to buy a medication that potentially, if not used properly, could end up having an adverse effect. And I think most parents would probably feel the same way,” according to the New York Times. Critics of her decision argued the motives were politically-driven, and that the labeling change was long overdue given the rates of unprotected sex and teen pregnancy. They argued that more access to contraceptives would lead to fewer unintended pregnancies and abortions, and pointed to data supporting the drug’s safety. Those who supported the restrictions made the opposite argument, maintaining that freer access to contraceptives could lead to more unprotected sex and abortions. (MORE: Plan B: 1 in 5 Pharmacists May Deny Eligible Teens Access to Emergency Contraception) In reversing Sebelius’ decision, Judge Korman said that the ruling was made in “bad faith and improper political influence,” writing in his decision, “it is hardly clear that the Secretary had the power to issue the order, and if she did have that authority, her decision was arbitrary, capricious, and unreasonable.” The age restriction means that while women over age 17 can get Plan B without a prescription, the medication is kept behind the pharmacy counter, which has made getting the drug more difficult when pharmacies are closed and pharmacists are not on duty. “This is really great news for women. It is great news that the evidence is really going to be put into practice. We have known for a long time that it is safe enough to be put on the shelf, and it was really a political decision not to,” says Dr. Daniel Grossman, the vice president of research at Ibis Reproductive Health. “I thought [Sebelius' decision] was very surprising, because the evidence was really quite clear. It was unprecedented to do something like this. I hope that HHS will comply with the ruling and it will be on shelves soon.” (MORE: University Vending Machine Dispenses Morning-After Pill) Grossman is also hopeful the judge’s ruling will increase access to all modes of contraceptives, including an eventual over-the-counter availability for daily birth control. ”The evidence will show that that is also safe for women of all ages and should be on the shelves as well. There is a lot of work trying to move daily birth control over-the-counter. We are still not there yet, but one thing holding pharmaceutical companies back was this age restriction on emergency contraception and the lack of clarity about what would happen to regular birth control pills that was also approved for over-the-counter sale by the FDA,” he says. In an email response to requests for comment, Allison Price, a spokesperson at the Department of Justice, said “The Department of Justice is reviewing the appellate options and expects to act promptly” while an HHS spokesperson said in an email that HHS’ concern “always has been and remains the health of young women nationwide.” Title:","completion":"Federal Judge Overturns Age Restriction on Over-the-Counter Morning After Pill Availability: Examining the Ongoing Battle for Access to Contraceptive Plan B"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Yarralumla is a large inner south suburb of Canberra, the capital city of Australia. Located approximately 3.5 kilometres (2.2 mi) south-west of the city, Yarralumla extends along the south-west bank of Lake Burley Griffin. (The lake was created after the Second World War through the blocking, with a dam, of the Molonglo River.) In 1828, Henry Donnison, a Sydney merchant, was granted a lease on the western side of Stirling Ridge. Donnison's land was named Yarralumla in a survey of the area conducted in 1834, apparently after the indigenous people's term for the area. It was also spelt Yarrolumla in other documents. In 1881, the estate was bought by Frederick Campbell, grandson of Robert Campbell who built nearby \\"Duntroon\\". He completed the construction of a large, gabled, brick house on his property in 1891 that now serves as the site of Government House, the official residence of the Governor-General of Australia. Campbell's house replaced an elegant, Georgian-style homestead, the main portions of which were erected from local stone in the 1830s. Among the old Yarralumla homestead's most notable occupants were Sir Terence Aubrey Murray, who owned Yarralumla sheep station from 1837 to 1859, Augustus Onslow Manby Gibbes, who owned the property from 1859 to 1881, and Augustus' father Colonel John George Nathaniel Gibbes (1787–1873). (Augustus \\"Gussie\\" Gibbes was Murray's brother-in-law; he also advanced money to Frederick Campbell to assist with the construction, in 1890–1891, of Campbell's grand new family house at Yarralumla.) The modern suburb of Yarralumla was gazetted by the government in 1928 and as of 2011 was home to approximately 3,000 people and many diplomatic missions. In recent years, it has become one of Canberra's most desirable and expensive residential suburbs because of its wide leafy streets, attractive lakeside setting and central location.

Question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: Who was the majority group in Sao Paulo province? White Brazilians descended from the original Portuguese settlers. From the 1870s onwards this ethnic group also included other European immigrants: mainly Italians, Spaniards and Germans. Although whites could be found throughout the country, they were the majority group in the southern region and in São Paulo province. Whites also comprised a significant proportion (40%) of the population in the northeastern provinces of Ceará, Paraíba and Rio Grande do Norte. Black Brazilians of Sub-Saharan African ancestry inhabited the same areas as mulattoes. The majority of the population of Rio de Janeiro, Minas Gerais, Espírito Santo, Bahia, Sergipe, Alagoas and Pernambuco provinces (the last four having the smallest percentages of whites in the whole country—less than 30% in each) were black or brown. The Indians, the indigenous peoples of Brazil, were found mainly in Piauí, Maranhão, Pará and Amazonas.Because of the existence of distinct racial and cultural communities, 19th century Brazil developed as a multi-ethnic nation. However the data is problematic as no reliable information is available for the years prior to 1872. The first official national census was compiled by the government in 1872 showing that out of 9,930,479 inhabitants there were 38.1% whites, 38.3% browns, 19.7% blacks and 3.9% Indians. The second official national census in 1890 revealed that in a population of 14,333,915, 44% were whites, 32.4% browns, 14.6% blacks and 9% Indians.

Choices: - homologous and somatic - german and somatic - plasticity and somatic - germline and somatic A: Answer:","completion":"The two major categories of mutations are germline and somatic. Germline mutations occur in germ cells, which are the cells that produce eggs and sperm in sexually reproducing organisms. These mutations can be inherited and passed on to future generations. When a germline mutation occurs, it can affect the whole organism and its offspring, leading to the potential for new traits or characteristics to emerge. Germline mutations can be either beneficial, harmful, or have no effect on the organism, depending on the specific mutation and its implications on the genetic sequence. Germline mutations can result from several factors, such as errors during DNA replication, environmental factors (e.g., radiation, chemicals), or even random chance. Some of the most well-known genetic disorders, such as cystic fibrosis, sickle cell anemia, and hemophilia, are caused by germline mutations. Somatic mutations, on the other hand, occur in somatic cells, which are the body cells that are not involved in reproduction. These mutations affect only the individual organism and are not passed on to its offspring. Somatic mutations can arise at any time during the organism's life and can accumulate, resulting in diverse effects on the organism's health. Like germline mutations, somatic mutations can be caused by errors during DNA replication, exposure to environmental factors, and random chance. However, unlike germline mutations, somatic mutations can lead to conditions such as cancer, as they cause abnormal cell growth and division. Both germline and somatic mutations contribute to the genetic diversity within populations and can have significant consequences for the overall fitness of the individuals affected. While germline mutations may result in the propagation of new traits among a population, somatic mutations can give researchers insight into the factors that contribute to age-related diseases and other health conditions. Ultimately, understanding and studying both types of mutations is crucial for gaining a comprehensive view of genetics and its role in the biology of living organisms."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article:Clinching the championship in Austin, Texas, a week ago meant Hamilton achieved a lifetime's ambition in matching the achievements of his childhood hero Ayrton Senna. But, as with Senna himself, Hamilton's competitiveness and winning mentality have clearly been affected not at all by that success. Having chased team-mate Nico Rosberg from the start, rarely more than two seconds behind, Hamilton sniffed an opportunity to win when the German was called in to change his tyres on lap 46 of the race at a raucously packed Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez. Media playback is not supported on this device Now in the lead, Hamilton was told by engineer Peter Bonnington to pit on the next lap. Immediately, he questioned it. \\"Can I ask why?\\" he said. The team were worried about tyre wear, he was told, before being ordered to \\"box this lap\\". Hamilton's mechanics were in the pit lane with his tyres, but he did not go in. Bonnington came back on the radio. \\"So, Lewis, you WILL be boxing next lap,\\" he said. Again Hamilton argued. \\"You need to check his (Rosberg's) tyres,\\" he said. \\"My tyres are all good.\\" \\"So, Lewis,\\" Bonnington said, his voice calm but increasingly firm, \\"we were down to zero on the first set. If we run longer on this set we will be down to zero if not worse so box at the end of this lap - instruction.\\" \\"I think that's the wrong call,\\" Hamilton replied, \\"but I'm coming in.\\" Hamilton's thinking was clear. He had been stuck all race. He felt he was faster, but the combination of low-grip track surface and disrupted aerodynamics meant he could not get close enough to Rosberg to try to pass him. But now he suddenly had an 18-second advantage with 25 laps to go, on tyres that were almost certainly capable of going to the end of the race. And in those circumstances, he fancied his chances of winning. The new tyres gave Rosberg about a second a lap in pace advantage. So, had the race run without a safety car - which it didn't, but at the time Hamilton was not to know that - he would probably have caught his team-mate before the end of the race. But Hamilton will have been thinking that he had held Rosberg off before in circumstances like that, and he could do it again. \\"There was no risk,\\" Hamilton said afterwards. \\"There was nothing for me to lose. We have won the constructors' championship, the team have won. So let me take a risk - let's go for it.\\" That is a racing driver thinking of himself, not the team. A racing driver talking with the confidence borne of comfortably beating Rosberg over the last two seasons, in which Hamilton has demonstrated both to his satisfaction and that of most observers that he is not only a slightly faster driver than the German but also far, far better at wheel-to-wheel racing. Media playback is not supported on this device His response to the team demonstrated his status, as their lead driver and as a man who has now achieved what only nine other drivers in history have done. And it demonstrated that, third title or not, he wants nothing more than to keep on winning, and grind Rosberg into the dust. Hamilton's willingness to debate with Bonnington also demonstrated a maturity and desire to take more of an involvement in his races from his car. Earlier in his career, this was missing, and it underlines his growth as a driver and as a sportsman. It is one of several 'added value' talents that mark out great drivers from merely very good ones. But it clashed with the team's job, which is first and foremost to finish one-two. For them, there was no benefit to not stopping for fresh tyres when they did, only potential downsides. Rosberg and Hamilton had absolutely dominated the race, and by lap 46 they had built enough of an advantage over the rest of the field to be able to stop for fresh tyres without losing the lead. In such circumstances, it is standard practice to do just that because there is nothing to lose. Engineers call it \\"protecting against a safety car\\" - reducing the risk of losing places if one is deployed in the event of an accident. And six laps after Rosberg's stop - four after Hamilton's - there was indeed a safety car, when an unusually off-form Sebastian Vettel finally did what he had been threatening to do all race and smashed his Ferrari into the barriers. If Mercedes had not stopped either driver when they did, it was Hamilton who would have been at risk when the safety car came out. The two cars would have been \\"stacked\\" in the pits - stopped at the same time - and Hamilton would have lost time, and potentially positions. Media playback is not supported on this device As for the claim that there was a safety issue, that was a reference to the fact that, as was demonstrated by the failures at the Belgian Grand Prix in August, when the tyres wear down there is an increased risk of a puncture. Not stopping would have meant Hamilton doing 43 laps on that set of tyres. Well within the predicted wear life - but then so were Vettel's when he suffered a 200mph blow-out at Spa in August. The Mercedes engineers did not want to take that risk. As team boss Toto Wolff said: \\"We had the option tyre down to the canvas (after the first stint), we had the margin for a safety stop and Lewis's tyres were more marginal than Nico's so we decided to do those. \\"It was not about tread left then, it was about the end of the race and we would not have risked a team result.\\" Following the decision to stop, Mercedes were sitting pretty. With fresh tyres, they had no need to stop when the safety car was deployed, and once it pulled off, Hamilton had 13 laps to have a go at his team-mate. As before, he could do nothing about him. Hamilton dodged the issue after the race, but privately he might well be thinking that he was right to think he should have stayed out. He had an 18-second lead after Rosberg's stop. The fresh tyres gave both drivers about a second a lap so Rosberg would nowhere near have caught Hamilton by the time the safety car was deployed on lap 52. At which point Hamilton could have come in for his fresh tyres and might have come out still in the lead - which he would almost certainly have kept to the end of the race. If he was thinking that, though, he did not say it. Indeed, in his post-race interviews he did not seem to have considered it - referring only to the fact that \\"the tyres would have got cool and Nico would have been right on my tail on fresh tyres\\". That suggests he was only considering not stopping at all, which almost certainly was the wrong decision - on fresh tyres with Hamilton on worn ones, Rosberg's chances of passing his team-mate would have been high. \\"We'll have a chat when we get back and I have full confidence in those guys,\\" Hamilton added. Not for the first time with Mercedes over the last two seasons, the events demonstrated the inherent tension in the relationship between a driver and his team, especially when that team is dominant and the two drivers are each other's only real rival. Mercedes' actions in Mexico were the latest in a series of examples of the team trying to be fair to both drivers while staying as much in control as possible. It was a strategy that got them into problems during last season, but which has not done so this year because Hamilton has generally been so superior and the championship has not been close. In different circumstances, though, it is the sort of decision that could cause Mercedes difficulties - and indeed has done already. An example would be last year's Hungarian Grand Prix, when the two drivers were on different strategies and Hamilton was ordered to let Rosberg by. That call was predicated on their pre-season agreement that each driver would be given the best chance to make his own strategy work if they were on differing ones. Media playback is not supported on this device But Hamilton knew that if he let Rosberg by, he would almost certainly be beaten by him - and having got himself into a position to compete for victory after starting from the back as a result of an engine fire in qualifying, and having already lost many points to reliability problems, he was not prepared to do that. And he refused. Rosberg was infuriated. But the team backed Hamilton, Wolff saying the team had made the wrong call. As a result of that, Mercedes took a different approach to race strategies from then on last year. But it was the grudge Rosberg bore after that decision that directly led to the collision he precipitated at the next race in Belgium. And the fall-out from that - a public and private dressing-down for Rosberg - completely changed the dynamic of both Mercedes internally and the season itself in Hamilton's favour. Mexico was not a dissimilar situation. A driver thinking of himself rather than the team. A miscommunication or apparent mistrust between him and his engineer. A potential victory denied. \\"It was clear he was questioning it because he saw an advantage,\\" team boss Toto Wolff said. \\"If he didn't do that he wouldn't be a racing driver. Finally it is clear the team knows what is happening out there on track and everything is cool.\\" For how long, though? With both titles already won, and relatively little at stake, it is likely this will blow over this time. But unless Wolff and co-team boss Paddy Lowe are not careful about how they handle the fall-out from Sunday's events with Hamilton, it's not impossible that at some point in the future what happened in Mexico might come back to haunt Mercedes. A summary of the above article is?","completion":"So, in this car race, a driver named Hamilton wanted to match the achievements of his childhood hero, Ayrton Senna. Hamilton chased another racer, Rosberg, and saw a chance to win when Rosberg changed his tires. Hamilton's team told him to change his tires too, but he questioned them and said his tires were still good. The team insisted, and Hamilton followed the instruction but disagreed with the decision. Hamilton thought he could've won if he didn't change his tires, but his team made the call to be safe and make sure they finished the race. Sometimes a driver thinks about themselves more than the team, and they can have disagreements, but they still work together to try to win the race."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the most logical next event? How to polish concrete Evaluate the concrete. Use a mohs hardness pick to determine the degree of mineral hardness. Determining whether the concrete is soft, medium, or hard will allow you to fine-tune the polishing process.","completion":"After evaluating the concrete using a Moh's hardness pick, the most logical next event is to proceed with the actual polishing process. Concrete polishing is a multi-step procedure that results in a high-gloss and smooth finish. It involves grinding, honing, and polishing the surface, and can also include densifying and sealing the concrete. Here is a step-by-step guide on how to polish concrete: 1. Choose the appropriate equipment and tools: Make sure you have the correct tools and equipment for the job. For large-scale projects, consider using a walk-behind, stand-up, or ride-on machine. For smaller surfaces, a hand-held grinder or floor polisher may suffice. You will also need diamond-impregnated abrasive discs with varying grits (starting from low to high) and a floor vacuum or dust collector to manage the dust generated during the process. 2. Prepare the surface: Remove any debris, sealants, adhesives, or coatings from the concrete surface. Repair any cracks and imperfections to ensure a smooth substrate. You can use an angle grinder with a diamond cup wheel or other appropriate tools to grind away any inconsistencies. 3. Start the grinding process: Begin with a low-grit diamond abrasive disc (such as 30 or 50 grit) attached to your grinder or polisher. Begin grinding in a forward and backward motion, covering small sections at a time. Be sure to overlap your passes to ensure even grinding. This step will remove any small imperfections and surface stains and open the pores of the concrete, preparing it for the honing phase. 4. Honing the surface: Switch to a higher-grit diamond abrasive disc (for example, 100 or 200 grit). Repeat the process, going over the entire surface. This step will remove scratches and provide a smoother finish. Continue to change the discs to higher grits (400, 800, etc.) until you achieve the desired level of shine and smoothness. Each progressive grit will remove scratches left by the previous one. 5. Apply a densifier: To enhance the hardness and durability of the surface, apply a concrete densifier. The densifier penetrates the concrete, filling the pores and reacts with the calcium hydroxide, forming a harder, more durable surface. Allow the densifier to cure according to the manufacturer's recommendations. 6. Polishing the surface: For achieving a high-gloss finish, switch to a fine-grit diamond abrasive disc (at least 800 grit or higher). Pass over the entire surface, achieving a consistent and glossy finish. Remember to overlap passes. 7. Apply a sealer (optional): Once the desired gloss has been achieved, you may apply a sealer to protect the polished surface. Select a sealer compatible with your concrete and follow the manufacturer's recommendations for application and curing. 8. Cleanup and maintenance: Properly clean and maintain the equipment after use. Dust and debris should be vacuumed, or the floor should be mopped. For long-term care, periodic cleaning with a neutral-pH cleaner is recommended to maintain the polished surface. By following these steps, you can successfully complete the concrete polishing process, providing an aesthetically pleasing and durable result that is low-maintenance and long-lasting."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: An experimental drug derived from peanuts protected some children and adolescents with life-threatening peanut allergies, according to a study, allowing the subjects to eat small amounts of peanuts without suffering a serious reaction. The drug, from a small California company, Aimmune Therapeutics, didn’t work for everyone, has some side effects and hasn’t been approved by regulators for sale. Yet the findings from the late-stage trial promise a potential new solution for peanut allergies, a growing concern. ... ||||| Abstract Background Peanut allergy, for which there are no approved treatment options, affects patients who are at risk for unpredictable and occasionally life-threatening allergic reactions. Methods In a phase 3 trial, we screened participants 4 to 55 years of age with peanut allergy for allergic dose-limiting symptoms at a challenge dose of 100 mg or less of peanut protein (approximately one third of a peanut kernel) in a double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenge. Participants with an allergic response were randomly assigned, in a 3:1 ratio, to receive AR101 (a peanut-derived investigational biologic oral immunotherapy drug) or placebo in an escalating-dose program. Participants who completed the regimen (i.e., received 300 mg per day of the maintenance regimen for approximately 24 weeks) underwent a double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenge at trial exit. The primary efficacy end point was the proportion of participants 4 to 17 years of age who could ingest a challenge dose of 600 mg or more, without dose-limiting symptoms. Results Of the 551 participants who received AR101 or placebo, 496 were 4 to 17 years of age; of these, 250 of 372 participants (67.2%) who received active treatment, as compared with 5 of 124 participants (4.0%) who received placebo, were able to ingest a dose of 600 mg or more of peanut protein, without dose-limiting symptoms, at the exit food challenge (difference, 63.2 percentage points; 95% confidence interval, 53.0 to 73.3; P<0.001). During the exit food challenge, the maximum severity of symptoms was moderate in 25% of the participants in the active-drug group and 59% of those in the placebo group and severe in 5% and 11%, respectively. Adverse events during the intervention period affected more than 95% of the participants 4 to 17 years of age. A total of 34.7% of the participants in the active-drug group had mild events, as compared with 50.0% of those in the placebo group; 59.7% and 44.4% of the participants, respectively, had events that were graded as moderate, and 4.3% and 0.8%, respectively, had events that were graded as severe. Efficacy was not shown in the participants 18 years of age or older. Conclusions In this phase 3 trial of oral immunotherapy in children and adolescents who were highly allergic to peanut, treatment with AR101 resulted in higher doses of peanut protein that could be ingested without dose-limiting symptoms and in lower symptom severity during peanut exposure at the exit food challenge than placebo. (Funded by Aimmune Therapeutics; PALISADE ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02635776.) ||||| Experts who were not involved in the trial said the outcomes exceeded their expectations, calling the results “potentially lifesaving.” But they also cautioned that the treatment does not cure peanut allergies and should not be attempted at home. They emphasized that children who complete the regimen need to continue to eat a peanut-free diet and may need to keep up maintenance therapy with minute doses of peanut, possibly for the rest of their lives. “This is not the cure, but it is a good first step,” said Dr. James R. Baker Jr., chief medical officer of Food Allergy Research & Education (FARE), a nonprofit advocacy group that focuses on food allergies, noting the results were better than he expected. Until now, he said, “We’ve had nothing, nothing to give these poor kids that can keep them from having these reactions and put them in a much more positive outlook on life. It’s just a wonderful thing to have. “The fact that the kids were eating the equivalent of a peanut a day pretty much tells you that if they accidentally eat a peanut, they won’t have a life-threatening reaction,” Dr. Baker said. Michael Perkin, a clinical epidemiologist and pediatric allergy consultant at St. George’s, University of London who wrote an accompanying editorial about the study, said the regimen was “not a walk in the park” and requires tremendous discipline. Children are required to rest for two hours after receiving their daily dose but cannot fall asleep because of the risk of a reaction. Dr. Perkin said that the long-term side effects of consuming allergens when one has a severe allergy are still unknown. But he described the results as “beyond exciting.” “It isn’t a cure like an antibiotic that makes a bug go away and it’s not there anymore,” he said. But “psychologically it makes a massive difference if you can keep your kid from living in fear. These kids can eat enough peanut that parents no longer will have to worry about their teenage daughter kissing someone who’s eaten peanut butter. You cannot estimate what a psychological relief that is.” For children like Carter Grodi, a junior in high school in Ocala, Fla., who completed the treatment a year ago and continues to ingest a small amount of peanut every day to maintain his low-level tolerance, the treatment was transformative, making it easier to go out with friends and make plans to go away for college. |||||","completion":"A study has found that an experimental drug derived from peanuts, AR101 by Aimmune Therapeutics, has shown promising results in protecting some children and adolescents with severe peanut allergies. The late-stage trial revealed that 67.2% of participants aged 4 to 17 who underwent the treatment could subsequently ingest a dose of 600mg or more of peanut protein without experiencing severe symptoms. However, the treatment is not a cure for peanut allergies, and patients must still maintain a peanut-free diet and possibly continue maintenance therapy with small doses of peanut. Additionally, the therapy was not effective for participants aged 18 and older. Though the drug poses potential side effects and has not yet been approved for sale, experts see the results as a promising first step in managing life-threatening peanut allergies."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Millions of men and women readied themselves for work. Some made their way to the Twin Towers, the signature structures of the World Trade Center complex in New York City. Others went to Arlington, Virginia, to the Pentagon. Across the Potomac River, the United States Congress was back in session. At the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, people began to line up for a White House tour. In Sarasota, Florida, President George W. Bush went for an early morning run. For those heading to an airport, weather conditions could not have been better for a safe and pleasant journey. Among the travelers were Mohamed Atta and Abdul Aziz al Omari, who arrived at the airport in Portland, Maine. Boston: American 11 and United 175. Atta and Omari boarded a 6:00 A.M. flight from Portland to Boston's Logan International Airport. When he checked in for his flight to Boston, Atta was selected by a computerized prescreening system known as CAPPS (Computer Assisted Passenger Prescreening System), created to identify passengers who should be subject to special security measures. Under security rules in place at the time, the only consequence of Atta's selection by CAPPS was that his checked bags were held off the plane until it was confirmed that he had boarded the aircraft. This did not hinder Atta's plans. Atta and Omari arrived in Boston at 6:45. Seven minutes later, Atta apparently took a call from Marwan al Shehhi, a longtime colleague who was at another terminal at Logan Airport. They spoke for three minutes. It would be their final conversation. Question: \\"What time did Atta hang up the phone call with Marwan al Shehhi?\\" Answer: \\"At 6:55 in the morning\\" Based on the paragraph, choose if the answer is correct: A. no; B. yes;","completion":"Answer: B. yes Explanation: The paragraph states \\"Atta and Omari arrived in Boston at 6:45. Seven minutes later, Atta apparently took a call from Marwan al Shehhi...\\" This indicates that the phone call started at about 6:52. The paragraph also provides information that they spoke for three minutes. By adding the duration of the call (3 minutes) to the time the call started (6:52), we calculate that the call ended at 6:55. Therefore, the answer \\"At 6:55 in the morning\\" is correct, making option B. yes the right choice.

They made their trek over the Santa Fe Trail to Santa Fe, the capital of Santa Fe de Nuevo Mexico, reaching their destination in November 1826. Kit settled in Taos. Carson lived with Mathew Kinkead, a trapper and explorer who had served with Carson's older brothers during the War of 1812. Carson was mentored by Kinkead in learning the skills of a trapper, while learning the necessary languages for trade. Eventually he became fluent in Spanish and several Indian languages. Workman put an advertisement in a local newspaper back in Missouri. He wrote that he would give a one cent reward to anyone who brought the boy back to Franklin. No one claimed the reward.

Given the below context: The company, retaining the title \\"Sadler's Wells Opera\\", opened at the Coliseum on 21 August 1968, with a new production of Mozart's Don Giovanni, directed by Sir John Gielgud. Though this production was not well received, the company rapidly established itself with a succession of highly praised productions of other works. Arlen died in January 1972, and was succeeded as managing director by Lord Harewood.The success of the 1968 Mastersingers was followed in the 1970s by the company's first Ring cycle, conducted by Goodall, with a new translation by Andrew Porter and designs by Ralph Koltai. The cast included Norman Bailey, Rita Hunter and Alberto Remedios. In Harewood's view, among the highlights of the first ten years at the Coliseum were the Ring, Prokofiev's War and Peace, and Richard Strauss's Salome and Der Rosenkavalier. The company's musical director from 1970 to 1977 was Charles Mackerras. Harewood praised his exceptional versatility, with a range \\"from The House of the Dead to Patience.\\" Among the operas he conducted for the company were Handel's Julius Caesar starring Janet Baker and Valerie Masterson; five Janáček operas; The Marriage of Figaro with pioneering use of 18th century performing style; Massenet's Werther; Donizetti's Mary Stuart with Baker; and Sullivan's Patience. The company took the production of the last to the Vienna Festival in 1975, along with Britten's Gloriana. Sir Charles Groves succeeded Mackerras as musical director from 1978 to 1979, but Groves was unwell and unhappy during his brief tenure. Starting in 1979, Mark Elder succeeded Groves in the post, and described Groves \\"immensely encouraging and supportive\\".A long-standing concern of Arlen and then Harewood was the need to change the company's name to reflect the fact that it was no longer based at Sadler's Wells theatre.

Secondly, our experience of time, at the macroscopic level, is not time-reversal invariant. Glasses can fall and break, but shards of glass cannot reassemble and fly up onto tables.

Context: Wagner was not finished playing baseball after his retirement from major league baseball. He managed and played for a semi-pro team. After retirement, Wagner served the Pirates as a coach for 39 years, most notably as a hitting instructor from 1933 to 1952. Arky Vaughan, Ralph Kiner, Pie Traynor (player-manager from 1934-1939), and Hank Greenberg (although, Greenberg was in his final major league season in 1947, his only season with the Pirates, and very well established) all future Hall of Famers, were notable \\"pupils\\" of Wagner. During this time, he wore uniform number 14, but later changed it to his more famous 33, which was later the number retired for him.

Answer the following question: If I tell you that Bacteria increases the amount of organic matter in soil, and ask you the question \\"what would increase the amount of organic matter in soil?\\", is the correct answer \\"coal\\"? Answer:","completion":"No, the correct answer is not \\"coal.\\" The correct answer would be \\"bacteria,\\" as you mentioned in your statement. Bacteria play a vital role in decomposing organic materials and increasing the amount of organic matter in soil. They help break down complex organic compounds into simpler compounds, which can be utilized by plants or other organisms in the soil ecosystem. Coal, on the other hand, is a non-renewable resource composed primarily of carbon and hydrocarbons. It is formed from the remains of ancient plant material subjected to geological forces over millions of years. While coal does contain carbon, it does not directly contribute to increasing the organic matter in soil when left in its solid state. Bacteria and other decomposer organisms contribute to the formation of humus, a dark-colored organic substance that results from the decay and decomposition of organic matter in the soil. Humus improves soil structure, fertility, and water retention, which are crucial for maintaining a healthy ecosystem. Additionally, the activities of bacteria and other microorganisms recycle nutrients in the soil and make them available to plants. Some types of bacteria also form symbiotic relationships with plants, assisting in processes such as nitrogen fixation, which further enriches the soil. In conclusion, while coal is a source of carbon and hydrocarbons, it does not directly contribute to the organic matter content within the soil. Bacteria and other decomposers, on the other hand, are responsible for breaking down organic materials, increasing the amount of organic matter in soil, and maintaining and improving soil fertility."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Stemming from multiple treaties and federal legislation, including the Indian Appropriations Act (1851), the Dawes Act (1887), and the Indian Reorganization Act (1934), seven Indian reservations, encompassing eleven tribal nations, were created in Montana. A twelfth nation, the Little Shell Chippewa is a \\"landless\\" people headquartered in Great Falls, recognized by the state of Montana but not by the U.S. Government. The Blackfeet nation is headquartered on the Blackfeet Indian Reservation (1851) in Browning, Crow on the Crow Indian Reservation (1851) in Crow Agency, Confederated Salish and Kootenai and Pend d'Oreille on the Flathead Indian Reservation (1855) in Pablo, Northern Cheyenne on the Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation (1884) at Lame Deer, Assiniboine and Gros Ventre on the Fort Belknap Indian Reservation (1888) in Fort Belknap Agency, Assiniboine and Sioux on the Fort Peck Indian Reservation (1888) at Poplar, and Chippewa-Cree on the Rocky Boy's Indian Reservation (1916) near Box Elder. Approximately 63% of all Native people live off the reservations, concentrated in the larger Montana cities with the largest concentration of urban Indians in Great Falls.

Translate to English","completion":"American leadership - around the world and in Asia - can no longer continue by itself. The statement points out that the United States, which has long been a global leader, particularly in the Asian region, is now facing a situation where it cannot maintain its leadership position without adapting to new circumstances or relying on collaboration. This shift can be attributed to a variety of reasons, which we will explore in more detail below. 1. The rise of other global powers: As more countries like China, India, and the European Union strengthen their economic, political, and military capabilities, the hegemony the United States has traditionally enjoyed is being challenged. Nations are now looking to these powers to provide alternative leadership and solutions, thereby reducing the influence and reach of American leadership. 2. Changing geopolitical landscape: The world has evolved significantly since the post-WWII era when the United States emerged as a dominant force. Today, countries are realigning their alliances and partnerships, and some nations are no longer willing to be compliant with American objectives. This transformation puts a strain on the ability of the United States to assert its influence and leadership, especially in the Asian region. 3. Trade wars and economic disputes: Recent trade disputes, such as the ongoing tensions between the United States and China, have weakened the relationship between these two countries and disrupted global trade. These economic fissures have further eroded the confidence of other nations in American leadership, as countries around the world look for more stable partners. 4. Perception of American decline: The perception of a relative decline in American influence is becoming more prominent, partly due to internal political divisions and the country's response to global challenges, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. As this perception grows, it becomes increasingly difficult for the United States to portray itself as a global leader and maintain its traditional position within the international community. 5. Emphasis on multilateralism: There is a growing understanding that many global challenges - including climate change, public health crises, and international conflicts - require a collaborative approach. Consequently, the importance of multilateral institutions and alliances is increasing, potentially diminishing the role of a single dominant power like the United States in favor of international cooperation. In conclusion, American leadership around the world, and specifically in Asia, is facing significant challenges due to the rise of other global powers, changing geopolitical landscapes, trade disputes, perceptions of American decline, and the need for increased multilateralism. To maintain its influence and leadership, the United States must adapt to these changing circumstances, potentially by fostering new alliances, working collaboratively on global challenges, and re-establishing its position as a partner and leader in the international community."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

I read this background article the other day: Chemical equilibrium was studied by French chemist Henri Le Châtelier (1850-1936), and his description of how a system at equilibrium responds to a change in conditions has become known as Le Châtelier’s principle . This principle states that when a chemical system is at equilibrium and is disturbed by a stress, the system will respond by attempting to counteract that stress until a new equilibrium is established. Stresses to a chemical system include changes in the concentrations of reactants or products, changes in the temperature of the system, or changes in the pressure of the system. We will discuss each of these stresses separately. In each case, the change to the equilibrium position will cause either the forward or reverse reaction to be favored over the opposite process. When the forward reaction is favored, the concentrations of the products increase, and the concentrations of the reactants decrease. When the reverse reaction is favored, the concentrations of the products decrease, and the concentrations of the reactants increase. I am facing a new situation today: David was conducting experiments on chemical equilibrium in the chemistry lab. First, he took a chemical system that was at equilibrium. He labeled it as case E. Then he changed the temperature of the system. He labeled that experiment as case T. Finally, he observed two more experiments, case A and case B. In case A forward reaction was favored, and in case B reverse reaction was favored. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Would the reactants concentration increase or decrease in case A than in case B?","completion":"In case A, the forward reaction is favored, which means that the reactants are consumed to form more products. As a result, the concentration of reactants will decrease in case A. On the other hand, in case B, the reverse reaction is favored, meaning that the products are converted back into reactants. This leads to an increase in the concentration of reactants in case B. Therefore, comparing case A and case B, the concentration of reactants would be lower in case A than in case B as the forward reaction is favored in case A and the reverse reaction is favored in case B."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Information: - A village is a clustered human settlement or community, larger than a hamlet but smaller than a town, with a population ranging from a few hundred to a few thousand. Though often located in rural areas, the term urban village is also applied to certain urban neighbourhoods. Villages are normally permanent, with fixed dwellings; however, transient villages can occur. Further, the dwellings of a village are fairly close to one another, not scattered broadly over the landscape, as a dispersed settlement. - La Mancha is a natural and historical region located on an arid but fertile, elevated plateau (610 m or 2000 ft.) of central Spain, south of Madrid, from the mountains of Toledo to the western spurs of the hills of Cuenca, and bordered to the South by the Sierra Morena and to the North by the Alcarria region. La Mancha includes portions of the modern provinces of Cuenca, Toledo, and Albacete, and most of the Ciudad Real province. La Mancha historical comarca constitutes the southern portion of CastillaLa Mancha autonomous community and makes up most of the present-day administrative region. - A county is a geographical region of a country used for administrative or other purposes, in certain modern nations. The term is derived from the Old French \\"conté\\" or \\"cunté\\" denoting a jurisdiction under the sovereignty of a count (earl) or a viscount. The modern French is \\"comté\\", and its equivalents in other languages are \\"contea\\", \\"contado\\", \\"comtat\\", \\"condado\\", \\"Grafschaft\\", \\"graafschap\\", \\"Gau\\", etc. (cf. \\"conte\\", \\"comte\\", \\"conde\\", \\"Graf\\"). - Spain, officially the Kingdom of Spain, is a sovereign state largely located on the Iberian Peninsula in southwestern Europe, with two large archipelagos, the Balearic Islands in the Mediterranean Sea and the Canary Islands off the North African Atlantic coast, two cities Ceuta and Melilla in the North African mainland and several small islands in the Alboran Sea near the Moroccan coast. Its mainland is bordered to the south and east by the Mediterranean Sea except for a small land boundary with Gibraltar; to the north and northeast by France, Andorra, and the Bay of Biscay; and to the west and northwest by Portugal and the Atlantic Ocean. It is the only European country to have a border with an African country (Morocco) and its African territory accounts for nearly 5% of its population, mostly in the Canary Islands but also in Ceuta and Melilla. - Ciudad Real (English: \\"Royal City\\") is a city in CastileLa Mancha, Spain, with a population of c. 75,000. It is the capital of the province of Ciudad Real. It has a stop on the AVE high-speed rail line and has begun to grow as a long-distance commuter suburb of Madrid, which is located 115 miles (185 km) to the north of Ciudad Real. - A comarca (, pl. \\"comarcas\\" pl. \\"comarques\\") is a traditional region or local administrative division found in parts of Spain, Portugal, Panama, Nicaragua, and Brazil. The term is derived from the term marca, meaning a \\"march, mark\\", plus the prefix \\"co\\"- meaning \\"together, jointly\\". - An administrative division, unit, entity, area or region, also referred to as a subnational entity, constituent unit, or country subdivision, is a portion of a country or other region delineated for the purpose of administration. Administrative divisions are granted a certain degree of autonomy and are usually required to manage themselves through their own local governments. Countries are divided up into these smaller units to make managing their land and the affairs of their people easier. For example, a country may be divided into provinces, which, in turn, are divided into counties, which, in turn, may be divided in whole or in part into municipalities; and so on. - A town is a human settlement larger than a village but smaller than a city. The size definition for what constitutes a \\"town\\" varies considerably in different parts of the world. - A natural region is a basic geographic unit. Usually it is a region which is distinguished by its common natural features of geography, geology, and climate. - The province of Ciudad Real is a province in the southwestern part of the autonomous community of Castile-La Mancha, Spain. It is bordered by the provinces of Cuenca, Albacete, Jaén, Córdoba, Badajoz, and Toledo. It is partly located in the old natural region of La Mancha. Its capital is Ciudad Real. It is the third biggest province of Spain, after Cáceres and Badajoz. The historical comarca Campo de Calatrava is located in the centre of the province. - Villanueva de los Infantes is a municipality in the province of Ciudad Real , Castile - La Mancha , Spain . It has a population of 5727 people . This is also the capital of the comarca ( region ) Campo de Montiel . It has been designated by the Universidad Complutense de Madrid as \`\` El Lugar de La Mancha '' ( The Place in La Mancha ) mentioned at the start of Don Quixote by Miguel Cervantes . It is also known as the place where Francisco de Quevedo died ; his remains were found in 2007 in the church of San Andrés Apostol ( St. Andrew 's Church ) . We could visit the room of the convent where Quevedo spend his last days before died . The convent is now the church of \`\` Santo Domingo '' and this room is situated inside it . Economy is based on tourism , wine and olives . The town should not be confused with another Villanueva de los Infantes , in the province of Valladolid , which is part of the Castile and León autonomous community . - A municipality is usually a single urban administrative division having corporate status and powers of self-government or jurisdiction as granted by national and state laws, to which it is subordinate. It is to be distinguished from the county, which may encompass rural territory and/or numerous small communities such as towns, villages and hamlets. The term \\"municipality\\" may also mean the governing or ruling body of a given municipality. A municipality is a general-purpose administrative subdivision, as opposed to a special-purpose district. The term is derived from French \\"municipalité\\" and Latin \\"municipalis\\". What is the relationship between 'villanueva de los infantes' and 'ciudad real province'? Answer:","completion":"Villanueva de los Infantes is a municipality located within the Ciudad Real Province.

Question 2: How many lines can you make through a point? Select from: - no. - yes. Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","completion":"In order to provide a detailed and long answer, I will address both questions separately and then determine whether they are asking the same thing or not. Question 1: What is the significance of the projective plane in mathematics? A projective plane is an abstract mathematical concept that can be understood as a geometric structure that extends the concept of a plane. In the projective plane, there is a point for each straight line in the familiar Euclidean plane and a line for each point in the Euclidean plane. The projective plane has the unique property that any pair of lines intersects in exactly one point, and any pair of points is joined by exactly one line. This property is called the incidence relation. The significance of the projective plane in mathematics lies in its applications and its role in providing a more general framework for studying geometry. Some key applications and benefits of the projective plane include: 1. Homogenization of coordinates: In projective geometry, every point can be represented with homogeneous coordinates, which simplifies various algebraic and geometric calculations. 2. Intersection of lines and curves: The projective plane enables us to find the intersection points between lines and curves more easily, since all lines intersect, even seemingly parallel lines which meet at a point at infinity. 3. Transfer of properties: Projective geometry allows for the transfer of properties from one geometric figure to another through projective transformations. This is beneficial for studying invariance and equivalence between different configurations. 4. Perspective and computer graphics: The projective plane plays a significant role in perspective drawing and computer graphics, specifically in transforming 3D scenes into 2D images. 5. Finite geometry: Projective planes are also relevant in the study of combinatorics, error-correcting codes, and the design of experiments. Question 2: How many lines can you make through a point? In the context of the Euclidean plane, through any given point, you can draw an infinite number of lines as there are infinitely many directions in which the line can be drawn. For each direction, there will be a unique line passing through the given point. This concept can be extended to higher dimensions as well. Comparison: Questions 1 and 2 are not asking the same thing. Question 1 is about the significance of the projective plane in mathematics, while Question 2 is about the number of lines that can be made through a given point. Although both questions deal with geometric concepts and the properties of lines and points, they address different aspects of the subject matter. Therefore, none of the provided options, \\"no\\" or \\"yes,\\" are relevant to the content of the two questions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Given the question \\"What will Sydney want to do next?\\", is \\"skilled\\" a valid answer? A:","completion":"To determine if \\"skilled\\" is a valid answer to the question \\"What will Sydney want to do next?\\" after her shocking ski trip, we need to analyze the context and possible meanings of the given information. Sydney has taken a ski trip to a few states and has experienced some shocking moments during her trip. However, the nature of these shocking moments is not explicitly explained. To answer the question based on the available information, we can explore different aspects and factors that could affect Sydney's decisions and interests. 1. Skill Improvement: Assuming that the shocking moments Sydney encountered were related to her skiing abilities and challenges she faced on the slopes, it could imply that Sydney might want to improve her skiing skills. In this context, \\"skilled\\" could be valid, albeit indirect, as an answer. Sydney might consider taking ski lessons, attending coaching sessions, or training more to become a skilled and confident skier. 2. Personal growth or overcoming fears: If the shock arises from a fear of skiing, heights, or the different conditions she encountered on her trip, Sydney might want to address these fears and develop her resilience. Although \\"skilled\\" would not directly answer this question, it might be a part of the process of overcoming these fears and adapting to various skiing situations. 3. Diversifying experiences: Suppose Sydney wants to explore more skiing opportunities or locations to have richer experiences or better manage unexpected surprises. In that case, \\"skilled\\" might not be the most suitable answer to the question. In this case, expecting Sydney to want to visit more ski destinations or try various skiing disciplines would be more appropriate. 4. Alternatives to skiing: If Sydney's shock resulted in a loss of interest in skiing or other adverse effects, Sydney might consider taking a break from skiing or trying different activities. In this scenario, \\"skilled\\" would not be a valid answer to the question. Instead, Sydney might be expected to engage in alternative activities such as snowboarding, hiking, or other winter sports. Based on the different interpretations and contextual possibilities, \\"skilled\\" alone might not specifically answer the question or capture Sydney's intentions and desires for her next steps. A more precise and detailed response would consider the reasons behind Sydney's shock and how her experiences might influence her decisions and interests going forward."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please briefly summarize this news article: World Series Game 2 just a taste of Cards' pitching plethora - MLB News Updated Oct 25, 2013 11:07 AM ET Here’s the crazy part, or at least one crazy part. When three pitchers age 23 or younger combine to stymie the majors’ highest-scoring offense — on the road, in the World Series — crazy sort of becomes a relative term. But you want truly nuts? The St. Louis Cardinals, as currently constituted, will not have room in their 2014 rotation for right-hander Carlos Martinez, who pitched a scoreless seventh and eighth against the Boston Red Sox on Thursday night in Game 2 of the Series — and sits between 97 and 99 mph for six innings at a time as a starter in the minor leagues. Nope, the Cardinals will have six starters ahead of Martinez, if you can believe that — Adam Wainwright, Michael Wacha, Lance Lynn, Joe Kelly, Shelby Miller and Jaime Garcia, who will be coming off shoulder surgery. Come to think of it, Trevor Rosenthal might be an interesting candidate for the rotation, too, but sorry, there is no room at the inn for him, either. Wacha, 22, allowed two runs in six innings in the Cardinals’ breathtaking 4-2 victory Thursday night. Martinez, 22, held the red-hot David Ortiz, representing the tying run, to an infield single, then popped up Mike Napoli to escape the eighth. Rosenthal, 23, struck out the side in the ninth on 11 pitches, all fastballs, 95 to 99 mph. “To watch what they’ve come from, what they’ve grown into, is so much fun,” said veteran right-hander Chris Carpenter, who has remained with the club despite missing the entire season with a shoulder injury. “They really do enjoy the situation. They’re not scared. They want to take the ball and do this. I haven’t seen that very often, when you’ve got these young kids coming in with zero fear.” Wacha is now 4-0 with a 1.00 ERA in the postseason. Martinez, almost overnight, looks like one of the game’s best setup men. And Rosenthal, sheesh, we saw his act last postseason, and he certainly seems rather comfortable in the closer’s role, which he claimed only in late September. As veteran right-hander Adam Wainwright put it, “Those two guys at the end of the game are ridiculous.” Wainwright, whose average fastball during the regular season was 91.2 mph, according to Fangraphs.com, also joked that he will be the rotation’s “change-of-pace” guy in the future, because all of the kids throw harder. Yet, this is not just about talent. Third baseman David Freese said catcher Yadier Molina is a human guidepost for the young pitchers. Bench coach Mike Aldrete said the team’s veterans help acclimate the youngsters, ribbing them on occasion but also treating them as part of the team, not “second-class citizens.” Carpenter, meanwhile, said manager Mike Matheny deserves “huge props” for not simply believing in the kids, but trusting them. Case in point: Eighth inning, runner on first with two outs, the left-handed hitting Ortiz set to face the right-handed Martinez. The by-the-book move would have been to summon veteran lefty Randy Choate for the platoon advantage, but Matheny stuck with Martinez, who threw 96 to 98 mph and got two of his three strikeouts on breaking balls. “At this time of year, stuff plays,” Aldrete said. “And that’s pretty good stuff.” Still, the first question to Red Sox manager John Farrell in the postgame interview room was, “Were you surprised when they left Carlos Martinez in the game to face Ortiz?” Farrell basically said no, citing Martinez’s stuff. And Martinez, despite allowing the single by Ortiz, said, “I knew I had the stuff to get him out.” “Carlos gave up the run yesterday,” Matheny said, referring to Martinez’s Series debut in the eighth inning of Game 1. “He wasn't happy with how he went about it. He was very animated about how badly he wanted to pitch again and get back out there. And he proved that it wasn't just a lot of talk. He went out and did a great job.” So, for that matter, did Wacha, who slammed his glove in the dugout after making one mistake — a 3-2 changeup that Ortiz hit over the Green Monster to give the Red Sox a 2-1 lead in the sixth inning. Wacha had been so good in his first three postseason starts, allowing just one run in 21 innings, that this one seemed like a clunker by comparison. It was anything but. Farrell noted that Wacha began flipping his curveball in his later innings to give hitters a different look. If Wacha ever develops a quality curve to go with his stunning fastball-changeup combination, the game will be almost unfair. The big reason Wacha dropped to No. 19 in last year’s draft was his lack of a solid breaking pitch. And now he’s addressing the problem in must-win World Series games. We still haven’t seen Kelly and Lynn, who could give the Cardinals an edge in Games 3 and 4 over the Red Sox’s excitable Jake Peavy and fading Clay Buchholz. We might not even see Miller, who went 15-9 with a 3.06 ERA in the regular season but is not part of the postseason rotation. The scary part is, the Cardinals are just getting started, and none of the veterans are surprised by the youngsters’ performances on the game’s biggest stage. “Not at all,” Wainwright. “That’s exactly what I thought was going to happen, except I thought Mikey was going to give up no runs.” Nothing is crazy with this bunch.","completion":"In the World Series Game 2, the St. Louis Cardinals showcased their impressive array of young pitchers aged 23 or younger, including Michael Wacha, Carlos Martinez, and Trevor Rosenthal, who managed to stymie the majors' highest-scoring offense. Despite their impressive performance, the team will not have room for Carlos Martinez in their 2014 rotation, as they have six other starters ahead. The young pitchers demonstrated significant skill and revealed their potential for growth. Their success is attributed to a combination of talent, guidance from experienced players, and the trust placed in them by their manager, Mike Matheny. This deep pool of talented pitchers gives the Cardinals a notable advantage and shows that they are only just beginning to showcase their skills."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

(CNN) -- Japan's prime minister conceded defeat in parliamentary elections Sunday, signaling the return to power of the Liberal Democratic Party and ending the brief rule of the disappointing upstart Democratic Party of Japan. Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda pledged to step down as party president after exit polls showed a smashing loss in lower house voting. The party, once seen as a breath of fresh air in Japanese politics, came to be regarded as increasingly ineffective. \\"We got a regrettable result,\\" Noda said. \\"The result is everything in the politics. The biggest responsibility lies on me. I will quit as the partly leader of DPJ.\\" The move clears the way for the return to power of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, the current leader of the conservative-leaning Liberal Democratic Party, or LDP. \\"The Japanese people will be keenly looking whether the LDP can meet with their expectations,\\" Abe said in interviews after the polling. The LDP ruled the country almost continuously since its establishment in 1955 until it was forced from power three years ago by the DPJ. Public broadcaster NHK said the LDP and its coalition partner, the new Komei party, gained at least 302 seats in the 480-seat lower house. CNN's main affiliate, TV Asahi, reports the LDP/Komei coalition gained at least 312 seats. The official count is expected to be released Monday. The LDP is inheriting a struggling economy, regional tensions and questions over Japan's role in Asia. \\"The economy is at the bottom. It's our first mission to turn it around,\\" Abe said.

First, let's break down the information provided in the statement: 1. There are two individuals involved - specifically, two men. 2. These men are in the ocean. 3. They are surfing on boards. 4. They are trying to catch some waves. Now, the question asks if we can conclude that \\"There are two women surfing\\" from the given statement. Let's evaluate the available options and analyze their validity: Option A: Yes. Based on the information given, it is evident that there are two people surfing, and they are explicitly identified as men. Since they are identified as men, it cannot be concluded that there are two women surfing. Therefore, this option is not correct. Option B: It is not possible to tell. Choosing this option implies that there is not enough information to determine whether there are women surfing or not. However, the statement clearly establishes that there are two men surfing, and there is no mention of women or any additional surfers. Thus, it is possible to derive conclusions from the given information, so this option is also not accurate. Option C: No. This option suggests that we cannot conclude, based on the provided information, that there are two women surfing. As mentioned earlier, the statement explicitly identifies the surfers as men. There is no mention of women or any other individuals involved. Therefore, it is safe to assume that there are no women surfing in this context. Option C is the correct choice, as it correctly eliminates the possibility of women surfing based on the information provided.

Once upon a time, in a city called Reno, in the state of Nevada, there was a very important person named Paul Ryan. Paul Ryan was not a prince or a superhero, but he was a very important person because he used to be one of the people who helped make the rules for the whole country. He had many friends who were also important people, and they all worked together to try to make the country a nice place for everyone to live. One sunny day, Paul Ryan decided to go to Reno, Nevada, to meet some people called airmen. Airmen are like pilots, but they also help protect our country and make sure that we are all safe. They fly big airplanes that can go very, very high up in the sky and very, very fast. Sometimes they even go all the way around the world! Airmen are a special kind of brave, and Paul Ryan wanted to say \\"thank you\\" to them for being such good helpers. When Paul Ryan got to Reno, he went to a big, big place with lots of airplanes called an Air Force Base. The Air Force Base is kind of like a playground for airmen, where they can practice flying their airplanes and learn about new and fun things that will help them be even better at their jobs. All the airmen were very excited to meet Paul Ryan, and they had lots of questions for him. They asked him about his job and what it was like to make rules for the whole country. Paul Ryan told them that it was a big responsibility, but it was also a lot of fun because he got to meet so many different people and learn about all the things that were important to them. Paul Ryan also asked the airmen lots of questions. He wanted to know what it was like to fly so high and so fast, and what they did to get ready for their jobs. The airmen told him that they train a lot, just like how you practice riding your bike or tying your shoes. They also said that they have to be brave and work together as a team, just like how you and your friends play together on the playground. After they finished talking, Paul Ryan took pictures with the airmen so they could remember their special day. Then he said goodbye, and the airmen went back to their important job of keeping us all safe.

I'm talking about special little parts inside a woman's body - these are called eggs too, but they have the possibility of becoming a baby in the future.

How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect","completion":"During resting or sleeping, the body's metabolic rate decreases, which also reduces the demand for oxygen by the cells. As a result, the respiratory rate might slow down, and your body doesn't require as much oxygen as when you're physically active. However, the oxygen delivery process and its efficiency do not necessarily change during rest or sleep. Due to the lowered demand for oxygen, the body adequately meets the needs without increasing oxygen supply. Therefore, resting or sleeping does not lead to a greater amount of oxygen being delivered to the bloodstream. Thus, the supposed perturbation during rest or sleep has no effect on the second step mentioned, which is the oxygen traveling from the alveoli into the blood."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It causes levee and dam failure, as well as sink hole formation. Turbulent flow removes soil starting at the mouth of the seep flow and the subsoil erosion advances up-gradient. The term sand boil is used to describe the appearance of the discharging end of an active soil pipe.Soil salination is the accumulation of free salts to such an extent that it leads to degradation of the agricultural value of soils and vegetation. Consequences include corrosion damage, reduced plant growth, erosion due to loss of plant cover and soil structure, and water quality problems due to sedimentation. Salination occurs due to a combination of natural and human-caused processes. Arid conditions favour salt accumulation. This is especially apparent when soil parent material is saline. Irrigation of arid lands is especially problematic. All irrigation water has some level of salinity. Irrigation, especially when it involves leakage from canals and overirrigation in the field, often raises the underlying water table. Rapid salination occurs when the land surface is within the capillary fringe of saline groundwater. Soil salinity control involves watertable control and flushing with higher levels of applied water in combination with tile drainage or another form of subsurface drainage.

Would the following phrase be considered positive or negative? all for easy sanctimony , formulaic thrills and a ham-fisted sermon on the need for national health insurance","completion":"The given phrase can be generally considered as negative in tone, as it reflects a certain level of dissatisfaction and criticism. Let's analyze it more closely: 1. \\"all for easy sanctimony\\": The term \\"sanctimony\\" indicates an excessive display of moral superiority or self-righteousness. By pointing out that something is \\"all for easy sanctimony,\\" it's implied that the intent behind the subject matter may not be sincere or genuine and is instead self-serving. This statement can be seen as a criticism or a negative aspect of the context in which it is used. 2. \\"formulaic thrills\\": The term \\"formulaic\\" implies that something is predictable, clichéd, or lacks creativity. When associated with \\"thrills,\\" it suggests that the excitement or pleasure experienced is unoriginal or uninspired. This portion of the phrase also comes across as negative, as it highlights the lack of innovation and freshness in the subject matter. 3. \\"ham-fisted sermon\\": A \\"ham-fisted\\" approach refers to clumsiness or a lack of subtlety. By coupling it with the term \\"sermon,\\" it implies that the given message or lecture is being delivered in an awkward, inelegant, or preachy manner. This further emphasizes the negative sentiment expressed in the overall phrase. 4. \\"on the need for national health insurance\\": The topic or issue being discussed (national health insurance) is presented alongside the aforementioned shortcomings, consequently painting a less-than-favorable picture of how the subject matter is being conveyed or addressed. In summary, the given phrase can be deemed as negative, since it describes the context in a critical and disapproving light by highlighting the superficiality, predictability, and clumsy delivery associated with the subject matter."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

(May 2015) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Soren, a young barn owl, lives in the Tyto Forest with his family: his father, Noctus; his mother, Marella; his older brother, Kludd; his younger sister, Eglantine; and Mrs. P, the family's nest maid, a kindly blind snake. Soren enjoys listening to the 'Legends of Ga'Hoole,' which are mythical tales of warrior owls called the Guardians who fight against the Pure Ones. Kludd berates his brother's dreams, having grown tired of listening to the stories. When their father teaches them the first steps to flying, Kludd becomes jealous of Soren's natural branching ability. Later, when practicing branching while their parents are hunting, Kludd pushes Soren off a branch which forces them both to fall to the ground. They are attacked by a Tasmanian devil but are saved, and then kidnapped, by two owls, Jatt and Jutt. Along the way, more owlets are revealed to have been kidnapped. Soren meets Gylfie, a young elf owl who is also kidnapped. At St. Aegolius, the owlets are greeted by Nyra, who says that they will be divided into either soldiers or 'pickers'. When Soren and Gylfie protest, they are sorted as pickers while Kludd, who betrays Soren, is sent to be a soldier. Soren and Gylfie avoid being 'moon-blinked' (a catatonic state induced by sleeping under a full moon), while the others do not know and become moon-blinked. They are forced to 'pick' through owl's pellets, scouring for bits of metal 'flecks', which are being used to build a superweapon. They are spotted by Grimble, a boreal owl, who reveals that he works under the Pure Ones only to keep his family safe and that he isn't really a Pure One at all. He teaches them to fly, but Nyra finds out whilst coming to invite Soren to become a soldier. Kludd decides to stay behind and become a Pure One, despite Soren's pleas for him to come with him.

Background: Browning was born as Charles Albert Browning, Jr., in Louisville, Kentucky, the second son of Charles Albert and Lydia Browning, and the nephew of baseball star Pete Browning. As a young boy, he put on amateur plays in his backyard. He was fascinated by the circus and carnival life, and at the age of 16 he ran away from his well-to-do family to become a performer. Changing his name to \\"Tod\\", he traveled extensively with sideshows, carnivals, and circuses. Context: Browning's feature film debut was Jim Bludso (1917), about a riverboat captain who sacrifices himself to save his passengers from a fire. It was well received. Browning moved back to New York in 1917. He directed two films for Metro Studios, Peggy, the Will O' the Wisp and The Jury of Fate. Both starred Mabel Taliaferro, the latter in a dual role achieved with double exposure techniques that were groundbreaking for the time. He moved back to California in 1918 and produced two more films for Metro, The Eyes of Mystery and Revenge. In the spring of 1918 he left Metro and joined Bluebird Productions, a subsidiary of Universal Pictures, where he met Irving Thalberg. Thalberg paired Browning with Lon Chaney for the first time for the film The Wicked Darling (1919), a melodrama in which Chaney played a thief who forces a poor girl (Priscilla Dean) from the slums into a life of crime and possibly prostitution. Browning and Chaney would ultimately make ten films together over the next decade. The death of his father sent Browning into a depression that led to alcoholism. He was laid off by Universal and his wife left him. However, he recovered, reconciled with his wife, and got a one-picture contract with Goldwyn Pictures. The film he produced for Goldwyn, The Day of Faith, was a moderate success, putting his career back on track. Thalberg reunited Browning with Lon Chaney for The Unholy Three (1925), the story of three circus performers who concoct a scheme to use disguises to con and steal jewels from rich people. Browning's circus experience shows in his sympathetic portrayal of the antiheroes. The film was a resounding success, so much so that it was later remade in 1930 as Lon Chaney's first (and only) talkie shortly before his death later that same year. Browning and Chaney embarked on a series of popular collaborations, including The Blackbird and The Road to Mandalay. The Unknown (1927), featuring Chaney as an armless knife thrower and Joan Crawford as his scantily clad carnival girl obsession, was originally titled Alonzo the Armless and could be considered a precursor to Freaks in that it concerns a love triangle involving a circus freak, a beauty, and a strongman. London After Midnight (1927) was Browning's first foray into the vampire genre and is a highly sought-after lost film which starred Chaney, Conrad Nagel, and Marceline Day. The last known print of London After Midnight was destroyed in an MGM studio fire in 1967. In 2002, a photographic reconstruction of London After Midnight was produced by Rick Schmidlin for Turner Classic Movies. Browning and Chaney's final collaboration was Where East is East (1929), of which only incomplete prints have survived. Browning's first talkie was The Thirteenth Chair (1929), which was also released as a silent and featured Bela Lugosi, who had a leading part as the uncanny inspector, Delzante, solving the mystery with the aid of the spirit medium. This film was directed shortly after Browning's vacation trip to Germany (arriving in the Port of New York, November 12, 1929). Question: What other studios did he work for? Answer:","completion":"Tod Browning worked for several studios throughout his career, including Metro Studios, Universal Pictures (specifically their subsidiary, Bluebird Productions), Goldwyn Pictures, and MGM (Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer)."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Background: James Bond Stockdale (December 23, 1923 - July 5, 2005) was a United States Navy vice admiral and aviator awarded the Medal of Honor in the Vietnam War, during which he was a prisoner of war for over seven years. Commander Stockdale was the senior naval officer held captive in Hanoi, North Vietnam. He had led aerial attacks from the carrier USS Ticonderoga (CVA-14) during the 1964 Gulf of Tonkin Incident. On his next deployment, while Commander of Carrier Air Wing Sixteen aboard the carrier USS Oriskany (CV-34), his A-4 Skyhawk jet was shot down in North Vietnam on September 9, 1965. Context: On June 5, 1946 he graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree from the Naval Academy with the Class of 1947 due to the reduced schedule still in effect from World War II. Academically he ranked 130th among 821 graduates in his class. His first assignment was assistant gunnery officer aboard the destroyer minesweeper USS Carmick (DD-493) from June to October 1946. He next served aboard the USS Thompson (DD-627) from October 1946 to February 1947, the USS Charles H. Roan (DD-853) from February 1947 to July 1948, and the USS Deming (PCS-1392) from July 1948 to June 1949. Stockdale was accepted for flight training in June 1949 and reported to Naval Air Station Pensacola in Florida. He was designated a Naval Aviator at Naval Air Station Corpus Christi in Texas, in September 1950. He was next assigned for additional training at Naval Air Station Norfolk in Virginia from October 1950 to January 1951. In January 1954, he was accepted into the United States Naval Test Pilot School at the Naval Air Station Patuxent River base in Southern Maryland and completed his training in July 1954. There he tutored U.S. Marine Corps aviator John Glenn in math and physics. He was a test pilot until January 1957. In 1959, the U.S. Navy sent Stockdale to Stanford University where he received a Master of Arts degree in international relations and comparative Marxist thought in 1962. Stockdale preferred the life of a fighter pilot over academia, but later credited Stoic philosophy with helping him cope as a prisoner of war. Question: Are there any other interesting aspects about this article? Answer:","completion":"Yes, there are several interesting aspects about James Bond Stockdale's life and accomplishments which can be explored from the given information: 1. Unique blend of military and academic prowess: Stockdale's dedication to both military service and education is noteworthy. He excelled both as a high-ranking naval officer and aviator, while also pursuing academics and earning a Master of Arts degree from Stanford University. His understanding and application of Stoic philosophy, obtained during his academic journey, played a crucial role in helping him survive the incredibly challenging experience as a prisoner of war. 2. Stoic philosophy's role in his life: Stockdale relied heavily on Stoicism during his time as a POW, demonstrating the practical use of philosophy in coping with extraordinary circumstances. Stoicism, a school of philosophy that teaches that one should remain indifferent to external events and circumstances and focus on one's own virtues and character, provided Stockdale with the mental strength and resilience necessary to endure the harsh conditions of his captivity. 3. Interactions with notable figures: Stockdale's association with other famous personalities, like John Glenn, the U.S. Marine Corps aviator and future astronaut, is another interesting aspect of his life. Stockdale tutored Glenn in math and physics during his time at the United States Naval Test Pilot School, reflecting his competence in both hard and soft sciences. 4. Resilience and leadership in captivity: As the highest-ranking naval officer held captive in Hanoi, North Vietnam, Stockdale displayed remarkable leadership and courage. He maintained the chain of command among his fellow prisoners, organized resistance within the prison camps, and even inflicted harm upon himself to prevent the enemy from using him as propaganda. His resilience earned him the Medal of Honor, the highest military decoration awarded in the United States. 5. Gulf of Tonkin Incident: Stockdale played a significant role in the 1964 Gulf of Tonkin Incident, leading aerial attacks from the USS Ticonderoga (CVA-14). The incident resulted in the escalation of the Vietnam War and became a pivotal moment in American history. These aspects, when put together, provide a comprehensive picture of James Bond Stockdale's life, highlighting his exceptional blend of military accomplishments, academic pursuits, and personal resilience during one of the most difficult periods in American history."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Answer the following question: Question: \\"How did the Xbox and Wii differ?\\" Context: \\"The Xbox 360 sold much better than its predecessor, and although not the best-selling console of the seventh-generation, it is regarded as a success since it strengthened Microsoft as a major force in the console market at the expense of well-established rivals. The inexpensive Nintendo Wii did sell the most console units but eventually saw a collapse of third-party software support in its later years, and it has been viewed by some as a fad since the succeeding Wii U had a poor debut in 2012. The PlayStation 3 struggled for a time due to being too expensive and initially lacking quality titles, making it far less dominant than its predecessor, the PlayStation 2, and it took until late in the PlayStation 3's lifespan for its sales and game titles to reach parity with the Xbox 360. TechRadar proclaimed that \\"Xbox 360 passes the baton as the king of the hill – a position that puts all the more pressure on its successor, Xbox One\\".\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"The Xbox 360 and Wii differed in several ways.

BUT, I have used the delivery service only twice, and BOTH times they messed up my simple order, the second time sending a regular, non-gluten free pizza, which of course I could not eat. I live an hour away, so waiting for another wasn't practical. I decided to give them another chance tonight, but I wanted to speak with Biaggio personally first and let him know about the mistakes on the deliveries and help make sure it didn't happen again. I told him I would be upset if it happened again, and jokingly said I would post a bad review on Yelp if they messed it up. Instead of apologizing, he defended the restaurant saying, \\"It's just a pizza and people make mistakes. I'm going to decline your order and wish you on your way.\\" Ironically, he was upset that I didn't call and speak to him about the mistakes(at the time), but this is actually what I was just doing and he refused to let us eat there anymore as punishment. Turns out the service isn't that great after all! Fortunately there's no shortage of restaurants in Las Vegas.... - negative; - positive; I think the answer is","completion":"negative. The reviewer shared their experience about multiple failed deliveries and a less-than-satisfactory interaction with the restaurant owner, Biaggio. They mentioned that they were a loyal customer for two years, posting positive reviews in the past, but their recent experience led to a change in opinion. The positive choice is incorrect because the author's sentiment is mostly disappointment and frustration, leading them to conclude that the service isn't as great as they thought before."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Chloe's house reminded Paul of a cross between a used bookstore, a computer repair shop, and a college dorm. A wall of bookcases dominated the living room, each shelf crammed with two, sometimes three layers of books, videotapes, CD's and DVD's. More stacks of books and magazines stood in every corner. Paul was certain they would have taken over all the other flat spaces as well, were it not for the half-assembled computers and three dusty old monitors occupying the coffee table, end tables, and everything in between. The only semi-open spaces were the two couches that faced each other from across the room. A large red and black checkered blanket covered one of them, while the other was cracked but still serviceable brown leather.

The hypothesis is \\"It totally soaked them to the bone,\\" which means it did more than just saturate but completely soaked something or someone through to the bone. Step 2: Analyze the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis To determine if the hypothesis is true based on the given premise, we must analyze if there is a connection between the saturation mentioned in the premise and the complete soaking mentioned in the hypothesis. Step 3: Compare the meanings of saturation and complete soaking Saturation means that something has absorbed as much of a substance, such as water in this case, as it can. Complete soaking implies an extreme level of saturation. Step 4: Determine if the premise can support the hypothesis Given that saturation represents a thorough soaking and the hypothesis suggests total soaking to the bone, we can say that there is a strong connection between the two.

Question: This article: Joe Denton, a corrupt ex-cop, is released from jail. Six years earlier, while on the mob's payroll, Denton attacked district attorney Phil Coakley, earning him the enmity of the police and the nickname \\"slash cop\\". After finding his ex-wife has left the city with their children, he moves in with his elderly parents. Denton researches his ex-wife on the internet, eventually digging up a phone number. After briefly talking to one of his daughters, his ex-wife takes the phone and threatens to press charges if he ever contacts them again. Denton passes a bar on his way back home. Although a recovering alcoholic, he enters and orders a drink. His friend Scotty, the brother of Denton's slain partner, greets him and offers him any help he needs. A young woman asks Denton for a ride home. Denton is surprised when she reveals herself to be Coakley's daughter and intentionally bloodies herself. Cued by her cries for help, two men drag Denton from his car; Denton beats both men savagely. After Denton is questioned by the police, Coakley admits the evidence backs up his story and reluctantly asks if Denton wants to press charges. Denton declines, saying he wants to leave his history in the past, to the disgust of Coakley and Lieutenant Pleasant, who calls him a disgrace. Pleasant, revealed to also be corrupt, demands Denton kill mob boss Manny Vassey, who has found religion on his deathbed. Pleasant explains Vassey's guilty conscience may lead him to confess to Coakley. Pleasant promises to help Denton renegotiate the terms of the settlement with his ex-wife if he kills Vassey. At his house, Vassey denies the rumors. As Vassey falls asleep, Denton begins to suffocate him, only to be interrupted by Charlotte Boyd, Vassey's hospice nurse. Denton smoothly thanks her for her work and leaves the house, where he encounters Vassey's sadistic son, Junior.

While it is true that Viollet-le-Duc compiled and coordinated an Encyclopédie médiévale, which served as a rich repository for his contemporaries to mine for architectural details, this statement does not directly answer the question about the specific cathedral. Eugène Emmanuel Viollet-le-Duc (1814-1879) was a French architect and theorist, and a prominent figure in the Gothic Revival movement. He had a deep understanding of medieval architecture and was heavily involved in the restoration of many significant French buildings. One of his most notable works was the restoration of Notre-Dame Cathedral in Paris, which had suffered significant damage during the French Revolution and the subsequent years. The restoration project was commissioned in 1844, and Viollet-le-Duc worked on it in collaboration with Jean-Baptiste Lassus until Lassus' death in 1857. Viollet-le-Duc continued the project alone until its completion in 1864. During the restoration, Viollet-le-Duc reinforced and reconstructed various sections of the cathedral, including the iconic central spire, which had been removed in the late 18th century due to its poor condition. While working on Notre-Dame, Viollet-le-Duc used his extensive knowledge of medieval architecture to ensure that the restoration was accurate and faithful to the original design. His efforts were instrumental in preserving the cathedral's Gothic aesthetic and reviving interest in Gothic architectural style across France and Europe. In addition to the Notre-Dame Cathedral, Viollet-le-Duc was responsible for the restoration of many other prominent French monuments, such as the Basilica of Saint-Sernin in Toulouse, the Basilica of Saint-Denis, the fortified city of Carcassonne, and the Château de Pierrefonds, among others. To summarize, the famous French cathedral restored and reconstructed by Viollet-le-Duc is the Notre-Dame Cathedral in Paris. His work was instrumental in preserving and revitalizing Gothic architectural style, and his Encyclopédie médiévale served as a valuable resource for architectural details for his contemporaries."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Emergency workers hauling large concrete slabs from a collapsed... (Associated Press) As authorities buried the bodies of 18 unidentified workers killed in the collapse, Pope Francis and European Union officials criticized working conditions in the nation's 20 billion a year garment industry, which supplies many European and American retailers. Francis said he was shocked by a headline from the building collapse that said some of the workers were living on 38 euros a month. \`'This was the payment of these people who have died ... And this is called \`slave labor,'\\" he said. Vatican Radio said the pope made the remarks during a private Mass Wednesday morning at the Vatican. EU officials said they are considering action including changes to Bangladesh's duty-free and quota-free access to the giant EU market to \\"incentivize\\" responsible management of the nation's garment industry. Catherine Ashton, the EU's foreign affairs chief, and its trade commissioner, Karel De Gucht, called in a statement for Bangladesh authorities to act immediately to ensure factories comply with international labor standards. Pressure built inside Bangladesh as well, as a raucous procession of workers on foot, pickup trucks and motorcycles wound its way through central Dhaka on Wednesday. They waved the national flag and banners, beat drums and chanted \\"direct action!\\" and \\"death penalty!\\" From a loudspeaker on the back of a truck, a participant spoke for the group: \\"My brother has died. My sister has died. Their blood will not be valueless.\\" May Day protests, customarily an opportunity for workers in this impoverished South Asian nation to vent their grievances, have taken on a poignant significance this year following the April 24 disaster. Five garment factories were housed in the illegally constructed, eight-story Rana Plaza that collapsed in this Dhaka suburb. Five months after a fire killed 112 people at another clothing factory, the collapse again exposed safety problems in Bangladesh's garment industry. The death toll from the collapse passed 400 Wednesday, with 399 bodies pulled from the rubble and three of the injured dying in the hospital, police said. Several hundred people attended a mass funeral in a Dhaka suburb for 18 unidentified workers who died in the building collapse. The bodies, rotting in the spring heat, were brought to the graveyard on the back of a flatbed truck. One woman wailed that one of the bodies was her sister's and begged to take it. More than 80 additional graves have been prepared, with authorities expected scores of more bodies to remain unclaimed. The owner of the building, Mohammed Sohel Rana, is being questioned by police while under arrest. He is expected to be charged with negligence, illegal construction and forcing workers to join work, which is punishable by a maximum of seven years in jail. Authorities have not said if more serious crimes will be added. Workers protesting Wednesday demanded capital punishment for the 38-year-old Rana, a small-time political operative with the ruling Awami League party. \\"I want the death penalty for the owner of the building. We want regular salaries, raises and absolutely we want better safety in our factories,\\" said Mongidul Islam Rana, 18, who works in a garment factory that was not located in Rana Plaza. The Bangladesh High Court has ordered the government to confiscate Rana's property and to freeze the assets of the owners of the factories in Rana Plaza so the money can be used to pay the salaries of their workers. Rana had permission to build five stories but added three more floors illegally. When huge cracks appeared in the building a day before its collapse, police ordered an evacuation, but Rana told tenants that it was safe and they should go back in. The next day, a bank and some shops refused to occupy the premises but factory managers told their workers to go back in. A couple of hours later the building came down in a heap of concrete and bricks. Some 2,500 people escaped with injuries. Rescue workers expect the death toll to rise, because they believe many bodies are still buried on the ground level. There is confusion over how many people remain missing. Zillur Rahman Chowdhury, a Dhaka district administrator, said so far 149 people have been listed missing. A police official, Aminur Rahman, said police have recorded up to 1,300 names as missing, but he cautioned that many may be duplicates. \\"We will now have to screen the names by computer to find the actual number,\\" he said. Rescuers estimate that the building turned into 600 tons of rubble, of which 350 tons has been removed. Anxious relatives were still looking for their loved ones missing. Kulsum, who uses one name, was looking for her husband, holding his photograph among several hundred people at a nearby school ground. \\"My husband was inside the building on the fifth floor,\\" said Kulsum. \\"I haven't found him. Neither alive nor dead.\\" The garment-factory fire in November brought widespread pledges to improve worker-safety standards in Bangladesh. But since then, very little has changed. \\"I think it is a wakeup call for the nation, a wakeup call for the industry and for the trade unions,\\" said Shirin Akter, founding president of Karmojibi Nari, a Dhaka-based Bangladeshi group that lobbies for the rights of women in the workplace. Bangladesh's garment industry was the third-largest in the world in 2011, after China and Italy. Among the garment makers in the building were Phantom Apparels, Phantom Tac, Ether Tex, New Wave Style and New Wave Bottoms. Altogether, they produced several million shirts, pants and other garments a year. The New Wave companies, according to their website, make clothing for several major North American and European retailers. Britain's Primark has acknowledged it was using a factory in Rana Plaza. It said in a statement Monday that it is providing emergency aid and will pay compensation to victims who worked for its supplier. \\"Primark notes the fact that its supplier shared the building with those of other retailers. We are fully aware of our responsibility. We urge these other retailers to come forward and offer assistance,\\" it said. Canadian company Loblaw Inc., which also got its Joe Fresh clothing line made in Rana Plaza, said Monday it will ensure that victims and their families \\"receive benefits now and in the future.\\" Spokeswoman Julija Hunter said the company is still working out the details, but plans to deliver support \\"in the best and most meaningful way possible.\\" Wal-Mart said none of its clothing had been authorized to be made in the Rana Plaza facility, but it is investigating whether there was any unauthorized production. ___ Associated Press writers Julhas Alam in Dhaka and Cassandra Vinograd in London contributed to this report. ||||| Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story SAVAR, Bangladesh — Barely 20 miles from the national capital, this gritty suburb is now a dusty, chaotic industrial center littered with factories that produce clothes for leading Western brands. Building codes are often unenforced, regulatory oversight is flimsy and the men wielding power often travel with armed guards. And perhaps no one wielded power more brazenly than Sohel Rana. He traveled by motorcycle, as untouchable as a mafia don, trailed by his own biker gang. Local officials and the Bangladeshi news media say he was involved in illegal drugs and guns, but he also had a building, Rana Plaza, that housed five factories. Upstairs, workers earned as little as 40 a month making clothes for retailers like J. C. Penney. Downstairs, Mr. Rana hosted local politicians, playing pool, drinking and, the officials say, indulging in drugs. Now Mr. Rana, 35, is under arrest, the most reviled man in Bangladesh after the horrific collapse of Rana Plaza last week left nearly 400 people dead, with many others still missing. On Tuesday, a top Bangladeshi court seized his assets, as the public bayed for his execution, especially as it appears that the tragedy could have been averted if the frantic warnings of an engineer who examined the building the day before had been heeded. Photo But if Mr. Rana has been vilified, he is partly a creation of the garment era in Bangladesh, during which global businesses have arrived in search of cheap labor to keep profits high and costs low. Directly or indirectly, international brands are now sometimes interlinked with men like Mr. Rana, and placed at risk by them. Global apparel companies often depict their international supply chains as tightly scrutinized systems to ensure that clothing sold to American buyers is produced in safe, monitored factories. Yet their inspectors usually check safety factors and working conditions, but not the soundness of the buildings themselves, and the companies often have little control over the subcontractors who do much of the work. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Criminality and politics have long intersected in Bangladesh, especially at the local level. But the garment industry has introduced what had mostly been the missing element: money. Savar land values soared as new factories hurriedly opened to meet the new Western demand. To build Rana Plaza, Mr. Rana and his father bullied adjacent landowners, the landowners themselves say, and ultimately took their property by force. His political allies gave him a construction permit, despite his dubious claims of title to the land, and a second permit later to add upper floors that may have destabilized the building. Mr. Rana existed largely above scrutiny. Many local people say his political clout was such that not even the police dared to confront him. Television stations reported the cracks in the building the night before it collapsed, but no local authority prevented Mr. Rana from opening the building the next morning. “Money is his power,” said Ashraf Uddin Khan, a former mayor of Savar, who accused Mr. Rana of being deeply involved in the drug trade. “Illegal money.” Advertisement Continue reading the main story Before Rana Plaza collapsed, Bangladesh was already in turmoil, as opposition political parties were staging nationwide strikes, known as hartals, that paralyzed the country and placed huge pressure on factory owners to meet deadlines. Weeks earlier, the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association warned that the hartals had cost Bangladesh as much as 500 million in business. Hartals were part of Mr. Rana’s résumé. He held what appeared to be an innocuous position as secretary of the local student wing for the Awami League, the country’s majority political party. But that position translated into influence and helped him mobilize people. He developed a following that local people say he used as political muscle, sometimes to enforce strikes, sometimes to defy them. “He had a criminal gang,” said Mohammed Khorshed Alam, an elected councilman in Savar and a member of the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party. He said Mr. Rana and his men carried weapons and were part of a network involved in the local drug trade. Politics are rough in Savar. Mr. Alam walks through the city with an entourage of eight men, including a bodyguard with a sawed-off shotgun. Local officials say drug sales are widespread, though the city’s police chief says he has stamped out the problem. One of the busiest drug dens, he said, used to exist behind Rana Plaza. Land helped create Mr. Rana’s power. His father had been a poor peasant who sold his plot in a village and bought a small parcel in Savar. As prices began to rise, the father sold a portion of that land and used his profits to start a small factory making mustard oil. He also became involved in politics with the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, then in power, and slowly grew richer. By 2000, land prices were rising, and Mr. Rana was helping his father. They could see other hurriedly constructed buildings rising in Savar, and they decided to build Rana Plaza — except they did not have clear title to all the land. Rabindranath Sarkar, who had bought land in partnership with Mr. Rana’s father, said the family sent thugs to seize part of his share of the land and then retaliated when he filed a complaint with the local police. “Rana chased me through Savar with weapons,” he said. “The police wouldn’t even dare to protect me. The police were always scared of them.” Another adjacent family said Mr. Rana sent representatives to try to persuade them to sell a plot, including a small pond, beside Mr. Rana’s land. By 2005, a year before construction started on Rana Plaza, the family said Mr. Rana simply falsified a land deed to take possession of the pond. Bangladesh initially sought to attract foreign investment by creating special Export Processing Zones, which had higher quality buildings and tighter regulations. But as demand from foreign buyers rose, factories began sprouting across the country, including quickly built structures to accommodate the small operators who did subcontract work on tight margins. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Advertisement Continue reading the main story By 2011, Mr. Rana had rented out the existing five floors and gotten a permit from the local mayor, a political ally, to build additional floors. Mr. Khan, the former mayor, said this practice created serious risks, since officials were handing out permits, often for bribes, without insisting on the necessary safeguards. “For the garment industry, Savar grew quickly, and in an unplanned manner,” he said. “There are so many buildings like Rana Plaza in Savar.” Mr. Rana found factory owners to rent his new upper floors and appeared to be gaining in influence. Then on April 23, a problem arose. Workers on the third floor were stitching clothing when they were startled by a noise that sounded like an explosion. Cracks had appeared in the building. Workers rushed outside in terror. By late morning, Mr. Rana’s representatives had brought in Abdur Razzaque Khan, an engineer. Taken to the third floor, Mr. Khan examined three support pillars, and became horrified at the cracks he found. “I became scared,” Mr. Khan said. “It was not safe to stay inside this building.” He rushed downstairs and told one of Mr. Rana’s administrators that the building needed to be closed immediately. But Mr. Rana was apparently not impressed; he was holding court with about a dozen local journalists. “This is not a crack,” he said, according to Shamim Hossain, a local newspaper reporter. “The plaster on the wall is broken, nothing more. It is not a problem.” But it was. The next morning, Rana Plaza collapsed. Mr. Rana managed to escape from his basement office, but was eventually discovered hiding near the Indian border. He was flown by helicopter to Dhaka and thrust before the news media, looking dazed and disheveled. Neither Mr. Rana nor a representative was available for comment. He has previously said it was the factory owners who insisted on opening for business the day of the collapse, and several of the owners have been arrested, as was Mr. Rana’s father. Even now, many people in Savar remained unconvinced that Mr. Rana will be punished, or that his style of business will be cleaned up. “Rana is not the only one,” said Mr. Sarkar, the man whose land was taken. “Now, we have so many Ranas.” ||||| Focused crawls are collections of frequently-updated webcrawl data from narrow (as opposed to broad or wide) web crawls, often focused on a single domain or subdomain. ||||| Story highlights Mourners attend a funeral for 32 unidentified victims Officials say 412 people have been confirmed dead, 2,443 recovered alive A military official says about 149 people are still missing Pope Francis condemns worker exploitation and \\"slave labor\\" in a Mass A week after a building containing thousands of Bangladeshi garment workers came crashing down around them, the death toll from the South Asian nation's deadliest industrial disaster rose above 400.

MUST WATCH Did Western brands fail factory workers? 03:30 Frequent protests, some of them involving violent clashes with police, have taken place in Dhaka and nearby manufacturing districts since the disaster. On Wednesday, when workers around the world were holding May Day rallies, thousands of Bangladeshis took to the streets once again, although no clashes were initially reported. As trucks carrying rubble leave the scene of the catastrophe, people search desperately for missing relatives crowd around them, wanting to make sure they're not mistakenly taking away the bodies of their loved ones, said Maj. Gen. Hassan Sarwardy, the military official leading the recovery efforts. There was confusion earlier about exactly how many people were still unaccounted for in the collapse, Sarwardy said at a news briefing Wednesday. Authorities were waiting for the Bangladesh Garments Manufacturers and Exporters Association to provide a list of all the people who were inside the five garment factories in the building when it caved in, he said. When that information was obtained, Sarwardy said it appeared about 149 people were still missing. \\"It is very unlikely that someone is still alive under the rubble on the seventh day of the building collapse ... but the almighty Allah knows better,\\" the military official said. Authorities say the number of people confirmed dead so far is 412, while 2,443 people have been recovered alive, according to the official Bangladesh State News Agency. And so, the search for the human remains still entombed within the ruins goes on amid the stench of death that pervades the site. Those involved in the search are using face masks and cans of air freshener to try to block out the smell, and electronic sensors and sniffer dogs to try to find the bodies. Col. Shayekh Jaman, one of the officials involved in the operation, said Wednesday that he believed the grueling, painstaking efforts could continue for about 10 more days. \\"It is a delicate and time-consuming operation, but we are doing everything we can,\\" he said. Lost relatives Meanwhile, hundreds of people such as Sheikh Nasir Uddin are left in limbo. At the school playground in Savar where bodies recovered from the wreckage are initially brought for identification, Uddin said he had being looking for his nephew, Abul Kalam Azad, for the past week. He said visits to all the hospitals in Savar and Dhaka where the injured and the dead were taken had proved fruitless. \\"Nobody can tell me about my nephew, who was working at an apparel factory in the building,\\" he said. Much of the rage voiced in protests has been directed at Sohel Rana, the owner of the building, who was arrested near the Indian border over the weekend. Protesters have called for him to be hanged. Rana and the owners of the factories in his building have been accused of ordering workers to enter the premises on the day of the collapse, despite the discovery of large cracks the day before. The Bangladeshi government is also coming under criticism for lax enforcement of safety regulations in factories and claims by Britain and the United Nations that it refused offers of help with rescue efforts. Home Minister Mahiuddin Khan Alamgir said Tuesday that the rejection was because Bangladesh had only wanted equipment to be sent, not the additional search and rescue experts offered by the outside agencies. EU considers trade action In a sign of the growing international pressure on Dhaka to improve labor conditions, the European Union said Tuesday that it was considering trade action against Bangladesh. The statement carries weight, since the EU is Bangladesh's largest trade partner. The Bangladeshi government said this week that it would begin inspecting the safety and security of all garment factories in the country. Major Western retailers and clothing brands, some of which sourced products from the factories in the collapsed building, are also facing difficult questions about how closely they scrutinize working conditions at their suppliers. \\"We understand that businesses operating in this building appear to have links to numerous companies in the U.S. and Europe and so we'll continue to engage with U.S. companies to discuss what role they can play in improving working conditions, including in Bangladesh,\\" U.S. State Department spokesman Patrick Ventrell said Wednesday. The catastrophic building collapse happened about five months after a fire at Tazreen Fashions Factory, a garment maker in another suburb of Dhaka, killed at least 112 people. |||||","completion":"On May 1st, thousands of workers paraded in Dhaka to demand safer working conditions and the death penalty for the owner of a building housing garment factories that collapsed, killing at least 402 people and injuring 2,500.

Write a summary based on this article: World’s only fossils of T. rex skin suggest it was covered in scales—not feathers Was Tyrannosaurus rex—the giant king of the tyrannosaurs—actually sporting bright plumage? Mounting fossil evidence of feathers and protofeathers on several T. rex cousins has intensified the debate. But without direct proof that T. rex had feathers, some scientists decided to hunt for clues in the next-best place: fossilized skin. They examined the world’s only known fossils of T. rex skin—from the neck, pelvis, and tail of a long-dead dino named Wyrex, stored since 2006 at the Houston Museum of Natural Science in Texas (above). They found no sign of feathers; just smooth, scaly skin. They also analyzed skin impressions from large tyrannosaurs that lived around the same time, such as Albertosaurus and Gorgosaurus. Like Wyrex, those dinosaurs were covered in scales, they report today in Biology Letters . So if these large tyrannosaurs had any feathers at all, says the team, their fluff would have been limited to their backs—the only body part for which they were lacking fossil impressions.Because their earlier cousins did have feathers, it’s likely that the large tyrannosaurs lost them somewhere along the way, the team suggests. It’s possible that the giants didn’t need feathery thermal insulation, as their bodies were better able to retain heat. ||||| Starting in 1996, Alexa Internet has been donating their crawl data to the Internet Archive.

Answer the following question: Former President Barack Obama unveiled plans for his future presidential library and museum on the south side of Chicago where he raised his family and launched his political career. The designs show a complex of modern buildings, with a library, museum and event center, plus a community garden, a children's play area and possibly an athletic field. \\"What we want this to be is the world-premiere institution for training young people and leadership to make a difference in their communities, in their countries and in the world,\\" he told the crowd that included Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, his one-time chief of staff. Flanked by drawings and renderings, Obama also announced that he and former first lady Michelle Obama will be donating 2 million to fund a Chicago summer jobs program. The museum, the tallest of the three buildings, will hold exhibition space, public spaces, offices and education and meeting rooms, according to the Obama Foundation. The forum and library buildings are intended to be used for study and foundation programming. Obama said his foundation, which is overseeing the project, is also looking into the possibility of locating a Chicago Public Library branch on the site. Obama said he envisioned recording studios where musicians could help young people work on music, and space for movie directors who could take on community storytelling. The center will also have exhibits with campaign memorabilia and personal artifacts. \\"Let's face it, we want to see Michelle's dresses,\\" the former president joked. Obama also squashed any notion that the library was ever going to be elsewhere. Multiple locations in three states — Illinois, New York and Hawaii — had initially pitched proposals. \\"The best things that have happened to me in my life happened in this community,\\" he said. \\"Although we had a formal bidding process to determine where the presidential library was going to be, the fact of the matter was it had to be right here on the south side of Chicago.\\" According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.

Compare the premise and the hypothesis: The hypothesis suggests that having a definite number is superior in general, whereas the premise focuses on the preference of a specific organization, the Pentagon. 4. Evaluate the hypothesis with respect to the premise: Since the premise primarily deals with the Pentagon's preference, it can't be concluded that the hypothesis is universally true, as it could be organization-specific or situation-specific.

In 1024, they were replaced by the Salian dynasty, who famously clashed with the papacy under Emperor Henry IV (r. 1084–1105) over church appointments as part of the Investiture Controversy. His successors continued to struggle against the papacy as well as the German nobility. A period of instability followed the death of Emperor Henry V (r. 1111–25), who died without heirs, until Frederick I Barbarossa (r. 1155–90) took the imperial throne. Although he ruled effectively, the basic problems remained, and his successors continued to struggle into the 13th century. Barbarossa's grandson Frederick II (r. 1220–1250), who was also heir to the throne of Sicily through his mother, clashed repeatedly with the papacy. His court was famous for its scholars and he was often accused of heresy. He and his successors faced many difficulties, including the invasion of the Mongols into Europe in the mid-13th century.

Question: \\"How did the political leader of the coutnry affect religion?\\" Context: \\"Towards the end of the Republic, religious and political offices became more closely intertwined; the office of pontifex maximus became a de facto consular prerogative. Augustus was personally vested with an extraordinary breadth of political, military and priestly powers; at first temporarily, then for his lifetime. He acquired or was granted an unprecedented number of Rome's major priesthoods, including that of pontifex maximus; as he invented none, he could claim them as traditional honours. His reforms were represented as adaptive, restorative and regulatory, rather than innovative; most notably his elevation (and membership) of the ancient Arvales, his timely promotion of the plebeian Compitalia shortly before his election and his patronage of the Vestals as a visible restoration of Roman morality. Augustus obtained the pax deorum, maintained it for the rest of his reign and adopted a successor to ensure its continuation. This remained a primary religious and social duty of emperors.\\" Answer: A:","completion":"The political leader of the country, in this context referring to Augustus, had a significant impact on religion in ancient Rome. As the first emperor of the Roman Empire, Augustus was able to establish a tight control over religious practices, merging political and religious powers in a way that would shape the Empire's future. To understand the impact, it is essential to look at the various ways Augustus influenced and controlled religious practices. 1. Office of Pontifex Maximus: Augustus assumed the title of \\"Pontifex Maximus,\\" which was the highest religious authority in Rome. By merging this religious role with his political power, Augustus was able to consolidate authority, control the interpretation of religious rituals, and reinforce his political agenda. 2. Extraordinary Powers: Augustus was vested with an unprecedented number of Rome's major priesthoods, which allowed him to control and manipulate religious practices to suit his political agenda. This control enabled him to change the way the religious institutions were governed and functioned. 3. Adaptive Reforms: Augustus portrayed his religious reforms as adaptive, restorative, and regulatory rather than innovative, which helped to create an image of tradition-based continuity. Through his promotion of ancient religious orders, such as the Arvales and the Compitalia, and his patronage of the Vestals, Augustus strengthened the link between Roman religion and the state. 4. Pax Deorum: Augustus obtained the Pax Deorum, or \\"Peace of the Gods,\\" which was an understanding between the Roman government and the deities to maintain a stable and peaceful relationship. By maintaining the Pax Deorum throughout his reign, Augustus ensured the continuation of religious stability and demonstrated that he was god-favored, which further legitimized his rule. 5. The Succession System: Augustus laid the groundwork for a succession system where the emperors would adopt their successors, ensuring a smooth transfer of both political and religious powers from one emperor to the next. This continuity was essential to preserving the status quo and maintaining the Pax Deorum, remaining a crucial factor in the Roman Empire's continued success. In summary, the political leader of the country, Augustus, had a profound impact on religion in ancient Rome. By consolidating political and religious powers, Augustus was able to steer religious practices to benefit his rule and maintain stability in the Empire. His reforms set a precedence for future emperors, ensuring a steady relationship between the Roman Empire's political and religious realms."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

There's people like the town mechanic / abortionist, the town rapist, his annoying neighbor, his wife Oxana, and so on and so forth. Borat also talks about his home and his hobbies. Hobbies include ping pong, which he plays rather poorly, and traveling to capital city where he watches women as they do their business. Borat takes you through his home where you meet his wife Oxana and his sons Huey and Lewis, and introduces us to his annoying neighbor Yusuf. Borat and Yusuf have been engaged in a game of coveted goods, where everything Borat gets, Yusuf attempts to get as well, but since Yusuf doesn't have the money that Borat has, everything Yusuf buys is of significantly less quality.Borat is hailed as a hero in his town as he is contracted by the government of Kazakhstan to travel to America to make a documentary which will bring together, hopefully, the cultures of America and Kazakhstan.

Have you been doing Internet shopping rather than going to the stores? What can't you be bothered to do? A study into how lazy British people are has found more than half of the adults are so idle that they'd catch the lift rather than climb two flights of stairs. Just over 2,000 people were quizzed by independent researchers at Nuffield Health, Britain's largest health center. The results were extremely surprising. About one in six people questioned said if their remote control was broken, they would continue watching the same channel rather than get up. More than one third of those questioned said they would not run to catch a bus. Worryingly, of the 654 respondents with children, 64% said they were often too tired to play with them. This led the report to conclude that it's no wonder that one in six children in the UK are classified as obese (very fat) before they start school. Dr Sarah Dauncey, medical director of Nuffield Health, said, \\"People need to get fitter, not just for their own sake, but for the sake of their families, friends and evidently (;) their pets too.\\" \\"If we don't start to take control of this problem, a whole generation will become too unfit to perform even the most fundamental tasks.\\" And Scotland's largest city, Glasgow, was shamed as the most idle city in the UK, with 75% questioned admitting they do not get enough exercise, followed closely by Birmingham and Southampton, both with 67%.

An ideal position is to have the cat comfortably resting on your lap or on a stable surface with its paws accessible for easy trimming. Moreover, she highlights the significance of trimming the nails at the appropriate angle, usually around 45 degrees, to avoid cutting into the quick – the pink, sensitive part of the cat's nail that contains blood vessels and nerves. Cutting the quick could result in bleeding and discomfort for the cat, which may make future claw trimming sessions more challenging. In addition, she advises that the trimming session should be kept brief and not rushed. This helps keep the cat calm and prevents them from becoming overwhelmed or agitated. If the cat starts to struggle, it is better to take a break and resume the session at a later time. Lastly, she stresses the importance of providing positive reinforcement, such as petting, praise, and treats once the process is complete. This helps elevate the cat's experience from an unpleasant chore to a manageable and potentially enjoyable task. In conclusion, taking the time to properly trim a cat's nails not only ensures the cat's wellbeing but also fosters a strong bond between the pet and its owner. By implementing these tips and maintaining a consistent grooming schedule, cat owners can ensure that both their feline friends and their household remain safe and happy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write some highlights for the following article: The worlds of politics and arts mingled Sunday at the annual Kennedy Center Honors, with President Barack Obama among those toasting five stars of stage, screen and music. \\"Each of them has been blessed with an extraordinary gift,\\" the president said of the night's honorees. \\"Tonight, we thank them for sharing that gift with us.\\" The festivities in Washington began with a White House reception, where Obama made his remarks flanked by the honorees. People moved from there across town to The Kennedy Center overlooking the Potomac River for a gala performance. The performing arts space, named in honor of the late President John F. Kennedy, is marking its 40th anniversary this year, and this is the 34th time that it has honored individuals in a \\"celebration of the arts.\\" Past honorees run an entertainment gamut -- from the likes of Clint Eastwood and Sean Connery in the movie world, to Aretha Franklin and Bob Dylan in music, to Ginger Rogers and Mikhail Baryshnikov in dance, among dozens of others. This year's slate of honorees are similarly eclectic, though with a distinctly musical bent. Singer-songwriter Neil Diamond has sold more than 125 million records and scored 39 top-10 singles -- including \\"Cracklin' Rosie,\\" \\"Sweet Caroline\\" and \\"America\\" -- according to a biography posted on the Kennedy Center's website. Legendary saxophonist and composer Sonny Rollins has long stood out on the jazz scene even while playing alongside luminaries such as Miles Davis and Dizzy Gillespie. Atlanta-bred musical theater star Barbara Cook made her mark on Broadway. She's also toured the world and produced several studio albums. Yo-Yo Ma -- described in his biography as the nation's \\"cellist-in-chief\\" -- has won 16 Grammy awards over his illustrious career and last year was given a Presidential Medal of Freedom. Sunday night's only non-musical winner is actress Meryl Streep. She burst on the movie scene in 1978 in \\"The Deer Hunter\\" and \\"Kramer vs. Kramer,\\" later winning plaudits for her roles in films such as \\"Sophie's Choice,\\" \\"Out of Africa\\" and more recently \\"Julie & Julia.\\" \\"We're just over the moon about this,\\" Cook said of her conversations with the four others about being celebrated Sunday. \\"It's once in a lifetime -- there's nothing else like this.\\" Others attending Sunday's events included actors Stanley Tucci, Robert DeNiro, Sarah Jessica Parker and Emily Blunt, and musician Smokey Robinson. They were joined by political players including Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, GOP presidential contender Newt Gingrich, and U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood. Several of them -- including DeNiro, Tucci and Robinson -- took the Kennedy Center on Sunday night to celebrate the honorees. Others who spoke included Bill Cosby on behalf of Rollins, Jennifer Nettles and Lionel Ritchie for Diamond, and Stephen Colbert toasting Yo-Yo Ma. A two-hour recap of the gala will air the night of December 27 on CBS. Obama ended his lighthearted remarks Sunday evening with a call for people to support the arts, ideally helping a future Kennedy Center honoree and many others have the tools and opportunities they need to excel. \\"Let's make sure that our young people can dream big dreams and follow them as long as they can go,\\" the president said. That sentiment was seconded on the red carpet by, among others, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. \\"The arts are a very good investment because they're about the spirit of America (and) they encourage children to learn, to gain confidence through exercising their creativity,\\" the California Democrat said. \\"Imagination is what keeps us number one.\\" Highlights:","completion":"1.

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which country had a more dramatic influence on the food web? Hint: Biodiversity loss is the extinction of species (plant or animal) worldwide, and also the local reduction or loss of species in a certain habitat. The latter phenomenon can be temporary or permanent, depending on whether the environmental degradation that leads to the loss is reversible through ecological restoration / ecological resilience or effectively permanent (e.g. through land loss). Global extinction has so far been proven to be irreversible. Even though permanent global species loss is a more dramatic phenomenon than regional changes in species composition, even minor changes from a healthy stable state can have dramatic influence on the food web and the food chain insofar as reductions in only one species can adversely affect the entire chain (coextinction), leading to an overall reduction in biodiversity, possible alternative stable states of an ecosystem notwithstanding. Ecological effects of biodiversity are usually counteracted by its loss. Reduced biodiversity in particular leads to reduced ecosystem services and eventually poses an immediate danger for food security, also for humankind.[1] The answer to this question is:","completion":"Iceland had a more dramatic influence on the food web, as the actions of its people led to a loss of animal and plant species, which adversely affected the food chain and overall biodiversity."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

OPTIONS: + be complacent; + sign the contract; + get a pen to sign the contract; Q: I heard that Quinn read the terms of the contract and finally agreed to it with a signature. And I was wondering Why did Quinn do this? A:","completion":"Quinn's action of reading the contract thoroughly, agreeing to the terms and then signing it can be attributed to a multitude of potential reasons. Firstly, it is essential to understand that signing a contract is a responsible and serious action. A contract signifies a legal agreement between two or more parties, each of whom are agreeing to undertake certain obligations or duties as stated in the contract. Failure to fulfill these obligations can often lead to legal repercussions. Therefore, before signing a contract, one must ensure that they fully understand and agree to all the terms mentioned in it. One potential reason for Quinn's action could be the fact that the contract offered benefits that aligned with Quinn's needs or interests. The contract could have been related to a job offer, a business deal, a lease agreement or any other arrangement, and Quinn presumably believed that signing it would be advantageous or necessary for them. They must have seen potential in the contract that could benefit them or help them achieve their goals effectively. Another reason could be that Quinn may have engaged in negotiations before agreeing to the contract. Sometimes, the initial terms of a contract may not be entirely favorable to one party. In such situations, this party can engage in discussions or negotiations with the other party or parties involved in the contract to alter the terms to a certain degree. If these negotiations resulted in an agreement that was satisfactory to Quinn, this could explain why they agreed to sign the contract. Also, the thorough reading of the contract signifies a cautious approach from Quinn. They wanted to make sure they understood every element of what they were entering into. This could imply a couple of things: one, Quinn understands the potential consequences of entering a contract blindly; and two, they have a respect for the process and wish to ensure transparency and fairness. Reading it in detail allows Quinn to clarify any ambiguity, understand obligations, measure feasibility, and assess risk factors. Finally, Quinn not opting for complacency reflects their seriousness and understanding of the implications of signing a contract. Complacency in such scenarios can lead to overlooking certain aspects which may not be in one's favor and can lead to detrimental effects later on. Hence, by not choosing to be complacent, Quinn exhibits conscientiousness and prudence. In conclusion, Quinn's actions represent a well thought out decision process. They indicate a proper understanding and seriousness towards legal obligations, a desire for personal or professional growth, the skill to negotiate, a careful approach towards assessing potential risks, and a non-complacent attitude."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: suppose the person does not have a lung disease happens, how will it affect the lungs will oxygenate more blood. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect A:","completion":"A: more If a person does not have a lung disease, it typically means that their lungs are functioning normally and efficiently. In this situation, the lungs will be more effective in oxygenating and providing a consistent supply of oxygen to the blood as compared to someone with lung disease. Lung diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma, can impair lung function and negatively affect the oxygenation process. In a healthy individual, the process of respiration occurs smoothly, following the steps you provided. Air is taken into the body through the nose or mouth, filtered, warmed, and humidified as it travels down the windpipe and into the bronchial tubes. These tubes branch out further into smaller airways called bronchioles, ultimately leading to the tiny air sacs or alveoli, which are responsible for gas exchange. Oxygen from the inhaled air diffuses into the blood vessels surrounding these tiny sacs, and carbon dioxide, a waste product from cellular metabolism, diffuses from the blood into the alveoli to be exhaled. When the lungs are functioning optimally without any disease, they are capable of providing the body with a sufficient amount of oxygen to meet the energy requirements of all vital organs and tissues. This results in more efficient blood oxygenation and overall better functioning of the circulatory and respiratory systems. Conversely, if a person has a lung disease, such as COPD, their lung function is compromised, making it harder for them to efficiently oxygenate the blood. This can lead to shortness of breath, fatigue, and other signs of oxygen deprivation. Lung diseases create obstacles in the airways (such as inflammation, mucus production, or airway constriction) that hinder the passage of air, making it increasingly difficult for the person to breathe and take in sufficient amounts of oxygen. Therefore, option A (more) would be the accurate choice. A person without any lung disease would have healthier, more efficient lungs compared to someone with a lung disease, allowing them to oxygenate more blood and maintain optimal energy levels throughout the body."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer:","completion":"To answer your questions, LAPD Detective Burton is played by Dennis Farina in the movie \\"Paparazzi.\\" The movie's plot revolves around Bo Laramie (Cole Hauser), a rising movie star who has achieved major success with his latest film. He is constantly harassed by persistent photographers Rex Harper (Tom Sizemore), Wendell Stokes (Daniel Baldwin), Leonard Clark (Tom Hollander), and Kevin Rosner (Kevin Gage), who go as far as to endanger the lives of Bo and his family, including his wife Abby (Robin Tunney) and their 8-year-old son Zach (Blake Bryan). A car accident caused by Rex and his crew results in injuries to Bo's wife and son, leading Bo to seek help from LAPD Detective Burton (Dennis Farina). Burton explains that there are no witnesses to the accident, so it remains difficult to prove that these paparazzi were responsible for the incident. Bo then takes matters into his own hands, leading to a dangerous and intense battle against the relentless photographers. Investing in a film proposal like \\"Paparazzi\\" comes with its own set of risks and rewards. The movie has an engaging plot and a talented cast, which may draw a significant audience. Moreover, the theme of the film, addressing the pervasive intrusion of paparazzi into the private lives of celebrities, is a relevant and compelling issue in today's society. It could potentially spark discussions and debates, thereby generating even more interest in the movie. However, there could be downsides to investing in a film like \\"Paparazzi\\" as well. The movie deals with a controversial issue, and some audiences may not receive it well.

Math problem: Solve 0 = 18*t - 17*t for t. What is the solution?","completion":"Okay, let's make this simple! We have a math problem that looks like this: 0 = 18*t - 17*t. Think of 't' as a toy. So this means we have 18 toys and we need to take away 17 toys. Now, what do we get if we have 18 toys and we take away 17 toys? That's right! We have 1 toy left. So, that part of the problem looks like this: 1*t (which means we have 1 toy). Since 1*t equals 0, and because 1 toy is the same as just 1, the problem becomes 0 = 1*t, or 0 = t. So, in this case, the solution is t = 0. That means we don't have to worry about the toys at all because there are none! Great job!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.
