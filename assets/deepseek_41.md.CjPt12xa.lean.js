How do I automate e commerce website like flipkart using selenium web driver, navigate the menu and then add an item to cart? Is there any add-on tool to automate the web UI for Google Maps using a Selenium web driver? Do those questions have the same meaning?","completion":"First, let's address your questions, then move on to the e-commerce website automation. No, those questions do not have the same meaning. The first one is about automating an e-commerce website (like Flipkart) using Selenium web driver, while the second one is about automating the web UI for Google Maps using Selenium web driver. Although both of them involve Selenium web driver, their purposes are different. Now let me guide you through the process of automating an e-commerce website like Flipkart, navigating the menu, and adding an item to the cart using Selenium web driver. 1. Install the required packages: To get started, you'll need to install Selenium library. If you haven't, please install using \`pip install selenium\`. You will also need a web driver, like ChromeDriver. 2. Import necessary libraries: \`\`\`python from selenium import webdriver from selenium.webdriver.common.keys import Keys from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait from selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as EC \`\`\` 3. Set up the browser instance: \`\`\`python driver = webdriver.Chrome(executable_path='path/to/chromedriver') driver.get('https://www.flipkart.com/') \`\`\` 4. Close the login prompt (if needed), you can do this by awaiting for a modal to appear, and clicking close button: \`\`\`python wait = WebDriverWait(driver, 10) close_btn = wait.until(EC.element_to_be_clickable((By.XPATH, '//button[text()=\\"✕\\"]'))) close_btn.click() \`\`\` 5. Navigate the menu: You can navigate the menu by finding the element that represents it or by searching with keywords. Let's use the search bar for simplicity; in this example, we will search for a laptop: \`\`\`python search_box = driver.find_element_by_name('q') search_box.send_keys('laptop') search_box.send_keys(Keys.RETURN) \`\`\` 6. Select an item: After the search has executed, select an item from the results. You may want to select an item based on a specific index or scroll through the items until you find one that meets your criteria. For this example, we'll choose the first item in the list: \`\`\`python wait.until(EC.visibility_of_element_located((By.CSS_SELECTOR, 'div._2kHMtA'))) products = driver.find_elements_by_css_selector('div._2kHMtA') first_product = products[0] first_product.click() \`\`\` 7. Add the item to the cart: On the product page, find the 'Add to Cart' button and click it. Before that, switch to the new browser tab that opens upon clicking the product. \`\`\`python driver.switch_to.window(driver.window_handles[-1]) add_to_cart_button = wait.until(EC.element_to_be_clickable((By.XPATH, '//button[text()=\\"ADD TO CART\\"]'))) add_to_cart_button.click() \`\`\` This will add the selected item to the cart.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. News article: A Willem Dafoe Movie-With an Audience of One What does an artist provocateur do when offered a 600-seat theater to present his work? He makes 599 seats unavailable. French conceptual artist Loris Gréaud will debut a film at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art on Aug. 16 that is only allowed to play to one audience member at a time, with the institution’s Bing Theater reconfigured for a single seat. If a viewer leaves early, the 54-minute movie will play to an empty room. Such exclusive (or nearly so) experiences can be found across Lacma this summer. Along with “Loris Gréaud: Sculpt,” the museum also features one of James Turrell ’s perpetual cells. It allows a single visitor inside a sphere to be bombarded by light. “Rain Room,” a chamber of falling water that was created by artist duo Random International, has been running at the museum since the fall and accommodates roughly 15 people at once. “Sculpt,” Mr. Gréaud’s first feature-length film, stars Willem Dafoe as a “moment collector” who gets lost in his own obsessive quest for experiences. Tickets are free of charge, released online at 9 a.m. to the first takers for that day’s four to six screenings. The artist is sending in video bootleggers to record the work and is planning free screenings in other places after the Lacma debut. “If you look at the project itself, it’s a money-losing machine—it’s an object that can’t exist today,” Mr. Gréaud said. The artist added that the movie, which is tinted red from start to finish, is scripted and features a coherent narrative. “It’s not abstract and crazy,” he said. The film’s trailer, which flickers from freakish characters to naked women in bondage to gusts of steam to Mr. Dafoe in torment, has drawn nearly 680,000 views on YouTube since May. The 37-year-old artist said that he courted Mr. Dafoe for the movie, filmed over 30 months in Italy, Vietnam, Iceland and elsewhere. One day, while Mr. Dafoe was considering whether to do the project, he suggested that the two rehearse in New York the following morning. Mr. Gréaud, who lives in a Paris suburb, raced to the airport and landed on Mr. Dafoe’s doorstep in time. Even then, Mr. Gréaud said, the actor didn’t offer an outright yes. “I think he was sort of testing me,” the artist said. Mr. Gréaud’s exhibition follows a controversial one at the Dallas Contemporary in 2015, when he hired people to smash his works in a pretend riot. What got more attention, though, was the viral moment that followed: After a female art critic disparaged the show, Mr. Gréaud sent her a series of angry Facebook messages telling her that she needed a boyfriend. The exchange caught fire online. Afterward the artist suggested that his outburst was an intentional part of the project. Lacma has been instructed not to announce the exhibit’s end date, but other events are planned for the theater in the fall.

Sentence 2: Jequié is rich in iron ore so that it is very hot during the day and cold at night. In both sentences: - The subject is the same—it is the city of Jequié. - The main idea presented is that Jequié is rich in iron ore, which is indicated by the phrases \\"rich on Iron Ore\\" and \\"rich in iron ore.\\" Although the prepositions \\"on\\" and \\"in\\" are used differently, they convey the same point regarding Jequié's abundance in iron ore. - The sentences describe the outcome of this abundance in iron ore—a significant temperature difference between daytime and nighttime. The term \\"very hot during the day, and cold at night\\" is used in Sentence 1, while Sentence 2 utilizes \\"very hot during the day and cold at night.\\" Both phrase variations convey the same idea of the local climate.

This article: The Annunciation draws heavily on van der Weyden's 1430s Louvre Annunciation, his c. 1455 Saint Columba altarpiece, and the Clugny Annunciation (c. 1465–75), which is attributed to either van der Weyden or Memling. Memling almost certainly was apprenticed to van der Weyden in Brussels until setting up his own workshop in Bruges sometime after 1465. Memling's Annunciation is more innovative, with motifs such as the attendant angels that were absent in the earlier paintings. According to Till-Holger Borchert, not only was Memling familiar with van der Weyden's motifs and compositions, but he might have assisted with the underdrawing in van der Weyden's workshop. The shutters on the right are copied from the Louvre panel, the knotted curtain appears in the Columba triptych's \\"Annunciation\\".A sense of movement is conveyed throughout. The trailing edges of Gabriel's garment fall outside the pictorial space, indicating his arrival. The Virgin's \\"serpentine\\" pose, with attendant angels supporting her, adds to the sense of flow. Memling's use of color achieves a startling effect. The traditional rays of light are replaced with light color indicators; the white clothes rendered in \\"icy\\" blue, the angel to the right in yellow patches seems \\"bleached by light\\", the left-hand angel appears to be steeped in shadow, dressed in clothes of lavender and bearing deep green wings. The effect is iridescent, according to Blum, who writes, \\"this shimmering surface gives [the figures] an unearthly quality, separating them from the more believable world of the bedchamber.\\" The effect deviates from the pure naturalism and realism which typifies Early Netherlandish art, causing a \\"startling\\" juxtaposition, an effect that is \\"unsteadying\\" and contradictory. contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the person who might have assisted with the underdrawing in Van der Weyden's workshop?, what is it ?

To be honest, I don’t really consider them true friends, but that’s because of past issues that I need to resolve. Anyway, we all decided to live on campus together next year in this great building: two bedrooms, two bathrooms, kitchen, on site mailbox, the works. But I HATE living with my current roommate. I believe that I wouldn’t like her even if I didn’t live with her. She’s disgusting — lets her dirty gym clothes marinate on the floor, leaves our shared sink a mess despite me cleaning it EVERY night, has trash strewn over half the room (for some reason she gets the bigger half of the room??) seconds after she enters. She coughs and sneezes without covering her mouth because “she can’t help it.” She’s loud — always slamming the door shut, her walk is like a stomp in her clunky boots, her voice echoes when we’re walking together, inside and out, and then she just claims that it’s because she’s a “sociable person.” She’s rude — she interrupts people when they are talking (also the signs of a sociable person), she is such a know-it-all, especially on topics she knows nothing about (for instance, MY job), she jumps into conversations that do not include her at all, she speaks on the behalf of others who CAN speak, she believes that if something happened in her life then it automatically sets an example for everything else in the world (such as the lack of bullying in schools? Okay.). And she is so LAZY. She doesn’t help clean up unless I directly ask her, she doesn’t have a job because she is super picky about where she wants to work but complains about not having money (she claims to have applied to every position on campus but never got one, and didn’t do a single follow up). Then she cries because she feels like she is disappointing her family. And then she cries about not having a boyfriend. That’s not really lazy but you can all see why she DOES NOT have one. Basically she’s always dumping her problems on everyone else and frankly I don’t really care because they all have simple solutions. And honestly, she’s just MEAN. She takes play fighting/teasing to a whole different level (throwing pencils and metal forks). And a bit racist. Yet everyone expects me to share a room with her again next semester. I can’t do it. Nope. I decided to get an apartment. BY MYSELF. I’m not risking ending up with another shit roommate. I’m willing to start working full time to avoid that. But everyone else in the group thinks that it’s just so I could have my own room (they know that I have never had my own bedroom) and that I’m being an asshole for not trying to stick it out. That I’m being an asshole because they have to risk getting shit roommates because it’s too expensive living with just two people (the other girl is joining the army, but no one thinks she’s doing wrong by “abandoning” us). So what? AITA for letting them sink with the increased rent, or the possibility of getting terrible roommates, for my own means?","completion":"Part #1: Real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation.

Q:Answer the question below: A piece of sandpaper was rubbed across a glass table, then the sandpaper was rubbed across some gravel. The friction will be greater between the sandpaper and the glass table or or the sandpaper and the gravel.? Assuming that: Rougher surfaces have more friction between them than smoother surfaces. A:","completion":"Given your assumption that rougher surfaces have more friction between them than smoother surfaces, the sandpaper will have greater friction when rubbed across gravel than when it's rubbed across a glass table. The friction between two surfaces is determined by their relative roughness. Typically, the frictional force is greater when the surfaces in contact are rougher. The texture of gravel is more uneven and typically rougher compared to a glass table, which is smoother. So, when you rub sandpaper against gravel, the tiny, rough particles of the sandpaper get into the tiny irregularities on the gravel's rough surface, causing more resistance or friction. In contrast, when sandpaper is rubbed across the glass table, the interaction surface is smoother, resulting in lower friction. However, please note that other factors such as the pressure with which you're rubbing the sandpaper and the material properties of the sandpaper, glass, and gravel can also affect the friction. Still, fundamentally and simply based on surface roughness, the friction should be greater between sandpaper and gravel."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Question: Will and his partners steal how much money? Movie title: Stolen Movie plot: In New Orleans, the notorious bank thief and family man Will Montgomery steals 10m with his partners Vincent, Riley Jeffers and Hoyt. However, he has an argument with Vincent during the getaway and Hoyt leaves Will behind with money. He tries to flee but the FBI agent Tim Harlend organizes a manhunt and Will is captured. He burns the stolen money to get rid of the evidence against him. Eight years later, Will leaves the prison and he goes to the house of his teenage daughter Alison Loeb, who has issues against him. Alison leaves Will alone in a coffee shop and takes a cab to go to a session with her shrink. However, a couple of minutes later, Will receives a phone call from Vincent, who is presumed dead, telling that he has abducted Alison and will kill her unless he receives the 10m of the last robbery. Now Will has twelve hours to find a way to rescue his daughter from the hands of the psychopath Vincent.Vincent soundproofs a cab trunk, drugs Alison, and drives around, making threats and killing people at random. Apparently, this is how he stays off the radar.Will buys a prepaid phone and sends Vincent's phone to Alabama to buy time, then he accosts Hoyt. Hoyt is conveniently killed by the police, and Will carjacks a cab and tries to track Vincent, all while evading the hopeless FBI/police. Will contacts Riley and they somehow get a truckload of specialized equipment to break into the same bank, stealing gold bars to pay off Vincent. Harlend continues his chase, ineffectually. Riley and Will make for the ferry, using a mannequin to fool the cops.Will meets Vincent with the money at the fairground, lugging 10m in gold bars in a duffel bag. Vincent shoots Will and lights the cab on fire. Despite a bullet in his ribs, Will beats up Vincent, lights him on fire, and drives the cab into the water, apparently drowning his daughter. Vincent, also despite being gravely wounded, wades into the water to battle Will. After some underwater karate moves, Will beats Vincent (again) and rescues Alison. Vincent returns...

Reviewing the album for Esquire, Gary Giddins hailed it as another landmark recording from Coleman and his most accomplished work of harmolodics, partly because of compositions which he found clearly expressed and occasionally timeless. In his opinion, the discordant keys radically transmute conventional polyphony and may be the most challenging part for listeners, who he said should concentrate on Coleman's playing and \\"let the maelstrom resolve itself around his center\\". Giddins also highlighted the melody of \\"Sleep Talk\\", deeming it among the best of the saxophonist's career. Kofi Natambu from the Detroit Metro Times wrote that Coleman's synergetic approach displays expressive immediacy rather than superficial technical flair while calling the record \\"a multi-tonal mosaic of great power, humor, color, wit, sensuality, compassion and tenderness\\". He found the songs inspirational, danceable, and encompassing developments in African-American music over the previous century. Robert Christgau called its \\"warm, listenable harmolodic funk\\" an artistic \\"breakthrough if not a miracle\\". He found its exchange of rhythms and simple melodies heartfelt and sophisticated, writing in The Village Voice, \\"the way the players break into ripples of song only to ebb back into the tideway is participatory democracy at its most practical and utopian.\\"Purist critics in jazz complained about the music's incorporation of danceable beats and electric guitar. In Stereo Review, Chris Albertson deemed the combination of saxophone and bizarre funk occasionally captivating but ultimately unfocused. Dan Sullivan of the Los Angeles Times believed the album's supporters in \\"hip rock circles\\" had overlooked flaws, arguing that Tacuma and Coleman's playing sound like a unique \\"beacon of clarity\\" amid an incessant background.

But I had a pot sticker craving so I ordered a few items that seemed decent per reviews. The guy said 15-20min but it took 40 minutes. The pot stickers (which I got pan fried vs steamed) were actually more like deep fried. The sauce is more sweet, not vinegary. Not terrible but out of 6 there was about 2 that had a decent amount of filling, the rest had about a tablespoonful in a dumpling that is about 4 inches long and 3 inches tall. The taste of the filling and the dumpling dough was good, just poor proportions and a bit greasy. The sweet and sour chicken was bright pink and more onion than anything else. Overall somehow the dish was bland. The rice that came with it was soggy - too much water. The pad see ew noodles were overcooked and clumped up into small cubed bits.

Runoff carries it away. The fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, from ponds to oceans. Nitrogen is a fertilizer in the water. Since there is a lot of nitrogen, it causes algae to grow out of control. Pictured below is a pond covered with algae ( Figure below ). Algae use up carbon dioxide in the water. After the algae die, decomposers break down the dead tissue. The decomposers use up all the oxygen in the water. This creates a dead zone.

We know that as a team they have gained confidence, if not a lot of points, in a very short space of time in Europe's pre-eminent club competition. It's obvious that they have grown up these past few months, from the spooked innocents of the Nou Camp to the mature competitors we saw at Etihad Stadium.

Sixteen months ago, they lost 2-0 to a modest Malmo side and crashed out of the Champions League in the qualifying stage. Their world seemed to be at an end. Now they have just completed the group stage - earning in the region of £23m - and their world is infinitely brighter. Fifteen months ago they led Aberdeen 1-0 in a league match at Pittodrie before losing 2-1. Now they swat Aberdeen aside 3-0 in a cup final. Thirteen months ago they completed their double-header against Molde in the Europa League, losing 5-2 over two matches, and tried to dress it up as an unfair reflection of where they were at. It wasn't. On Tuesday, they got a fully deserved draw in a Champions League match against a Manchester City team that might have been missing many stellar names but was still put together for a total of £92m with another £129m sitting on the bench. Twelve months ago they went ahead against Motherwell at Celtic Park and lost 2-1. Now they go 2-0 down against Motherwell at Fir Park and win 4-3.

Rodgers' calm authority, motivational excellence and tactical nous has galvanised things in a major way. He's done it quickly and with not a lot of money. His starting line-up in Manchester only contained one player that wasn't around last season - Moussa Dembele. Much has been made of Dembele's capture and there is no doubt that it's been a coup. Much has also been made of the arrival of Scott Sinclair and he, too, has been a big success. The major difference that the manager has made, though, has come not in the players he has signed but the players he has reinvented. Maybe Scott Brown, now free of injury, would be playing with the authority of old no matter who his manager was this season, but Rodgers made him a special case from day one and has love-bombed him at every turn. James Forrest was on his way out of the door at Celtic Park and has been yanked back in and restored to something approaching his best form, even if inconsistency still dogs him. Stuart Armstrong looks a different player. Tom Rogic has upped his level. Celtic now have a partnership at centre-back that is bedding in nicely. The irony of ironies here is that one of the few players who has gone backwards under Rodgers is the one who stood out under Ronny Deila. Leigh Griffiths remains in Dembele's shadow. It's easy to see why, but Griffiths has started just two games since returning from injury in September and has nine goals compared to 18 this time last season. With 12 minutes left in Manchester on Tuesday, Griffiths, a second-half substitute, had a chance to put Celtic back in front but he snatched at it and the moment passed. You wondered then would the Griffiths of last season have done more with it. This is a continuing challenge for Rodgers. Dembele is his young star, but he can't afford to let Griffiths' confidence drain away on the bench. It would be easy - and a little unfair - to deride Tuesday's game. Of course it was a dead rubber. Of course City were missing some of their biggest guns. Nine of the players who lost to Chelsea last weekend didn't play against Celtic - among them Sergio Aguero, Kevin de Bruyne and David Silva. That still left Ilkay Gundogan, Nolito, Leroy Sane and Kelechi Iheanacho as the chief attackers and Gael Clichy, Bacary Sagna, Pablo Zabaleta and Fernando as vastly experienced defensive players. Guardiola went with some youngsters but there was heaps of experience around them. What was obvious on the night was how comfortable Celtic looked, how they played without any fear, any regard for the reputations of some of those they were playing against. Weakened or not, that City team would have done damage against Celtic last season. Celtic's football has got better over the course of six games, but that couldn't have happened had their mentality not got better. They've come on a ton in that regard. They're a more robust side now. They believe in themselves more than they did before. They could have beaten City. After Patrick Roberts burst through to score the opening goal, there was a Forrest-inspired chance for Dembele, then a penalty that should have been given for a foul on Roberts, then Griffiths had a chance, then Gary Mackay-Steven had the best chance of all, just seven minutes from the end. City had opportunities as well, but it was hard to find a single soul at the game who thought they were better and deserved to win. What they were saying was that Celtic may not have won the match but they won respect. Across two contests with Guardiola's team they scored four times and went unbeaten. A new attitude has taken hold under Rodgers. The great frustration comes in the eight months they must now wait for another shot at getting back to this level. In the meantime, Rodgers and his chief executive, Peter Lawwell, have much to talk about. The manager has taken Celtic forward without having spent the earth. It only amounted to three draws from six games in the Champions League this season but consider those three points as a firm foundation for next season. Rodgers has prepared the ground. The challenge for the club is building on top of it.

Please answer the following question: Huge amounts of chemicals, such as fertilizers and pesticides, are applied to farm fields (see Figure below ). Some of the chemicals are picked up by rainwater. Runoff then carries the chemicals to nearby rivers or lakes. Dissolved fertilizer causes too much growth of water plants and algae. This can lead to dead zones where nothing can live in lakes and at the mouths of rivers. Some of the chemicals can infiltrate into groundwater. The contaminated water comes up in water wells. If people drink the polluted water, they may get sick. There are two lakes in southern Indiana that are popular places for families of nearby cities to visit for picnics and parties. Lake Mahoe is right next to a large farm that grows all kinds of crops for the town. The owner of the farm also rents out his barn regularly so people can use it for celebrations. Lake Tresco is located near a school and children will often come play at it during recess. Which lake will have more algae? A:","completion":"Lake Mahoe Step 1: Identify the key factors affecting algae growth in this context: In this case, the key factor mentioned is the presence of chemicals such as fertilizers and pesticides. These chemicals can lead to excessive growth of water plants and algae in nearby water bodies. Step 2: Compare the proximity of the two lakes to potential sources of these chemicals: Lake Mahoe is located right next to a large farm that grows various crops and uses fertilizers and pesticides. In contrast, Lake Tresco is located near a school, which is less likely to expose it to significant amounts of these chemicals. Step 3: Analyze the potential for chemical runoff or infiltration in each lake: Due to its proximity to the farm, Lake Mahoe is more likely to experience chemical runoff from rainwater carrying fertilizers and pesticides. This can potentially lead to higher levels of dissolved nutrients in the lake, promoting the growth of algae. On the other hand, Lake Tresco, being near a school, is less likely to be exposed to such chemical runoff. Step 4: Conclusion - Lake Mahoe will likely have more algae growth because of its proximity to the large farm that uses fertilizers and pesticides. These chemicals can contribute to excessive algae growth by providing the necessary nutrients for their proliferation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Disgusting: The officer was served this burger with a raw beef patty at a McDonald's in Derry, New Hampshire. He managed to take four bites before realising what he was eating. 'Deliberate': Police officer Rob Moore believes the fast food staff gave him the raw burger on purpose because he is a cop. Routine: Moore ordered a double quarter-pounder with cheese at the McDonald's, something he does a couple times a week during his late shift. ‘I took the bun off and the first patty was cooked, the second patty revealed a raw mess and I’m sitting there holding that. I couldn’t believe what I just ate,’ Moore told CBS Boston. The beef patty was completely raw, he says, which he believes was done on purpose because he is a police officer. ‘A lot of people don’t like police officers, all the circumstances are there. Only one there in full uniform and it was obviously cooked after I arrived.’ Shock: The McDonald's drive-through in Derry served Moore a raw burger. He was expecting a well-cooked double quarter-pounder with cheese. Sick: Moore says he went home and vomited all night long after he ate the raw meat. It was at a McDonald's drive-through in Derry, New Hampshire, that the police officer was given a raw burger. Moore admits he went home and became violently sick and vomited all night long. According to Moore, a surveillance video shows the cook preparing his order and not being able to close the cooker properly. The cook eventually gives up and slaps the raw meat onto the bun. A statement from the Derry McDonald’s owner and operator, Emile Haddad, said they were looking into the incident. ‘We take matters regarding food safety and quality very seriously. We have investigated the issue and have resolved the customer’s concern at the restaurant level,’ said the statement. What are highlight points for this article?","completion":"1.

Walter Leland Cronkite Jr. (November 4, 1916 - July 17, 2009) was an American broadcast journalist who served as anchorman for the CBS Evening News for 19 years (1962-1981). During the heyday of CBS News in the 1960s and 1970s, he was often cited as \\"the most trusted man in America\\" after being so named in an opinion poll. He reported many events from 1937 to 1981, including bombings in World War II; the Nuremberg trials; combat in the Vietnam War; the Dawson's Field hijackings; Watergate; the Iran Hostage Crisis; and the assassinations of President John F. Kennedy, civil rights pioneer Martin Luther King Jr., and Beatles musician John Lennon. He was also known for his extensive coverage of the U.S. space program, from Project Mercury to the Moon landings to the Space Shuttle. On April 16, 1962, Cronkite succeeded Douglas Edwards as anchorman of the CBS's nightly feature newscast, tentatively renamed Walter Cronkite with the News, but later the CBS Evening News on September 2, 1963, when the show was expanded from 15 to 30 minutes, making Cronkite the anchor of American network television's first nightly half-hour news program. Cronkite's tenure as anchor of the CBS Evening News made him an icon in television news. During the early part of his tenure anchoring the CBS Evening News, Cronkite competed against NBC's anchor team of Chet Huntley and David Brinkley, who anchored the Huntley-Brinkley Report. For much of the 1960s, the Huntley-Brinkley Report had more viewers than Cronkite's broadcast. A key moment for Cronkite came during his coverage of John F. Kennedy's assassination on November 22, 1963. Another factor in Cronkite and CBS' ascendancy to the top of the ratings was that, as the decade progressed, RCA made a corporate decision not to fund NBC News at the levels that CBS provided for its news broadcasts. Consequently, CBS News acquired a reputation for greater accuracy and depth in coverage. This reputation meshed well with Cronkite's wire service experience, and in 1967 the CBS Evening News began to surpass The Huntley-Brinkley Report in viewership during the summer months. In 1969, during the Apollo 11 (with co-host and former astronaut Wally Schirra) and Apollo 13 moon missions, Cronkite received the best ratings and made CBS the most-watched television network for the missions. In 1970, when Huntley retired, the CBS Evening News finally dominated the American TV news viewing audience. Although NBC finally settled on the skilled and well-respected broadcast journalist John Chancellor, Cronkite proved to be more popular and continued to be top-rated until his retirement in 1981. One of Cronkite's trademarks was ending the CBS Evening News with the phrase \\"...And that's the way it is,\\" followed by the date. Keeping to standards of objective journalism, he omitted this phrase on nights when he ended the newscast with opinion or commentary. Beginning with January 16, 1980, Day 50 of the Iran hostage crisis, Cronkite added the length of the hostages' captivity to the show's closing in order to remind the audience of the unresolved situation, ending only on Day 444, January 20, 1981.","completion":"This text is about Walter Leland Cronkite Jr., an American broadcast journalist who served as anchorman for the CBS Evening News for 19 years (1962-1981)."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Neuroscience: Which regions of the brain are responsible for anxiety? Please tell me if those questions are the same. Available choices: [i] no. [ii] yes.","completion":"[i] no. The two questions, although they both pertain to brain functions, are asking about different emotions and sensations (pain and anxiety) which are managed by unique regions of the brain and therefore are not the same. The sensation of pain is managed by a variety of structures in the brain, each playing a unique role. For physical pain, the process usually begins with the nociceptor sensory neurons located throughout the body that sends signals to the spinal cord upon encountering a potentially damaging stimulus. These signals then get forwarded to the brain via the thalamus. Two key areas in the cerebral cortex related to the sensation of pain are the somatosensory cortex and the anterior cingulate cortex. The somatosensory cortex helps in identifying the location and intensity of pain. The anterior cingulate cortex, on the other hand, is involved in the emotional response to pain. Additionally, the prefrontal cortex is involved in pain perception related to the suffering component, while the insula gives us the sensation of the unpleasantness of pain. Anxiety, however, is a more complex emotional response that involves an extensive network of brain regions known as the 'fear circuitry.' The central structure in this circuitry is the amygdala, which is involved in the detection of threat and the generation of fear responses. The prefrontal cortex and the anterior cingulate cortex also play significant roles, with the former involved in decision-making processes and controlling rational thought and action, and the latter helping to mediate the body's response to stress. The hippocampus, a region critical for memory, is also involved in anxiety, particularly in relation to remembering stressful or traumatic events. In summary, while overlapping brain regions (like the anterior cingulate cortex and prefrontal cortex) are involved in both pain and anxiety, each of these emotions utilizes the brain's structures in unique ways. Hence, the regions of the brain responsible for experiencing pain are distinct from those responsible for anxiety."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Premise: The decline of the Korean economy would cause more bankruptcies, increase investors' efforts to get out of won assets into other currencies, and force the won down further. Hypothesis: The decline of the Korean economy was beneficial since there weren't any bankruptcies. Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Available options: (1). yes; (2). it is not possible to tell; (3). no;","completion":"(3). No. The premise does not entail the hypothesis. Let's first unpack the premise and the hypothesis. Premise: The decline of the Korean economy would cause more bankruptcies, increase investors' efforts to get out of won assets into other currencies, and force the won down further. The premise suggests that if the Korean economy declines, three potential consequences are expected: increased bankruptcies, investors trying to exit from Korean won-denominated assets, and the devaluation of the won against other currencies. Hypothesis: The decline of the Korean economy was beneficial since there weren't any bankruptcies. The hypothesis states that the decline of the Korean economy was a positive occurrence because no bankruptcies were observed. This is contradictory to the premise's assertion that a decline in the Korean economy would lead to more bankruptcies. Now let's focus on whether the premise entails the hypothesis. Entailment is a logical relationship between two statements when the truth of one statement (premise) requires or guarantees the truth of the other statement (hypothesis). In this case, the premise does not guarantee the truth of the hypothesis, as the premise predicts that a declining economy will lead to more bankruptcies, while the hypothesis claims that the decline was beneficial due to the absence of bankruptcies. Since the premise and hypothesis present conflicting views on the consequences of a declining economy, it is not possible for the premise to entail the hypothesis. Therefore, the correct answer is option (3). No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: Alex wanted to make a big, healthy breakfast, so Alex made hard-boiled eggs.

Can you tell me the answer to what part of mexico got the earthquake hit??","completion":"The Mexico earthquake in discussion appears to be the one that occurred on September 19, 2017. This earthquake, with a magnitude of 7.1 on the Richter scale, struck Central Mexico and caused widespread destruction, loss of lives, and damage to infrastructure. The epicenter of the 2017 Central Mexico earthquake was located in Puebla state, near the town of Raboso. From there, the shockwaves spread out, affecting numerous cities and states throughout the region. Some of the most impacted areas include: 1. Mexico City: The capital of Mexico experienced significant devastation as a result of the earthquake. Many buildings collapsed, particularly older structures, leading to the deaths of hundreds of people and the displacement of thousands more. Infrastructure and transportation systems were also disrupted, causing long-lasting effects. 2. Puebla: Being close to the earthquake's epicenter, Puebla faced severe destruction. Many buildings, including historical structures like churches, were damaged or destroyed. The region's rescue efforts were overwhelmed by the scale of the catastrophe, and a significant loss of life was reported. 3. Morelos: The state of Morelos, particularly its capital, Cuernavaca, also suffered major damage. Numerous buildings collapsed or were structurally destabilized, and essential services like electricity and water supply faced significant challenges during the aftermath. 4. State of Mexico: Situated in the greater Mexico City metropolitan area, the State of Mexico experienced substantial damage to its buildings and infrastructure. The earthquake ruptured essential systems and led to loss of lives and property. 5. Guerrero: Despite being further away from the epicenter, the state of Guerrero still felt the earthquake's effects. Damage to several buildings and some loss of life were reported in the region. The 2017 Central Mexico earthquake was a tragic reminder of the vulnerability of the region, given its high risk of seismic activity. The earthquake also occurred only a few weeks after an 8.1 magnitude quake struck the coast of Chiapas in Southern Mexico, adding to the devastation already faced by the country. It is essential that proper emergency response plans, strict building codes, and appropriate education programs are put into place to minimize the impacts of future earthquakes on the Mexican population."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

I've seen several reviewers call ISOYG an 'anti-rape' film or even a feminist statement, and I just have to chime in on the galling hypocrisy of these claims. First of all, what do we see on the cover of this movie? That's right: a shapely woman's behind. Whether it was Zarchi's attempt to make an anti-rape statement - and I absolutely don't believe it was - is entirely beside the point. The film is marketing sex and the titillation of sexual assault and the material is so graphic (everything but actual penetration is shown) that NO ONE but the hard core exploitation crowd will enjoy it. The rape(s) in the film is uncomfortable, brutal and hard to watch. There's something to be said for presenting a horrible crime in such a brutal light, but there was no reason for this scene to go on for seemingly 30 minutes, none. There was also little character development of the victim and only one of the rapists is slightly developed (mere moments before he's murdered) so the scene isn't at all engaging on an emotional level. Really, it's just presented for the sake of showing extreme sexual violence and you can tell by the movies ISOYG is associated with on IMDb (Caligula, Cannibal Ferox, etc.) that it attracts only the exploitation crowd. Finally, a few reviewers have commended Zarchi's so-called documentary style and lack of a soundtrack. But considering how inept everything else in the film is (acting, script, etc.) I suspect these were financial decisions and the film looks like a documentary because he literally stationed a camera and let his porn-caliber actors do their thing. I'm not going to get all up on my high horse talking about the content of ISOYG. I'm all for exploitation / horror and love video nasties. In fact, I'm giving this movie three stars only because it truly does push the envelope so much further than some other films. However, it's also poorly made and after the rape occurs, just downright boring for the rest of the film as we watch a bunch of ho-hum, mostly gore-less murders and wait for the credits to roll. This is probably worth watching once if you're a hardcore 70s exploitation fan but I'm telling you, the movie is overall pretty bad and not really worth its notorious reputation.

Premise: \\"They are like that – les femmes!\\" The first statement presents a general and vague characterization of women using the French expression \\"les femmes.\\" It's unclear what the speaker implies about women with this phrase. Without context and details on what the speaker believes women are like, we cannot determine if the statement makes any generalizations or assumptions about the behavior or nature of women.

It wasn't that William lacked skills or intelligence; he certainly had his fair share of accomplishments. Still, his practical mindset and reserved nature were far better suited for handling the financial and technical aspects of their joint business venture. Step 1: Establish the main characters, Derrick and William, and their core skills. Step 2: Highlight the reason why running a business suits Derrick more than William. One fine morning, Derrick arrived at the office, noticing that their small company was growing exponentially. He realized that space was becoming an issue, threatening to hamper their progress. He promptly arranged a team meeting to discuss the matter. Step 3: Introduce a challenge for Derrick to tackle related to the management of the business. During the meeting, Derrick encouraged his team members to voice their concerns and ideas for solving the space problem. Many employees suggested renovating the office or searching for a larger space. William, meanwhile, quietly crunched the numbers and assessed the practicality of each suggestion. Step 4: Describe how Derrick and William address the problem using their respective skills. After weighing the various options, Derrick decided to move the company to a more spacious location that would not only accommodate the current employees but would also have room for future growth. With William's support in handling the financial aspects of the relocation, Derrick led the team in orchestrating a seamless move. Step 5: Showcase how the protagonists' respective strengths benefit the successful resolution of the challenge. The new office was soon buzzing with creative energy, and the employees were noticeably more motivated. Derrick's empathetic and open leadership style had allowed him to identify the needs of his team and take proactive steps to address them. William, on the other hand, continued to ensure that the company's finances remained strong and in order, allowing the business to prosper. Step 6: Finalize the story by demonstrating the success achieved through their teamwork and the strengths they brought to the table. In the end, it was evident that running a business better suited Derrick than William because of his innate ability to lead, engage, and motivate others. However, their joint venture's success was only possible because of the complementary strengths each partner contributed, proving they were a powerful pair when working together."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Q: With regular money now coming in from the Guardian column, my regular contributions to other publications and the modest subscription revenue from The Friday Thing, I had been living something of the high life since arriving in London. I had started hanging out with the great and the good of the dot com world: attending launch parties for new sites, going to parties to celebrate them staying in business for a whole year, eating their lunches, drinking their booze and learning their secrets while they tried to convince me to write about them in my column. Many of these online entrepreneurs had become my friends and I'd managed to find myself a new girlfriend - Maggie, a Welsh journalist who was a restaurant reviewer for a food and drink website. This was a brilliant blag: it meant we could eat at some of London's best restaurants and never pay a penny. Life was wonderful: The Friday Thing and the Guardian column meant that my plan to use the Internet to become hugely famous and successful was firmly on track, I'd made lots of new friends, and, on top of all that, I was getting laid and eating gourmet food for free. Even Sam Lewis was jealous, and he was rich. Meanwhile, the people I was writing about were not having such an easy time of it. 2003 was a really strange time to be covering the 'new media' industry - mainly because no one was really sure for how long there would be an industry left to cover. The dot com boom of 1999 seemed like a millennium ago: a period in history as crazy as the tulip craze or the South Sea Bubble look to us now. The first signs of trouble for the industry had come in 2000. As the century turned, so had the market and - to use the parlance of analysts - the boom had turned out to be a bubble. And then the bubble had burst. Question: How could the writer eat at London's best restaurants for free? === The answer to the above question is A:","completion":"The writer could eat at London's best restaurants for free because his girlfriend, Maggie, was a restaurant reviewer for a food and drink website.

Benjamin Ryan Tillman (August 11, 1847 - July 3, 1918) was a politician of the Democratic Party who served as Governor of South Carolina from 1890 to 1894, and a United States Senator from 1895 until his death in 1918. A white supremacist who opposed civil rights for blacks, Tillman led a paramilitary group of Red Shirts during South Carolina's violent 1876 election. On the floor of the U.S. Senate, he frequently ridiculed blacks, and boasted of having helped to kill them during that campaign. In the 1880s, Tillman, a wealthy landowner, became dissatisfied with the Democratic leadership and led a movement of white farmers calling for reform. Tillman was sworn in as governor in Columbia on December 4, 1890, before a crowd of jubilant supporters, the largest to see South Carolina's governor inaugurated since Hampton's swearing-in. In his inaugural address, Tillman celebrated his victory, \\"the citizens of this great commonwealth have for the first time in its history demanded and obtained for themselves the right to choose her Governor; and I, as the exponent and leader of the revolution which brought about the change, am here to take the solemn oath of office ... the triumph of democracy and white supremacy over mongrelism and anarchy, of civilization over barbarism, has been most complete.\\" Tillman made it clear he was not content that African Americans were allowed even a limited role in the political life of South Carolina: The whites have absolute control of the State government, and we intend at any and all hazards to retain it. The intelligent exercise of the right of suffrage ... is as yet beyond the capacity of the vast majority of colored men. We deny, without regard to color, that \\"all men are created equal\\"; it is not true now, and was not true when Jefferson wrote it. The legislature, at Tillman's recommendation, reapportioned itself, costing Charleston County four of its twelve seats, and other lowcountry counties one each, with the seats going to the upcountry. Although Tillman sought to reduce public expenditures, he was not successful in doing so as his reform program required spending, and the legislature could find few savings to make. Construction of Clemson College was slowed, and subsidies for fairs were cut. Among the matters before the new, Tillman-controlled legislature was who should fill the Senate seat held by Hampton, whose term expired in March 1891--until 1913, state legislatures elected senators. There was a call from many in the South Carolina Democratic Party to re-elect Hampton, who had played a major role in the state for the past thirty years, in war and peace. Tillman was embittered against Hampton for a number of slights, including the senator's neutrality in the race against Haskell. The legislature retired Hampton, who received only 43 of 157 votes, and sent Irby to Washington in his place. The ouster of Hampton was controversial, and remained so for decades afterwards; according to Simkins (writing in 1944), \\"to future generations of South Carolinians, Tillman's act was a ruthless violation of cherished traditions of which Hampton was a living symbol\\". Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: Were the seats replaced by Republicans or Democrats?","completion":"The article does not explicitly mention whether the replaced seats were occupied by Republicans or Democrats. However, it does describe how Tillman, a Democrat, and his movement led to a redistribution of seats within the South Carolina legislature. The reference to Charleston County losing four of its twelve seats and other lowcountry counties losing one seat each, with those seats going to the upcountry, indicates that the redistribution favored Tillman's Democratic faction."},{"prompt":"The young man (boy, really) played with his fingers in the garish light cast from the lone bulb in the concrete bunker. He scratched at an imaginary itch on his right hand (just below his thumb) to take his mind off the man in the lab coat who sat across from him at the beaten, scarred, wood table. It didn't work. And whoever this man in the lab coat was, he was insistent about paperwork. He had three inches clipped onto a weathered clipboard which he flipped through with precision. \\"Can I offer you a glass of water?\\" asked the boy's captor in a calm, sensitive tenor. The boy, Kurt, continued to scratch the imaginary itch, which had leapt magically from his right hand to the left. Eventually the falseness of the itch would be deduced, and the lab coated man would disappear out of the cell and return with... God knows what. He had seen torture hundreds-if not thousands-of times on TV, and he was glumly certain that there would be no commercial breaks for him. \\"Can I offer you a glass of water?\\" The question was repeated without urgency, like a forgetful waiter. The itch now leaped with the dexterity of a trained flea onto the boy's leg, and the dutiful fingers followed. He watched as the man in the lab coat, without name tag or company insignia, studied his stack of papers attached to the clipboard. Several yellow forms near the top half inch were labeled 27B. The man frowned and wrote a note on the top page. \\"Note: Find out who isn't duplicating 27B in Pink.\\" \\"I'm sorry,\\" he said, \\"I wasn't listening. Was that a yes or no to the water?\\" Kurt remained in his chair, almost motionless, except for the itching-and-scratching routine.

The archipelago, part of the Melanesia subregion, includes the main island of Grande Terre, the Loyalty Islands, the Chesterfield Islands, the Belep archipelago, the Isle of Pines, and a few remote islets. The Chesterfield Islands are in the Coral Sea. Locals refer to Grande Terre as \\"\\" (\\"the pebble\\"). - New Zealand is an island nation in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. The country geographically comprises two main landmassesthat of the North Island, or Te Ika-a-Mui, and the South Island, or Te Waipounamuand numerous smaller islands. New Zealand is situated some east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and roughly south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its long period of isolation, New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal, fungal and plant life. The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's capital city is Wellington, while its most populous city is Auckland. - Cook Strait lies between the North and South Islands of New Zealand. It connects the Tasman Sea on the northwest with the South Pacific Ocean on the southeast, and runs next to the capital city, Wellington. It is wide at its narrowest point, and is considered one of the most dangerous and unpredictable waters in the world. - The Southern Alps (Mori: K Tiritiri o te Moana ) are a mountain range extending along much of the length of New Zealand's South Island, reaching its greatest elevations near the island's western side. The term \\"Southern Alps\\" generally refers to the entire range, although separate names are given to many of the smaller ranges that form part of it. - The North Island or Te Ika-a-Mui (\\"Mori\\") is one of the two main islands of New Zealand, separated from the slightly larger but much less populous South Island by Cook Strait. The island's area is , making it the world's 14th-largest island.

Australia's capital is Canberra, and its largest urban area is Sydney. - Fiji ((), officially the Republic of Fiji, is an island country in Melanesia in the South Pacific Ocean about northeast of New Zealand's North Island. Its closest neighbours are Vanuatu to the west, New Caledonia to the southwest, New Zealand's Kermadec Islands to the southeast, Tonga to the east, the Samoas and France's Wallis and Futuna to the northeast, and Tuvalu to the north. - The Tasman Sea (Mori: \\"Te Tai-o-Rehua\\") is a marginal sea of the South Pacific Ocean, situated between Australia and New Zealand. It measures about across and about from north to south. The sea was named after the Dutch explorer Abel Janszoon Tasman, who was the first recorded European to encounter New Zealand and Tasmania. The British explorer Captain James Cook later extensively navigated the Tasman Sea in the 1770s as part of his first voyage of exploration. - Mount Taranaki, or Mount Egmont, is an active but quiescent stratovolcano in the Taranaki region on the west coast of New Zealand's North Island. Although the mountain is more commonly referred to as Taranaki, it has two official names under the alternative names policy of the New Zealand Geographic Board. The 2518-metre-high mountain is one of the most symmetrical volcanic cones in the world. There is a secondary cone, Fanthams Peak, , on the south side. Because of its resemblance to Mount Fuji, Taranaki provided the backdrop for the movie \\"The Last Samurai\\". - The South Taranaki Bight is a large bay that extends south and east from the south coast of Taranaki in New Zealand's North Island. With more symmetry than poetry or originality, it is matched by the North Taranaki Bight to the north of Cape Egmont. - Makahu is a settlement in inland Taranaki , in the western North Island of New Zealand . It is located to the southeast of Strathmore . the Makahu Stream runs south through the area to join with the Mangaehu Stream , which flows into the Patea River . The name \`\` Makahu '' means \`\` White Hawk '' . - Patea is the third-largest town in South Taranaki, New Zealand. It is on the western bank of the Patea River, 61 kilometres north-west of Whanganui on State Highway 3. Hawera is 27 km to the north-west, and Waverley 17 km to the east.

In Louisiana, Katherine receives a call from a friend, Father Michael Costigan (Stephen Rea), who says that his photographs of her have developed burn marks that when assembled, form a sickle-like symbol, a possible warning from God, which she ignores. She meets Doug Blackwell (David Morrissey), a teacher from the nearby town of Haven, who asks Katherine to find out why Haven's river has turned red. The locals believe this is a biblical plague caused by a girl, Loren McConnell (AnnaSophia Robb), who they believe killed her older brother in the river. They travel to Haven where Katherine meets Loren and has a vision of her turning the river red. Meanwhile, Ben witnesses dead frogs seemingly fall from the sky. Doug invites them to spend the night at his house, since the town doesn't have a motel. That night as they're about to eat dinner, they encounter flies and disease, which kills off local cows. Later that evening, Katherine explains to Doug at his wife's grave why she left the church; five years ago, she was an ordained minister.

The primary intention of these recordings was to provide an enhanced dynamic range, reduced noise, and better overall audio quality when compared to prior technologies. Your provided statement is mostly accurate but could be made more comprehensive by clarifying the compatibility and operational aspects of DBX encoded recordings with prior technologies. Here is a more detailed and long answer: DBX encoded recordings were designed to work in tandem with specific dbx playback equipment that employed the dbx compandor encoding/decoding scheme. This system used advanced noise reduction techniques to compress dynamic range by a factor of two in decibels. By automatically adjusting gain during playback, quiet sounds were reproduced at lower gain while loud sounds were reproduced at higher gain, thus reducing the effect of surface noise on quiet passages. This provided a significant improvement in overall sound quality for vinyl records and other audio formats at the time. When it came to compatibility with prior technologies, DBX encoded recordings were not directly compatible with conventional record playback preamplifiers and non-dbx equipment. This is because they lacked the necessary decoding circuitry to accurately reproduce the expanded dynamic range of a dbx-encoded recording. Attempting to play a DBX encoded recording on a standard playback system resulted in a significant loss of audio fidelity, including an exaggerated perceived dynamic range and considerable distortion. In essence, the compatibility between DBX encoded recordings and standard playback systems was limited and required separate dbx-compatible equipment to fully enjoy the intended audio quality improvements. That being said, the benefits of DBX encoded recordings were notable for those who invested in dbx-compatible playback equipment. The increased dynamic range and reduced noise interference provided by dbx processing allowed listeners to experience a higher level of audio fidelity and immersion, particularly for vinyl records which were prone to surface noise. In conclusion, DBX encoded recordings were not directly compatible with prior technology playback systems, primarily because they required specialized dbx-compatible equipment to decode the expanded dynamic range properly. By using the dbx compandor encoding/decoding scheme, these recordings delivered a marked improvement in dynamic range and noise reduction when played on compatible systems, offering a superior listening experience compared to non-dbx recordings of the time."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

News article: Egyptâs Chaotic Election Egypt’s democratic transition is in turmoil again as the country heads into next month’s crucial election for its first president since the ouster of Hosni Mubarak. Egypt’s military-run government is running out of time to guarantee a fair and credible vote. Authorities need to finalize the list of candidates and decide where polling stations will be located, whether citizens must vote at specific stations, what rules the monitors must follow and how television airtime will be apportioned among candidates. And all this information needs to be widely publicized. The parliamentary elections in February had problems but were still good enough that the Egyptians see the new legislature as legitimate. The standard should be higher for the presidential election. The presidential election commission sowed confusion and doubt when it disqualified 10 of 23 candidates for president, including Omar Suleiman, a secularist who was Mr. Mubarak’s former spy chief; Khairat el-Shater, a chief strategist of the Muslim Brotherhood; and Hazem Salah Abu Ismail, an ultraconservative Salafi preacher. All three were considered front-runners — and polarizing figures — and were ruled off the ballot on technical grounds. We don’t pretend to know all of the forces at work here. Both the military and the Islamists, who have been battling for control, lost their top candidates. But the disqualifications have fed conspiracy theories and added to doubts about the legitimacy of the entire process. So who’s left? The disqualifications were a boost for Amr Moussa, a secularist and former foreign minister, and Abdel Moneim Aboul Fotouh, a liberal Islamist reformer. They are seen as the leading candidates along with Mohamed Morsi, the Brotherhood’s current choice. The Brotherhood has the strongest organization. But Mr. Morsi is not as well known or as influential as Mr. Shater. His election would also give the Islamists control of both the presidency and Parliament, and his conservative religious vision rightly makes many Egyptians, as well as the West, uneasy. He has called for barring women and non-Muslims from the presidency on the basis of Islamic law, or Shariah, and he has made inflammatory statements about Israel, describing its citizens as “killers and vampires.” The two other leading candidates offer less ideological and more practical approaches that seek to appeal to a broad range of Egyptians. Mr. Moussa, a former Arab League secretary general with wide name recognition, has pledged to eradicate illiteracy, create jobs, attract international aid and “care for the marginalized and the weak.” His links to Mr. Mubarak could hurt him. Mr. Aboul Fotouh is charismatic and is seen as a pious man, but not an extremist. He was expelled from the Brotherhood last year for advocating a more tolerant and inclusive approach to Islam and Egypt. The military has wasted the last year, deferring decisions or making bad ones. Economic problems are particularly acute: debt is mounting; currency reserves could soon be depleted; unemployment has skyrocketed. A new constitutional assembly needs to be appointed (the court threw out the first group) to rewrite the repressive Mubarak Constitution, and Egyptians will need to approve it. The process is already causing fierce jockeying over how much power the military and the president will have. Egyptians need to know that whoever wins the presidency will bring a skilled team with a viable plan to create jobs, improve education, woo foreign investment and guarantee the rights of all Egyptians. The first step must be a credible vote. What are the most important parts of this news article?","completion":"This news article is about Egypt's elections for a new president after their old leader, Hosni Mubarak, was removed from power.

Help as much as you can. Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Who would win in a competition to memorize numbers, a chimp or a teenager? The teenager? Think again. Scientists have proved that chimps perform better than human beings when it comes to this kind of problem. We may have to rethink what we believe about human memory. Memory is our ability to learn something, save it and recall it when needed. Our memories are important to our sense of self, our personalities, and our ability to understand the world. Scientists say that there are different types of memory. There is short-term memory and long-term memory. Your short-term memory saves information for a few seconds or a few minutes. For example, the time it takes to compare the prices of a few items in a store. Long-term memory involves the information you try hard to keep, because it's meaningful to you (an example is data about family and friends. ) And then there is visual memory and sound memory. But these are not hard and fast: scientists argue a lot about the nature of memory. Scientists have also found that people memorize things in different ways. Some memorize better with the help of pictures. Others are helped more by sounds. One thing's for sure. If you can combine different kinds of memory together, you will remember a lot! So why not try pictures with English words? At the same time listen to recordings of the same group of words. It may help when it comes to memorizing it. Imagination and association can be useful too. By imagination scientists mean picturing a word in your mind. Association means relating the word to something you already know.

Article: HONG KONG -- Hong Kong Disneyland is too crowded, a senior Chinese tourism official said today, hinting that another Disney Park is necessary to accommodate demand from China's huge population. The comments by Shao Qiwei, director of China's State Administration of Tourism, came a day after Shanghai's mayor Han Zheng said the city was preparing to build China's second Disney theme park. \\"China has a very large population. We now have 1.3 billion people. The market is very large. As far as I know, Hong Kong Disneyland is now very crowded,\\" said Shao, whose comments were broadcast on Hong Kong's Cable TV. The Hong Kong theme park, which opened in September, was widely criticized in January when it turned away hundreds of Lunar New Year holiday makers from mainland China because the park was full. Chaos erupted when angry crowds tried to force their way into the park. The embarrassing incident prompted a public apology from Hong Kong Disneyland Managing Director Bill Ernest and a dressing down from Hong Kong's leader Donald Tsang. Authorities are carefully studying the issue of overcrowding in preparation for the possible building of the Disney park in Shanghai, Shao said. The official Xinhua News Agency reported Tuesday that no agreement has been reached on the park in Shanghai, quoting senior vice president of Walt Disney Parks and Resorts, Leslie Goodman. Hong Kong Disneyland is a joint venture between The Walt Disney Co. and the local government, which shouldered the bulk of the park's construction fees.

This meets the criteria because it utilizes less common words (ridicule, exclusion, and comrades) while maintaining the same meaning as the initial response. Part #3: Make sure your correct answer is reasonably long, consistent with the context, and requires common sense. Usage: Perhaps the child underwent a humiliating encounter, causing him to unleash his frustrations on his mother later. This meets the criteria because it is a longer response, consistent with the provided context, and relies on understanding the emotional situation rather than merely extracting information from the text. Part #4: Use as few words as possible from the given context. Usage: The young lad might have faced mockery and ostracism, leading to his emotional outburst. This meets the criteria because it uses minimal words from the original context (only \\"young lad\\" refers to \\"the boy\\") and still conveys the correct answer. Part #5: Use a response that is uncommon/non-stereotypical, so it is less predictable. Usage: It's plausible that the youngster encountered taunts and isolation, thereby provoking his pent-up emotions. This meets the criteria by using unique language (taunts, isolation, and pent-up emotions) to create a less predictable response. Part #6: Vary your language for each question. Usage: The juvenile could have been subjected to jeers and exclusion, which eventually unleashed his repressed feelings.

Initially termed \\"progressive pop\\", the style was an outgrowth of psychedelic bands who abandoned standard pop traditions in favour of instrumentation and compositional techniques more frequently associated with jazz, folk or classical music. Additional elements contributed to its \\"progressive\\" label: lyrics were more poetic, technology was harnessed for new sounds, music approached the condition of \\"art\\", and the studio, rather than the stage, became the focus of musical activity, which often involved creating music for listening, not dancing. - The Wurlitzer electric piano, trademarked the \\"Electronic Piano\\" and referred to by musicians as the \\"Wurly\\", was one of a series of electromechanical stringless pianos manufactured and marketed by the Rudolph Wurlitzer Company of Corinth, Mississippi, U.S. and North Tonawanda, New York.

Passage: In Ireland, private schools (Irish: scoil phríobháideach) are unusual because a certain number of teacher's salaries are paid by the State. If the school wishes to employ extra teachers they are paid for with school fees, which tend to be relatively low in Ireland compared to the rest of the world. There is, however, a limited element of state assessment of private schools, because of the requirement that the state ensure that children receive a certain minimum education; Irish private schools must still work towards the Junior Certificate and the Leaving Certificate, for example. Many private schools in Ireland also double as boarding schools. The average fee is around €5,000 annually for most schools, but some of these schools also provide boarding and the fees may then rise up to €25,000 per year. The fee-paying schools are usually run by a religious order, i.e., the Society of Jesus or Congregation of Christian Brothers, etc. Question: What is the Irish term for school fees?","completion":"Part #1: Identify the passage and the question.

His father, Otto Anderson (1903-1984) was a farmer; and his mother, Audrey Volenne (nee Speer; 1906-1969) was an opera singer and concert pianist who was forced to abandon her own Hollywood dreams to care for her family. Following her example, West stated to his father as a youth that he intended to go to Hollywood after his completion of school. He moved to Seattle with his mother when he was 15, following his parents' divorce. West often reprised his role as Batman/Bruce Wayne, first in the short-lived animated series The New Adventures of Batman, and in other shows such as The Batman/Tarzan Adventure Hour, Tarzan and the Super 7, Super Friends: The Legendary Super Powers Show, and The Super Powers Team: Galactic Guardians (succeeding Olan Soule in the role). In 1979, West once again donned the Batsuit for the live-action TV special Legends of the Superheroes. In 1985, DC Comics named West as one of the honorees in the company's 50th-anniversary publication Fifty Who Made DC Great for his work on the Batman series. West was considered to play Thomas Wayne, Bruce Wayne's father, in Tim Burton's 1989 Batman film. Originally, he wanted to play Batman. West never appeared in any of the theatrically released post-1960s Batman franchise motion pictures and, to date, neither has Burt Ward (Robin, from the TV series). West made an appearance in a 1992 episode of Batman: The Animated Series on Fox, but not as Batman (as the role of Batman was already being played by Kevin Conroy). Instead, he portrayed Simon Trent, a washed-up actor who used to play a superhero in a TV series called The Gray Ghost and who now has difficulty finding work. West later had a recurring role as the voice of Mayor Grange in the WB animated series The Batman. The actor vocally reprised his role as Batman for the CGI-animated short film Batman: New Times. He co-starred with Mark Hamill, who vocally portrayed The Joker and had originally played the role on Batman: The Animated Series. West also voiced Thomas Wayne in an episode of the cartoon series Batman: The Brave and the Bold. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: What did he do after that series?","completion":"After the Batman series, Adam West continued to act as Batman/Bruce Wayne in different animated shows and specials, like The New Adventures of Batman, The Batman/Tarzan Adventure Hour, Tarzan and the Super 7, Super Friends: The Legendary Super Powers Show, The Super Powers Team: Galactic Guardians, and Legends of the Superheroes.

The movie opens into action with Hamilton's initial research team trying to capture one of these new (and very large) primates, but fails and is apparently wiped out. Hamilton and his assistant Chenne (Prapimporn Karnchanda) survive and scour the camp site looking for clues and remains of their team. Meanwhile, another research team is inbound, this one a motley crew of incredibly naive college anthropology students with no idea of what they're in for. The students Seth, Amy, Greg, Sydney, Josh, and Dani are flown into a remote region of the Thai jungle, and picked up by a guide who drives them deeper into bush. He drops them off in a panic at the edge of trail/road, which leads further still into the foliage, claiming \\"bad things\\" are in there and won't go any further.

Answer:","completion":"The Kollegienkirche, located in Salzburg, Austria, is a remarkable architectural masterpiece and an important historical venue for classical music. This baroque church, also known as the University Church, was built between 1694 and 1707 by the renowned architect Johann Bernhard Fischer von Erlach. Kollegienkirche is inextricably linked to the Salzburg Festival, an internationally renowned event that celebrates classical music, opera, and theater on a grand scale. The Salzburg Festival was first established in 1920, with the objective of fostering and promoting the rich cultural heritage of Salzburg and Austria. The festival was founded by a group of intellectuals, artists, and politicians, including Hugo von Hofmannsthal, Max Reinhardt, Richard Strauss, and Franz Schalk. These visionaries saw the potential in Salzburg as a prime location for an annual cultural celebration, not only because of its picturesque beauty, but also due to the city's strong historical connection with music, including being the birthplace of the iconic composer, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Since its inception, the Salzburg Festival has grown to become one of the most prominent and prestigious events in the world of classical music. Each year, it attracts thousands of visitors and performers from all corners of the globe. The festival takes place over a span of several weeks in the summer, and it features a diverse program that includes operas, symphonic concerts, chamber music, solo recitals, and theatrical performances. Kollegienkirche, with its magnificent baroque architecture and exceptional acoustics, has been serving as one of the prominent venues of the Salzburg Festival since its founding year in 1920. Over the years, it has hosted numerous concerts featuring both established and emerging musicians, orchestras, and ensembles. The church's elegant and spacious interior is particularly well-suited for the presentation of sacred music, and it provides a fitting backdrop to this evocative genre. In conclusion, the Salzburg Festival, which takes place annually in the heart of Austria's historic city of Salzburg, was first established in 1920. Kollegienkirche, with its beautiful baroque architecture and exceptional acoustics, has been an integral part of the festival since its inception, hosting a variety of musical performances, concerts, and recitals as a prominent venue. As the legacy of the Salzburg Festival endures and continues to evolve, Kollegienkirche remains a symbol of the city's unwavering commitment to the celebration, preservation, and innovation of classical music."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: The ancient Olympic Games were held in a sacred valley at Olympia at western Greece. The earliest records of the Games go back to 776 B.C.. These contests were held every four years. They were important to the Greeks. When they took place, all wars were stopped. No one dared to break the truce of Olympic. Criers announced the names of winning athletes everywhere in the land. Artists made statues of them. Poets wrote about the Olympic heroes. The first Olympians raced the length of the stadium at Olympia--about 200 yards. But later other events were added:longer races, broad jumping, the javelin throw, the marathon race, and the discus throw. Then boxing, wrestling and horseback riding were also added. In the beginning, only Greeks competed in the Games. But in later centuries, athletes from other lands joined. In 146 B.C. the Romans conquered Greece. Soon the Games began to change. Under the Romans, they became rougher, wilder, and bloodier. Many professionals took part, which was against the spirit of the Olympics. Finally, Emperor Theodosius of Rome decided that the Olympics were a public danger. He died away with them after the Games of A.D. 392. They had lasted over 1,000 years. Fifteen hundred years passed. Then, in the 1890's, Baron Pierre de Coubertin of France began to interest nations in bringing the Games back. The first modern Olympic Games were held in Athens, Greece, in 1896. They have been held every four years since then, except during the two world wars. The passage is mainly about _ .

Step 1: Identify the main components of the sentence. The main components of the sentence are: - Friends - Sitting in the rocks - For photo Step 2: Interpret the meaning of the components. - \\"Friends\\" refers to a group of people who share a bond or relationship. - \\"Sitting in the rocks\\" suggests that the group of friends are positioned among rocks. - In the context of photography, \\"sitting\\" is often associated with being seated down or having a lowered posture. - \\"For a photo\\" implies that the friends are posing for a picture. Step 3: Combine the meanings of the components. When we combine the meanings of the components, we get a clearer picture of the scene: a group of friends are positioned among rocks with a lowered posture or seated-down pose for the purpose of taking a photo. Conclusion: Based on the steps and interpretations above, we can conclude that the sentence \\"Friends sitting in the rocks for a photo.\\" does mean that the friends are seated down or at least in a lowered posture for the purpose of taking a photo."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Given the below context: Markham had hoped for a fully-fledged Royal Naval expedition, but was warned by the Admiralty that \\"the present exigencies of the Naval Service [would] prevent them from lending officers...\\" However, the Admiralty agreed to release Scott and Charles Royds, and later allowed Michael Barne and Reginald Skelton to join the expedition. The remaining officers were from the Merchant Marine, including Albert Armitage, the second-in-command, who had experience with the Jackson–Harmsworth Arctic expedition, 1894–97, and Ernest Shackleton, designated Third Officer in charge of holds, stores and provisions, and responsible for arranging the entertainments. The Admiralty also released around twenty petty officers and seamen, the rest of the crew being from the merchant service, or from civilian employment. Among the lower deck complement were some who became Antarctic veterans, including Frank Wild, William Lashly, Thomas Crean (who joined the expedition following the desertion of a seaman in New Zealand), Edgar Evans and Ernest Joyce. Although the expedition was not a formal Navy project, Scott proposed to run the expedition on naval lines, and secured the crew's voluntary agreement to work under the Naval Discipline Act.The scientific team was inexperienced. Dr George Murray, Gregory's successor as chief scientist, was due to travel only as far as Australia (in fact he left the ship at Cape Town), using the voyage to train the scientists, but with no part to play in the detailed work of the expedition.

Context: Many of the migrants from China in the 19th century came to work on the pepper and Uncaria gambir plantations, with 11,000 Chinese immigrants recorded in one year. Singapore became one of the entry and dispersal points for large number of Chinese and Indian migrants who came to work in the plantations and mines of the Straits Settlements, many of whom then settled in Singapore after their contract ended. By 1860, the total population had reached around 90,000, of these 50,000 were Chinese, and 2,445 Europeans and Eurasians. The first thorough census in Singapore was undertaken in 1871, and the people were grouped into 33 racial, ethnic or national categories, with Chinese forming the largest group at 57.6%. Censuses were then conducted at 10 year intervals afterwards. The 1881 census grouped the people into 6 main categories, and further subdivided into 47 sub-categories. The 6 broad groups were given as Europeans, Eurasians, Malays, Chinese, Indians and Others in 1921. The Malays group includes other natives of the Malay archipelago, the Europeans include Americans, the Indians would be people from the Indian subcontinent including what would now be Pakistan and Bangladesh. In 1901, the total population of Singapore was 228,555, with 15.8% Malays, 71.8% Chinese, 7.8% Indians, and 3.5% Europeans and Eurasians. The Chinese population figure of Singapore has stayed at over 70% of the total since, reaching 77.8% in 1947. After dropping from a peak of 60% in the early years of Singapore, the Malay population would range between 11 and 16% in the first half of the 20th century, while Indians hovered between 7 and just over 9% in the same period. Question: How many percent were not Indians in 1901? Answer:","completion":"To find the percentage of the population in 1901 that were not Indians, we can subtract the Indian population percentage from the total population percentage. Total population = 100% Indian population in 1901 = 7.8% Non-Indian population in 1901 = Total population - Indian population Non-Indian population in 1901 = 100% - 7.8% = 92.2% Answer: 92.2% of the population in 1901 were not Indians."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

If you’re going to have a romantic relationship with her, it’s important to have romantic chemistry. Compliment her when she does something different with her appearance. If she gets a new haircut, say, “Your hair looks great!” If she giggles and flirts back or initiates her own flirting, it could be the start of a romantic relationship. If she becomes despondent or upset when you try to flirt with her, it may be a sign that it just isn’t meant to be. But you can only find out if you try! If you’ve gotten closer to her, you can ask her for her phone number so you can communicate with her there. Texting is a great way of talking to her casually. You can ask her about her day, or make plans to meet up without the pressure of an in-person conversation. Text her something like, “Hey, I’m super bored, what are you up to?” She may respond saying that she wants to meet up or she may start a text conversation with you. Don’t blow up her phone with a bunch of texts and don’t get angry if she takes a long time to respond to your texts or doesn’t respond at all.

If she has an Instagram account, go and follow her profile so you can like her posts. Connecting on social media also gives her a chance to learn more about you and your life. Like and comment on her posts, but don’t overdo it. If you go and like every post from the past 6 weeks, it could make you look creepy. Memes are a great way to make her laugh and show her that you understand her sense of humor as well. You can text memes to her or tag or share them via social media so she sees them there. Try making your own memes that include inside jokes between you and her. Whatever you do, don’t be too pushy and constantly laud her with praise and questions. Give her her space and if she likes you back, she will let you know. The last thing you want to do is drive her away by creeping her out or even scaring her by being too clingy. If she tells you that she needs space, say something like, “No problem, I understand. It wasn’t my intention.” Never follow her around or approach her against her will.

Nevsky acts like a body builder and he isn't all that attractive, in fact, IMO, he is UGLY. ( his acting skills lack everything! ) Sascha is played very well by Joanna Pacula, but she needed more lines than she was given, her character needed to be developed. There are way too many men in this story, there is zero romance, too much action, and way too dumb of an ending. It is very violent. I did however love the scenery, this movie takes you all over the world, and that is a bonus. I also liked how it had some stuff about the mafia in it, not too much or too little, but enough that it got my attention. The actors needed to be more handsome...The biggest problem I had was that Nevsky was just too normal, not sexy enough. I think for most guys, Sascha will be hot enough, but for us ladies that are fans of action, Nevsky just doesn't cut it. Overall, this movie was fine, I didn't love it nor did I hate it, just found it to be another normal action flick. Now, what is this review like?

The reviewer acknowledges some good aspects of the movie, such as the interesting plot and action sequences, the acting of Joanna Pacula, and the global scenery. This indicates that the reviewer found some value in the film, which can be interpreted as a positive aspect of the review. The mention of the mafia subplot capturing their attention also contributes to the positive side. On the other hand, there is a significant amount of criticism present in the review. The reviewer expresses dissatisfaction with the lead actor, Nevsky, claiming that he is unattractive and lacks acting skills. They also point out several flaws, such as too many male characters, a lack of romance, excessive action, and a disappointing ending. Moreover, the reviewer wishes that the actors were more attractive, and the movie was more appealing to female action fans. These criticisms contribute to the negative elements found in the review. Overall, the review is a balance between positive and negative aspects, with the conclusion that the movie is just a typical action flick.

In 1993 Dangers relocated from England to San Francisco, resulting in Stephens' departure from the band. At this time, Nothing Records was founded as an imprint of Interscope with the purpose of signing industrial and electronic bands to capitalize on the recent success of Nine Inch Nails. Nothing, helmed by Trent Reznor, signed Meat Beat Manifesto and in 1996 the double album Subliminal Sandwich was released. While this album represented MBM's major-label debut, it failed to achieve the critical and commercial successes of previous releases. The album is notable for the last appearance of Jonny Stephens who contributed guitar on the track Asbestos Lead Asbestos. After Subliminal Sandwich, Dangers put together an album called Original Fire that collected various studio rarities, B-sides, and fan favorites from the early years of MBM, in addition to some new remixes of the material. Also in 1996, the group contributed to the AIDS benefit album Offbeat: A Red Hot Soundtrip produced by the Red Hot Organization. In 1997 Dangers recruited drummer Lynn Farmer and multi-instrumentalist John Wilson (MBM member 1995-1998 former Supreme Love Gods) to record and release Actual Sounds + Voices in 1998, which found the group's earlier flirtations with jazz fusion featured more prominently; the record included appearances by saxophonist Bennie Maupin. The album yielded the single \\"Prime Audio Soup\\" which was featured in the film The Matrix. While Jon Wilson left the band prior to the 1998-1999 tour, Farmer remains with the band as of Spring 2007. Wilson was replaced by former Consolidated programmer Mark Pistel, who also remains a contributing member. During these years, Dangers contributed a pair of remixes to high-profile Nine Inch Nails releases Closer to God and The Perfect Drug.

Hatfield, a radiologist, and Julie Hatfield, a former Boston Globe features, society, travel writer, and fashion critic who currently works as a freelance travel writer. Hatfield grew up in the Boston suburb of Duxbury. Although well known for the early 1990s hit, \\"My Sister\\", Hatfield has two brothers, but no sisters. Hatfield's father claimed his family were descendants of the West Virginia Hatfields of the Hatfield-McCoy feud following the Civil War. In 1995, following the success of Become What You Are she released her follow-up album, Only Everything, in which she \\"turned up the volume and the distortion and had a lot of fun\\". One reviewer describes it as \\"a fun, engaging pop album\\". The album spawned another alternative radio hit for Hatfield in \\"Universal Heartbeat\\". The video featured Hatfield as an overly demanding aerobics instructor. Prior to the tour for Only Everything, Hatfield released Phillips and brought on Jason Sutter (American Hi-Fi, Chris Cornell, Jack Drag), as well as Ed Slanker (Thudpucker, Tinsel) on 2nd guitar, and Lisa Mednick on keyboards. Two weeks into the tour, Hatfield canceled the tour, which her publicist explained as due to \\"nervous exhaustion,\\" and took a month-long break. In her memoir, Hatfield writes that in truth she was suffering from depression severe enough to the point of being suicidal. Hatfield disagreed with the decision not to be upfront about her depression. The drummer was, once again, replaced, this time by Phillips, and touring resumed with Jeff Buckley as the opening act. In 1996, she traveled to Woodstock, New York where she recorded tracks for God's Foot, which was to be her fourth solo album (third if not counting Become What You Are, which was recorded with the Juliana Hatfield Three), intended for 1997 release. After three failed attempts to satisfy requests from Atlantic Records to come up with a \\"single\\" that the label could release, Juliana requested she be released from her contract. The label obliged, but kept the rights to the songs produced during these sessions (Atlantic had reportedly paid 180,000 to that point on the recordings). Two tracks - \\"Mountains of Love\\" and \\"Fade Away\\" - were eventually released on a greatest hits collection entitled Gold Stars, while still another, \\"Can't Kill Myself,\\" was available for download from Hatfield's official website. The remaining tracks have surfaced only as substandard bootleg versions (which do not meet Hatfield's approval) and she has rarely featured them in her subsequent live performances. In 1997 Hatfield toured with the first Lilith Fair, a prominent all-female rock festival founded by singer Sarah McLachlan. Entity:","completion":"The text is about Juliana Hatfield, an American musician and singer-songwriter from the Boston area. She is best known for her 1990s hits, particularly \\"My Sister\\".

For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. opposite turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command.

Având în vedere afluxul de refugiați din Africa de Nord și incertitudinea din regiune, apelăm la politici comunitare suplimentare și nu dorim re-naționalizarea. Translate to English","completion":"Taking into account the influx of refugees from North Africa and the uncertainty in the region, we call for additional community policies and do not wish for re-nationalization. Given the rising number of refugees arriving from North Africa, coupled with the prevailing uncertainty in the region, it is imperative to address this humanitarian crisis through a collaborative approach. Additional community policies can be implemented to alleviate the challenges faced by both the refugees and the countries they seek asylum in. Re-nationalization, on the other hand, refers to the process of returning assets or resources, such as industries and services, to national ownership after being privatized or operated under a foreign government. In this context, the re-nationalization of policies may imply the abandonment of a unified response to the refugee crisis in favor of each country implementing its own strategy. However, such a move could risk exacerbating the crisis and hindering the formation of a comprehensive solution. There are several reasons why advocating for additional community policies is the preferred course of action: 1. Resource sharing: Additional community policies can foster the sharing of resources and responsibilities among member countries, reducing the burden on individual nations and ensuring a more equitable distribution of support for the refugees. 2. Coordinated response: A unified approach ensures that countries work together in a coordinated manner, improving the efficiency of the response to the crisis. This includes pooling data, expertise, and capabilities to create effective strategies and execute them in a timely and organized manner. 3. Promoting integration: Implementing community policies can provide a platform for member countries to develop programs that promote the social and economic integration of refugees. 4. Enhancing regional stability: By addressing the reasons behind the influx of refugees, additional community policies can contribute to achieving long-term stability and increased security in the region, mitigating the risk of potential conflicts and tensions. In conclusion, additional community policies are crucial in tackling the refugee crisis arising from the uncertain situation in North Africa. Pursuing a unified and coordinated strategy not only eases the pressure on individual countries but also ensures a more efficient, fair, and humane response to the humanitarian challenges faced by the refugees."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Two notable examples from the Heian period include Taira no Masakado and Fujiwara no Sumitomo. Taira no Masakado was a powerful samurai and regional leader who challenged the central government in 939 A.D. Born into the Taira clan, a prominent family serving the Imperial Court, Masakado's rebellion in the eastern province of Hitachi notably jeopardized Japan's imperial administration. He was able to temporarily establish an autonomous state after claiming the title of \\"New Emperor.\\" However, his reign was short-lived as he was eventually defeated and killed by forces loyal to the central government in 940 A.D. Fujiwara no Sumitomo, on the other hand, was an influential pirate leader who rebelled against the central government almost simultaneously with Taira no Masakado. As a member of the powerful Fujiwara clan, which held significant influence over the Imperial Court, Sumitomo's revolt held considerable weight. He led several uprisings from 939 to 941 A.D., aimed at destabilizing the central authority in western Japan. Despite his best efforts, he was eventually captured and executed in 941 A.D. While these historical figures threatened the authority of Japan's central government in the Heian period, it is important to recognize that tensions between central and regional authorities persisted throughout Japanese history, as different clans and factions jostled for dominance. These power struggles have shaped Japan's political landscape, influencing the emergence of feudalism and the eventual rise of powerful shogunates, such as the Kamakura, Muromachi, and Tokugawa shogunates. Each of these eras was marked by various internal conflicts and rebellions, further illustrating the challenges posed by competing factions and their impact on Japan's central government."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Millions of men and women readied themselves for work. Some made their way to the Twin Towers, the signature structures of the World Trade Center complex in New York City. Others went to Arlington, Virginia, to the Pentagon. Across the Potomac River, the United States Congress was back in session. At the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, people began to line up for a White House tour. In Sarasota, Florida, President George W. Bush went for an early morning run. For those heading to an airport, weather conditions could not have been better for a safe and pleasant journey. Among the travelers were Mohamed Atta and Abdul Aziz al Omari, who arrived at the airport in Portland, Maine. Boston: American 11 and United 175. Atta and Omari boarded a 6:00 A.M. flight from Portland to Boston's Logan International Airport. When he checked in for his flight to Boston, Atta was selected by a computerized prescreening system known as CAPPS (Computer Assisted Passenger Prescreening System), created to identify passengers who should be subject to special security measures. Under security rules in place at the time, the only consequence of Atta's selection by CAPPS was that his checked bags were held off the plane until it was confirmed that he had boarded the aircraft. This did not hinder Atta's plans. Atta and Omari arrived in Boston at 6:45. Seven minutes later, Atta apparently took a call from Marwan al Shehhi, a longtime colleague who was at another terminal at Logan Airport. They spoke for three minutes.

They lay eggs that can be fertilized either inside or outside of the body. In most fish, the eggs develop outside of the mother's body. In the majority of these species, fertilization also takes place outside the mother's body. The male and female fish release their gametes into the surrounding water, where fertilization occurs. Female fish release very high numbers of eggs to increase the chances of fertilization. I am facing a new situation today: Two different rivers were stocked with adult fish. Red river had a lower fish population because the fish had hardly reproduced naturally. Black river had doubled it's fish population in two years because they reproduced naturally. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which of the two rivers had fewer fish lay eggs outside of the body? Answer:","completion":"Based on the background information, fish lay eggs that can be fertilized either inside or outside of the body, with the majority of species having eggs develop outside the mother's body and fertilization taking place outside as well. However, the information provided in the new situation does not specify the exact species of fish in Red and Black rivers, nor does it provide details about their reproductive methods. To answer the question accurately, we would need to determine the reproductive habits of the specific fish species in both rivers. If it is the same species in both rivers, we can infer that their reproductive methods are likely the same, so egg-laying outside of the body might not be the primary reason for the difference in population growth. Other factors, such as environmental conditions or availability of prey, could have contributed to the population increase in Black river. In conclusion, without information about the specific fish species in Red and Black rivers and their reproductive habits, it's not possible to definitively determine which river had fewer fish lay eggs outside of the body."},{"prompt":"Question: Here's a question and a few possible answers: Q: James and Judy are preparing to copulate.

The first thing he notices is that Sampline is further down the periodic table than Mardine. It's not much information to go on, but it's a good starting point for Timmy.

Q: Question: Who won the award that Gesicki was a finalist for? Passage:Following coach James Franklin, Rahne spent the 2014 and 2015 seasons as the Penn State Nittany Lions quarterbacks coach. Working with quarterback Christian Hackenberg, Rahne helped him break all of the Nittany Lions major career passing records. Hackenberg finished his career with 693 completions, 8,457 passing yards, 48 touchdown passes, 9 career 300-yard passing games, and 21 200-yard passing games. After the final game of the 2015 regular season, John Donovan was fired as Penn States offensive coordinator, and replaced by Rahne as the interim to coach the TaxSlayer Bowl. During preparation for the bowl game, it was announced that ex-Fordham Head coach, Joe Moorhead would be taking over as offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach for the 2016 season. Rahne took over as tight ends coach, a position that was previously held by Donovan. In this role Rahne mentored Mackey Award finalist Mike Gesicki as he broke the Penn State career record for receptions (123), receiving yards (1,419) and touchdowns (15) by a tight end. Gesicki was selected first-team All-Big Ten in 2017 and second team in 2016. Gesicki set single-season records at Penn State for receptions (51), receiving yards (679) and touchdown catches (9) by a tight end. On December 1, 2017, Rahne was named Penn States offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach after Joe Moorhead left the Nittany Lions to become the head coach at Mississippi State.

Пилетт, Андре Which language is this?","completion":"The name \\"Пилетт, Андре\\" is written in the Cyrillic script, and it is a transliteration of \\"Pilett, Andre\\" in the Russian language. The Cyrillic script is used in many languages, primarily Slavic, such as Russian, Ukrainian, Belarusian, Bulgarian, Serbian, and Macedonian, as well as many non-Slavic languages like Kazakh, Tajik, and Kyrgyz. To give a bit of context, the Cyrillic script was developed in the 9th century, during the reign of the Bulgarian Tsar Simeon I the Great. It was created by two Byzantine missionaries, brothers Cyril and Methodius, who were born in Thessaloniki, Greece. The script was based on the Greek uncial script, with the addition of new letters for sounds not present in the Greek language. The goal of creating the Cyrillic script was to translate religious texts and spread Christianity among the Slavic peoples. Throughout its history, the Cyrillic script has undergone several modifications, mainly influenced by the evolution of the languages that use it and the historical events in the regions they were spoken. The Russian Revolution in 1917 led to the Bolshevik government reforming the script, simplifying several letters and removing others that were considered redundant or used only in specific dialects. As a result, the modern Russian alphabet has 33 letters. In the case of \\"Пилетт, Андре,\\" it is a name written in Russian Cyrillic. If we transcribe it back to the Latin alphabet, it becomes \\"Pilett, Andre.\\" It's most likely a name of a person, with \\"Pilett\\" being the last name, and \\"Andre\\" being the first name, similar to the English equivalent \\"Andre Pilett.\\" \\"Andre\\" is a given name, commonly used in French-speaking countries. It is derived from the Greek name Andreas, which means \\"manly\\" or \\"brave.\\" The last name \\"Pilett\\" could be of French origin as well. While I identified this as Russian, it's essential to mention that since the name appears to be non-Slavic by origin, it could be written similarly in other languages that use the Cyrillic script.

Q:The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the precise geographic name of the pole Nansen and Johansen left the ship with a team of dogs and sledges to make for? , can you please find it? Nansen's Fram expedition of 1893–96 was an attempt by the Norwegian explorer Fridtjof Nansen to reach the geographical North Pole by harnessing the natural east–west current of the Arctic Ocean. In the face of much discouragement from other polar explorers, Nansen took his ship Fram to the New Siberian Islands in the eastern Arctic Ocean, froze her into the pack ice, and waited for the drift to carry her towards the pole. Impatient with the slow speed and erratic character of the drift, after 18 months Nansen and a chosen companion, Hjalmar Johansen, left the ship with a team of dogs and sledges and made for the pole. They did not reach it, but they achieved a record Farthest North latitude of 86°13.6′N before a long retreat over ice and water to reach safety in Franz Josef Land. Meanwhile, Fram continued to drift westward, finally emerging in the North Atlantic Ocean. The idea for the expedition had arisen after items from the American vessel Jeannette, which had sunk off the north coast of Siberia in 1881, were discovered three years later off the south-west coast of Greenland. The wreckage had obviously been carried across the polar ocean, perhaps across the pole itself. Based on this and other debris recovered from the Greenland coast, the meteorologist Henrik Mohn developed a theory of transpolar drift, which led Nansen to believe that a specially designed ship could be frozen in the pack ice and follow the same track as Jeannette wreckage, thus reaching the vicinity of the pole. Nansen supervised the construction of a vessel with a rounded hull and other features designed to withstand prolonged pressure from ice. The ship was rarely threatened during her long imprisonment, and emerged unscathed after three years. The scientific observations carried out during this period contributed significantly to the new discipline of oceanography, which subsequently became the main focus of Nansen's scientific work.

Refried beans are also popular in many other Latin American countries. Hypothesis: Refried beans are made with black beans.","completion":"Upon analyzing the given paragraph, we cannot definitively conclude that the hypothesis, \\"Refried beans are made with black beans,\\" is true. The paragraph only provides information about refried beans being a traditional staple of Mexican and Tex-Mex cuisine, as well as popular in many other Latin American countries. However, it does not specify the type or varieties of beans used in making refried beans.

Trivia question: Hors D'Oeuvres, usually consisting of marinated vegetables, or cured meats, are known by what name in Italy? And the answer is?","completion":"In Italy, hors d'oeuvres, which typically consist of marinated vegetables or cured meats, are known as \\"antipasti\\" (singular: antipasto). The term \\"antipasti\\" derives from the Latin words \\"anti\\" meaning \\"before\\" and \\"pastus\\" meaning \\"meal,\\" which combined translates to \\"before the meal.\\" As the name suggests, antipasti are appetizers served prior to the main course to stimulate the appetite and set the mood of a meal. Italian antipasti are known for their variety, richness, and flavors. These appetizers can be a simple combination of various items or a more elaborate assortment, depending on the occasion and the region of Italy. Common ingredients used in antipasti include olives, cured meats like prosciutto and salami, various types of cheeses, marinated vegetables such as artichokes and peppers, seafood like anchovies and shrimp, and bruschetta topped with garlic, tomatoes, or other local ingredients. Different regions of Italy have their unique versions of antipasti, reflecting the diverse culinary traditions of the country. For example, in the northern region of Lombardy, one may find bresaola (air-dried, salted beef) on a platter of antipasti; while in the southern region of Campania, the platter might feature seafood like marinated anchovies. Antipasti can be served on individual plates, but they are often presented on large, shared platters or trays that encourage communal dining and conversation. Transporting diners to a lively Italian setting, the experience of sharing and relishing a delicious assortment of antipasti ignites a unique joy and sets the stage for a memorable Italian meal."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the above question based on the context below: The East India Company drove the expansion of the British Empire in Asia. The Company's army had first joined forces with the Royal Navy during the Seven Years' War, and the two continued to co-operate in arenas outside India: the eviction of the French from Egypt (1799), the capture of Java from the Netherlands (1811), the acquisition of Penang Island (1786), Singapore (1819) and Malacca (1824), and the defeat of Burma (1826).From its base in India, the Company had also been engaged in an increasingly profitable opium export trade to China since the 1730s. This trade, illegal since it was outlawed by the Qing dynasty in 1729, helped reverse the trade imbalances resulting from the British imports of tea, which saw large outflows of silver from Britain to China. In 1839, the confiscation by the Chinese authorities at Canton of 20,000 chests of opium led Britain to attack China in the First Opium War, and resulted in the seizure by Britain of Hong Kong Island, at that time a minor settlement.During the late 18th and early 19th centuries the British Crown began to assume an increasingly large role in the affairs of the Company. A series of Acts of Parliament were passed, including the Regulating Act of 1773, Pitt's India Act of 1784 and the Charter Act of 1813 which regulated the Company's affairs and established the sovereignty of the Crown over the territories that it had acquired. The Company's eventual end was precipitated by the Indian Rebellion in 1857, a conflict that had begun with the mutiny of sepoys, Indian troops under British officers and discipline. The rebellion took six months to suppress, with heavy loss of life on both sides. The following year the British government dissolved the Company and assumed direct control over India through the Government of India Act 1858, establishing the British Raj, where an appointed governor-general administered India and Queen Victoria was crowned the Empress of India. India became the empire's most valuable possession, \\"the Jewel in the Crown\\", and was the... Answer:","completion":"The East India Company was dissolved by the British government following the Indian Rebellion in 1857. The conflict and the subsequent suppression prompted the British government to assume direct control over India, leading to the dissolution of the Company in 1858.

Article: When you're first learning how to latch hook, it's best to keep things simple. Try following a template for your first few project to get an idea of how the yarn looks on the canvas. From there, you can move on to freehand shapes like lines and circles a shot. As you improve, you'll learn to produce more complex patterns and contours and begin producing your own unique designs. These could be anything from formless swaths of color to distinct patterns like stripes, spirals, waves, and rainbows. Advanced latch hookers have even been known to weave detailed portraits and scenes. Don't be afraid to be abstract—experiment with yarn placement and weave whatever patterns your eye suggests. It can be helpful to think of the canvas squares as a guide for forming precise edges and curves, similar to drafting paper. Rather than spending hours cutting the yarn to size before you make a single knot, wait until your design comes together, then snip the strands wherever you want them to be shorter. Touching up your work after the fact will offer you more control, as it allows you to make just as much of an adjustment as you need instead of being forced to guess at the right length. Trimming the strands to different lengths can lend added texture and dimension to your finished project. Wrapping, threading, and knotting one strand after another can take all day. By doubling up your yarn, you also stand to double your speed. Line up two separate pieces of the same length, then knot them as you ordinarily would, being careful not to let the two strands overlap in the process. Since you'll have an extra strand to deal with, you'll need to work carefully to avoid mistakes. This method can be especially useful when you're covering a large area with a single color. What is a summary of what this article is about?","completion":"The article provides tips and guidance for beginners learning how to latch hook.

Choices: - laziness - feel better - laying down - relaxation - falling asleep The rationale to choose \\"falling asleep\\" as the answer is that: A:","completion":"Falling asleep is likely the most appropriate answer among the given choices, as it highlights a natural process that occurs when our body is at rest and our eyes are closed. The process of falling asleep involves a combination of several factors, including the physiology of the human body, the need for restorative rest, and the external environment. Here is a detailed rationale for choosing falling asleep over the other options: 1. Laziness: Although laziness may cause some people to rest with their eyes closed, it does not encompass the entire population and fails to consider the biological need for sleep. Laziness is typically associated with a lack of motivation, energy, or interest. This state may lead individuals to opt for a horizontal position, but it does not explain the natural functions involved in sleep, such as the release of certain hormones, slowing down of brain activity, and other physiological changes. 2. Feel better: While it is true that individuals might close their eyes to feel better or to relieve themselves from stress, the choice does not explicitly delve into the actual process of sleep and the role it plays in how we function daily. Closing one's eyes or lying down may promote a sense of calmness and relaxation, but it might not always result in falling asleep. 3. Laying down: Laying down is merely a position that people often assume while resting, and does not necessarily indicate that they are falling asleep. People lay down for various reasons, ranging from relaxation during leisure hours to recovering from an injury. It is a comfortable position that allows for a more even distribution of body weight, but it does not fully explain the complex processes involved when one's eyes are closed and they drift off to sleep. 4. Relaxation: Relaxation is a state where the body and mind are at ease, and stress is reduced, but this does not necessarily imply that the person is falling asleep. While closing one's eyes and laying down may induce relaxation and promote feelings of comfort, the transition to actual sleep involves a series of physiological changes that go beyond mere relaxation. Overall, falling asleep best encapsulates the various stages, physiological changes, and functions of sleep that are not captured by the other choices. Assuming a relaxed position with closed eyes might be comforting for some individuals and may even alleviate stress temporarily, but the complex process of falling asleep is more than just a response to laziness, seeking comfort, laying down, or finding relaxation. As a natural biological function, sleep is essential for the maintenance of physical and mental health, enabling the body to repair and regenerate itself and allowing the mind to process experiences and information in a more efficient manner."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: Secret filming by the BBC's Panorama programme this month showed vulnerable residents being pinned down, slapped, doused in water and taunted. An e-mail from the hospital manager last November said \\"five Safeguarding concerns\\" appeared to have arisen. It is thought this may refer to concerns raised with the council's Safeguarding Vulnerable Adults panel. The e-mail, sent by the manager to support workers and nurses and seen by the BBC, said patients had complained of ill treatment. It said they had allegedly been teased, forced to swallow medication, threatened, restrained when it was not warranted, and called nicknames which other patients then used. The e-mail read: \\"My worry is that these may be happening and some of you do not feel comfortable to challenge what you see. \\"I have always said (you have it now again in black and white) I do not condone ANY practice that is less than bespoke for this type of service.\\" \\"Safeguarding concerns\\" would normally refer to matters referred to the Safeguarding Vulnerable Adults panel at the local authority - South Gloucestershire Council. The leader of the council's Labour group, Councillor Andy Perkins, told the BBC he was really surprised he had not been told about any concerns when he presided over the social services committee last November. The private home, which is taxpayer-funded, is to be investigated by the Care Quality Commission. On Wednesday, Labour health spokeswoman Baroness Thornton added her voice to calls for a public inquiry into the alleged abuse. Speaking in the House of Lords during an urgent question on the subject, she told peers she wanted a wide-ranging, independent review to \\"shine a light\\" on events and allow lessons to be learned. Police this week arrested two women, aged 22 and 21, and three men, aged 58, 40 and 28. Last week, a woman and three men were arrested and all nine have been released on police bail.

Premise: \\"If grade budgets are such a good idea, why don't we have them?\\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"Grade budgets are not offered in our area.\\"?","completion":"If the premise \\"If grade budgets are such a good idea, why don't we have them?\\" is true, it implies that there is a general belief that grade budgets are beneficial. However, the mere fact that they are not implemented in a particular area does not directly entail the hypothesis \\"Grade budgets are not offered in our area.\\" The relationship between the premise's validity and the conclusion that grade budgets are not offered in our area can be examined through various factors. First, it is essential to understand the concept of grade budgets. Grade budgets refer to a system in which students are given a specific amount of points or grade currency to allocate across their assignments and exams during a course. The idea behind grade budgets is to provide students with more control over their learning and assessment, allowing them to focus on their strengths and individual learning styles. Advocates of grade budgets argue that they promote personal responsibility, reduce the pressure associated with high-stakes exams, and foster autonomy. Now, if the premise is true and grade budgets are indeed effective educational tools, their absence in a particular region could be a result of several reasons: 1. Lack of awareness: It is possible that the education policymakers and administrators are not aware of the potential benefits of grade budgets. As a result, they would not have considered implementing the system in the first place. This could be because grade budgets are a relatively new concept, or the idea has not reached that geographical area yet. 2. Resistance to change: In some cases, even when the education authorities are aware of grade budgets, they may be hesitant to implement them due to resistance to change. Transitioning to a new grading system necessarily requires adjustments, both for educators and students. There could be concerns about the need for re-training of teachers, potential initial confusion for students, or the fear of unintended consequences. 3. Financial constraints: Implementing a new grading system like grade budgets might involve additional expenses, such as developing new software or training staff. Education budgets are often strained, and authorities might not be willing or able to allocate resources to such an endeavor, especially if the benefits are not yet proven on a larger scale. 4. Philosophical or ideological differences: The education system in different regions is frequently shaped by historical, cultural, and philosophical influences. It is possible that the concept of grade budgets conflicts with the dominant educational ideology in that area. For example, some traditionalists might view grade budgets as fostering an unhealthy focus on grades rather than learning or perceive the system as undermining a teacher's authority. In conclusion, the absence of grade budgets in a particular area does not solely depend on their effectiveness as an educational tool. Various factors, such as lack of awareness, resistance to change, financial constraints, and philosophical differences, can influence whether or not grade budgets are implemented. Thus, the premise that grade budgets are a good idea does not directly entail that they are not offered in a certain area. The absence of grade budgets could be due to any of the aforementioned factors or a combination of them."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

I was familiar with Lisa from her show on Lifetime, and since I was eager to get a sign from my father, I agreed to go. I took my father's gold watch and listened as Lisa helped audience members communicate with their loved ones. \\"I have a grandfather-like figure with me and he is speaking about his granddaughter Jilly,\\" she announced. The audience was quiet; no one raised a hand. I nudged my sister and whispered to her that this was Dad ,for my third child and my father had a deep bond(,) and he called her Jilly. Although I sensed his presence, I wasn't confident enough to raise my hand. I needed something a bit more concrete, something undoubted. \\"This man is letting me know he had cancer,\\" she continued. I nudged my sister harder and assured her this was our father.

I jumped up when she asked, \\"Who is holding his watch?\\" I waved the watch in the air. \\"He wishes you congratulations.\\" My fourth child was born three weeks after my father died. I was in shock and could not believe I was getting a chance to hear from him, yet I knew our bond was strong enough that he could come to the world. She banged on her chest like an ape and apologized, saying, \\"I don't know why but he wants me to do this like Tarzan.\\" It didn't resonate with me until my sister called out \\"King Kong!\\" I was convinced.

On the day before the bass season opened, he and his father were fishing early in the evening, catching sunfish and perch with worms. Then he tied on a small silver lure and practiced casting. The lure struck the water and caused colored ripples in the sunset, then silver ripples as the moon rose over the lake. When his pole doubled over, he knew something huge was on the other end. Finally, he very gingerly lifted the exhausted fish from the water. It was the largest one he had ever seen, but it was a perch . The boy and his father looked at the handsome fish. Then the father lit a match and looked at his watch. It was 10 P.M.--- two hours before the season opened. He looked at the fish, then at the boy. \\"You'll have to put it back, son,\\" he said. \\"Dad!\\" cried the boy. \\"There will be other fish,\\" said his father. \\"Not as big as this one,\\" cried the boy. He looked around the lake. No other fishermen or boats were anywhere around in the moonlight. He looked again at his father. Even though no one had seen them, nor could anyone ever know what time he caught the fish, the boy could know everything by his father's clear voice that the decision could not be changed.

A fake paramedic jailed for tricking a terminally ill pensioner into thinking he was a real medical worker and even drove his own ambulance has been sent back to prison for 'befriending vulnerable people'. Joshua Martyn had bought a fully marked paramedic first response vehicle and medical equipment online, despite having never completed anything more than a basic first aid course. The 21-year-old from Hove, East Sussex, was jailed for 18 months in August after he admitted fraud and theft charges, but was released in September as he had served most of his sentence while on remand. Fake: Joshua Martyn (left), who bought a first response vehicle (right) and tricked pensioners into thinking he was a real paramedic, has been sent back to prison for 'befriending vulnerable people' However, he was returned to prison earlier this month after breaching his licence by 'befriending vulnerable people', Sussex Police said. Martyn first came to police attention in 2010 while pretending to be a paramedic. However, because it is not currently an offence to impersonate a health professional, police found there was little they could do to stop him. He was eventually arrested in September 2011 for fraud and assault on a 71-year-old woman he was living with in Crawley, according to police. Difficulties: Police said that because it is not currently an offence to impersonate a regulated health or care professional, they found it difficult to know how to deal with Martyn. He had moved in with the woman, convincing her that he was medically trained, but in reality had no such qualifications. In March 2012, he was convicted at Lewes Crown Court of using an uninsured and untaxed vehicle, three counts of battery in relation to the 71-year-old woman, and two counts of driving without a licence. He was sentenced to a six-month hospital order and banned from driving for six months. Kit: A stash of medical equipment used by the 21-year-old, who managed convince pensioners that he was a real paramedic. However, just two months later, police were told that he was staying with a couple in their 80s in West Hoathly, near East Grinstead, West Sussex, whose concerned family were not convinced he was a registered paramedic. Last March, Martyn was convicted of fraud and assault against a terminally ill 80-year-old man from West Hoathly but cleared of one charge of witness intimidation. He was sentenced to five months imprisonment at a youth offenders’ institution and given a restraining order banning him from contacting the 71-year-old woman in Crawley. He admitted further charges of fraud and theft when he appeared at Hove Crown Court in August this year, and received the 18 month prison sentence. 'Joshua Martyn adopted personas that put him in contact with vulnerable people and in a position of trust,' said Pc Jacqui Thornton. 'He was well known in the community and fooled people into thinking he was qualified to administer medical care. 'He dressed as a paramedic, drove a marked ambulance response vehicle and carried medical equipment. 'It is not currently an offence to impersonate a regulated health or care professional, therefore it was difficult to deal with Martyn’s activities and behaviour. 'It took me three years of investigation to obtain the evidence required to put Martyn before the court for various offences linked to his activities.' Pc Thornton said Martyn’s case was not the first of its kind and that she was working with the South East Coast Ambulance Service (Secamb) to raise awareness and to amend legislation which protects those who are vulnerable and those who need medical care. Paramedic David Davis said: 'This case specifically highlights a current inadequacy in the law in that it is not currently an offence to impersonate a paramedic, or for that matter a nurse, doctor, physiotherapist or a social worker. 'Members of the public can always check to see if their paramedic or other allied health professional or social worker is registered, by visiting the www.hcpc-uk.org or doctor www.gmc-uk.org or nurses/midwives www.nmc-uk.org.'

Burns mistakenly compels the police to interrogate a waiter, Skip Lee (Jay Acovone), who is intimidated and beaten to coerce a confession before police discover Skip's fingerprints don't match the killer's. Burns is disturbed by this police brutality, and tells Captain Edelson he didn't sign on for this so that they can arrest anyone just because he's gay. Exhausted by his undercover assignment, Burns is close to quitting, but is convinced by Edelson to continue with the investigation. Following a new lead, Burns investigates Columbia University students who studied with one of the previous victims, a college professor. At the film's conclusion, Burns thinks that he has found the serial killer, Stuart Richards (Richard Cox), a gay music graduate student with schizophrenic disorder who attacks him with a knife in Morningside Park. Burns brings the man into custody, but shortly afterward Ted's mutilated body is found. The police dismiss the murder as a lover's quarrel turned...

Q:- Sediment builds up over the remains - The remains decompose, leaving only trace amounts - The remaining parts over the years are replaced with mineral - A fossil is formed - What might be the first step of the process? A:","completion":"The first step in the process of fossil formation, also known as fossilization, begins when an organism or parts of an organism, such as bones, shells, or plant materials, die and become buried under layers of sediment. Here is a detailed explanation of this initial stage and the subsequent series of events that ultimately transform biological remains into fossils. 1. Death and initial burial: For fossilization to occur, the remains of an organism must be protected from scavengers and rapid decomposition. When an organism dies, it falls to the ground or settles to the bottom of a body of water (ocean, lake, or river). There, it becomes quickly covered with a layer of sediment, which could be mud, silt, sand, or other fine particles. This initial coverage helps protect the remains from damage due to exposure, scavenging, and decay. 2. Accumulation of sediments: Over time, more layers of sediment continue to accumulate on top of the remains, compressing them under the increasing weight and pressure. These additional layers also contribute to the further exclusion of oxygen, which slows down microbial decomposition and ultimately preserves the remains. 3. Sediment solidification: As the sediment layers continue to build up and the pressure increases, the lower sediment layers begin to compact and undergo a process called lithification. This process turns the deposited sediment into sedimentary rock, such as shale, sandstone, or limestone. Once lithification is complete, the rock layer containing the organism's remains becomes part of the Earth's crust. 4. Decomposition of organic material: With time, the remaining organic material in the remains, such as muscle tissue and skin, decompose, leaving behind only trace amounts of carbon and other elements. These elements are eventually replaced by minerals from the surrounding environment through a process called mineralization or permineralization. This replacement can occur at an atomic level, preserving even the most intricate structural details of the organism. 5. Formation of a fossil: As the process continues, the remains become mineralized, and all the original organic material is replaced by minerals, forming a three-dimensional replica of the organism's structure preserved in rock. The fossil may appear as an exact mold or cast of the original organism, or it may even retain some of its original coloring or other physical properties. Thus, the first step in the process of fossil formation is the death of the organism and its subsequent burial under layers of sediment. This crucial stage sets the stage for the subsequent processes of sediment accumulation, lithification, decomposition, and mineralization, which ultimately transform the organism's remains into fossils that provide valuable insights into the history of life on Earth."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

[-] it is not possible to tell. [-] no.","completion":"Based on the premise, \\"Tell us at once,\\" the hypothesis \\"It does not matter if we are told right away or after a while\\" seems to be false. The premise suggests that the speaker is requesting immediate information or response, showing emphasis on the urgency or importance of the information being sought. In this specific context, we can analyze why the hypothesis might not hold true: 1. Urgency: The request to \\"Tell us at once\\" reflects a sense of urgency on the part of the speaker, possibly because the information sought is time-sensitive. Therefore, being informed immediately is essential, and waiting for a while could potentially cause complications or negative consequences. 2. Importance: The premise could also suggest that the information being sought is of high importance, and the speaker believes that prompt communication of such information is crucial for making well-informed decisions. 3. Anticipation: The statement may also convey eagerness or anticipation for the information being requested. In such a situation, the individual asking the question may be emotionally invested in the details and require them as soon as possible to alleviate their curiosity or anxiety, making a delay in the response less than desirable. Taking all these aspects into account, the hypothesis \\"It does not matter if we are told right away or after a while\\" is likely false, as the premise \\"Tell us at once\\" emphasizes a sense of urgency, importance, and anticipation, which contradicts the idea that the information's timing doesn't matter."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Title: Over 21 Movie plot: At the New York Bulletin newspaper, its owner, Robert Drexel Gow (Charles Coburn), receives a teletype story that the newspaperâs thirty-nine-year-old editor, Max Wharton (Alexander Knox), is resigning to enlist in the army. Robert is livid, both at the news and the method that he found out about the news. There is a second story on the teletype: Maxâs wife, the famous novelist Paula Wharton (Irene Dunne) (whom Max calls Paulie), is in Hollywood adapting her latest book into a movie screenplay. Max wants to do his duty as a citizen and responsible journalist to be close to the war (World War II). Robertâs view is that without Max, the newspaper will fold because Max *is* the newspaper. From Hollywood, Paulie telephones Max and congratulates him on his decision. After Max informs her of the plan of basic training then possibly officerâs candidate school, Paulie decides that she will move to where ever that school is to be close to him. After completion of basic training, Max sends Paulie a telegram that officerâs candidate school is in Tetley Field, Florida. She doesnât quite understand Maxâs motivations, but she wants to see her husband succeed in this passion. Paulie arrives at Palmetto Court looking for bungalow 26D and meets the last tenant, Jan Lupton (Jeff Donnell), whose husband Roy has just graduated to second lieutenant.

Premise: \\"What is the impact of home computing technology on postal demand?\\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"What is the impact on postal demand caused by home computing technology?\\"?","completion":"The premise \\"What is the impact of home computing technology on postal demand?\\" and the hypothesis \\"What is the impact on postal demand caused by home computing technology?\\" basically entail the same inquiry. The wording is slightly different, but they both seek to explore how home computing technology has affected postal demand. When we talk about the impact of home computing technology on postal demand, there are several aspects that we have to consider. Firstly, home computing technology has significantly reduced the high dependence on traditional postal services. This is mainly due to the ability of computers, and especially the internet, to facilitate instant and efficient communication. The prevalence of email as a medium of formal and informal communication has drastically reduced the need for individuals to send letters or documents via traditional mail. Secondly, online platforms facilitated by home computing technology have given rise to virtual marketplaces and e-commerce platforms. These platforms encourage online shopping and deliveries which leverage courier services more than traditional postal services. However, it's essential to admit that while email has displaced snail mail for quick exchanges, package delivery is thriving thanks to e-commerce. The reduction in demand for the postal service to deliver personal and business letters and documents is substantial, but the explosion in package delivery, particularly due to online shopping, has substantially increased the demand for parcel delivery services. Moreover, home computing technology helped citizens and businesses to pay their bills, invoices, and taxes online, reducing the need to send or receive these types of documents by post. Also, online advertising has reduced the need for physical promotional mail. Lastly, home computing technology has also facilitated the development and adoption of electronic banking services such as online money transfers, which have reduced the need for sending things like checks through the post. Electronic files can also be shared through computing technology, reducing the need for sending physical media (like CDs, DVDs, etc.) through the mail. Nonetheless, it's essential to mention that while home computing technology has generally had a negative impact on traditional postal services, it has also presented opportunities for evolution. Postal services worldwide are adapting to these changes, offering new services (like parcel delivery for online shopping), and integrating modern technology into their operations. So, back to the question regarding whether the premise entails the hypothesis. As mentioned before, the premise and the hypothesis imply the same question. They both examine how the advancement and adoption of home computing technology have affected the demand for postal services. Thus, answering the premise effectively answers the hypothesis. The distinction between them lies more in their phrasing than in the content or nature of the inquiry they represent."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Robert Owen (; 14 May 1771 - 17 November 1858) was a Welsh textile manufacturer, philanthropic social reformer, and one of the founders of utopian socialism and the cooperative movement. Owen is best known for his efforts to improve the working conditions of his factory workers and his promotion of experimental socialistic communities. In July 1799 Owen and his partners bought the New Lanark mill from David Dale, and Owen became the New Lanark mill's manager in January 1800. Encouraged by his success in the management of cotton mills in Manchester, Owen hoped to conduct the New Lanark mill on higher principles than purely commercial ones. David Dale and Richard Arkwright had established the substantial mill at New Lanark in 1785. With its water power provided by the falls of the River Clyde, the cotton-spinning operation became one of Britain's largest. About 2,000 individuals were associations with the mill; 500 of them were children who were brought to the mill at the age of five or six from the poorhouses and charities of Edinburgh and Glasgow. Dale, who was known for his benevolence, treated the children well, but the general condition of New Lanark's residents was unsatisfactory. Over the years, Dale and his son-in-law, Owen, worked to improve the factory workers' lives. Many of the workers were in the lowest levels of the population; theft, drunkenness, and other vices were common; education and sanitation were neglected; and most families lived in one room. The respectable country people refused to submit to the long hours and demoralising drudgery of the mills. Until a series of Truck Acts (1831-1887) required employees to be paid in common currency, many employers operated the truck system that paid workers in total or in part with tokens. The tokens had no monetary value outside the mill owner's \\"truck shop,\\" where the owners could supply shoddy goods and charge top prices. In contrast to other employers, Owen's store offered goods at prices slightly above their wholesale cost. He also passed on the savings from the bulk purchase of goods to his workers, and placed the sale of alcohol under strict supervision. These principles became the basis for the cooperative shops in Britain, which continue in an altered form to trade today.

When someone is happy,can you smell it? You can usually tell when someone is happy based on seeing them smile,hearing them laugh or perhaps from receiving a big hug.But can you also smell their happiness? Surprising new research suggests that happiness does indeed have a scent,and that the experience of happiness can be transmitted through smell,reports Phys.org. For the study,12 young men were shown videos meant to bring about a variety of emotions while researchers gathered sweat samples from them.All of the men were healthy and none of them were drug users or smokers,and all were asked to abstain from drinking or eating smelly foods during the study period. Those sweat samples were then given to 36 equally healthy young women to smell,while researchers monitored their reactions.Only women were selected to smell the samples,apparently because previous research has shown that women have a better sense of smell than men and are also more sensitive to emotional signaling--though it's unclear why only men were chosen to produce the scents. Researchers found that the behavior of the women after smelling the scents--particularly their facial expressions--indicated a relationship between the emotional states of the men who produced the sweat and the women who sniffed them. \\"Human sweat produced when a person is happy brings about a state similar to happiness in somebody who breathes this smell,\\" said study co-author Gun Semin,a professor at Koc University in Turkey. This is a fascinating finding because it not only means that happiness does have a scent,but that the scent is capable of transmitting the emotion to others.The study also found that other emotions,such as fear,seem to carry a scent too.This ensures previous research suggesting that some negative emotions have a smell,but it is the first time this has proved to be true of positive feelings. Researchers have yet to isolate exactly what the chemical compound for the happiness smell is,but you might imagine what the potential... Question: What is the main finding of the new research?

Nasa has revealed the incredible moments in a specially set up 'war room' inside its HQ as its Curiosity rover landed on the red planet. The unprecedented insight reveals the drama the 34 scientists allowed into the inner sanctum, which was separate from mission control, went through during Curiosity's descent to the surface of the red planet. It even reveals the carefully chosen words that signified a perfect landing - tango delta nominal. Curiosity's Entry, Descent and Landing (EDL) 'war room' and its staff. On the night of Aug. 5, 2012 PDT (early morning Aug. 6 EDT), 34 engineers gathered in this room at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, to support the landing. Twenty-five of Nasa's engineers are pictured above. From the left, back row, they are: Luis Dominguez, Armen Toorian, Allen Kummer, Dan Scharf, Jaime Catchen, Chuck Baker, Nadin Cox, Matt, Lenda, Steve Lee, Genevie Yang and Richard Kornfeld at the end. Starting from the top of the table and moving left are: Paul Brugarolas, Lynn McGrew, Aaron Stehura, Steve Sell, Devin Kipp, Jeremy Shidner, Corey Harmon and David Way. In the closest row, from the left, are: Matt Rozek, Ravi Prakash, Dick Powell, Jody Davis, Gavin Mendeck and Jordi Casoliva. The image above shows the team at work. \\"If we said 'touchdown,' then people not intimately familiar with EDL. might infer that Curiosity was good to go,\\" said Steve Sell, a 42-year-old engineer from Gettysburg, said on Nasa's web site. He admits the touchdown was the first of three key message the team hoped to hear. 'Two more. major calls had to be made before I could begin to breathe again.' The key moment for the team occured at 10:32 p.m local time. Diaries from the crew reveal there had been a debate amongst Curiosity's entry, descent and landing team about what their first words to indicate that the rover had reached the surface should be. The team at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory knew their microphones would be 'hot' and that NASA TV was beaming the landing event out live to anybody with the desire and wherewithal to watch. They also knew that landing safely on Mars meant more than simply landing on Mars - which any one of the 34 engineers present at JPL's Building 264 Room 230, also known as the 'EDL War Room,' will tell you at great length is not simple at all. Their rocket-propelled backpack and rover-lowering Sky Crane system were getting their first test 154 million miles (248 million kilometers) away from home. At 10:31:45 p.m. PDT, Jody Davis saw the event record, or EVR, she was looking for appear on her computer screen in the EDL War Room. She told Nasa's site she knew that the 'Touchdown' message would only be beamed down if the rover's descent stage had throttled down, a result which could only occur if the descent stage had offloaded half its weight. The only way the rover could offload half its weight in an instant is if it were being held up from below. Davis, a member of the EDL team and an engineer from NASA Langley Research Center in Virginia, gave the much reviewed, pre-scripted call - 'Tango Delta nominal.' Tango and Delta are phonetic identifiers for T and D, which the team used to represent touchdown. The next call the EDL team was looking for was 'RIMU Stable.' 'RIMU stands for Rover Inertial Measurement Unit,' said Sell. 'The RIMU gives us the rover's orientation as well as any movement it is making. 'If we landed on a crumbling crater wall or an unstable sand dune, or were being dragged by a still-connected descent stage across the surface, then the RIMU would show that in its data set.' Researchers in Nasa's main mission control celebrating the landing. However, Nasa has now revealed its key researchers were in a special 'war room' for the landing. The War Room's David Way, an engineer from JPL, was monitoring that unit's performance. Eight long seconds after Jody's call, he found the EVR he was looking for. 'RIMU Stable,\\" said Way. The final confirmation actually came from a different building, Nasa said. There, in the Mission Support Area of JPL's Building 230, Adam Steltzner, the mission's EDL phase lead, was staring across the room at Brian Schwartz, who was not making eye contact with anyone. Schwartz, the EDL communications engineer, was staring at his screen. Final destination: Curisity recently sent back this high resolution picture of its landing site and its destination, called Mount Sharp, in the distance. His task was not to check for a good-news EVR from the rover. Instead, he was waiting to see if the UHF signal became intermittent, faded away or just cut out altogether - all potential indications that the rover and descent stage had not gone their separate ways. Eight seconds after the RIMU call - Schwartz looked up. 'UHF strong,' said Schwartz. With that, Steltzner had all the data he needed. Seated directly in front of the pacing EDL Phase Lead, Allen Chen felt a jab in the shoulder. Chen, the mission's (capsule communicator), knew it could only mean one thing. 'Touchdown confirmed,' said Chen. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"1.

A British brand whose aim is to create products ‘which are as close to nature as possible’, their bodycare and skincare is simply second to none and they’re certified by The Soil Association. Over the past couple of years I’ve tried several of their products including my favourite Cleansing Melt and I haven’t found anything that I don’t like yet! This month I’ve been trying their Deep Peace Aromatic Body Oil which arrived with me just at the right time – my husband had man flu, I had a cold and I was looking after our 16 month old toddler alone. Deep Peace was just what my body was craving! I was sent a small glass bottle of the oil to try, but the full size product is a larger 100ml pump bottle (it also comes in 200ml and 1 litre bottles too). The directions say you can use it in two ways, either massage it into shoulders, neck and arms before bed, or apply it all over the body after batheing. After a bath or shower is the best time I feel as the skin is damp and warm and the Deep Peace oil helps lock moisture into the skin and the warmth helps the scent to lift. This Aromatic Massage Oil is 99% organic and the ingredients include Lavender, Rose Geranium and Orange Peel oils. The fragrance is very subtle and perfect if you don’t like products that smell overpowering. It’s a bit ‘planty’, I think it’s the scent of the Rose Geranium that comes through the most, and personally I don’t absolutely love the fragrance, but it’s pleasant enough and it does help the head to feel calmed (even when nursing a husband with man flu!).

Abrasion produces fine sediment, termed glacial flour. The debris transported by the glacier, when the glacier recedes, is termed a moraine. Glacial erosion is responsible for U-shaped valleys, as opposed to the V-shaped valleys of fluvial origin.The way glacial processes interact with other landscape elements, particularly hillslope and fluvial processes, is an important aspect of Plio-Pleistocene landscape evolution and its sedimentary record in many high mountain environments. Environments that have been relatively recently glaciated but are no longer may still show elevated landscape change rates compared to those that have never been glaciated. Nonglacial geomorphic processes which nevertheless have been conditioned by past glaciation are termed paraglacial processes. This concept contrasts with periglacial processes, which are directly driven by formation or melting of ice or frost. The answer to this question is:","completion":"Manny studied less about abrasion."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

However, when the tournament reverted to a knockout formula in 1969, he did not prosper. Ray Reardon became the dominant force in the 1970s, winning six titles, with John Spencer (snooker player) winning three. Steve Davis first world title in 1981 made him only the 11th world champion since 1927, including the winner of the boycotted 1952 title, Horace Lindrum. Stephen Hendry became the 14th in 1990 and dominated through the 1990s. Reardon won six (1970, 1973–1976 and 1978), Davis also six (1981, 1983, 1984 and 1987–1989) and Hendry seven (1990, 1992–1996 and 1999). Ronnie OSullivan is the closest to dominance in the modern era, having won the title on five occasions in the 21st century (2001, 2004, 2008, 2012 and 2013). Mark Williams (snooker player) has won three times (2000, 2003, and 2018) and John Higgins (snooker player) four times (1998, 2007, 2009, 2011) but since the beginning of the century, there has not been a dominant force like in previous decades, and the modern era has seen many players playing to a similar standard, instead of one player raising the bar. Davis, for example, won more ranking tournaments than the rest of the top 64 players put together by 1985. By retaining his title in 2013, OSullivan became the first player to successfully defend the world championship since 1996 when Hendry won the sixth of his seven titles, his fifth in a row, and then later by Mark Selby in 2017. How many more titles were won by Ray Reardon than John Spencer?","completion":"Ray Reardon won six titles while John Spencer won three titles.

Does the sentence \\"It was occupied by piratical kingdoms of the Barbary Coast, de facto independent since the 18th century.\\" answer the question \\"Where were the piratical kingdoms from?\\"","completion":"No, the sentence \\"It was occupied by piratical kingdoms of the Barbary Coast, de facto independent since the 18th century\\" does not directly answer the question \\"Where were the piratical kingdoms from?\\" However, it does provide important information about the location and independence of these piratical kingdoms that can be used to infer their origin. The sentence tells us that these piratical kingdoms were located along the Barbary Coast, which provides some geographical clues about their origins. The Barbary Coast refers to the Mediterranean coastline of North Africa, and includes the modern-day countries of Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, and Libya. Historically, European sailors and explorers named this region after the Berber people who lived there. The piratical kingdoms being mentioned here are often referred to as the Barbary States or Barbary Pirates. These states thrived from the 16th to the early 19th century, engaging in piracy, privateering, and the capturing of European slaves. The main kingdoms included the Sultanate of Morocco, the Regency of Algiers, the Regency of Tunis, and the Eyalet of Tripolitania (later known as the Regency of Tripoli). It is important to note that these states were not a single unified entity, but rather independent territories governed by their own rulers, often with complex political and military alliances amongst themselves and with other European powers. The sentence also suggests that these kingdoms were \\"de facto independent since the 18th century.\\" This means that despite possible formal allegiances to the larger Ottoman Empire or other suzerains, the Barbary States exercised a significant degree of autonomy and self-governance during this period. In conclusion, while the sentence does not directly answer the question, it provides enough information to infer that the piratical kingdoms were likely from the geographic region along the Mediterranean coastline of North Africa that makes up the Barbary Coast, specifically within the territories of present-day Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, and Libya. The mention of de facto independence since the 18th century further suggests that these kingdoms operated with a considerable degree of autonomy during this era of their history."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Sentence 1: The cooperative National Weather Service reports that Occidental has cool, damp winters and warm, dry summers. In this sentence, the report from the cooperative National Weather Service suggests that Occidental experiences cool and damp (meaning wet or moist) weather conditions during the winter season. In contrast, the summers in Occidental are described as being warm and dry, indicating higher temperatures without much precipitation. Sentence 2: The cooperative national weather station reports that Occidental has warm, dry winters and cool, wet summers. In the second sentence, the cooperative national weather station's report contradicts the information provided in Sentence 1. According to Sentence 2, Occidental experiences warm and dry weather during the winter season, while the summers are characterized by cool temperatures and wet (or rainy) conditions. In summary, the two sentences present conflicting information about the weather patterns in Occidental. Sentence 1 describes cool, damp winters and warm, dry summers, while Sentence 2 states that the winters are warm and dry and the summers are cool and wet.

Please answer the following question: Information: - Alcoholism, also known as alcohol use disorder (AUD), is a broad term for any drinking of alcohol that results in problems. It was previously divided into two types: alcohol abuse and alcohol dependence. In a medical context, alcoholism is said to exist when two or more of the following conditions is present: a person drinks large amounts over a long time period, has difficulty cutting down, acquiring and drinking alcohol takes up a great deal of time, alcohol is strongly desired, usage results in not fulfilling responsibilities, usage results in social problems, usage results in health problems, usage results in risky situations, withdrawal occurs when stopping, and alcohol tolerance has occurred with use. Risky situations include drinking and driving or having unsafe sex among others. Alcohol use can affect all parts of the body but particularly affects the brain, heart, liver, pancreas, and immune system. This can result in mental illness, WernickeKorsakoff syndrome, an irregular heart beat, liver failure, and an increase in the risk of cancer, among other diseases. Drinking during pregnancy can cause damage to the baby resulting in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. Generally women are more sensitive to alcohol's harmful physical and mental effects than men. Both environmental factors and genetics are associated with alcoholism with about half the risk attributed to each. A person with a parent or sibling with alcoholism is three to four times more likely to be alcoholic themselves. Environmental factors include social, cultural, and behavioral influences. High stress levels, anxiety, as well as inexpensive easily accessible alcohol increases risk. People may continue to drink partly to prevent or improve symptoms of withdrawal. A low level of withdrawal may last for months following stopping. Medically, alcoholism is considered both a physical and mental illness. Both questionnaires and certain blood tests may detect people with possible alcoholism.

It has been described as \\"Europe's alternative choice in the second half of the '90s\\", and \\"a fusion of hip hop and electronica until neither genre is recognisable\\". Trip hop music fuses several styles and has much in common with other genres; it has several qualities similar to ambient music, and its drum-based breakdowns share characteristics with hip hop.

The parent label handles the production and distribution and funding of the vanity label, but the album is usually released with the vanity label brand name prominent. Usually, the artist/head of the vanity label is signed to the parent label, and this artist's own recordings will be released under the vanity label's brand name. Creating a vanity label can be an attractive idea for the parent label primarily as a \\"perk\\" to keep a successful artist on the label's roster happy and a venue to bring fellow artists to the public's attention. - Run Lola Run (literally \\"Lola runs\\") is a 1998 German thriller film written and directed by Tom Tykwer, and starring Franka Potente as Lola and Moritz Bleibtreu as Manni.

Widely differing definitions of drug abuse are used in public health, medical and criminal justice contexts. In some cases criminal or anti-social behavior occurs when the person is under the influence of a drug, and long term personality changes in individuals may occur as well. In addition to possible physical, social, and psychological harm, use of some drugs may also lead to criminal penalties, although these vary widely depending on the local jurisdiction. Drugs most often associated with this term include: alcohol, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, cannabis, cocaine, methaqualone, opioids and substituted amphetamines. The exact cause of substance abuse is not clear, with theories including one of two: either a genetic disposition which is learned from others, or a habit which if addiction develops, it manifests itself as a chronic debilitating disease. In 2010 about 5% of people (230 million) used an illicit substance. Of these 27 million have high-risk drug use otherwise known as recurrent drug use causing harm to their health, psychological problems, or social problems or puts them at risk of those dangers. In 2013 drug use disorders resulted in 127,000 deaths up from 53,000 in 1990. The highest number of deaths are from opioid use disorders at 51,000. Cocaine use disorder resulted in 4,300 deaths and amphetamine use disorder resulted in 3,800 deaths. Alcohol use disorders resulted in an additional 139,000 deaths. - Industrial rock is a musical genre that fuses industrial music and specific rock subgenres, not to be confused with industrial metal.

His stage name was formed by juxtaposing the names of two opposing American pop cultural icons; actress Marilyn Monroe and cult leader Charles Manson. - Alternative metal (also known as alt-metal) is a rock music genre that infuses heavy metal with influences from alternative rock and other genres not normally associated with metal. Alternative metal bands are often characterized by heavily downtuned, mid-paced guitar riffs, a mixture of accessible melodic vocals and harsh vocals and sometimes unconventional sounds within other heavy metal styles. The term has been in use since the 1980s, although it came into prominence in the 1990s. - Atticus Matthew Cowper Ross (born 16 January 1968) is an English musician, songwriter, record producer, and audio engineer.

Q:I have a new situation: Two neighboring habitable planets from the same solar system, planet U and planet N, had Earth-like atmospheres. The inhabitants of planet U destroyed the ozone layer by their actions, while their neighboring planet N didn't. But I can use this background: Unfortunately, the layer of good ozone is being destroyed by air pollution. The chief culprits are chlorine and bromine gases. They are released in aerosol sprays, coolants, and other products. Loss of ozone has created an ozone hole over Antarctica. Ozone depletion results in higher levels of UV radiation reaching Earth. In humans, this increases skin cancers and eye cataracts. It also disturbs the nitrogen cycle, kills plankton, and disrupts ocean food webs. The total loss of the ozone layer would be devastating to most life. Its rate of loss has slowed with restrictions on pollutants, but it is still at risk. What is an answer for this question: Which planet had inhabitants that used fewer aerosol sprays? A:","completion":"From the given information, it is clear that it was the inhabitants of planet N who used fewer aerosol sprays and other ozone-depleting substances (ODS) than their counterparts on planet U. The key to this conclusion lies in the state of the ozone layer on each of the planets. Planet U experienced the destruction of its ozone layer, which suggests that the inhabitants there extensively used substances known to deplete ozone, like chlorine and bromine gases. These harmful gases are commonly released by products such as aerosol sprays and coolants. As a result, planet U suffered from increased levels of UV radiation, likely leading to severe consequences for the health of its inhabitants and the planet's ecosystems. On the other hand, planet N managed to maintain its Earth-like atmosphere, which implies that the ozone layer there has remained largely intact and functional. This preservation of the ozone layer strongly indicates that the inhabitants of planet N used fewer aerosol sprays and other products that release chlorine and bromine gases. There must have been a more sustainable approach to the use of such substances, which has helped prevent the depletion of their ozone layer. It is worth noting that even though planet N has a healthier ozone layer, all habitable planets need to commit to reducing the use of ozone-depleting substances in order to prevent further damage to these essential protective barriers."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

So far he's had little success. Ashmol, while he loves his sister, is frequently annoyed when she talks to her imaginary friends, and some of the kids at school tease the siblings because of them. Rex and Anne decide it is time to separate Kellyanne from her invisible companions. Annie takes Kellyanne to a Christmas party at Annie's friend's house, Rex telling her that he will let Pobby and Dingan come with him to go opal mining. Upon Rex's return, Kellyanne says she can no longer see them and that they have disappeared. She insists on going to the opal mining area to look for them, accompanied by Rex and Ashmol. The family accidentally strays on to a neighbouring miner's claim. The miner, Sid, pulls a shotgun on Rex and calls the police, thinking that Rex was \\"ratting\\" on his territory - that is, looking for opals on his turf. Kellyanne is grief-stricken at the loss of her imaginary friends and takes ill, although doctors can find nothing physically wrong with her. Rex has to leave his opal claim. Annie loses her job at the local supermarket, thanks to the circulating rumours around Rex's arrest. Convinced that Kellyanne is faking her illness, Ashmol nonetheless goes along with her wish that he try to find Pobby and Dingan. He even comes up with the idea of putting posters around town. Ultimately, returning to his father's mine area, Ashmol finds two lollipop wrappers. Deeper in the tunnel, he finds a large opal which he takes back to Kellyanne. He tells her he has found Pobby and Dingan, and that they are dead. answer the following question: What does Sid's neighboring miner have to give up after being arrested? Answer:","completion":"The text does not mention that Sid, the neighboring miner, has to give up anything after Rex's arrest. It is Rex who has to leave his opal claim, and Annie loses her job at the local supermarket due to the circulating rumors around Rex's arrest."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below. Which farm caused less fertilizer to end up in oceans? Two farms had different plant cultivation methods. Jolly farm adopted the permaculture methods created by Sepp Holzer, while Peach farm continued using fertilizers and pesticides. Hint: Rain dissolves fertilizer in the soil. Runoff carries it away. The fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, from ponds to oceans. Nitrogen is a fertilizer in the water. Since there is a lot of nitrogen, it causes algae to grow out of control. Pictured below is a pond covered with algae ( Figure below ). Algae use up carbon dioxide in the water. After the algae die, decomposers break down the dead tissue. The decomposers use up all the oxygen in the water. This creates a dead zone. A dead zone is an area in a body of water where nothing grows because there is too little oxygen. There is a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico ( Figure below ). The U.S. states outlined on the map have rivers that drain into the Gulf of Mexico. The rivers drain vast agricultural lands. The water carries fertilizer from these areas into the Gulf. Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided, Jolly farm adopted the permaculture methods created by Sepp Holzer and didn't use fertilizers, while Peach farm continued using fertilizers and pesticides. Since fertilizer runoff contributes to the growth of algae in bodies of water and creates dead zones, it can be deduced that Jolly farm, which utilized permaculture methods and didn't use fertilizers, caused less fertilizer to end up in oceans."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Context: The Trump administration's decision to add a question about citizenship to the 2020 census divided Capitol Hill on Tuesday, with Democrats saying the addition could skew the results and alter millions in government funding, while some Republicans praised it as a \\"commonsense\\" move. U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross announced late Monday the next effort to count every resident in the country will include a question about citizenship status. The U.S. Census Bureau conducts the survey every 10 years, with the next set for 2020. The deadline for finalizing the questions is Saturday. In a memo late Monday, Ross said he chose to include the query at the urging of the Department of Justice, which said it needed the citizenship data to better enforce a law protecting minority voting rights. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders defended the addition of the question, rejecting the notion that it might result in less federal aid to immigrant communities in the U.S. if immigrants are undercounted. Republicans on Capitol Hill welcomed the decision, which revives a practice that was abandoned in 1950, after being in place for more than 100 years, according to the Commerce Department. \\"It is imperative that the data gathered in the census is reliable, given the wide-ranging impacts it will have on U.S. policy.

A single-select problem: Is the question answered in a satisfactory fashion? Pick from: (a). yes. (b). no.","completion":"Answer: The flame that Theodosius extinguished to remove the Vestals from power was the Sacred Fire of Vesta. Theodosius I was a Roman Emperor who ruled from 379 to 395 AD. He was a strong advocate for Christianity and aimed to strengthen the influence of the Christian religion across the Roman Empire. This endeavor led him to extinguish the Sacred Fire of the Vestals and vacate their temple, as mentioned by the senator Quintus Aurelius Symmachus in his letter. The role of Vestals in ancient Rome was of significant importance. They were priestesses dedicated to Vesta, the goddess of the hearth, home, and family. They remained celibate for 30 years and had the responsibility to maintain the eternal flame, the Sacred Fire of Vesta, which symbolized the well-being and continuity of Roman society. As long as the flame was burning, Rome was believed to be divinely protected. During Theodosius's reign, a move to eliminate traditional Roman religious practices happened, focusing on converting the empire to Christianity. Theodosius enforced several anti-pagan laws and discontinued state support for the Vestals and other pagan cults. As a clear demonstration of his intentions, Theodosius extinguished the Sacred Fire, which was the primary duty and source of power for the Vestals. By extinguishing the Sacred Fire of Vesta, Theodosius weakened the traditional pagan belief system, effectively removing the Vestals from their positions of power, and made significant progress in establishing Christianity as the dominant religion in the Roman Empire. Eventually, the temple of Vesta was closed, and the Vestal Virgins were disbanded, marking the end of their prominent role in Roman society. In conclusion, the flame that Theodosius extinguished to remove the Vestals from power was the Sacred Fire of Vesta. By extinguishing this flame and vacating the temple, he was able to strengthen the Christian religion and reduce the influence of pagan cults within the Roman Empire."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Information: - Aristotle (\\"Aristotéls\\"; 384322 BC) was a Greek philosopher and scientist born in the city of Stagira, Chalkidice, on the northern periphery of Classical Greece. His father, Nicomachus, died when Aristotle was a child, whereafter Proxenus of Atarneus became his guardian. At seventeen or eighteen years of age, he joined Plato's Academy in Athens and remained there until the age of thirty-seven (c. 347 BC). His writings cover many subjects including physics, biology, zoology, metaphysics, logic, ethics, aesthetics, poetry, theater, music, rhetoric, linguistics, politics and government and constitute the first comprehensive system of Western philosophy. Shortly after Plato died, Aristotle left Athens and, at the request of Philip of Macedon, tutored Alexander the Great beginning in 343 BC. - Zeus (\\"Zeús\\", ; Modern , \\"Días\\" ) was the sky and thunder god in ancient Greek religion, who ruled as king of the gods of Mount Olympus. His name is cognate with the first element of his Roman equivalent Jupiter. His mythologies and powers are similar, though not identical to those of the Indo-European deities such as Indra, Jupiter, Perun, Thor, and Odin. - In Greek mythology, Melete () was one of the three original (Boeotian) muses before the Nine Olympian Muses were founded. Her sisters were Aoide and Mneme. She was the muse of thought and meditation. Melete literally means \\"ponder\\" and \\"contemplation\\" in Greek. - Mnemosyne (or ), source of the word \\"mnemonic\\", was the personification of memory in Greek mythology. A Titanide, or Titaness, she was the daughter of the Titans Uranus and Gaia. Mnemosyne was the mother of the nine Muses, fathered by her nephew, Zeus: - In Greek mythology , Mneme / nimi / ( ) was one of the three original ( Boeotian ) muses , along with her sisters Aoide and Melete before Arche and Thelxinoë were identified , increasing the number to five . Later , the Nine Olympian Muses were named . She was the muse of memory . - Anaximander (\\"Anaximandros\\"; c. 610 c. 546 BC) was a pre-Socratic Greek philosopher who lived in Miletus, a city of Ionia (in modern-day Turkey). He belonged to the Milesian school and learned the teachings of his master Thales. He succeeded Thales and became the second master of that school where he counted Anaximenes and, arguably, Pythagoras amongst his pupils. - In Greek mythology, Aoede (\\"Aoid\\") was one of the three original (Boeotian) muses, which later expanded to five, before the Nine Olympian Muses were named. Her sisters were Melete and Mneme. She was the muse of voice and song. According to Greek mythology, she is the daughter of Zeus, the King of the Gods, and Mnemosyne, the goddess of memory. - Arche is a Greek word with primary senses \\"beginning\\", \\"origin\\" or \\"source of action\\". (: from the beginning, r : the original argument), and later first principle or element, first so used by Anaximander (Simplicius in Ph. 150.23), principles of knowledge (Aristot. Metaph. 995b8). By extension, it may mean \\"first place, power\\", \\"method of government\\", \\"empire, realm\\", \\"authorities\\" (in plural: ), \\"command\\". The first principle or element corresponds to the \\"ultimate underlying substance\\" and \\"ultimate undemonstrable principle\\". In the philosophical language of the archaic period (8th-6th century BC), \\"arche\\" (or \\"archai\\") designates the source, origin or root of things that exist. In ancient Greek philosophy, Aristotle foregrounded the meaning of \\"arche\\" as the element or principle of a thing, which although undemonstrable and intangible in itself, provides the conditions of the possibility of that thing.

In the small town of La Pintada, for instance, 68 of the town's 800 residents are missing after a massive landslide Monday, the AP reports. \\"Half the homes in town were smothered and buried,\\" one woman says. Several entire families were wiped out in the disaster. Tropical Storm Manuel is believed to have caused almost 400 million in damage, Voice of America reports. Thousands of tourists have been evacuated from Acapulco.

With a rising death toll and extensive damages, Mexico's citizens and authorities are reeling from the effects of the back-to-back disasters. Authorities have declared at least 97 confirmed deaths, with many people still unaccounted for, as Mexico's emergency services struggle to cope with the extensive devastation. The Wrath of the Storm: Tropical storms Manuel and Ingrid pummeled the country this week, leaving several towns and communities devastated in their wake. One of the worst-hit locations is the small town of La Pintada, where Monday's massive landslide buried approximately half of the homes, leading to at least 68 residents out of the town's 800 missing. Reports reveal that several families have been wiped out entirely by this catastrophe. The storm situation is so severe that the Mexican government has calculated the damage caused by Tropical Storm Manuel alone at an estimated 400 million. Impact on Tourism: Mexico’s economy has also been affected, due to the storm impacting its tourism industry. As Tropical Storm Manuel hit the popular tourist destination of Acapulco, thousands of tourists had to be evacuated at short notice. Acapulco's transportation infrastructure has been severely compromised, and holidaymakers planning to visit the area now face cancellation or rescheduling of their plans. This disruption has led to a significant blow for the country's tourism sector, which it needs to bounce back from in the coming months. Response and Recovery Efforts: Despite the significant challenges faced by communities across the country, Mexico's residents claim they have received inadequate aid from their government and emergency services. In the hard-hit town of Renacimiento, for example, a CNN investigation found that cleanup crews had yet to arrive, despite the storm having passed days prior. As a result, people of the town feel ignored by their government. In the words of one resident who lost his kitchen to the floodwaters, \\"The government ignores us. They help everyone else, but they've forgotten about Renacimiento.\\" Conclusion: As Mexico begins the arduous process of recovery from the unimaginable destruction caused by the tropical storm double-whammy, the government has its work cut out for it. With the burden of handling a rising death toll, extensive damage to infrastructure, and the subsequent impact on their economy, the authorities must effectively utilize the available resources and manpower to provide aid and support to the most affected communities. In order to rebuild, the Mexican government needs to prioritize addressing the struggles of its citizens, particularly in hardest-hit areas like La Pintada and Renacimiento. Only through such concerted efforts can Mexico emerge stronger in the aftermath of this natural disaster nightmare."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Available choices: A). need to change B). knock on the door C). arrive at the party A:","completion":"Based on the given situation, it seems that Bailey will likely need to change clothes after having a drink accidentally spilled onto them by Quinn. To offer a detailed account of what may happen next, let's break down the events: 1. Bailey took Quinn aside to say hello - It seems that Bailey wanted to have a private or personal conversation with Quinn, which is why they took Quinn aside. This could be an indication that they had not met in a while or that they had some important matter to discuss. 2. Quinn accidentally spilled their drink onto Bailey - Quinn, most likely feeling nervous or simply being clumsy, accidentally spilled their drink onto Bailey's clothes. Depending on the type of drink and the fabric of Bailey's clothing item, this could cause a noticeable stain or may just make their clothes wet. So, given the situation, this is how things may unfold: A. Need to change - Bailey, realizing that their clothes are now wet and/or stained from the drink, might immediately feel uncomfortable or embarrassed about their appearance. Depending on the severity of the situation and taking into consideration the type of gathering they are attending (e.g., a formal party or a casual gathering), Bailey may decide that they need to change clothes as it could affect their overall presentation or comfort level. - If they are at someone else's house, Bailey might seek permission from the host to borrow clothes or use the host's washing facilities to attempt to remove any stains. - If they are at a public place, Bailey may look for a nearby restroom to assess the situation and possibly try to dry their clothes or remove the stain using available resources. In either scenario, Quinn might feel mortified by their actions and might be apologetic towards Bailey. They may even offer to help Bailey in finding a solution or taking responsibility for any inconvenience caused. In conclusion, although the available choices provided didn't seem to match the exact outcome of the events, Bailey would most likely fall into category A, needing to change clothes or clean their stained garment.

Write a question about the following article: The Bears travelled to Heinz Field to face the winless Pittsburgh Steelers in their first NBC Sunday Night Football matchup of the season. Pittsburgh had lost the previous week to Cincinnati to fall to 0-2 for the first time in 11 years. In the last game between the two in 2009, the Bears triumphed 17-14. The Bears were the 1-point favorites; eight CBSSports.com experts voted on their predictions for the game, with a 5-3 result favoring Chicago, while four ESPN analysts predicted that the Steelers would win. One of the goals of the defense was to contain Ben Roethlisberger in the passing pocket, especially as the offensive line suffered the loss of center Maurkice Pouncey. Additionally, the Steelers also had the 31st-ranked rushing offense and had yet to score a rushing touchdown, who was expected to regain first-rounder Le'Veon Bell. Alan Rubenstein of ChicagoNow writes that the Bears should attempt to improve their pass rush, which was only able to record two sacks in the last two games. Marc Trestman cited the weather as a factor for the poor performance, stating, \\"It's tough to rush the passer in wet weather... For both sides. It's tough to get a pass rush with a soggy field and a wet field. It's an advantage throwing the football. On a rainy day (versus) no rain, really the advantage goes to the offense. Because we can sit back there and protect. And it's really hard to configure a pass rush to get close.\\" On offense, the Bears should attempt to attack the Steelers' 14th-ranked rush defense. A key matchup was the WR-CB duel between Brandon Marshall and Ike Taylor; Taylor contained Bengals receiver A. J. Green, who recorded 162 yards against the Bears in week one, to just six catches for 41 yards in week two. Chicago started the game with Robbie Gould's field goal, followed by Matt Fort&#233; and Michael Bush's touchdown runs to take a 17-0 lead in the first quarter. Pittsburgh then scored on Shaun Suisham's 27-yard field goal, but the Bears then scored after Major Wright returned Roethlisberger's interception 38 yards for a touchdown for the 24-3 lead at halftime. In the second half, the Steelers began to rally with Roethlisberger throwing two touchdown passes of 33 and 21 yards to Antonio Brown, followed by Suisham kicking two more field goals to narrow the margin to 27-23. However, Jay Cutler threw a 17-yard touchdown pass to Earl Bennett; the pass was initially ruled as incomplete, but was reversed. Eventually, Lance Briggs stripped Roethlisberger, and Julius Peppers returned the fumble 42 yards for a touchdown. Although the eventual extra point by Gould was blocked by Troy Polamalu, the Bears finished the game with Chris Conte intercepting Roethlisberger with 1:39 left in the game for the fifth takeaway by Chicago on the night and the 40-23 win, dropping the Steelers to 0-3 for the first time since 1986.","completion":"What happened when the Bears and the Steelers played against each other in a Sunday Night Football matchup, and who were the favorites to win the game?"},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Facts: - death date: 10 february 1979 - birth date: 25 october 1915 - name: torleiv bolstad - nationality: norwegian - death place: oslo , norway - birth place: Øystre slidre , oppland county , norway - occupation: musician and hardanger fiddler Based on these bullet points, write a short biography describing the life of torleiv bolstad .

With songs such as \\"Maybellene\\" (1955), \\"Roll Over Beethoven\\" (1956), \\"Rock and Roll Music\\" (1957) and \\"Johnny B. Goode\\" (1958), Berry refined and developed rhythm and blues into the major elements that made rock and roll distinctive, with lyrics focusing on teen life and consumerism and music featuring guitar solos and showmanship that were a major influence on subsequent rock music. - Rhythm and blues, often abbreviated as R&B or RnB, is a genre of popular African-American music that originated in the 1940s. The term was originally used by record companies to describe recordings marketed predominantly to urban African Americans, at a time when \\"urbane, rocking, jazz based music with a heavy, insistent beat\\" was becoming more popular. In the commercial rhythm and blues music typical of the 1950s through the 1970s, the bands usually consisted of piano, one or two guitars, bass, drums, saxophone, and sometimes background vocalists. R&B lyrical themes often encapsulate the African-American experience of pain and the quest for freedom and joy. Lyrics focus heavily on the themes of triumphs and failures in terms of relationships, freedom, economics, aspirations, and sex. - \\"Roll Over Beethoven\\" is a 1956 hit single by Chuck Berry, originally released on Chess Records, with \\"Drifting Heart\\" as the B-side. The lyrics of the song mention rock and roll and the desire for rhythm and blues to replace classical music. The title of the song is an imperative directed at the composer Ludwig van Beethoven to roll over in his grave in reaction to the new genre of music that Berry was promoting. The song has been covered by many other artists, including the Beatles and the Electric Light Orchestra. \\"Rolling Stone\\" magazine ranked it number 97 on its list of the \\"500 Greatest Songs of All Time\\". - \`\` Around and Around '' is a 1958 rock song written and first recorded by Chuck Berry . It originally appeared under the name \`\` Around & Around '' as the B - side to the single \`\` Johnny B. Goode '' . - \\"Maybellene\\" is one of the first rock-and-roll songs. It was written and recorded in 1955 by Chuck Berry, and inspired/adapted from the Western Swing fiddle tune \\"Ida Red,\\" which was recorded in 1938 by Bob Wills and his Texas Playboys. Berry's song tells the story of a hot rod race and a broken romance. It was released in July 1955 as a single by Chess Records, of Chicago, Illinois. It was Berry's first single and his first hit. \\"Maybellene\\" is considered one of the pioneering rock-and-roll songs: \\"Rolling Stone\\" magazine wrote, \\"Rock & roll guitar starts here.\\" The record is an early instance of the complete rock-and-roll package: youthful subject matter; a small, guitar-driven combo; clear diction; and an atmosphere of unrelenting excitement.

Answer the following question: What is the final step of the following process: - Solar radiation reaches Earth's atmosphere - Some is reflected back into space - The rest of the energy is absorbed by land and oceans, heating the Earth - Heat radiates from Earth to space - Some of this heat is trapped by greenhouse gases in the atmosphere - Human activities such as burning fuel are increasing the amount of greenhouses gases - This causes more heat radiation to stay trapped in our atmosphere Answer:","completion":"The final step of the process involving solar radiation, absorption, reflection, and greenhouse gases is an increase in Earth's overall temperature due to the enhanced greenhouse effect. This phenomena is known as global warming or climate change. When solar radiation reaches Earth's atmosphere, some of that energy is reflected back into space while the rest is absorbed by the Earth's surface, which includes land and oceans. This absorbed energy then warms the Earth and results in heat radiating back to the space. However, not all of this heat escapes the atmosphere; some is trapped by greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, methane, and water vapor, which act as insulators. While the greenhouse effect is a natural part of Earth's climate system, human activities have amplified this effect significantly. Burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and various industrial processes have led to an increase in the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. The increasing amounts of these gases cause more of the Earth's radiated heat to be retained, thus causing an imbalance in Earth's energy budget. Consequently, this leads to an overall increase in global temperatures and fluctuations in the climate system. This global warming has several consequences, including rising sea levels, loss of sea ice, extreme weather events, and shifting ecosystems. Such changes affect human societies and natural environments, which might face food and water scarcity, damage to infrastructure, and loss of biodiversity. Moreover, the warming triggers a series of feedback loops, such as the release of methane from melting permafrost. These feedback loops could further accelerate the overall warming, resulting in significant and potentially catastrophic changes to our planet. Therefore, the final step of the process involving solar radiation, energy absorption, reflection, heat radiation, and greenhouse gases is the rise in Earth's overall temperature and the associated consequences of global warming and climate change. This problem highlights the urgent need for concerted global efforts to mitigate the factors contributing to global warming and transition towards cleaner and sustainable sources of energy."},{"prompt":"Which is farther north, Lehigh Canal or New Orleans Outfall Canals?","completion":"Lehigh Canal is farther north than the New Orleans Outfall Canals.

Answer the following question: Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below. Which country was more regulated in regards to foreign currency exchange? Pakistan tried to control the foreign exchange market and India didn't. By creating the foreign exchange control department, Pakistan tried to stop the devaluation of their currency. India chose to not interfere and let the exchange market regulate itself. Hint: Often, foreign exchange controls can result in the creation of black markets to exchange the weaker currency for stronger currencies. This leads to a situation where the exchange rate for the foreign currency is much higher than the rate set by the government, and therefore creates a shadow currency exchange market. As such, it is unclear whether governments have the ability to enact effective exchange controls.[1] Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, Pakistan was more regulated in regards to foreign currency exchange. This is because Pakistan created a foreign exchange control department to control the market and prevent the devaluation of their currency, while India chose not to interfere and let the exchange market regulate itself."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Macy) has little positive going for him: he lives in a dreary place--a studio apartment in a run-down motel near the Las Vegas Strip; he can't recall the last time he had physical contact with a woman; he's indebted to the Shangri-La casino boss Shelly Kaplow (Alec Baldwin), who years earlier cured him of a gambling habit by breaking his kneecap. Kaplow had also paid Lootz' casino debts, and Bernie has been working off that large debt to Shelly for several years and the debt is nearly paid off. Lootz is weary of the casino business, and tells Kaplow he is leaving Las Vegas soon. His future success as a luck \\"cooler\\" is changed when cocktail waitress Natalie Belisario (Maria Bello) seemingly takes an interest in him, and his luckÂ â and that of those around himÂ â takes a turn for the better. What Bernie doesn't know yet is that Shelly has paid Natalie to seduce him into staying and working at the Shangri-La. What Shelly doesn't know is that Natalie actually has fallen in love with Bernie, and vice versa. Additional complications arise when Shelly, a relative old-timer who resents the Disneyfication of Vegas, resists the efforts of new Shangri-La owner advisers, including Ivy League graduate and condescending upstart Larry Sokolov (Ron Livingston), to update the casino hotel property and bring it into the 21st century. Lootz also learns his seldom-seen adult son is back in town, and, with his wife, is interfering with the operations at the Shangri La. Though Shelly still has the backing of certain mob associates, such as gangster Nicky Fingers, the growing power of the new young Ivy League casino owners is lessening his power grip on the casino and the business he truly loves.

One of its earliest massive implementations was brought about by Egyptians against the British occupation in the 1919 Revolution.

Answer a question about this article: Centered on Post Oak Boulevard and Westheimer Road, the Uptown District boomed during the 1970s and early 1980s when a collection of mid-rise office buildings, hotels, and retail developments appeared along Interstate 610 west. Uptown became one of the most prominent instances of an edge city. The tallest building in Uptown is the 64-floor, 901-foot (275 m)-tall, Philip Johnson and John Burgee designed landmark Williams Tower (known as the Transco Tower until 1999).

The product: Axe Peace The premise: Leaders in North Korea and Iran are among the troubled nations alluded to in a tense sequence of events — an advancing tank, a military march, a soldier with a machine gun. The punch line: But just as we’ve begun to think the worst, the soldiers begin to abandon their weapons and embrace the women they love. That military march is a grand tribute to the dictator’s wife. The red button deploys fireworks, not bombs. The message here is peace, as the newest line of Axe is called. The verdict: This is something new: a heartwarming commercial from Eau de Bro body spray company Axe. In a departure from its usual schlubby-dude-wearing-Axe-attracts-bikini-babe marketing strategy, Axe has shifted its message to something softer. Not only does the ad support a partnership with cease-fire advocates Peace One Day, but it’s also gripping and cinematic, with a great twist. The product: Dannon Oikos Greek yogurt The premise: John Stamos, the reigning ladies’ man of lactose for the third straight year, is once again eating yogurt with a woman. He’s having trouble getting the spoon to his mouth, so she helps him out by licking it off of his lips. He senses an opportunity and — oops! — drips it in his lap. The punch line: But his “Full House” castmates, Bob Saget and Dave Coulier, aren’t about to let him score. Needless to say, the cleanliness-obsessed Saget is not the person that Stamos was hoping would utter the phrase, “Take off your pants, Greek boy.” The verdict: Given the media blitz that the “Full House” castmates undertook in recent days — including a Reddit Q&A and a skit with Jimmy Fallon — Dannon is really getting its money’s worth this year. The product: GoDaddy Web hosting The premise: Throngs of hulking bodybuilders are running through a city — and they’re led by GoDaddy spokeswoman Danica Patrick, who’s been considerably beefed up, thanks to some veiny, prosthetic muscles. But why is the siren call attracting all these meatheads? The punch line: They’re about to stampede a spray-tanning salon, whose owner hosts her Web site on GoDaddy. “It’s ‘go’ time,” she says, spritzing a little orange puff of tanning solution. The verdict: Last Fall, GoDaddy — maker of the most notoriously provocative commercials — announced that it was dropping its scantily-clad-babe strategy for something a little less sleazy. It’s a decision that has already paid off, as this year’s commercial is one of the funniest of the bunch. The product: Kia The premise: Laurence Fishburne returns as Morpheus from “The Matrix,” moonlighting as a valet at a fancy restaurant. When an attractive couple approaches, he presents them with an echo of the movie’s choice: blue key or red key? Red, he says, will make them “never look at luxury the same way again.” The punch line: They take it, of course, and some weird, Matrix-y things start to happen — flying cars, exploding streetlights. It’s all done to the unexpected tune “Nessun Dorma,” from the opera “Turandot.” The verdict: One hopes they tipped him well. The product: Chevy Silverado The premise: A rugged-looking gentleman takes a bull on a road trip. The ad seems like a typical truck commercial featuring farmland and Americana, until they cue the music: Hot Chocolate’s “You Sexy Thing.” The punch line: The bull is offloaded into a field of cows and . . . hello, ladies. With perfect comedic timing, he licks his lips as he surveys his prospects. The verdict: It’s nice to see a rancher-and-his-truck commercial that doesn’t take itself so seriously. The product: Bud Light The premise: In a two-part ad, a guy named Ian is in for a wild night. He’s approached by a woman who offers him a Bud Light and asks him whether he’s up for whatever happens next. The punch line: What happens next turns out to be partying with a group of bachelorettes in a limo with Reggie Watts, bumping into Don Cheadle and a llama in a limo, and playing table tennis with Arnold Schwarzenegger. The verdict: It’s as if “The Hangover” were a short film, instead. And it might be one of Arnold’s finest performances. The product: Toyota Highlander The premise: Terry Crews is driving on a dusty road when he comes upon a broken-down bus. When he stops to offer aid, the Muppets of Electric Mayhem pile into his car and take him on a weird, wonderful trip — through an old ladies’ bingo game, a winery, a parade and more. It’s all to the tune of a new Muppet jingle, “We ain’t got no room for boring.” The punch line: Boring old Terry Crews starts to loosen up a bit — maybe a bit too much, as his neighbor Kermit finds him shirtless and wild-eyed, with a tie around his head, singing the Muppets’ song. The verdict: Basically, it’s the kid-friendly version of the Bud Light commercial that takes one man on a surprising, celebrity-packed day of adventures. Except these celebrities are made of felt. ||||| Advance marketing campaigns have largely leeched the thrill of discovery out of Super Bowl advertising, since many of the spots were exposed before the game. Of course, that logic seems less assailable given that the game itself was essentially over on the first play of the second half, making viewing optional if you really gave a damn about who wins. The level of perceived creativity in Super Bowl advertising has taken on a life of its own, which has led to the content generally being overrated. Moreover, one of the biggest sponsor categories — movie studios — are invariably challenged to come up with genuinely breakthrough creative, since a trailer is pretty much a trailer, the only difference here being the size of the stage and cost of the platform. That said, watching the game like a regular fan (including a couple of pale ales just to complete the effect), here’s a set of knee-jerk reactions about the in-game advertising, assessing who scored — in a creative sense, if not necessarily a moving-product one — and who could have put those millions of dollars to better use. Because they’re of special interest to Hollywood — and really belong in a separate class — we’ll break the movies out separately, followed by the rest of the field. In general, there were relatively few standouts, but also few outright howlers, with car companies conjuring some of the most memorable spots, for both good and ill. As always, when it comes to the size of a corporate footprint at the Super Bowl, there’s Budweiser, and then everybody else: Related VideoAmp, Fox, FreeWheel Publishers and Omnicom Media Group Discuss TV Advertising Fox Orders Comedy Pilots From Lon Zimmet, Billy Finnegan MOVIES Need for Speed (DreamWorks): Pretty smart, doing an ad for a high-testosterone movie without built-in sequel recognition that virtually omits any dialogue. Essentially reduced the project to its adrenaline-rush core. Transformers: Age of Extinction (Paramount): If I could sit through another one of these movies, that spot would probably make me want to watch this one. The Amazing Spider-Man 2 (Sony): The special effects look fine, but for some reason as I watched it, I kept thinking about the first “Spider-Man 3.” 24: Live Another Day (Fox): I know, it’s a TV show, but the ad certainly looked like a movie trailer — and made me laugh for all the wrong reasons. Jack Bauer, trust me, you don’t want to go out this way, dude. CLEAR WINNERS Volkswagen: German engineers sprouting wings each time one of their cars hits 100,000 miles — including wings of varying sizes in the men’s room? Genius. Chevy: The company’s spot about World Cancer Day was just beautiful — haunting, touching, a little movie, played out in 30 seconds. Hyundai Genesis: Who can’t relate to the idea of a dad trying to protect his kid — and a car’s breaking system stepping in when he’s not available? Perfect way of pushing the product in a light yet highly identifiable manner. Too bad it’s other spot, with Johnny Galecki, was a waste. SodaStream: Although this has always struck me as a completely unnecessary product, the company’s “banned” Scarlett Johansson ad was a winner well before kick off, going viral thanks to the NFL forcing a change because the company dared to mention fellow Super Bowl sponsor Pepsi. And it’s a good thing, too, since the spot didn’t air until the fourth quarter, when the outcome of the game was long since decided, and wasn’t particularly imaginative. Budweiser: Unabashedly patriotic and designed to make viewers cry, the notion of every returning soldier receiving a hero’s welcome was enough to trump the inherent manipulation in the way it was mounted and produced. Ditto for the adorable-puppy-meets-Clydesdale ad. Microsoft: A thoughtful look at how technology is changing — and improving — the world, while not-so-subtly linking Microsoft to those innovations. Beats Music: Ellen DeGeneres seemed like the right talent for a playful spot pushing the music service. RadioShack: A dizzying wave of ’80s nostalgia used to sell the stores’ new look. Clever. MARGINAL WINNERS Cheerios: Adorable kid finds out she’s getting a new baby. What’s not to like? Coca-Cola: Old-fashioned and heart-tugging, America in all its diversity is united in its love for sugary brown water. And in reality, very little else. Got it — and much better than the second spot, with the young kid running (and running and running) for a touchdown. Time Warner Cable: One of those weird fever dreams — “True Blood?” “Ray Donovan?” Diddy? — that kind of strangely worked. Toyota Highlander: Hard to go wrong with the Muppets. But a modest winner at best. Kia: As much as I enjoyed Laurence Fishburne’s “The Matrix” spoof, I also found it mildly depressing that he would do it. Jaguar: Nicely produced spot featuring British actors explaining why they’re cast as villains in movies — and like to drive Jaguar. Although probably not as much of a recognition factor for a lot of viewers as the company would have liked to really make this pop. LOSERS Wonderful Pistachios: What a criminal waste of Stephen Colbert as a pitchman. Maserati: That ad with the kid was terribly dramatic, but I have no idea what the hell it has to do with cars. Bud Light: Kudos to the idea of doing a serialized spot — with Don Cheadle and Arnold Schwarzenegger, no less — but the payoff to this reality-TV spoof felt like a missed opportunity. While I suspect it will score well in public polling, kind of a creative mess, conceptually. GoDaddy: Someone quits their job on TV, in this economy, and that’s fodder for a commercial? Never thought I’d say this, but go back to teasing that you’re going to show naked women — or the other spot with the running bodybuilders. Audi: I’m sure they thought the Doberhuahua spot and its “Don’t compromise” message was crowd-pleasing, but as executed, all they did was stumble into a possible plot for the next Kevin James and/or Adam Sandler movie. CarMax and Geico: Hey, I love “Rudy” as much as the next guy — and for that matter, talking pigs — but what was the point? Subway: Olympians eat at Subway, huh? Right, and rainbows fly out of the butts of German engineers. Chobani: So if I buy your yogurt, a bear is going to break into my house to get it? Does anybody ever think these spots through? M&M and Butterfingers: Apparently the candy industry just decided to be weird this year. Although did the latter really imply a chocolate-peanut butter-candy bar three-way? Kinky, but still…. DRAW Chrysler: “We will build your car” is a powerful message, but A) this looked exactly like the Clint Eastwood spot and B) Bob Dylan strikes me as a rather awkward spokesman to deliver it. Too many people will find themselves thinking, like I did, less about the loving imagery than, “Wow, why would Dylan do this?” Honda: Having Bruce Willis deliver a car safety message wasn’t a bad idea, but why not just play it straight, instead of mucking it up with the Fred Armisen gag? T-Mobile: Great for the Tim Tebow lovers out there, but kind of a waste for those who felt he was overexposed about three seasons ago. Doritos: OK, the kid using the “time machine” to steal the guy’s Doritos was kind of funny, but it didn’t feel particularly special. Chevy: So the Silverado truck will get a Bull laid? Cheeky, but — pardon the expression — where’s the beef? TurboTax: While I like the idea of trying to dissect the sociology of the Super Bowl, trying to convince me to go worry about my taxes while I have a big plate of bean dip isn’t particularly appetizing or interesting. Squarespace and Sonos: Not a bad idea trying to highlight what a strange universe the Web often is, but the spot left me with absolutely no idea what the company’s product does. And ditto for the second one. WeatherTech: Despite the appealing “Made in America” message, not particularly well done. Heinz: Probably effective, but “If you’re happy and you know it clap your hands” strikes me as just a trifle too simplistic to be worthy of a Super Bowl campaign. Oikos: Kind of fun to do a “Full House” reunion in the context of a commercial, but this just felt so … flat. ||||| Focused crawls are collections of frequently-updated webcrawl data from narrow (as opposed to broad or wide) web crawls, often focused on a single domain or subdomain. ||||| Rating is available when the video has been rented.

It's really easy, and all you need is sand, a net and a group of people, of any age or fitness level, who want to have fun. Beach volleyball can be played with as few as two people in each team, making a total of four people. However, if you are less skilled and experienced in the game, it will be easier to play with a larger team. The more players you have, the less ground each person will be responsible for covering and the more time they will have to recover between shots. If you only have a few players, each of you will get a lot of running for the ball after each volley . If you are looking for a relaxing, fun, low-key experience, choose larger teams. Beach volleyball is similar to regular volleyball in its rules. However, even experienced volleyball players do not realize how much more difficult it is to run and jump on sand. Since it is harder to move quickly on sand than a hard surface, play will be much slower than regular volleyball on a court. When an athlete trains for beach volleyball, he will focus on building lower body strength as well as upper body strength. Strengthening his legs is extremely important. This improves the player's ability to move quickly and accurately on sand despite the resistance. The ability to jump high and land without injury is necessary for beach volleyball players. Whether you are in it for the competition, or just to have a great time with your friends, beach volleyball can be extremely exciting and fun. You may start out with friends and may soon fall in love with the sport. When playing beach volleyball, in which of the following situation will you feel most relaxed? A) Playing in a 2-person team. B) Playing in a 4-person team. C) Playing in a 6-person team. D) Playing in an 11-person team. Answer:","completion":"You will feel most relaxed when playing beach volleyball in an 11-person team (Option D). The reason for this is that when you have a larger team, each player is responsible for covering less ground on the sand. As a result, individuals have more time to recover between shots, and the overall gameplay becomes less physically demanding. In a more relaxed and low-key atmosphere, with 11 players on your team, you will have more opportunity to enjoy the game and socialize with teammates. It allows players of different age groups and fitness levels to participate in the game without feeling exhausted or overwhelmed by the fast-paced nature of smaller teams. When playing with fewer players, as in a 2-person (Option A) or 4-person team (Option B), the gameplay becomes more intense and competitive. In these situations, each player has to cover more ground and gets less time to recover between volleys, making the game more challenging. A 6-person team (Option C) offers a moderate level of intensity, wherein the responsibilities are more distributed compared to smaller teams, but still may require quick gameplay and faster movements. Overall, if you are looking to have a relaxing, fun, and low-key experience, playing beach volleyball in an 11-person team would be the best option, as it ensures everyone can play comfortably and enjoy the game."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Frank's father, Simon, is a B-movie enthusiast who believes in extraterrestrials and shows his favorite movies at the local theater. The city loses its electrical power just as Simon, Jack and her boyfriend Squirrelly exit the theater. They watch an object streaking through the sky and crashing into the museum. Thought to be a meteorite, they later find out it is a craft containing an alien lifeform. Trying to adapt to the Earth's atmosphere, it latches on to the first organism it finds - the museum's most notable exhibit, a frozen Wooly mammoth. A security guard witnesses the revival of the prehistoric elephant, which kills the guard. With the creature on the loose, two government agents, Powers and Whitaker, track Frank down. While the agents and Frank try to figure out what happened and what to do, the mammoth heads into the forest, where it kills anyone it comes across. The beast's path soon brings it to a huge party attended by Jack and Squirrelly. They survive the attack and meet up with Frank and the agents.

Because of the power of shots, the goaltender wears special equipment designed to protect the body from direct impact. The goalie is one of the most valuable players on the ice, as their performance can greatly change the outcome or score of the game. One-on-one situations, such as breakaways and shootouts, have the tendency to highlight a goaltender's pure skill, or lack thereof. Only one goaltender is allowed to be on the ice for each team at any given time. - Christopher William Hajt (born July 5, 1978) is a former Canadian-born American ice hockey defenceman and the son of former NHLer Bill Hajt. - The Verizon Center, formerly known as the MCI Center, is a sports and entertainment arena in Washington, D.C. - Junior hockey is ice hockey competition generally for players between 16 and 21 years of age.

Question: suppose less stormy weather happens, how will it affect more roots occur. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","completion":"To answer the question, let's go through the process step-by-step: 1. A plant grows near or on a rock. 2. The plant roots begin to grow. 3. Break apart the rock. 4. The plant acids dissolve parts of the rock. 5. The rocks are broken into more and more pieces. 6. Erosion starts to occur. Now let's address the perturbation: Suppose less stormy weather happens. Less stormy weather could potentially lead to less rainfall and overall drier conditions in the environment. This could have a few different effects on the process at hand: 1. If there is less rainfall, it could result in slower plant growth or even hinder the germination of new plants near or on rocks. This would, in turn, lead to fewer roots growing near or on rocks. 2. Another way the perturbation could influence the process is by affecting erosion. With less stormy weather, there would be less water-induced erosion, which means the rocks broken apart by the plant roots dissolve more slowly. Considering how the supposed perturbation influences the second effect mentioned, which is \\"the plant roots begin to grow,\\" the less amount of stormy weather could lead to less rainfall and drier conditions, ultimately resulting in less roots growth. Therefore, the answer would be that the perturbation has a \\"less\\" effect on the second effect stated in the process."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Information: - A film, also called a movie, motion picture, theatrical film or photoplay, is a series of still images which, when shown on a screen, creates the illusion of moving images due to the phi phenomenon. This optical illusion causes the audience to perceive continuous motion between separate objects viewed rapidly in succession. The process of filmmaking is both an art and an industry. A film is created by photographing actual scenes with a motion picture camera; by photographing drawings or miniature models using traditional animation techniques; by means of CGI and computer animation; or by a combination of some or all of these techniques and other visual effects. - A screenplay or script is a written work by screenwriters for a film, video game, or television program. These screenplays can be original works or adaptations from existing pieces of writing. In them, the movement, actions, expression, and dialogues of the characters are also narrated. A screenplay written for television is also known as a teleplay. - A television program is a segment of content intended for broadcast on over-the-air, cable television, or Internet television, other than a commercial, trailer, or any other segment of content not serving as attraction for viewership. It may be a single production, or more commonly, a series of related productions (also called a television series or a television show). - Music is an art form and cultural activity whose medium is sound and silence, which exist in time. The common elements of music are pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the \\"color\\" of a musical sound). Different styles or types of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs without instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and instruments. The word derives from Greek (\\"mousike\\"; \\"art of the Muses\\"). In its most general form, the activities describing music as an art form include the production of works of music (songs, tunes, symphonies, and so on), the criticism of music, the study of the history of music, and the aesthetic examination of music. Ancient Greek and Indian philosophers defined music as tones ordered horizontally as melodies and vertically as harmonies. Common sayings such as \\"the harmony of the spheres\\" and \\"it is music to my ears\\" point to the notion that music is often ordered and pleasant to listen to. However, 20th-century composer John Cage thought that any sound can be music, saying, for example, \\"There is no noise, only sound.\\" - Mathias Woo Yan Wai ( Chinese : ; born 1968 ) is a cultural worker in the cross-media discipline in Hong Kong , with creative works ranging from theatre and multi-media design , to cultural policy research and analysis , art education , architectural design and screenplay writing .

The performers may communicate this experience to the audience through combinations of gesture, speech, song, music, and dance. Elements of art, such as painted scenery and stagecraft such as lighting are used to enhance the physicality, presence and immediacy of the experience. The specific place of the performance is also named by the word \\"theatre\\" as derived from the Ancient Greek (théatron, \\"a place for viewing\\"), itself from (theáomai, \\"to see\\", \\"to watch\\", \\"to observe\\"). - Stagecraft is the technical aspect of theatrical, film, and video production. It includes constructing and rigging scenery, hanging and focusing of lighting, design and procurement of costumes, makeup, procurement of props, stage management, and recording and mixing of sound.

New York City Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito has revealed she has 'high risk HPV', a sexually-transmitted disease that can cause cancer. She made the announcement on Twitter on Sunday, explaining that she learned about her human papillomavirus diagnosis on Friday following a long overdue gynecologist's appointment. 'At recent #GYN visit alarmed to find out last one, 2yrs ago,' she wrote on Sunday evening. 'Friday got call re: results. Told have \\"high risk HPV.\\" #Biopsy needed #ASAP.' Diagnosis: Melissa Mark-Viverito, pictured last week, revealed on Twitter on Sunday that she has human papillomavirus, a sexually-transmitted infection that can cause cervical cancers. The 45-year-old went on: 'To say. I'm not wee bit worried = lie. \\"High risk HPV\\" can POTENTIALLY but NOT definitively lead to cervical #cancer.' An aide to Mark-Viverito, who is not married, explained to the New York Daily News that she went public with the news in an attempt to help de-stigmatize the condition, which is the most common sexually transmitted infection. 'Yes, I’m an extremely private person,' her first tweet read. 'But this position has led me to understand I now have a bigger responsibility.' She added she had 'struggled & came to conclusion it would be best to disclose & share process I’m going thru hoping it can be helpful to others. Speaking out: She said she revealed her diagnosis on Twitter to de-stygmatize the infection. Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common sexually transmitted infection in the U.S. Around 79 million Americans are infected, according to the CDC. Although in many cases the virus may cause no symptoms, in other people, it can cause genital warts or cervical cancer. The infection occurs primarily through skin-to-skin contact, and can be transmitted through sexual intercourse, anal sex or oral sex. Rarely, a mother can transmit the virus to her baby during delivery. Two vaccines have been introduced in the U.S. to be given to schoolchildren aged 11 to 12.

We have this equation: -143 * n + 5376 = -311 * n We need to find the value of n, just like finding the missing piece of the puzzle. Let's follow these easy steps: 1. To solve for n, we need to get all the n's on one side of the equation. We can add 311 * n to both sides of the equation to start: -143 * n + 5376 + 311 * n = -311 * n + 311 * n 2. Now, combine the n's on the left side: (-143 + 311) * n + 5376 = 0 3. Now, calculate -143 + 311: 168 * n + 5376 = 0 4. We need to move 5376 to the other side by subtracting it: 168 * n = -5376 5. Finally, divide both sides by 168 to find the value of n: n = -5376 / 168 6. Calculate -5376 / 168: n = -32 So, the missing puzzle piece, n, is equal to -32!

The first live performance of the Ray Davies Quartet, the band that would become the Kinks, was at a dance for their school, William Grimshaw, in 1962. The band performed under several names between 1962 and 1963—the Pete Quaife Band, the Bo-Weevils, the Ramrods, and the Ravens—before settling on the Kinks in early 1964. Ray has stated that a performance at Hornsey Town Hall on Valentine's Day 1963 was when the band were truly born. The Kinks made their first tour of Australia and New Zealand in January 1965 as part of a \\"package\\" bill that included Manfred Mann and the Honeycombs. They performed and toured relentlessly, headlining package tours throughout 1965 with performers such as the Yardbirds and Mickey Finn. Tensions began to emerge within the band, expressed in incidents such as the on-stage fight between drummer Mick Avory and Dave Davies at The Capitol Theatre, Cardiff, Wales on 19 May. After finishing the first song, \\"You Really Got Me\\", Davies insulted Avory and kicked over his drum set. Avory responded by hitting Davies with his hi-hat stand, rendering him unconscious, before fleeing from the scene, fearing that he had killed his bandmate. Davies was taken to Cardiff Royal Infirmary, where he received 16 stitches to his head. To placate police, Avory later claimed that it was part of a new act in which the band members would hurl their instruments at each other. Following their summer 1965 American tour, the American Federation of Musicians refused permits for the group to appear in concerts in the United States for the next four years, possibly due to their rowdy on-stage behaviour.In April 1969 Davies helped negotiate an end to the American Federation of Musician ban on the group, which allowed plans for a North American tour.

In his right hand I saw what I call a meat cleaver or a machete. “I instantly thought, 'He’s going to kill me’.” The force of E48’s shot threw Adebolajo to the ground and the three officers then leapt out of the car and saw Adebowale, who was holding a gun. D49 said: “I thought, 'Oh my God he’s going to shoot me’. I feared for my life.” The third officer then shot Adebowale but the attacker raised his gun while lying on the ground. E48 told the jury: “I’ve still got a distinct image in my mind of him holding a black revolver in his hand which I clearly saw, which struck me as unusual because he’d just been shot.” Police fired again at the hand holding the gun and shot Adebowale’s thumb off. The officers then immediately administered first aid, said E48, adding: “Once the threat is neutralised we have a duty of care to all persons to save life, no matter who they are.” Earlier, the court was shown a video clip of Adebolajo telling members of the public he had attacked Fusilier Rigby in retaliation for British soldiers killing Muslims. He then told paramedic Nicholas Goh: “I don’t want anyone to die, I just want the soldiers out of my country.”. Adebolajo also told him he wished the bullets had killed him, Richard Whittam QC, prosecuting, said. In a statement, Stephen Berry, another paramedic, said Adebolajo told him that “British soldiers deserved to die” for raping and killing women “in our lands”. The defendant later told Pc Melita Vejnovic in hospital that he had never intended to hurt civilians, only the military. Michelle Nimmo, a witness, said in a statement that one of the alleged attackers had a “smirk” on his face and both men appeared “proud” of what they had done. “They stood around looking proud and posing with the gun and knives. They made no attempt to run away.” Her mother, Tina, broke down in tears as she gave evidence in person. She said she had pleaded with the two attackers to stop, shouting and swearing at them. Sarah Riordan, another witness, who was heavily pregnant at the time, said in her statement that she began experiencing “contracting pains” as events unfolded, but was given the all clear at hospital. Abebolajo and Adebowale both deny murdering the soldier, as well as counts of attempted murder of a police officer and conspiracy to murder.","completion":"A police officer testified in court that while responding to the Lee Rigby attack, she thought she was going to die when a man ran at her with a meat cleaver.

Q:Process: - The organism must die to begin the process - The soft tissue decomposes - The bones are left behind - Scavengers tear the body apart and move the bones elsewhere - Wind and rain also scatter the bones further - The bones left behind will weather and become buried by sand and soil - The proteins in the bone are replaced with minerals that are dissolved in the soil - This creates a rock-like substance called a fossil - Water and wind erosion wear away the layers of soil on top of the fossil - This makes discovery of the fossil possible. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose the climate become more forgiving happens, how will it affect there will be a lot more bones. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","completion":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of a more forgiving climate would have an indirect effect on the process of fossilization. Let's analyze how it may impact each step of the process: 1. The death of the organism: A more forgiving climate might result in organisms living longer or more abundantly. This could potentially lead to more bones being available as a starting point for fossilization. 2. Decomposition of soft tissues: A more forgiving climate might affect the rate at which soft tissues decompose. Factors like temperature, humidity, and the presence of decomposers in the environment can influence decomposition rates. 3. Scavengers and bones scattering: With a more forgiving climate, there might be an increase in the number of scavengers, potentially leading to bones being dispersed more widely. 4. Wind and rain scattering bones: Changes in the climate might alter wind patterns and precipitation, resulting in varying distributions of scattered bones. 5. Burial of bones by sand and soil: A more forgiving climate could lead to changes in vegetation cover and soil development, which in turn would affect the rate and manner in which bones are buried. 6. Mineral replacement in bones: Changes in the soil's chemical composition due to a more forgiving climate could impact the minerals available for replacing proteins in bone, potentially altering the fossilization process or the properties of the resultant fossils. 7. Formation of fossils: A more forgiving climate might affect the rate of fossil formation, as well as the specific environmental conditions under which fossils are formed. 8. Erosion and fossil discovery: Changes in erosion patterns due to climate variations might impact the rate at which fossils are exposed on the surface, thereby affecting their discoverability. In conclusion, while a more forgiving climate might not directly change the process of fossilization, it could indirectly impact various stages of the process through changes in environmental conditions and the availability of bones for fossilization."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Here are possible answers to this question: - gymnasium - baseball stadium - soccer game - sports match - football stadium I believe the correct choice is \\"soccer game\\", here's why: The answer is:","completion":"soccer game. Here's the step-by-step justification for this answer: 1. Analyzing the context: The question mentions \\"bleachers full of hooligans\\" which indicates that the event takes place in a sporting context where fans gather to support their teams and sometimes engage in disruptive behavior. 2. Identifying keywords: \\"hooligans\\" and \\"chants\\" indicate that the event is one where fans are known for being passionate and sometimes even violent. \\"Smoke bombs\\" can also be linked to fanaticism in sports events. 3. Relating keywords to potential answers: Soccer, or football, is known to have a strong hooligan culture in some countries, where fans can be aggressive and disruptive during matches. \\"Chants\\" and \\"smoke bombs\\" described in the question are commonly seen during soccer matches as well, while these elements are less common in baseball, basketball, and general sports matches. 4. Eliminating less suitable options: - Gymnasium: A gymnasium often refers to an indoor space for sports like basketball or volleyball, which are not typically associated with hooligans and the described behavior. - Baseball stadium: Baseball games generally have a more relaxed atmosphere and are not strongly associated with hooligan behavior or intense chanting. - Sports match: This option is too broad and does not specify the kind of sports involved. - Football stadium: This can be a potential answer. However, the term \\"stadium\\" focuses primarily on the venue rather than the event; hence \\"soccer game\\" is more accurate. 5. Selecting the best answer: Based on the context and keywords, \\"soccer game\\" would be the most appropriate answer as it directly points to the event where the described behavior takes place, and soccer is well-known for having a passionate fan base and a hooligan culture in some countries."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Premise: \\"The IJC website provides a place for advocates to share information.\\" Based on this premise, is the hypothesis \\"IJC's website is really helpful \\" true?","completion":"Based on the premise that \\"The IJC website provides a place for advocates to share information,\\" it can be reasonably inferred that the IJC's website serves as a valuable resource and platform for the intended user group. However, it's essential to consider additional factors to evaluate the hypothesis \\"IJC's website is really helpful\\" thoroughly. 1. Content Quality: A crucial factor underlying the usefulness of any website is the level and depth of the information it provides. If the IJC website contains accurate, comprehensive, and up-to-date data shared by advocates, the website's helpfulness is undoubtedly boosted. On the other hand, if the content quality is poor or outdated, it would not be fair to say that the website is truly helpful. 2. Ease of Use and Navigation: A helpful website should be user-friendly and easily navigable to ensure that visitors can quickly locate the information they need. If the IJC website has a well-organized layout, with essential features like search functionality, filters, tagging, and intuitive menus, it could be considered helpful. Conversely, if users face difficulties in navigating the website and finding relevant data, its usefulness diminishes. 3. User Engagement and Community Building: The effectiveness of a website might also be judged by the level of user engagement and community participation it facilitates. If the IJC website encourages active discussions, fosters collaborations, and supports advocacy efforts, it can be considered helpful for its target audience. A strong sense of community and exchange of knowledge on the platform would also contribute to the website's positive reputation. 4. Availability of Resources and Tools: A helpful website should offer access to various resources and tools that enable users to accomplish their goals. In the case of IJC, if the website offers tools such as templates, guides, and legal documents that support advocacy work, it adds to the overall helpfulness and utility for visitors. 5. Responsiveness and Updates: A website that is regularly updated with new information and responds to users' queries or feedback demonstrates a commitment to keeping the content relevant and useful. If the IJC website maintains a strong interaction with its user base, addressing concerns and incorporating suggestions, it could be seen as genuinely helpful. To fully determine if the hypothesis \\"IJC's website is really helpful\\" is true, it would be essential to consider these factors, gathering user feedback, and analyzing the overall user experience. If the IJC website scores high on these factors, it would likely be deemed as being \\"really helpful\\" to its intended audience."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Answer choices: - oxygen - dinosaurs - bacteria - skull - clouds - humans - fossil fuels - sea squirts","completion":"Natural gas is primarily composed of methane (CH4), a hydrocarbon, and is formed through a process called thermogenic conversion, where organic materials are subjected to high heat and pressure over millions of years. The primary source of organic materials in the formation of natural gas is not dinosaurs, as it might be commonly misunderstood, but microscopic plants and animals called phytoplankton and zooplankton. When these organisms die, they sink to the bottom of oceans, lakes or other bodies of water, and accumulate in layers of sediment. Over time, more layers build up, exerting pressure on the organic materials beneath them. Let's analyze the answer choices to see which remains are best suited for undergoing this thermogenic process to become natural gas: 1. Oxygen - Oxygen does not form natural gas. It is an element and natural gas is a hydrocarbon formed from organic materials. 2. Dinosaurs - Although commonly misunderstood, dinosaurs have very little involvement in the formation of natural gas and other fossil fuels. It is mostly formed from microscopic organisms rather than large creatures like dinosaurs. 3. Bacteria - Although bacteria play an essential role in the decomposition process of the organic materials involved in natural gas formation, their remains do not predominantly contribute to the formation of natural gas. 4. Skull - Skulls, or any other animal remains, do not significantly contribute to the formation of natural gas. 5. Clouds - Clouds are made up of water droplets suspended in the atmosphere and have no role in the formation of natural gas. 6. Humans - Human remains do not significantly contribute to the formation of natural gas, as it takes millions of years of heat and pressure for organic materials to undergo the necessary transformations. 7. Fossil fuels - Fossil fuels like coal, oil, and natural gas are formed from the remains of ancient plants and animals. However, it is a general term, and the question asks which remains are changed into natural gas by heat and pressure change. 8. Sea squirts - While sea squirts are marine animals, they do not significantly contribute to the formation of natural gas. The primary source of organic materials in the formation of natural gas comes from microscopic organisms like phytoplankton and zooplankton. Based on the answer choices provided, none of them fits the description as well as phytoplankton and zooplankton, which are the microscopic plants and animals that primarily contribute to the formation of natural gas. These tiny organisms, along with other organic materials in layers of sediment, undergo heat and pressure change over millions of years to result in the formation of natural gas."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In the spring of 1974, after completing a vast world tour that culminated with a tour of Asia, the group took an extended break, erroneously reported as a break-up at the time, because of the other band members feeling exhausted and overshadowed (this was said by Hayward in the final issue of Higher & Higher magazine 2006). Although the band had typically featured four lead vocalists (with Edge also contributing vocally), Hayward was the principal guitarist/vocalist whilst Pinder was considered to be the person most responsible for their symphonic sound, arrangements, and overall conceptual direction. Pinder and Thomas also doubled as the Moodies' onstage MCs (as the 1969 \\"Caught Live + 5\\" album displayed). Before the band's 1973-74 world tour (their last with Pinder), Hayward wrote a song called \\"Island\\" with the intention of including it on a potential follow-up album, which the Moodies recorded in 1973 before ultimately going their separate ways. An additional cause of the hiatus were the long tours that had by this time strained Pinder, who needed a rest. In 1974 the band oversaw preparation of the compilation album This Is The Moody Blues which was released that year. Hayward and Lodge released a duo album, the very successful Blue Jays (1975), and a UK chart single, \\"Blue Guitar\\" (no. 8), which was credited to Hayward and Lodge even though it was just Hayward with 10cc backing him. The album had originally been a projected liaison between Hayward and Pinder, but after Pinder dropped out, John Lodge stepped in. (Tony Clarke produced it.) The members then released solo albums. Pinder said he hoped to get the band back together that year. \\"Having moved to California in 1974, I returned to Britain for a visit in summer 1975. I was trying to get the band to do an album, but the response was so weak I returned to California with my two new Mk5 mellotrons and began work on my solo album The Promise.\\" Edge produced two albums with guitarist Adrian Gurvitz, Kick Off Your Muddy Boots (1975) and Paradise Ballroom (1976); Hayward composed the acoustically textured Songwriter (1977), which was followed up in later years by Night Flight (1980), Moving Mountains (1985), (which Hayward dedicated to Peter Knight) Classic Blue (1989), The View From The Hill (1996) and Live in San Juan Capistrano (1998); Lodge released Natural Avenue (1977); Pinder produced The Promise (1976); and Thomas collaborated on two projects with songwriter Nicky James, producing From Mighty Oaks (1975) and Hopes, Wishes and Dreams (1976).

Young filmmaker Stevie Horowitz eagerly awaits a meeting with big shot Hollywood film producer J.P. Shelldrake. Shelldrake has been desperately searching for a way to avoid problems with the IRS and unpaid millions owed them in back taxes. His brilliant yet overpaid accountant devises a scheme to allow the producer to write off the expenses of his next movie release, but only if the film is a box office flop. Armed with his foolproof plan, Shelldrake agrees to meet with Stevie and screen his film \\"Lobster Man From Mars\\" (financed by Stevie's jailed con man Uncle Joey).

Tara Maclay is a fictional character created for the action-horror/fantasy television series Buffy the Vampire Slayer (1997-2003). She was developed by Joss Whedon and portrayed by Amber Benson. Tara is a shy young woman with magical talents who falls in love with Willow Rosenberg, one of the core characters. Together, they help Buffy Summers, who has been given superhuman powers to defeat evil forces in the fictional town of Sunnydale. When Tara and Willow meet, their proficiency at magic is about the same, but Tara's knowledge of the craft far exceeds Willow's. Tara reveals that she has been practicing magic for most of her life, as her deceased mother had also been a powerful witch. Throughout season 4, Tara acts as a partner and guide in Willow's witchcraft, teaching Willow spells and performing magic together. Willow, however, is inherently talented, despite being new to the craft, and begins to progress much faster than Tara in the fifth season, including experimentations in dark magic. Tara struggles with understanding her place among the Scoobies with Buffy (Sarah Michelle Gellar), the leader, with which has a very friendly relationship; Xander Harris (Nicholas Brendon), Willow's friend since childhood; and Rupert Giles (Anthony Stewart Head), their mentor. Tara's primary role throughout the series is that of Willow's partner. She feels somewhat useless until the fifth season episode \\"Family\\" when the entire Scooby Gang (Spike included) makes it clear that she is unquestionably a part of them. The episode introduces some of Tara's blood family: a cold, authoritarian father who has lied to her all her life (telling her that her magical powers are a result of her being part-demon on her mother's side); an overbearing brother; and a judgmental, repressed and repressive cousin; all of whom Tara dismisses at the end of the episode. Tara later reveals in \\"The Body\\" that her mother had died when she was 17. In the following episode, when Dawn is acting out, Tara confides to Buffy that she had to deal with her brother after her mother's death. No more of her backstory is revealed in the series. As Willow's character grows more self-assured and powerful through the seasons, Tara takes over some of the role of being placed in peril and needing to be rescued. The fifth season's primary villain, or Big Bad, is Glory, a goddess too powerful for Buffy to fight alone. Glory tortures Tara in order to gain information on the Key, but Tara asserts willpower and resists Glory, resulting in Glory stealing her sanity, and prompting Willow to go searching for retribution. Glory states she feels \\"buzzed\\" after feeding on Tara's mind, indicating Tara's powerful intellect (and possibly suggesting her power as a witch). Buffy scholar Ian Shuttleworth writes that Benson was able to \\"admirably\\" portray the same range of emotions inherent in Tara although the character loses her identity. Willow's powers are significant enough that she is able to battle Glory more effectively than Buffy, if not completely successfully. In the final episode of season 5, Willow uses her magic to restore Tara's sanity, significantly weakening Glory in the process. Tara also becomes a guide of sorts, and a maternal figure. She appears to Buffy in a dream in the fourth season finale \\"Restless\\" to tell her about the arrival of Buffy's sister Dawn (Michelle Trachtenberg) and act as a translator for the voiceless First Slayer. Following the death of Joyce Summers and Buffy's sacrifice to save the world at the end of the fifth season, Tara and Willow move into the Summers house, taking Joyce's bedroom and becoming Dawn's surrogate parents.

Article: Every year on my birthday, from the time I turned 12, a white gardenia was delivered to my house. No card came with it. Calls to the flower-shop were not helpful at all. After a while I stopped trying to discover the sender's name and just delighted in the beautiful white flower in soft pink paper. But I never stopped imagining who the giver might be. Some of my happiest moments were spent daydreaming about the sender. My mother encouraged these imaginings. She'd ask me if there was someone for whom I had done special kindness. Perhaps it was the old man across the street whose mail I'd delivered during the winter. As a girl, though, I had more fun imagining that it might be a boy I had run into. One month before my graduation, my father died. I felt so sad that I became completely uninterested in my upcoming graduation dance, and I didn't care if I had a new dress or not. But my mother, in her own sadness, would not let me miss any of those things. She wanted her children to feel loved and lovable. In truth, my mother wanted her children to see themselves much like the gardenia-lovely, strong and perfect with perhaps a bit of mystery .My mother died ten days after I was married. I was 22.

Answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What were the full names of the two people who died in prison?, using the article: Other scholar-bureaucrats were wary of Wang's heterodoxy, the increasing number of his disciples while he was still in office, and his overall socially rebellious message. To curb his influence, he was often sent out to deal with military affairs and rebellions far away from the capital. Yet his ideas penetrated mainstream Chinese thought and spurred new interest in Taoism and Buddhism. Furthermore, people began to question the validity of the social hierarchy and the idea that the scholar should be above the farmer. Wang Yangming's disciple and salt-mine worker Wang Gen gave lectures to commoners about pursuing education to improve their lives, while his follower He Xinyin (何心隱) challenged the elevation and emphasis of the family in Chinese society. His contemporary Li Zhi even taught that women were the intellectual equals of men and should be given a better education; both Li and He eventually died in prison, jailed on charges of spreading \\"dangerous ideas\\". Yet these \\"dangerous ideas\\" of educating women had long been embraced by some mothers and by courtesans who were as literate and skillful in calligraphy, painting, and poetry as their male guests.The liberal views of Wang Yangming were opposed by the Censorate and by the Donglin Academy, re-established in 1604. These conservatives wanted a revival of orthodox Confucian ethics. Conservatives such as Gu Xiancheng (1550–1612) argued against Wang's idea of innate moral knowledge, stating that this was simply a legitimization for unscrupulous behavior such as greedy pursuits and personal gain. These two strands of Confucian thought, hardened by Chinese scholars' notions of obligation towards their mentors, developed into pervasive factionalism among the ministers of state, who used any opportunity to impeach members of the other faction from court., what would be the answer ? Answer:","completion":"Based on the article provided, the full names of the two people who died in prison are He Xinyin (何心隱) and Li Zhi.

Answer the following question: This article: Elvis Aaron Presley (January 8, 1935 – August 16, 1977) was an American singer and actor. Regarded as one of the most significant cultural icons of the 20th century, he is often referred to as the \\"King of Rock and Roll\\" or simply \\"the King\\". Presley was born in Tupelo, Mississippi, and relocated to Memphis, Tennessee, with his family when he was 13 years old. His music career began there in 1954, recording at Sun Records with producer Sam Phillips, who wanted to bring the sound of African-American music to a wider audience. Accompanied by guitarist Scotty Moore and bassist Bill Black, Presley was a pioneer of rockabilly, an uptempo, backbeat-driven fusion of country music and rhythm and blues. In 1955, drummer D. J. Fontana joined to complete the lineup of Presley's classic quartet and RCA Victor acquired his contract in a deal arranged by Colonel Tom Parker, who would manage him for more than two decades. Presley's first RCA single, \\"Heartbreak Hotel\\", was released in January 1956 and became a number-one hit in the United States. With a series of successful network television appearances and chart-topping records, he became the leading figure of the newly popular sound of rock and roll. His energized interpretations of songs and sexually provocative performance style, combined with a singularly potent mix of influences across color lines during a transformative era in race relations, made him enormously popular—and controversial. In November 1956, Presley made his film debut in Love Me Tender. Drafted into military service in 1958, Presley relaunched his recording career two years later with some of his most commercially successful work. He held few concerts however, and guided by Parker, proceeded to devote much of the 1960s to making Hollywood films and soundtrack albums, most of them critically derided. In 1968, following a seven-year break from live performances, he returned to the stage in the acclaimed television comeback special Elvis, which led to an extended Las Vegas concert residency and a string... contains an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person whose music career began in Memphis in 1954, recording at Sun Records?, what is it ?

The brevity of the sentence, consisting of only two words, does not provide much context to completely understand the nuances surrounding the statement; however, it can still be analyzed based on the individual words and their connotations. 1. Language Analysis: The word \\"violence\\" is generally associated with negative emotions, as it typically refers to situations involving physical aggression, harm, or injury. In most contexts, violence is considered morally, socially, or legally wrong. It suggests the infliction of pain, suffering, or damage, which is often met with disapproval or disdain by society. Seeing just this word without any modifiers might lead readers to feel an immediate discomfort or fear associated with whatever scenario is being referenced. 2. Lack of Context: Although the sentiment of the word \\"violence\\" is predominantly negative, it is necessary to keep in mind that the brevity of the sentence makes it difficult to determine its true meaning. A more specific and elaborative context would help to gain a more informed understanding of the sentiment. For example, the sentence could be part of a question or statement expressing concern about violence. Additionally, the term could be used to refer to efforts in combating violence or condemning it. Without more information, it becomes challenging to ascertain which context the sentence is derived from. 3. Emotional Perception: Since the sentence only contains two words, it does not allow the reader to feel empathy or compassion for any specific character or situation. However, a reader would still be likely to experience some form of emotional response to the term \\"violence,\\" given the negative implications that are commonly associated with it. The response could range from anxiety to repulsion or simply a desire to understand more about the circumstances under which the violence is mentioned. In conclusion, with limited information and the focus on the word \\"violence,\\" the sentiment of the sentence \\"the violence\\" is primarily perceived as negative. To understand the underlying meaning and full extent of the sentiment, it is crucial to have more context or a broader discussion surrounding the statement. Nonetheless, the negative connotations and emotional perception of the term \\"violence\\" make the phrase likely to evoke unease or discomfort in readers."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: suppose forest rangers are more diligent at watching for fires happens, how will it affect a GREATER negative effect on animals. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect The answer to this question is:","completion":"B: Less Should forest rangers become more diligent at watching for fires, it would have a lesser negative impact on animal populations in the forest for several reasons. 1. Habitat preservation: More diligent fire prevention and monitoring efforts would mean that fewer forest fires occur, or when they do occur, they are more quickly suppressed. This would result in less habitat destruction, allowing animals to continue living in their accustomed areas without disruption. 2. Stable food sources: When forest fires occur, not only do animals lose their homes, but the flora they depend on for feeding can also be destroyed. A diligent forest ranger would help in preserving these feeding grounds, ensuring a stable food source for animals. 3. Reduced stress on animals: By preventing or quickly addressing forest fires, forest rangers would help in reducing the stress experienced by animals during fires. Animals are forced to flee from their homes, which can result in injury, dislocation, or even death. A reduction in forest fires would allow animals to remain in their natural habitats, without the need to flee. 4. Balanced ecosystem: Forest fires can, in some cases, severely impact the balance of an ecosystem. For example, if the population of a specific predator is reduced due to a forest fire, the prey species may grow unhindered, possibly leading to an imbalance in the food chain. By reducing the incidence and scale of forest fires, forest rangers can help maintain the delicate balance of ecosystems. 5. Protection of endangered species: Particularly vulnerable animal species can suffer greatly from forest fires. Some species may have small populations, limited habitats, or specific needs that make them especially susceptible to threats like fires. By closely monitoring and preventing forest fires, forest rangers can take steps to protect endangered species and promote their survival. 6. Preservation of water quality: Forest fires can result in chemicals, debris, and ash entering streams, rivers, or lakes, which can contaminate the water supply for both aquatic and land animals. Diligent forest rangers would help in maintaining the water quality, ultimately contributing to the overall well-being of different species. In conclusion, more diligent forest rangers watching for fires would have a lesser negative effect on animals living in the forest, leading to a healthier and more stable ecosystem."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write down the foods you eat and see how you feel about 1 hour of eating. If the food you ate an hour ago is bothering you, you should eliminate that from your diet. Commonly reported hyperacidity triggers include: Citrus fruit Caffeinated beverages Chocolate Tomatoes Garlic, onions Alcohol Note: Most of these foods have not been studied enough to make a definitive claim. It's more important to find out what triggers your symptoms than to avoid this exact list. If your bed allows for it, raise the head of it by 6 to 8 inches. Gravity will keep the acid in your stomach. Don't just pile up pillows, though. These tend to bend your neck and body in such a way that increases the pressure. It will make the hyperacidity worse. If you’re carrying extra weight, losing weight may reduce some of the pressure on your lower esophageal sphincter, keeping stomach acid from leaking through. However, you may not need to lose weight, so check with your doctor before attempting to do so. Then, eat a healthy diet based on fresh produce and lean protein and exercise for 30 minutes per day. Decrease the amount of food you eat at any one time. This may reduce the amount of stress and pressure on your stomach. Switching to smaller plates and bowls may help because it tricks your mind into thinking you’re eating more food than you really are. Chew each bite several times, then swallow before taking another bite. This helps your stomach digest food more easily and quickly, leaving less food in the stomach adding pressure on the LES. You can also slow yourself down by putting your fork down between bites. Pressure will increase the discomfort of hyperacidity. You can experience excess pressure because of hiatal hernias (when the upper part of the stomach moves above the diaphragm), pregnancy, constipation, or being overweight. Don't wear clothes that constrict your stomach or abdomen. Summary:","completion":"To manage hyperacidity, it is essential to identify and eliminate foods and beverages that trigger your symptoms. Common triggers include citrus fruits, caffeinated beverages, chocolate, tomatoes, garlic, onions, and alcohol, although individual triggers may vary. Monitor the foods you eat and how you feel an hour after eating to determine which ones aggravate your condition. Adjusting your sleeping position can help alleviate hyperacidity. If possible, raise the head of your bed by 6 to 8 inches to utilize gravity in keeping stomach acid in place. Avoid using pillows that bend your neck and body, as these can intensify symptoms. Managing your weight can also affect hyperacidity. If you are overweight, losing weight may decrease pressure on your lower esophageal sphincter, reducing stomach acid leakage. Consult your doctor before attempting to lose weight, maintain a healthy diet based on fresh produce and lean protein, and exercise for 30 minutes daily. Reducing portion sizes and eating slowly will help as well. Utilize smaller plates and bowls to decrease food intake, and chew each bite thoroughly before swallowing.

As you can see in the video above, his answer was not the one his mom expected. \\"I'm taking a deep breath,\\" said Dunn, who recently purchased visor clips for Daniel's friends who have already gotten their licenses that say \\"Stay alive. Don't text and drive.\\" \\"I wouldn't even mind if he said, 'I'm at a red light and I picked up the phone for a minute to read something and put it back down,' but that moving and texting freaks me out.

Are these two questions paraphrases of each other?","completion":"No, these two questions are not paraphrases of each other; they address different aspects concerning the life of an IPS (Indian Police Service) officer. Let's look at each question in detail: 1. \\"How is the life of an IPS officer's wife?\\" This question refers to the experiences, challenges, and lifestyle of the spouse of an IPS officer. The questioner might be interested in understanding the perspective and lifestyle adjustment required when you are married to someone in public service, especially in critical and often demanding positions like an IPS officer. The life of an IPS officer's wife can be quite dynamic and challenging in its own way. It includes frequent transfers and relocations, handling family matters single-handedly in the absence of their spouse, facing the risks and threats associated with their spouse's high-profile jobs, and often adjusting to the public scrutiny that comes with their spouse's position. Still, there are also opportunities to get involved in various social service activities, meeting new people, and getting exposed to diverse cultures and life experiences. 2. \\"How is the life of a woman IPS officer?\\" This question is targeting the lifestyle, challenges, experiences, and professional life of a woman who is herself an IPS officer. This question pertains to the professional life of a woman in the field of law enforcement, her responsibilities, challenges she might face such as balancing personal life and professional commitments, combating stereotypes in a predominantly male-dominated field, facing and dealing with potential threats, etc. The life of a woman IPS officer is marked by rigorous training, demanding duty hours, and handling complex investigations. It also includes dealing with societal expectations and biases that come with being a woman in a male-dominated field. However, it is also fulfilling for those who aspire to make a difference and contribute to maintaining law and order in society. In conclusion, while both questions evaluate the lifestyles of people associated with the IPS, one does so from the family perspective, while the other examines the perspective of the officer herself. Hence, these questions are not paraphrases of each other as they intend to retrieve distinctly different information."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Back experts in the USA were worried that young students are having back and neck problems because they are carrying too much in their backpacks (schoolbags). \\"It hurts my back when I run,\\" said Eglin Reyes, a student in Virginia. \\"It's hard to get up the stairs with my backpack because it's too heavy.\\" Students have to carry heavy backpacks on their backs for a whole week's study. Beeline is one of them. They have regular backpacks with two straps to carry them, but a number of students with heavy loads have switched to rolling backpacks. The backpacks have wheels and can roll on the ground. Shirley Park's backpack weighs 10 kilos, and she said, \\"I'll change to a rolling backpack because I am starting to have back pain.\\" How much is too much? Experts say that students should carry no more than 10 to 15 percent of their own body weight. A few students have had a good idea to lighten the load: Less homework. Doctor's suggestions: *Lighten the load. Take home only the books the students need that night. *Wide straps are better. They can send out weight over your shoulders and be sure to wear backpacks with two straps. *The heaviest things should be packed closest to the back. *Bend both knees when you pick up the pack, don't just bend the waist . If a child carries a heavy school bag , _ A) his back and neck will be hurt B) his head and arms will be hurt C) his hands will be hurt D) his feet will be hurt A:","completion":"A: The problem of students carrying too much weight in their backpacks at school is indeed a concerning issue. Over the years, there has been a significant increase in the number of students experiencing back and neck problems due to the heavy load they carry in their school bags. This excessive weight can lead to chronic health issues and impact the overall well-being of the students. As mentioned in the example, Eglin Reyes, a student from Virginia, experiences difficulty in running and climbing stairs due to the heavy weight of his backpack. As a result, there has been a rising trend of students switching to rolling backpacks with wheels, enabling them to roll the bags on the ground, alleviating the stress on their backs and necks. Shirley Park, another student whose backpack weighs 10 kilos, has also decided to switch to a rolling backpack to prevent further back pain. Experts suggest that students should ideally carry no more than 10 to 15 percent of their body weight in their backpacks. Carrying more weight than this can increase the risk of developing back and neck problems, as the constant strain on these areas can lead to muscle pain, soreness, and posture issues. To minimize the risk of such problems, there are a few important suggestions that students can take into consideration: 1. Lighten the load: Students should only take home the books and materials they need for that night's homework or study, which will help reduce the overall backpack weight. 2. Using backpacks with wider straps: Wider straps help in distributing the weight more evenly across the shoulders, providing better support and reducing the pressure on the neck and back. A backpack with two straps is more beneficial than a single-strap bag. 3. Packing the heaviest items closest to the back: This ensures that the bulk of the weight is closer to the body, reducing the strain on the neck and back muscles. 4. Bending both knees when picking up the backpack: Instead of bending at the waist, students should bend both knees when lifting their bags, as this reduces the stress on the back muscles. In conclusion, the correct answer to the question is A) his back and neck will be hurt. A heavy school bag will most likely cause harm to a child's back and neck, as it places significant pressure and strain on these areas, potentially leading to long-term health issues. By following the suggestions provided by experts and adopting better practices in carrying backpacks, students can prevent or alleviate such problems."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

We have this problem: -k + 159*k = 164*k + 168 Let's think of the letter \\"k\\" as a bunch of apples! So, on the left side, we have -1 apple and 159 apples. If we combine them, we get 159 - 1 = 158 apples. So now our problem looks like this: 158*k = 164*k + 168 Now, let's move all the apples to one side! We can do that by taking away 158 apples from both sides of the equal sign: 158*k - 158*k = 164*k - 158*k This means: 0 = 6*k + 168 We now have 6 \\"k\\" apples on one side and 168 on the other. We want to find out how many apples equals one \\"k.\\" To do that, let's get rid of those 168 apples by taking them away from both sides: -168 = 6*k Now, let's find out how many apples one \\"k\\" equals by sharing the apples equally.

To do this, subtract 1425 from both sides of the equation. The equation now looks like: 99*l = -753 - 1425 Step 2: Simplify the right side of the equation. -753 - 1425 equals -2178. So the equation now looks like: 99*l = -2178 Step 3: Next, divide both sides of the equation by 99 to solve for l. l = -2178/99 Following these steps, the solution for l is: l = -22.

Short movie review: pap invested in undergraduate doubling subtexts and ridiculous stabs at existentialism reminding of the discovery of the wizard of god in the fifth trek flick . Did the critic thinking positively or negatively of the movie?","completion":"The critic seems to be thinking negatively of the movie as they used phrases that indicate criticism and dissatisfaction. Let's discuss the phrases one by one to better understand the negative sentiment. 1. \\"pap invested\\": \\"Pap\\" usually refers to something lacking value or being shallow. When the critic says the movie is \\"invested\\" in it, that implies the film dedicates a significant effort to something considered to be of little substance or depth. 2. \\"undergraduate doubling subtexts\\": This phrase suggests that the film engages with themes or messages that feel pretentious or overly academic without any genuine depth. The critic likens the subtexts to something an undergraduate might come up with, which is generally less refined and sophisticated than more experienced creators. 3. \\"ridiculous stabs at existentialism\\": This statement indicates that the movie attempts to tackle existential themes but does so in a way that comes across as absurd or laughable. The term \\"ridiculous\\" highlights the critic's disapproval and lack of belief in the film's attempt to portray existential concerns. 4. \\"discovery of the wizard of god in the fifth trek flick\\": This phrase most likely refers to a particular scene or plot point in the movie that seems contrived or unbelievable. By referencing a specific scene, the critic implies that the film is filled with such moments that are hard to take seriously. Overall, the critic's choice of words and phrases convey a negative perception of the movie. The critic believes that the film relies on shallow or unrefined concepts and takes itself too seriously while trying to explore existential themes, ultimately leading to an unsatisfying and unconvincing result."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Movie title: The Mexican Movie plot: The story follows Jerry Welbach (Brad Pitt) as he travels through Mexico to find a valuable antique gun, The Mexican, and smuggle it into the United States. Five years earlier, Welbach had caused a traffic accident in which he hit the car of local mobster Arnold Margolese (Gene Hackman), who was jailed for five years after the police searched his car following the crash, finding someone tied up in his trunk. In compensation for the jail time, Welbach has been sent on various errands by Margolese's prickly second-in-command, Bernie Nayman (Bob Balaban). Retrieving the gun will be his final errand. Welbach has a girlfriend, Samantha (Julia Roberts), with whom he argues constantly and who leaves Jerry prior to the trip over his lack of commitment to their relationship. Jerry arrives in Mexico and makes his way to pick up Beck (David Krumholtz), the Margolese employee now in possession of the gun. There, a drunken Beck tells Jerry about the gun's history as a suicide weapon used as part of a jilted love-triangle between a woman, a nobleman, and the son of the gunsmith who forged the weapon, as well as its curse to misfire. Jerry helps Beck to his car, only for the man to be killed by celebratory gunfire from a nearby festival. Panicked but determined, Jerry buries the body and then calls Bernie to report on the situation, only for his vehicle to be stolen while he makes the call, the gun still inside. Jerry briefly has an uncooperative donkey as transportation to follow the thief, then buys an old, damaged truck. Meanwhile, Samantha gets kidnapped by a hit man named Leroy (James Gandolfini), who tells her that Jerry hired him to make sure she is safe from anybody that wants her dead. It is then revealed that Leroy is gay, which doesn't bother Samantha. They pick up a postal worker named Frank (Michael Cerveris), who then has a relationship with Leroy.

Data collected from Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn is being used to help people who may be a suicide risk . The study is focusing on former military personnel in the U.S. where 22 veterans take their own lives every day, an average of one every 65 minutes, according to a recent government report. Doctors working on the Durkheim Project, which is supported by Facebook, are hoping that clues from social interaction will help care workers identify patients before they fatally harm themselves. Social media: Computer experts are looking for clues about the use of Twitter and Facebook by people at risk of killing themselves. The research is a joint venture by the predictive. analytics firm Patterns and Predictions and the Veterans Education and. Research Association of Northern New England. Last year, suicides among active members. of the military reached 349, more than those killed on duty and experts believe the military culture makes those at risk less. likely to ask for help or admit they need it. Dr. Craig J. Bryan, associate director of the. National Center for Veterans Studies at the University of Utah told NBC News: 'We do know factors that increase risk such as depression, but our best methods rely on. individuals telling us,' The Durkheim Project adviser, added: 'A lot of people who die by suicide. don't tell people they're thinking of it, so the difficulty is trying to. figure out if there are other indicators that go around this problem.' Clues: Researchers are analysing data from Twitter, Facebook to discover people most at risk of suicide. The study put together three groups using 300 anonymous medical records from the Veterans Administration - patients who killed themselves, those. under psychiatric care and those wanting treatment. Common issues showed up - troubled relationships, debt, job loss, post-traumatic stress, health issues and alienation. But computer experts discovered behaviour unique to patients who committed suicide by analysing the language in the medical reports. Project director Chris Poulin told NBC that the. project's consulting doctors who had treated veterans were surprised not. at the common behaviours, but that a. computer programme could detect often subtle clues from the medical. reports. Investigation: Computer experts hope 100,000 volunteers will take part in the project to identify suicide risks among the military1. 'The technology is trying to find the stories within the stories,' said Durkheim spokesman Gregory Peterson. The computers were alerted by certain language used by the former military personal such as loneliness or agitation. Findings will not be published for some time but the project hopes to get 100,000 volunteers to take part. Data will come from a variety of apps that will continuously upload the subjects' social media and mobile phone interactions. The project accepts that to really know more about what pushes patients to suicide, the researchers have to wait for people to die. Mr Poulin said: It's not a happy topic. I don't think we should back away from it just because it's taboo or so stressful, there's no negative intent there, no creepy objective. This is the cost of doing business in life-or-death research.'

No further progress was made until the 1970s. Pierre Fresnault-Deruelle then took a semiotics approach to the study of comics, analyzing text–image relations, page-level image relations, and image discontinuities, or what Scott McCloud later dubbed \\"closure\\". In 1987, Henri Vanlier introduced the term multicadre, or \\"multiframe\\", to refer to the comics a page as a semantic unit. By the 1990s, theorists such as Benoît Peeters and Thierry Groensteen turned attention to artists' poïetic creative choices. Thierry Smolderen and Harry Morgan have held relativistic views of the definition of comics, a medium that has taken various, equally valid forms over its history. Morgan sees comics as a subset of \\"les littératures dessinées\\" (or \\"drawn literatures\\"). French theory has come to give special attention to the page, in distinction from American theories such as McCloud's which focus on panel-to-panel transitions. Since the mid-2000s, Neil Cohn has begun analyzing how comics are understood using tools from cognitive science, extending beyond theory by using actual psychological and neuroscience experiments. This work has argued that sequential images and page layouts both use separate rule-bound \\"grammars\\" to be understood that extend beyond panel-to-panel transitions and categorical distinctions of types of layouts, and that the brain's comprehension of comics is similar to comprehending other domains, such as language and music.\\".

Poultry: \\"Poultry\\" is a term used for any kind of domesticated bird, captive-raised for its utility, and traditionally the word has been used to refer to wildfowl (Galliformes) and waterfowl (Anseriformes). \\"Poultry\\" can be defined as domestic fowls, including chickens, turkeys, geese and ducks, raised for the production of meat or eggs and the word is also used for the flesh of these birds used as food. The Encyclopædia Britannica lists the same bird groups but also includes guinea fowl and squabs (young pigeons). In R. D. Crawford's Poultry breeding and genetics, squabs are omitted but Japanese quail and common pheasant are added to the list, the latter frequently being bred in captivity and released into the wild. In his 1848 classic book on poultry, Ornamental and Domestic Poultry: Their History, and Management, Edmund Dixon included chapters on the peafowl, guinea fowl, mute swan, turkey, various types of geese, the muscovy duck, other ducks and all types of chickens including bantams. In colloquial speech, the term \\"fowl\\" is often used near-synonymously with \\"domesticated chicken\\" (Gallus gallus), or with \\"poultry\\" or even just \\"bird\\", and many languages do not distinguish between \\"poultry\\" and \\"fowl\\".

To understand this conclusion, let's break down the premise and hypothesis. Premise: \\"How many books they physically have in their warehouse has no relevance to me.\\" The premise suggests that the number of books in the warehouse is not important or relevant to the person making the statement. It implies that they do not care about the quantity of books in the warehouse, and it has no bearing on their interests or preferences. Hypothesis: \\"It matters to me the amount of books at the warehouse.\\" The hypothesis is the opposite of the premise, stating that the amount of books in the warehouse is essential to the person making the statement. It suggests that the person does care about the quantity of books and that it has significance to them. Since the premise and hypothesis hold opposing views about the importance of the number of books in the warehouse, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise. An entailment occurs when one statement logically follows from or is a necessary consequence of another statement. In this case, the hypothesis contradicts the premise and so cannot be logically derived from it.

To solve the problem: If the population of women is 50% of men, then we can represent this relationship as: W = 0.5M, where W is the population of women and M is the population of men. We need to find the population of men as a percentage of the population of women. So we need to find M/W. First, we'll solve for M in terms of W: M = 2W (since W = 0.5M, multiplying both sides by 2 gives M = 2W) Now we can find M/W: M/W = 2W/W = 2. Thus, the population of men is 2 times the population of women, which can be represented as a percentage by multiplying by 100: 2 * 100 = 200% Therefore, the population of men is 200% of the population of women."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Truman (May 8, 1884 - December 26, 1972) was an American statesman who served as the 33rd President of the United States (1945-1953), taking the office upon the death of Franklin D. Roosevelt. A World War I veteran, he assumed the presidency during the waning months of World War II and the beginning of the Cold War. He is known for implementing the Marshall Plan to rebuild the economy of Western Europe, for the establishment of the Truman Doctrine and NATO against Soviet and Chinese Communism, and for intervening in the Korean War. In domestic affairs, he was a moderate Democrat whose liberal proposals were a continuation of Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal, but the conservative-dominated Congress blocked most of them. After his wartime service, Truman returned to Independence, where he married Bess Wallace on June 28, 1919. The couple had one child, Mary Margaret Truman. Shortly before the wedding, Truman and Jacobson opened a haberdashery together at 104 West 12th Street in downtown Kansas City. After brief initial success, the store went bankrupt during the recession of 1921. Truman did not pay off the last of the debts from that venture until 1934, when he did so with the aid of a political supporter. Jacobson and Truman remained close friends, and Jacobson's advice to Truman on Zionism later played a role in the U.S. government's decision to recognize Israel. With the help of the Kansas City Democratic machine led by Tom Pendergast, Truman was elected in 1922 as County Court judge of Jackson County's eastern district--this was an administrative rather than judicial position, somewhat similar to county commissioners elsewhere. (At the time Jackson County elected a judge from the western district (Kansas City), one from the eastern district (Jackson County outside Kansas City), and a presiding judge elected countywide.) Truman was not re-elected in 1924, losing in a Republican wave led by President Calvin Coolidge's landslide election to a full term. Two years selling automobile club memberships convinced him that a public service career was safer for a family man approaching middle age, and he planned a run for presiding judge in 1926. In 1926, Truman was elected presiding judge with the support of the Pendergast machine, and he was re-elected in 1930. Truman helped coordinate the Ten Year Plan, which transformed Jackson County and the Kansas City skyline with new public works projects, including an extensive series of roads and construction of a new Wight and Wight-designed County Court building. Also in 1926, he became president of the National Old Trails Road Association (NOTRA). He oversaw the dedication in the late 1920s of a series of 12 Madonna of the Trail monuments honoring pioneer women, which were installed along the trail. In 1933, Harry S. Truman was named Missouri's director for the Federal Re-Employment program (part of the Civil Works Administration) at the request of Postmaster General James Farley. This was payback to Pendergast for delivering the Kansas City vote to Franklin D. Roosevelt in the 1932 presidential election. The appointment confirmed Pendergast's control over federal patronage jobs in Missouri and marked the zenith of his power. It also created a relationship between Truman and Roosevelt's aide Harry Hopkins and assured Truman's avid support for the New Deal.

Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers: muscle cells of the uterus become more sensitive to its effects. Oxytocin is continually released throughout childbirth through a positive feedback mechanism. As noted earlier, oxytocin prompts uterine contractions that push the fetal head toward the cervix. In response, cervical stretching stimulates additional oxytocin to be synthesized by the hypothalamus and released from the pituitary. This increases the intensity and effectiveness of uterine contractions and prompts additional dilation of the cervix. The feedback loop continues until birth. Although the mother’s high blood levels of oxytocin begin to decrease immediately following birth, oxytocin continues to play a role in maternal and newborn health. First, oxytocin is necessary for the milk ejection reflex (commonly referred to as “let-down”) in breastfeeding women. As the newborn begins suckling, sensory receptors in the nipples transmit signals to the hypothalamus. In response, oxytocin is secreted and released into the bloodstream. Within seconds, cells in the mother’s milk ducts contract, ejecting milk into the infant’s mouth. Secondly, in both males and females, oxytocin is thought to contribute to parent–newborn bonding, known as attachment. Oxytocin is also thought to be involved in feelings of love and closeness, as well as in the sexual response.

In 1992, she starred in Stand By Your Man, a Fox Network sitcom co-starring Melissa Gilbert. The show bombed, just as O'Donnell's movie career took off. O'Donnell made her feature film debut in A League of Their Own (1992) alongside Tom Hanks, Geena Davis, and Madonna. She was originally considered for the role of Mary Sanderson in Disney's Hocus Pocus, but it was ultimately given to Kathy Najimy. O'Donnell claimed on her blog that she turned down the offer to work with Bette Midler because she refused to portray a frightening evil witch. Throughout her career, she has taken on an eclectic range of roles: she appeared in Sleepless in Seattle as Meg Ryan's character's best friend; as Betty Rubble in the live-action film adaptation of The Flintstones with John Goodman, Elizabeth Perkins and Rick Moranis; as one of Timothy Hutton's co-stars in Beautiful Girls; as a federal agent comedically paired with Dan Aykroyd in Exit to Eden; as the voice of a tomboyish female gorilla named Terk in Disney's Tarzan; and as a baseball-loving nun in M.

Is Other types of lossy compressors, such as the linear predictive coding (LPC) used with speech, are source-based coders. a good answer to this question?","completion":"Yes, this is a good starting point for an answer to the question. However, a more detailed and extensive answer would provide an overview of models used for various sound generators, as well as a brief discussion on lossless and lossy compressors. Let's expand on the provided answer: A model of the sound's generator is utilized in various fields of audio processing, such as speech synthesis, audio compression, and music production. One of the most common uses of a model of a sound's generator is in lossy compression algorithms, which aim to reduce the size of audio data while maintaining an acceptable level of sound quality. Linear Predictive Coding (LPC) is one such source-based lossy compression algorithm. It uses a mathematical model to approximate the sound's generator, specifically in speech signals. LPC analyzes the human speech production mechanism to create a predictive model. It achieves this by trying to estimate the current speech sample based on previous speech samples, leading to a form of data compression. LPC has been widely used in telecommunications, speech synthesis, and various applications of speech recognition. For instance, LPC has been utilized in codecs like the Speex codec and GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications) standard for digital mobile phone calls. In addition to LPC, there are other lossy and lossless audio compression techniques used in various applications. Lossless compression, like the popular FLAC (Free Lossless Audio Codec), enables the original audio data to be perfectly reconstructed from the compressed data, preserving full audio quality. This technique is commonly used in archiving and professional audio applications. Lossy compression, on the other hand, removes some audio data considered less important to human perception, which generally results in smaller file sizes. The most well-known example of a lossy compression algorithm is MP3 (MPEG-1 Audio Layer 3), which uses a psychoacoustic model to determine and discard sound components that are harder for the human ear to hear. To summarize, while the analogy of the Linear Predictive Coding (LPC) model being used with speech as a source-based coder is accurate, it is only a part of a broader scope of audio processing techniques. Models of the sound's generator are employed in various compression algorithms, both lossless and lossy, and their specific applications range from telecommunications and music production to speech synthesis and recognition."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Given the question: Question: \\"Adult albatrosses can lose 2.9 ounces a day of weight from their what?\\" Context: \\"Incubation, which optimises temperature for chick development, usually begins after the last egg has been laid. In monogamous species incubation duties are often shared, whereas in polygamous species one parent is wholly responsible for incubation. Warmth from parents passes to the eggs through brood patches, areas of bare skin on the abdomen or breast of the incubating birds. Incubation can be an energetically demanding process; adult albatrosses, for instance, lose as much as 83 grams (2.9 oz) of body weight per day of incubation. The warmth for the incubation of the eggs of megapodes comes from the sun, decaying vegetation or volcanic sources. Incubation periods range from 10 days (in woodpeckers, cuckoos and passerine birds) to over 80 days (in albatrosses and kiwis).\\" Answer: The answer is:","completion":"Adult albatrosses can lose 2.9 ounces a day of weight from their body weight during incubation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Read the following paragraph and determine if the hypothesis is true: Bad Company is the debut studio album by the English hard rock supergroup Bad Company. The album was recorded at Headley Grange with Ronnie Lane's Mobile Studio in November 1973, and it was the first album released on Led Zeppelin's Swan Song Records label. Hypothesis: led zeppelin thought Bad Company was a classic album","completion":"Based on the information provided in the given paragraph, we cannot definitively determine if Led Zeppelin thought \\"Bad Company\\" was a classic album. However, there are a few points from the paragraph that we can use to infer some information about Led Zeppelin's opinion of the band Bad Company and their debut album. Firstly, the album \\"Bad Company\\" was recorded at Headley Grange with Ronnie Lane's Mobile Studio in November 1973. Headley Grange is a well-known location where several prominent bands, including Led Zeppelin, recorded some of their most iconic albums. The fact that Bad Company recorded their debut album at this historic location may suggest that Led Zeppelin, or people associated with them, saw potential in the band and thought highly of their abilities as musicians. Secondly, \\"Bad Company\\" was the first album released on Led Zeppelin's Swan Song Records label. This implies that Led Zeppelin, or at least the members managing the record label, believed in the band and their music enough to have them represent the launch of their new label. Led Zeppelin would not have likely signed the band and allowed them to release an album on their label if they did not have some level of confidence in the quality of their music. While these points do hint at Led Zeppelin having a favorable opinion of Bad Company and their debut album, there is no explicit evidence in the paragraph that clearly states that Led Zeppelin thought \\"Bad Company\\" was a classic album. It is possible that they saw potential in the band and liked their music enough to release their album on Swan Song Records, but that does not necessarily equate to considering the album a classic. In conclusion, based solely on the given paragraph, we cannot confirm that Led Zeppelin thought \\"Bad Company\\" was a classic album. However, the fact that they recorded at Headley Grange and that their debut album was the first release on Led Zeppelin's Swan Song Records label suggests that they did hold Bad Company and their music in high regard. To determine if they truly considered the album a classic, we would need more information or statements from the members of Led Zeppelin themselves."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

[1]. yes. [2]. it is not possible to tell. [3]. no.","completion":"[2]. It is not possible to tell. The original sentence states, \\"Three small girls laying in bed while two of them are under covers.\\" It informs us that there are three girls, all of them are laying in bed, and two of those girls are under the covers. However, the sentence does not provide information about the intentions of the girls, such as pretending to be in a fort, nor does it indicate the positioning of the third girl relative to the bed covers and whether she is laying on top or not. The second sentence, \\"Two small girls pretend they are in a fort in a bed while a third girl lays on top of the bed,\\" adds new information about the girls. It specifically claims that two of the girls are pretending to be in a fort and that the third girl is laying on top of the bed. Since there is no information about the girls' intentions or the exact position of the third girl in the original sentence, it is not possible to determine the truth of the second sentence from the first sentence alone. There might be some similarities between the two sentences in terms of the players involved (i.e., three small girls), but the additional information in the second sentence cannot be confirmed based on the original sentence.

Gershwin's compositions spanned both popular and classical genres, and his most popular melodies are widely known. Among his best-known works are the orchestral compositions Rhapsody in Blue (1924) and An American in Paris (1928), as well as the contemporary opera Porgy and Bess (1935). In 1913, Gershwin left school at the age of 15 and found his first job as a \\"song plugger\\". His employer was Jerome H. Remick and Company, a Detroit-based publishing firm with a branch office on New York City's Tin Pan Alley, and he earned 15 a week. His first published song was \\"When You Want 'Em, You Can't Get 'Em, When You've Got 'Em, You Don't Want 'Em\\" in 1916 when Gershwin was only 17 years old. It earned him 50 cents. In 1916, Gershwin started working for Aeolian Company and Standard Music Rolls in New York, recording and arranging. He produced dozens, if not hundreds, of rolls under his own and assumed names (pseudonyms attributed to Gershwin include Fred Murtha and Bert Wynn). He also recorded rolls of his own compositions for the Duo-Art and Welte-Mignon reproducing pianos. As well as recording piano rolls, Gershwin made a brief foray into vaudeville, accompanying both Nora Bayes and Louise Dresser on the piano. His 1917 novelty ragtime, \\"Rialto Ripples\\", was a commercial success. In 1919 he scored his first big national hit with his song, \\"Swanee\\", with words by Irving Caesar. Al Jolson, a famous Broadway singer of the day, heard Gershwin perform \\"Swanee\\" at a party and decided to sing it in one of his shows. In the late 1910s, Gershwin met songwriter and music director William Daly. The two collaborated on the Broadway musicals Piccadilly to Broadway (1920) and For Goodness' Sake (1922), and jointly composed the score for Our Nell (1923). This was the beginning of a long friendship. Daly was a frequent arranger, orchestrator and conductor of Gershwin's music, and Gershwin periodically turned to him for musical advice.

Math Problem Solve 273 = -20*x + 121 - 188 for x.","completion":"Alright, let's solve this math problem together, like a puzzle! We want to find out what number x is. Here's the problem: 273 = -20*x + 121 - 188 First, let's make the numbers on the right side of the \\"=\\" sign smaller. We have 121 - 188. If we subtract 188 from 121, we'll get -67.

To do that, we can add 67 to both sides of the \\"=\\" sign. On the right side, -67 + 67 will be 0, leaving just -20*x: 273 + 67 = -20*x When we add 273 and 67, we get 340: 340 = -20*x Now, we need to find out what number we should multiply -20 with to get 340. To do this, we'll divide both sides of the \\"=\\" sign by -20: 340 / (-20) = -20*x / (-20) When we divide 340 by -20, we get -17: -17 = x So, x equals -17!

Although the exact nature of the action is not specified, the essence of intentionality is present in both statements.

His Darwiniana was considered an important explanation of how religion and science were not necessarily mutually exclusive. Gray was adamant that a genetic connection must exist between all members of a species. He was also strongly opposed to the ideas of hybridization within one generation and special creation in the sense of its not allowing for evolution, as he felt evolution was guided by a Creator. Despite no longer having the burden of his professorial and garden duties, by the late 1870s the burden of maintaining himself as the pillar of American botany prevented Gray from the progress he desired on Synoptical Flora of North America, the follow-on to Flora of North America. This burden consisted of the fact that other scientists often only accepted Gray's word on a botanical matter, and the number of incoming specimens to identify was increasing vastly: numbers had to be assigned to them, collectors needed to be corresponded with, and preliminary papers had to be published. By the early 1880s, Gray's home was the center of everything to do with botany in America. Every aspiring botanist came to see him, even if just to look at him through his window. After turning over his non-research duties to Sargent, Goodale, Farlow, and Watson, Gray concentrated more on research and writing, especially on plant taxonomy, as well as lecturing around the country, largely promoting Darwinian ideas. Many of his lectures during this time were given at the Yale Divinity School. Liberty Hyde Bailey worked as Gray's herbarium assistant for two years during 1883-1884. In spring 1887 Gray and his wife made their last trip to Europe, this one for six months from April-October, primarily to see Hooker. Gray received the following advanced degrees: honorary degree of Master of Arts (1844) and Doctor of Laws (1875) from Harvard, and Doctor of Laws from Hamilton College (New York) (1860), McGill University (1884), and the University of Michigan (1887). Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: How many times did he team up with others?","completion":"Asa Gray was a very important plant scientist, or botanist, from America in the 1800s. He believed that all living things in a species are related to each other. He also believed that living things change and grow, and that God guides this process, which is called evolution. As more people wanted to learn about plants, Asa Gray's house became the main place where they would go. He would help them by organizing plant samples and answering their questions. Later on, he got some help from other plant scientists like Sargent, Goodale, Farlow, Watson, and Liberty Hyde Bailey. They helped him with his work so he could focus more on research and teaching. Asa Gray also traveled to Europe, and he received many special degrees from different universities for his work in botany. From the information above, we can't exactly say how many times he teamed up with others, but we know he worked with Sargent, Goodale, Farlow, Watson, and Liberty Hyde Bailey, and he also had a close relationship with Hooker."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Ted Cruz (15 percent), who rose from 8 percent in last month's survey. | AP Photo Trump rises, Carson collapses in Post/ABC poll Donald Trump has hit his highest level of support yet in a new Washington Post/ABC News poll of registered Republicans out Tuesday: 38 percent. Despite the widespread blowback over Trump’s proposal to ban Muslims from entering the U.S., GOP voters seem to like it: Trump’s support is up from 32 percent in November. (The poll, it should be noted, has a relatively small Republican sample, with a margin of error on the high side.) Story Continued Below Trump's support is 2½ times that of his nearest rival, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz (15 percent), who rose from 8 percent in last month's survey. Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson fell from 22 percent in November to 12 percent in December after a series of foreign policy gaffes and questions about his past. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio is tied with Carson at 12 percent and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush has 5 percent. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie has 4 percent. All other candidates are at 2 percent or less. Trump also polls the strongest on the question of who has the best chance of getting elected president: Nearly half of registered voters (47 percent) thought so. That number has gone up from 38 percent in November. Cruz follows Trump in electability with 15 percent, an increase from 6 percent last month, and Rubio has 14 percent, down from 17 percent in November. Bush has 8 percent, down 2 percentage points, and Carson — who had 22 percent in November — is now at 7 percent. Still, the majority of U.S. adults said they would feel “anxious” with a President Trump (69 percent), with 49 percent saying they would feel very anxious. Only 29 percent said they’d feel comfortable. One in two Americans (51 percent) would feel anxious with Hillary Clinton in the White House, and 47 percent would feel comfortable. The Post/ABC poll pushes Trump's national polling average up to 33 percent, double the support for Cruz. The telephone poll of 1,002 U.S. adults was conducted Dec. 10-13 with a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points. There were 851 registered voters, with a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points and 362 registered Republicans, with a margin of error of plus or minus 6 percentage points. ||||| Following his proposal to temporarily bar Muslims from entering the country, Donald Trump has increased his lead in the Republican primary to its largest margin yet, according to a new Washington Post-ABC News poll. The results are the latest sign that Trump’s outspoken comments on immigration and terrorism continue to find an audience among rank-and-file Republicans in spite of sharp condemnation from Democrats, GOP leaders, some of Trump’s rivals and a chorus of world leaders. The survey puts Trump’s support at 38 percent among registered Republicans and GOP-leaning independents, six points higher than in October and November. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, who also is running an anti-establishment campaign, has surged into second place with 15 percent, effectively doubling his support since last month. Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida and Ben Carson are tied for third, with 12 percent each. Carson, who with Trump was at the top of the field earlier this fall, saw his support cut roughly in half over the past month. No other candidate in the new poll registers in double digits. Former Florida governor Jeb Bush stands at 5 percent among registered Republicans. [Explore the complete results of the poll] At this point in the campaign, even with the first votes fewer than 50 days away, national polls are not always the reliable predictors of where presidential nominating contests are heading. At this time four years ago, former congressman Newt Gingrich was tied with eventual nominee Mitt Romney on the Republican side. Eight years ago, former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani led the GOP field, while Hillary Clinton held a wide lead over then-Sen. Barack Obama among Democrats. Giuliani and Clinton eventually lost. National surveys can change quickly and sometimes dramatically after voters in the early states begin to register their preferences. In Iowa, which kicks off the nominating season with caucuses on Feb. 1, Trump trailed Cruz in a Des Moines Register-Bloomberg Politics poll released over the weekend. Trump continues to lead in New Hampshire, which holds the first primary on Feb. 9, but that race has shown fluidity in recent weeks amid jockeying by a group of Republican candidates battling for establishment support. [Nasty conflicts in crowd at Trump’s Las Vegas rally] The Post-ABC survey isn’t all good news for Trump. In a hypothetical ­general-election race, Trump trails Clinton, the Democratic front-runner, by 53 percent to 40 percent among all adults and 50 percent to 44 percent among registered voters. The latter margin is within the range of sampling error. Beyond that, 69 percent of adults nationally say they would feel anxious with Trump as president, with 49 percent saying they would feel “strongly” so. That compares with just 29 percent of Americans who say they would feel comfortable. In contrast, 51 percent say they would feel anxious with Clinton in the Oval Office, compared with 47 percent who say they would feel comfortable. Regardless of how attitudes may change in the coming weeks, the survey underscores the degree to which Trump has dominated the GOP race in virtually all respects this year. He has skillfully used a megaphone through the media to spread his views on immigration and terrorism. He has tapped a vein of anger on the right, and he has been a relentless critic of any opponent who appears ready to challenge him. Condemnation came quickly to Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump's call to ban Muslims from entering the United States. Here are some notable comments. (Gillian Brockell/The Washington Post) The new poll was taken in the days immediately after Trump came under perhaps the heaviest criticism of the campaign. Early last week, he called for a ban on the entry of Muslims into the United States until U.S. officials could guarantee a more reliable process for screening out potential terrorists. As in other cases when he has made controversial or questionable statements, however, the widespread criticism of the billionaire reality TV star that followed did not result in any diminution his support among Republicans. That is in large part because 59 percent of Republicans agree with his proposed ban, even as 60 percent of all adults say it is the wrong thing to do. [Daily 202: Trump may benefit from focus on terrorism in tonight’s debate] Trump’s dominance over his GOP rivals nationally is seen throughout the poll. He holds huge leads over the other top candidates when it comes to whom Republicans see as the strongest leader in the field, who is most likely to bring change to Washington and who among the field has the best chance of winning a general election. On who is the strongest leader, 54 percent of Republicans and GOP-leaning independents cite Trump. On the question of who can best shake up Washington, 51 percent name Trump. On the question of who has the best chance of winning in the general election, 47 percent pick Trump. He enjoys 4-to-1 leads over the nearest candidate on strength and changing Washington and a 3-to-1 advantage on who can win. On two other attributes — honesty and personality — Trump is either first or second, but with only about a quarter of Republicans citing him. He is bunched closely with the four others — Cruz, Rubio, Carson and Bush — who make up the top five. After major terrorist attacks in Paris and San Bernardino, Calif., Republicans see terrorism as the most important issue in the election by a wide margin; it is cited by 38 percent, compared with 29 percent who name the economy and just 6 percent who highlight immigration. (Democrats rank the economy as the top issue.) Asked to choose which candidate among the top five they would trust most to deal with threats of terrorism, half of Republicans cite Trump. Half also say they would trust him to deal with immigration. The poll underscores the desire for change and the appeal of outsiders among Republican rank-and-file that has been a staple of this political year — though not among all Americans. Nationally, 57 percent of adults say they prefer someone with experience in the political system as the next president, while 37 percent say they prefer someone from outside the system. Among all Republicans, however, 58 percent say they want an outsider more than someone with political experience. Trump is the overwhelming choice for the nomination among this group. Trump leads among every demographic and ideological group of Republicans in the survey, but he has significantly greater support among those with less education and lower incomes and among men. He has the support of 46 percent of white Republicans without college degrees, compared with 29 percent among those with college degrees. Similarly, he does far better among GOP voters whose household incomes are below 50,000 than with those at 50,000 and above. Men are far more likely to say they support Trump than are women, with the gender gap larger than in previous surveys. Beneath Trump, the shifts in support suggest that many Republican voters are still weighing their options. Cruz’s rise to second in the Post-ABC poll parallels his even more dramatic surge in the Iowa poll. Carson’s decline, which has come amid questions about his foreign policy capabilities, has been reflected in state polls as well. Meanwhile, Rubio has held steady in Post-ABC polls over the past two months. The Post-ABC poll was conducted Thursday through SundayDec. 10-13 among a random national sample of 1,002 adults reached on conventional and cellular telephones. Overall results have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points. The error margin is plus or minus six points among the sample of 362 Republican and Republican-leaning registered voters. ||||| What is a summary?","completion":"Republican Presidential candidate Donald Trump has reached a new high of 38% support from registered Republicans in a recent Washington Post/ABC News poll, after his proposal to ban Muslims from entering the US. Despite widespread negative reactions to the proposal, his support increased from 32% in November. In comparison, Ted Cruz has 15% support, Ben Carson has 12%, and Jeb Bush has 5%. Interestingly, 69% of US adults said they would feel \\"anxious\\" with Trump as President, but 47% also feel more secure with him addressing terrorist threats.

Accompanied by his brother to the local open-air swimming pool, a restless Jake spots a 15-year-old girl named Vickie (Cathy Moriarty) at the edge of the pool.

Generate a question that has the following answer: Dathan for the following movie plot: Despite its epic scale, the Moses story takes up only about the first third of the film. After that, the story changes to a modern setting involving living by the lessons of the commandments. Two brothers make opposite decisions, one, John, to follow his mother's teaching of the Ten Commandments and become a poor carpenter, and the other, Danny, to break every one of them and rise to the top. The film shows his unchecked immorality to be momentarily gainful, but ultimately disastrous. A thoughtful contrast is made between the carpenter brother and his mother. The mother reads the story of Moses and emphasizes strict obedience and fear of God. The carpenter, however, reads from the New Testament story of Jesus's healing of lepers. His emphasis is on a loving and forgiving God. The film also shows the mother's strict lawful morality to be flawed in comparison to her son's version. Danny becomes a corrupt contractor who builds a church with shoddy concrete, pocketing the money saved and becoming very rich. One day, his mother comes to visit him at his work site, but the walls are becoming unstable due to the shaking of heavy trucks on nearby roads. One of the walls collapses on top of the mother, killing her. In her dying breath, she tells Danny that it is her fault for teaching him to fear God, when she should have taught him love. This sends Danny on a downward spiral as he attempts to right his wrongs and clear his conscience, but he only gets into more trouble. To make money, he steals pearls from his mistress, and when she fights back, he kills her. He attempts to flee to Mexico on a motorboat, but rough weather sends him off course and he crashes into a rocky island, where he is presumably killed.

White Dwarf: If the original star had a mass lower than or similar to that of the Sun, the final stage is a white dwarf. After the core has collapsed and the gases have dispersed, the remnants of the star's core continue to cool and shrink under the influence of gravity. This forms a dense and hot core called a white dwarf. A white dwarf is composed mostly of carbon and oxygen and is about the size of Earth. Its temperature is still extremely high, but as there is no more nuclear fusion happening, the white dwarf will slowly cool over billions of years, eventually becoming a cold, dark object called a black dwarf. However, black dwarfs are hypothetical, as the universe is not yet old enough for them to have formed. 2. Neutron Star: If the original star was more massive, around 1.4 to 3 times the mass of the Sun, the final stage is a neutron star. When the core collapses, the protons and electrons are compressed together with such immense pressure that they combine to form neutrons. The result is a small, dense, and rapidly spinning object called a neutron star. The extreme density and rotation lead to intense magnetic fields and the emission of radiation at the magnetic poles. Neutron stars can be observed as pulsars if their radiation beam is pointed towards Earth. Neutron stars are the densest objects in the universe, aside from black holes, with a mass close to that of our Sun and a diameter of only about 20 kilometers. 3. Black Hole: If the original star was even more massive, around three times the mass of the Sun or more, the final stage is a black hole. When such a massive core collapses, the gravitational force becomes so strong that even light cannot escape its pull. This creates an infinitely dense point in space known as a singularity, surrounded by an event horizon from which nothing can escape. Black holes can be observed indirectly through their impact on the surrounding environment, such as the accretion of matter and the emission of X-rays due to the immense gravitational pull. In summary, the final step of the outlined process involving a star burning in space, becoming a red giant, and going through the core collapse and gas dispersion phases, depends on the original mass of the star. The ultimate fate can be a white dwarf, neutron star, or black hole."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Article: Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell said yesterday he's concluded that no deal to raise the debt ceiling in return for serious spending restraint is possible with President Obama, and who can blame him? We've never thought the debt ceiling was the best leverage for a showdown over the entitlement state, and now it looks like Mr. Obama is trying to use it as a way to blame the GOP for the lousy economy. This may have been the President's strategy all along: Take the debt-limit talks behind closed doors, make major spending cuts seem possible in the early days, but then hammer Republicans publicly as the deadline nears for refusing to raise taxes on business and \\"the rich.\\" Related Video Peggy Noonan on the politics of the debt-limit debate. This would explain the President's newly discovered fondness for press conferences, which he has rarely held but now rolls out before negotiating sessions. It would also explain why Mr. Obama's tax demands have escalated as the August 2 deadline nears. Yesterday he played the Grandma Card, telling CBS that seniors may not get their August retirement checks. Next he'll send home the food inspectors and stop paying the troops. The reality is that Mr. Obama is trying to present Republicans with a Hobson's choice: Either repudiate their campaign pledge by raising taxes, or take the blame for any economic turmoil and government shutdown as the U.S. nears a debt default. In the former case Mr. Obama takes the tax issue off the table and demoralizes the tea party for 2012, and in the latter he makes Republicans share the blame for 9.2% unemployment. This is the political context in which to understand Mr. McConnell's proposal yesterday to force Mr. Obama to take ownership of any debt-limit increase. If the President still insists on a tax increase, then Republicans will walk away from the talks. Mr. McConnell would then let the President propose three debt-limit increases adding up to 2.5 trillion over the coming months. Senate Republicans (with Majority Leader Harry Reid's cooperation) would use a convoluted procedure to vote for three resolutions of disapproval on the bills. Mr. Obama could veto the resolutions and 34 Democrats could vote to sustain. The President would get his debt-limit increase, but without Republicans serving as his political wingmen. Enlarge Image Close Getty Images Senate Minority Leader Sen. Mitch McConnell The hotter precincts of the blogosphere were calling this a sellout yesterday, though they might want to think before they shout. The debt ceiling is going to be increased one way or another, and the only question has been what if anything Republicans could get in return. If Mr. Obama insists on a tax increase, and Republicans won't vote for one, then what's the alternative to Mr. McConnell's maneuver? Republicans who say they can use the debt limit to force Democrats to agree to a balanced budget amendment are dreaming. Such an amendment won't get the two-thirds vote to pass the Senate, but it would give every Democrat running for re-election next year a chance to vote for it and claim to be a fiscal conservative. We agree with those who say that Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner can cut other federal spending before he allows a technical default on U.S. debt. No doubt that is what he will do. We'd even support a showdown over technical default if we thought it might yield some major government reforms. But Mr. Obama clearly has no such intention. Related Video Opinion Journal columnist James Taranto on President Obama's news conference. Instead he and Mr. Geithner will gradually shut down government services, the more painful the better. The polls that now find that voters oppose a debt-limit increase will turn on a dime when Americans start learning that they won't get Social Security checks. Republicans will then run like they're fleeing the Pamplona bulls, and chaotic retreats are the ugliest kind. By then they might end up having to vote for a debt-limit increase and a tax increase. The tea party/talk-radio expectations for what Republicans can accomplish over the debt-limit showdown have always been unrealistic. As former Senator Phil Gramm once told us, never take a hostage you're not prepared to shoot. Republicans aren't prepared to stop a debt-limit increase because the political costs are unbearable. Republicans might have played this game better, but the truth is that Mr. Obama has more cards to play. The entitlement state can't be reformed by one house of Congress in one year against a determined President and Senate held by the other party. It requires more than one election. The Obama Democrats have staged a spending blowout to 24% of GDP and rising, and now they want to find a way to finance it to make it permanent. Those are the real stakes of 2012. Even if Mr. Obama gets his debt-limit increase without any spending cuts, he will pay a price for the privilege. He'll have reinforced his well-earned reputation as a spender with no modern peer. He'll own the record deficits and fast-rising debt. And he'll own the U.S. credit-rating downgrade to AA if Standard & Poor's so decides. We'd far prefer a bipartisan deal to cut spending and reform entitlements without a tax increase. But if Mr. Obama won't go along, there's no reason Republicans should help him dodge the political consequences by committing debt-limit harakiri. ||||| If you go onto Twitter or check some Web sites (right and left) you will find loads of chatter about the McConnell debt disapproval plan. Most of it is wrong. Members of the chattering class are so anxious to chatter that they feel compelled to do so without understanding the subject matter at hand. Throw in some bad faith (certain right-wing bloggers would declare the GOP leadership traitors if they proposed only 4 trillion in cuts and got President Obama to decline to run for reelection), add in some liberal suspicion (warranted since this is not the first time that Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has eaten their lunch), and presto: You get some of the worst “reporting” in recent memory. The concept isn’t that hard to understand. 1. McConnell had enough of the phony White House talks. The White House offered a paltry 2 billion in actual, immediate cuts. 2. McConnell gave a speech to make clear that wasn’t enough and that the debt limit would be raised only with real cuts and without tax hikes. 3. McConnell could sit back and wait for default. 4. But he comes up with a mechanism to force Obama to put up cuts, send them to Congress and face “default” if the president’s cuts don't get through. 5. In the process he makes 34 Democratic senators vote over and over again on cuts. (The sound you hear in the background is the conga line at the Senate Republican Committee headquarters.) There are no tax increases in the plan. The onus is on the president to send a request for a debt-ceiling increase and the cuts to go along with it. If he doesn’t do it or if the Congress disapproves of what he sends up (and sustains a veto) the debt ceiling remains in place. But the Senate Democrats will have the power to sustain a veto (and thereby allow phony cuts to be used to raise the debt ceiling), right? Which 34 senators exactly are going to do this? Certainly not the ones in unsafe seats with voters clamoring for real spending cuts. The critics who dimly understand the plan forget that the alternatives are limited. What are the alternatives? Default. Or accept the tax hike offer from the White House. Or maybe Obama will cave. McConnell is more than happy to keep on trying to get rid of the tax hikes and get the White House to cough up real spending cuts. But if there is no deal (grand or otherwise) then the default will not be on the shoulders of the Republicans. McConnell is providing them with a backstop to avoid default. If they don’t take it? Then the debt ceiling doesn’t go up. Ah well, time to prioritize the spending (and stop scaring granny that she won’t get her Social Security check). If there is a criticism of the McConnell plan it is that he vastly overestimated the ability of the political class to understand an out-of-the-box proposal. Maybe he could come up with a chart or a video. For now, expect another speech on the Senate floor tomorrow and some talk-radio appearances. And guess what? If no one likes the plan we can go back to the main ring, where Obama is offering only 2 billion in real spending cuts. ||||| The seed for this crawl was a list of every host in the Wayback Machine This crawl was run at a level 1 (URLs including their embeds, plus the URLs of all outbound links including their embeds) The WARC files associated with this crawl are not currently available to the general public. ||||| What is a summary?","completion":"The article talks about Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell saying that no deal to raise the debt ceiling for spending restraint is possible with President Obama. The author explains that President Obama might be trying to use this situation to blame the Republicans for a bad economy. They discuss how this situation puts Republicans in a difficult position, where they either have to break their promise by raising taxes or take the blame for any economic problems. The author also mentions a plan by McConnell to force President Obama to take responsibility for any increases in the debt limit. This plan would make President Obama propose three debt-limit increases, and then Republicans would vote on these proposals. The idea is to avoid a government shutdown and make sure the debt ceiling is increased while not letting Republicans take the blame for it."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: What is the final step of the following process: - Water comes through a filter - The filter has small pores to catch pollutants - The filter will catch chlorine, heavy metals, and other chemicals - The filter allows water and mineral ions like fluoride to pass through A:","completion":"The final step of the process is the filtered water, containing essential mineral ions like fluoride, passing through and being ready for consumption or use, free from harmful pollutants such as chlorine, heavy metals, and other chemicals."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A few seconds passed and the criminal put down his gun, turning his back on me. \\"Cut!\\" the director shouted with joy. One take! We had done the scene in just one take. Then all the people who acted in the film went off for lunch. I got my food and joined them, and the criminal, who had moments before been so scary, took his seat beside me and told us many funny jokes. A table of adults surrounded me, but I was never uncomfortable talking with strangers. I worked with these people and they worked with me. We talked, we laughed, we got to know each other and sometimes we became friends. At the end of the day we all went our separate ways, but we had been drawn close by working together to make this play. After the show was broadcast, my friends asked if I had been scared of the criminal. At first this sounded funny. He was, after all, a kind and intelligent man.

A young Saudi woman has begged a Yemeni court to allow her to stay in the country and marry the man she loves. In a case which has been compared to the plight of Shakespeare's star-crossed lovers Romeo and Juliet, Huda al-Niran, 22, defied her family and crossed the border illegally to be with Arafat Mohammed Tahar, 25. She has appeared in court and pleaded to be allowed to stay, as her supporters demonstrated outside the Sanaa courthouse, sporting headbands proclaiming 'We are all Huda.' A sticker showing Saudi woman Huda Abdullah Ali Al-Niran and Yemeni man Arafat Mohammed, outside a court in Sanaía, Yemen. In a case reminiscent of Shakespeare's star-crossed lovers Romeo and Juliet, Huda al-Niran, 22, (pictured) defied her family and crossed the border illegally to be with her beloved. The plight of the two lovers' has gripped audiences in deeply conservative Yemen and Saudi Arabia. Huda has defied both the wishes of her family, who said she could not marry Tahar, and also dared to flee the country and follow him to Yemen. In court, she refused to accept a lawyer provided by the Saudi embassy, fearing pressure to return home. But Huda did accept to be represented by a lawyer appointed by a Yemeni non-government organisation called Hood, who said he hoped for a favourable outcome. 'This is a humanitarian case, and must not raise tensions between the two countries,' lawyer Abdel Rakib al-Qadi told AFP.

He indicated that Sanaa had come under pressure from the Saudi authorities to ensure Huda's return. She is currently under arrest and on trial for illegal entry. If found guilty, she faces expulsion. No decision was announced on Sunday, and the court set the next hearing for December 1 as it awaited a UN High Commissioner for Refugees ruling on a request for asylum. A UNHCR representative confirmed to AFP that Huda had initiated proceedings to be granted refugee status in Yemen. If she succeeds, it will be difficult for the authorities in Yemen to expel her. Huda's case has also come to the attention of the New York-based Human Rights Watch. On November 19, HRW urged Yemen not to repatriate her and to take into consideration the fact that returning to her family could put her life at risk. 'She fears physical harm from her family members, whom she said have beaten her in the past, if she is returned to Saudi Arabia,' HRW said in a statement.

Help as much as you can. Given a question and a context passage, generate the answer having the word or phrase from the context passage. Here, the answer should be a shortest continous span from the passage. Q: Context: The chemical elements and water that are needed by living things keep recycling on Earth. They pass back and forth through biotic and abiotic components of ecosystems. Thats why their cycles are called biogeochemical cycles. For example, a chemical element or water might move from organisms (bio) to the atmosphere or ocean (geo) and back to organisms again. Elements or water may be held for various periods of time in different parts of a biogeochemical cycle. An exchange pool is part of a cycle that holds a substance for a short period of time. For example, the atmosphere is an exchange pool for water. It usually holds water (as water vapor) for just a few days. A reservoir is part of a cycle that holds a substance for a long period of time. For example, the ocean is a reservoir for water. It may hold water for thousands of years. The rest of this lesson describes three biogeochemical cycles: water cycle, carbon cycle, and nitrogen cycle. Water is an extremely important aspect of every ecosystem. Life cant exist without water. Most organisms contain a large amount of water, and many live in water. Therefore, the water cycle is essential to life on Earth. Water on Earth is billions of years old. However, individual water molecules keep moving through the water cycle. The water cycle is a global cycle. It takes place on, above, and below Earths surface, as shown in Figure 24.7. During the water cycle, water occurs in three different states: gas (water vapor), liquid (water), and solid (ice). Many processes are involved as water changes state to move through the cycle. Watch this video for an excellent visual introduction to the water cycle: . MEDIA Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL: Water changes to a gas by three different processes called evaporation, sublimation, and transpiration. Evaporation takes place when water on Earths surface changes to water vapor. The sun heats the water and gives water molecules enough energy to escape into the atmosphere. Most evaporation occurs from the surface of the ocean. Sublimation takes place when snow and ice on Earths surface change directly to water vapor without first melting to form liquid water. This also happens because of heat from the sun. Transpiration takes place when plants release water vapor through pores in their leaves called stomata. Rising air currents carry water vapor into the atmosphere. As the water vapor rises in the atmosphere, it cools and condenses. Condensation is the process in which water vapor changes to tiny droplets of liquid water. The water droplets may form clouds. If the droplets get big enough, they fall as precipitation. Precipitation is any form of water that falls from the atmosphere. It includes rain, snow, sleet, hail, and freezing rain. Most precipitation falls into the ocean. Eventually, this water evaporates again and repeats the water cycle. Some frozen precipitation becomes part of ice caps and glaciers. These masses of ice can store frozen water for hundreds of years or even longer. Condensation may also form fog or dew. Some living things, like the lizard in Figure 24.8, depend directly on these sources of liquid water. Precipitation that falls on land may flow over the surface of the ground. This water is called runoff. It may eventually flow into a body of water. Some precipitation that falls on land soaks into the ground. This water becomes groundwater. Groundwater may seep out of the ground at a spring or into a body of water such as the ocean. Some groundwater is taken up by plant roots. Some may flow deeper underground to an aquifer. An aquifer is an underground layer of rock that stores water. Water may be stored in an aquifer for thousands of years. The element carbon is the basis of all life on Earth. Biochemical compounds consist of chains of carbon atoms and just a few other elements. Like water, carbon is constantly recycled through the biotic and abiotic factors of ecosystems. The carbon cycle includes carbon in sedimentary rocks and fossil fuels under the ground, the ocean, the atmosphere, and living things Question: __process in which snow and ice change directly to water vapor A:","completion":"sublimation"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Hi there, little friend! Today, we are going to talk about the points that the Bucs, a football team, allowed the other team to score in a game. Sometimes, it's hard for even grown-ups to know how many points the Bucs allowed during a game, so buckle up and let's learn together! To understand how many points the Bucs allowed, first, let's learn about how points are scored in football games. Scoring a touchdown gets a team 6 points, kicking an extra point (field goal) is worth 1 point, completing a two-point conversion gets 2 points, and a field goal is worth 3 points. Just remember, counting points can be as simple as counting on your fingers! Now, coming back to the Bucs, they are a football team from Tampa Bay called the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. They wear really cool pirate-themed uniforms, and sometimes their fans dress up like pirates too! Isn't that so much fun? Okay, little buddy, it's time to reveal the magic number! To find out how many points the Bucs allowed in a particular game, we need to know when the game took place and who they played against. There are many games in a football season, so we need to make sure we get the right one. You can ask your mommy, daddy, or anyone who knows more about it to get the correct information. Once you know which game you want to find out about, you can look up the match score on the internet with the help of a grown-up, check the newspapers, or watch a highlight of that game on TV. You'll be able to see and count the points the Bucs allowed their opponents to score. But here's a little secret: there are so many games played and different scores that even as a helpful assistant, I'm unable to tell you how many points the Bucs allowed in a specific game without knowing which game you mean. But don't you worry! With the help of a grown-up, you can easily find the information you need, and they'll be so proud of you for being curious and wanting to learn.

Options: - oasis - surface of earth - countryside - mountains - bridge The answer is \\"surface of earth\\" because A:","completion":"The answer is indeed \\"surface of earth\\" because the desert is an environment where rocks are commonly found on the Earth's surface. Now, let's explore the reasoning behind this more in-depth: 1. Oasis: Although an oasis is typically found in the desert, it is not the primary location for finding rocks. An oasis is a small area that supports vegetation and wildlife due to the availability of water. The presence of water in an oasis can lead to the erosion and transportation of rocks, but it would not be considered a primary source for finding rocks in the desert landscape. 2. Surface of earth (correct answer): In the desert, rocks can be easily found on the Earth's surface. Deserts are characterized by their arid environment, which leaves the ground bare and exposed to various geological processes such as weathering, erosion, and sedimentation. As a result, rocks are prominently visible on the Earth's surface in deserts. These rocks can vary in size, shape, and composition depending on the local geology. 3. Countryside: The term \\"countryside\\" refers to rural areas that are typically characterized by agricultural lands, villages, and natural landscapes. While rocks can also be found in countryside settings, the question specifically asks about their location in the desert. Therefore, this option doesn't accurately address the context in which the rocks are found. 4. Mountains: Deserts can be located near mountain ranges or can have elevated areas within them. In such cases, rocks can indeed be found in the mountainous regions of the desert. However, this option is still less accurate than the \\"surface of earth\\" answer because it narrows the area to a specific type of terrain within the desert. In reality, rocks can be found across various terrains in desert environments – not just in mountainous regions. 5. Bridge: A bridge is an artificial structure that usually spans a body of water or an otherwise impassable area. It is not a natural component of the desert landscape where rocks would naturally be found. Bridges are built by humans and are not considered as representative of the typical desert geological settings. In conclusion, the correct answer in the context of the desert is \\"surface of earth\\" because it accurately identifies where rocks are most commonly found in the desert environment. Rocks are visible and abundant on the surface of deserts due to the arid conditions, limited vegetation, and geological processes that have a significant impact on the landscape."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Given the following context: The concert took place on Saturday, September 19, 1981, on the Great Lawn, the central open space of Central Park. The first spectators, many carrying chairs or picnic blankets, arrived at daybreak to secure a good spot. The Parks Department originally expected about 300,000 attendees. Although rain fell throughout the day and continued until the start of the concert, an estimated 500,000 audience members made this the seventh-largest concert attendance in the United States in history.The stage backdrop depicted an urban rooftop with water tank and air outlet, symbolic of New York's skyline. At twilight, the backing band went onstage, followed by New York's mayor, Ed Koch, who announced, \\"Ladies and gentlemen, Simon and Garfunkel!\\" The duo entered through a side stage door, took center stage amid audience applause, looked at each other and shook hands, and began the concert with their 1968 hit \\"Mrs. Robinson\\". After the second song, \\"Homeward Bound\\", Simon delivered a short speech which began, \\"Well, it's great to do a neighborhood concert.\\" He then thanked the police, the fire department, the park administration and finally Ed Koch. The audience booed at the mention of Koch but applauded as Simon continued. Simon & Garfunkel played twenty-one songs in total: ten by the duo, eight by Simon, one by Garfunkel, a cover of The Everly Brothers' \\"Wake Up Little Susie\\", and the medley version of \\"Maybellene\\". Each performer sang three songs alone, including one new song apiece. Garfunkel sang the Simon & Garfunkel classic \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water\\" and \\"April Come She Will\\", and \\"A Heart in New York\\", a song written by Gallagher and Lyle that appeared on his album Scissors Cut, which had been released the previous month.

Please answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who considered staging Il tabarro in combination with his own early work Le Villi? The one-act opera genre had become increasingly popular in Italy following the 1890 competition sponsored by publisher Edoardo Sonzogno for the best such work, which was won by the young Pietro Mascagni's Cavalleria rusticana. With Tosca essentially completed by November 1899, Puccini sought a new project. Among sources he considered, before proceeding with Madama Butterfly, were three works by French dramatist Alphonse Daudet that Puccini thought might be made into a trilogy of one-act operas.After Butterfly premiered in 1904, Puccini again had difficulty finding a new subject. He further considered the idea of composing three one-act operas to be performed together, but found his publisher, Giulio Ricordi, firmly opposed to such a project, convinced that it would be expensive to cast and produce. The composer then planned to work with his longtime librettist, Giuseppe Giacosa, on an opera about Marie Antoinette, a project frustrated by the librettist's illness. Puccini wrote in November 1905, \\"Will we go back to it? [Maria Antonietta] If I find three one-act works that suit me, I'll put off M.A.\\" Puccini pursued neither project, as Giacosa's illness led to his death in September 1906.In March 1907, Puccini wrote to Carlo Clausetti, Ricordi's representative in Naples, proposing three one-act operas based on scenes from stories by Russian novelist Maxim Gorky. By May the composer had set aside this proposal to concentrate on the project which became La fanciulla del West, although he did not wholly abandon the idea of a multiple-opera evening. His next idea in this vein, some years later, was for a two-opera bill, one tragic and one comic; he later expanded this to include a third opera with a mystic or religious tone. By November 1916 Puccini had completed the \\"tragic\\" element, which became Il tabarro, but he still lacked ideas for the other two works. He considered staging Il tabarro in combination with his own early work Le Villi, or with other two-act operas which might be used to round out the evening's...

The children were taken into government care after they showed up alone at the Southwest border. Most of the children are from Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala, and were fleeing drug cartels, gang violence and domestic abuse. The agency learned the 1,475 children could not be found after making follow-up calls to check on their safety, the committee was told. The news has raised concern that the children could fall into the hands of human traffickers or be used as laborers by people posing as relatives. “You are the worst foster parents in the world. You don’t even know where they are,” said Democratic Senator Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota. “We are failing. I don’t think there is any doubt about it. And when we fail kids, that makes me angry.” Since the dramatic surge of border crossings in 2013, the federal government has placed more than 180,000 unaccompanied minors with parents or other adult sponsors who are expected to care for the children and help them attend school while they seek legal status in immigration court. An AP investigation in 2016 found that more than two dozen of those children had been sent to homes where they were sexually assaulted, starved or forced to work for little or no pay. Since then, the Department Health and Human Services has boosted outreach to at-risk children deemed to need extra protection, and last year offered post-placement services to about one-third of unaccompanied minors. But advocates say it is hard to know how many minors may be in dangerous conditions, in part because some disappear before social workers can follow up with them, and they never show up in court. Republican Senator Rob Portman of Ohio gave HHS and the Department of Homeland Security until Monday to deliver a time frame for improving monitoring. “These kids, regardless of their immigration status, deserve to...

Hong Kong (CNN) -- The news that Alex Ferguson is stepping down as Manchester United manager after 26 trophy-laden seasons will be reverberating far beyond British shores Wednesday, and no more so than in Asia where the club has a huge following.

Could you please translate this to English?","completion":"And, ultimately, it is important not to start a conflict between large farms and small producers. The original text in Romanian highlights a crucial aspect regarding the relationship between large farms and small producers in the agricultural sector. The statement emphasizes the need for maintaining a harmonious coexistence, understanding, and cooperation between these two entities. Engaging in conflicts might lead to adverse consequences for both sectors and affect overall food production, which in turn, can impact the population that relies on their products. Large farms, due to their scale, often have the advantage of access to resources, advanced technologies, and established markets, which allows them to produce and sell goods at a lower cost. On the other hand, small producers often struggle to match the prices set by their larger counterparts. Consequently, this can result in an imbalance between the two sectors and might even lead small producers to shut their businesses. In ensuring a stable and flourishing agricultural industry, thus, it is essential to facilitate a healthy and cooperative relationship between large farms and small producers. One of the ways to avoid conflicts between these two sectors is to implement policies and programs that encourage collaboration and coexistence. For instance, governments can provide support mechanisms such as financial assistance, education, and training programs that target small producers, aiding them in improving their production efficiency and competitiveness. Such initiatives can help level the playing field for small producers when competing with large farms. Moreover, fostering collaboration between large farms and small producers can be achieved through the establishment of cooperatives or partnerships. This can enable small producers to benefit from the expertise, resources, and networks of large farms, and in turn, can provide the latter with a sustainable source of local produce. Additionally, joint marketing efforts and distribution networks can be established, ensuring better market access and improved bargaining power for both parties. In conclusion, avoiding conflicts between large farms and small producers is a vital aspect of ensuring a prosperous and sustainable agricultural industry. By implementing policies and programs that encourage cooperation, providing support to small producers, and fostering collaborative initiatives, both sectors can coexist harmoniously and contribute to a thriving agricultural landscape that benefits all stakeholders, including consumers."},{"prompt":"Question: Given the question \\"What can you learn from the dialogue?\\" and the answer \\"Jim is Frank's friend.\\", write a conversation that might have happened.

Now, let's simplify the equation: 1. When you multiply 0 by w (0*w), you get 0. So, the equation will now look like: -34 * w - 215 = -11. 2. Now we want to find 'w', so let's get all other numbers to the other side of the equation. Let's add 215 to both sides: -34 * w = -11 + 215 (We moved 215 to the other side to make it easier to find w.) 3. -11 + 215 is equal to 204. So, our equation looks like: -34 * w = 204. 4. Now, to find 'w', we should divide both sides of the equation by -34: w = 204 ÷ -34. 5. When we divide 204 by -34, we get: w = -6. And that's the answer! So, w is -6.

Dreamgirls, despite its fistful of Tony wins in an incredibly weak year on Broadway, has never been what one would call a jewel in the crown of stage musicals. However, that is not to say that in the right cinematic hands it could not be fleshed out and polished into something worthwhile on-screen. Unfortunately, what transfers to the screen is basically a slavishly faithful version of the stage hit with all of its inherent weaknesses intact. First, the score has never been one of the strong points of this production and the film does not change that factor. There are lots of songs (perhaps too many?), but few of them are especially memorable. The closest any come to catchy tunes are the title song and One Night Only - the much acclaimed And I Am Telling You That I Am Not Going is less a great song than it is a dramatic set piece for the character of Effie (Jennifer Hudson). The film is slick and technically well-produced, but the story and characters are surprisingly thin and lacking in any resonance. There is some interest in the opening moments, watching Jamie Foxx's Svengali-like manager manipulate his acts to the top, but that takes a back seat in the latter portion of the film, when the story conveniently tries to cast him as a villain, despite his having been right from a business stand-point for a good majority of the film. Beyonce Knowles is lovely and sings her songs perfectly well, but is stuck with a character who is basically all surface glitz. Anika Noni Rose as the third member of the Dreamgirls trio literally has nothing to do for the entire film. Eddie Murphy acquits himself well as a singer obviously based on James Brown, but the role is not especially meaty and ultimately has little impact. Foxx would seem ideal casting, but he seems oddly withdrawn and bored. The film's biggest selling point is surely former American Idol contestant/Oscar winner Jennifer Hudson in the central role of Effie White, the temperamental singer who gets booted from the group and makes a triumphant closing act return. For me, Effie has always been a big problem in both the show and the movie. The film obviously wants you to feel sorry for her and rather ham-handedly takes her side, but I have never been sure that this character deserves that kind of devotion. From the start, Effie conducts herself for the most part like an obnoxious, egotistical, self-centered diva, who is more interested in what everyone else can do for her rather than having much vested interest in the group of which she is a part. When she is booted from the group for her unprofessionalism and bad attitude, the charges are more than well-founded, but the stage show/film seem to think Effie should be cut unlimited slack simply because she has a great voice. Even though the film tries to soften some of Effie's harder edges to make her more likable, the charges still stand. Her story becomes more manipulative by suggesting she should have our further sympathy because she is an unwed mother struggling to raise her daughter - using the implication that (much like the talent card) motherhood immediately makes any behavior excusable. Indeed the only big effort the film makes to show Effie's mothering is to tell us about it and then include a scene where she barks at her daughter in the unemployment office, insists that the girl has \\"no father\\" and then refuse to look for gainful employment to support them since singing is all she knows. In the hands of a skillful actress, the gaps could perhaps have been remedied with technique and charisma. Unfortunately, Hudson is not that actress. She sings well, but the dialog-driven moments do not come naturally to her nor do high emotional moments. Effie's signature moment (the aforementioned And I Am Telling You... number) is well-sung by Hudson, but emotionally flat in the acting department. Effie is supposed to expressing her rage and desperation at her predicament, but Hudson comes off as a cabaret performer belting out a hot number. All in all, not quite the emotional highlight one expects. The latter portion of the film is basically a predictable melange of events that maneuver Foxx into Hudson's earlier position and allow her to strut back in and lord it over everyone. Foxx's criminal offenses in the film are undoubtedly par for the course of many struggling record producers, but the film's seeming implication that he has it coming because he helped usher in the disco era is rather ridiculous, not to mention pretentious and condescending, particularly coming from a film with all of the depth of a puddle. The end result is a faithful rendition of the stage hit, drained of emotion, energy or anything that can be described as dynamic.

All is going as planned until Connie's sister, Kate, her investment broker husband, Roman Craig, and their twin daughters, Mara and Cara, crash the vacation. Ghost stories at the family BBQ include one of a man-eating grizzly bear that Chet met face-to-face when he was younger. Chet says that while he and Connie were honeymooning at the same lake, he was attacked by a giant grizzly bear. When he fired at it with a shotgun, the buckshot shaved the hair off the top of the bear's head and from that day on, it was known as the \\"Bald-Headed Bear\\" of Claire County. After Roman pulls Chet around the lake on an impromptu water ski ride with his rented speedboat, tensions between the families erupt. Chet is ready to pack up and go home, even as his teenage son Buck tries to romance a local girl, Cammie.

Buck tries to apologize to Cammie for being late, but Cammie refuses to speak to him. Connie and Kate bond at a local bar when the conversation drifts to Kate's challenges of being wealthy.

Jeffrey has recently bought an emu from Brian and needs help, because pick from the following. --Jeffrey knows nothing about emus. --Brian knows nothing about emus.","completion":"Jeffrey knows nothing about emus. When Jeffrey drove back to his property with the newly acquired emu in tow, he was filled with excitement and anticipation. As he unloaded the tall, quirky looking bird from its enclosure, he realized that he had very little knowledge about emus. While his friend Brian had managed to convince him that owning an emu would be a fantastic and unique experience, neither of them possessed any substantial expertise in emu care. At once, Jeffrey began to worry that he might not be capable of providing the appropriate care for his new feathered friend. Determined to make the best of the situation, he quickly decided that he would need to learn everything there was to know about emus in order to ensure he could provide a happy and healthy life for the bird. He set himself a mission: to become an emu expert in record time. Jeffrey started by conducting extensive research online and by contacting local wildlife centers. As he learned more about emus, he discovered that they are actually the second-largest living bird by height, after the ostrich. Despite their massive size, with powerful legs and the ability to run at close to 30 mph, emus are surprisingly gentle and docile creatures, making them ideal as pets on large properties. Jeffrey also learned about their diet, which consists of a variety of plants, fruits, insects, and small creatures such as mice. One important aspect of emu care is to ensure that they have plenty of access to clean, fresh water throughout the day. Jeffrey set up a large container to hold water on his property and made sure that he would refill it daily for his emu to drink and occasionally bathe in it. Jeffrey's research also focused on the habitat requirements for the bird. He learned that emus require a large, open space to roam, so he designated a suitable fenced area on his property that would keep the emu both safe and happy. He also created a shelter for the emu to escape from harsh weather conditions or to rest and sleep at night. This custom-built shelter consisted of a three-walled structure with a roof, ensuring that the emu was always protected from wind, sun, and rain. As Jeffrey dug deeper into emu care, he discovered the importance of regular veterinary checkups. Finding a reliable and experienced vet who specialized in emus was a challenge, but eventually, Jeffrey found one in a nearby town. He then made arrangements for the vet to visit his property regularly, ensuring that the emu's health would always be his topmost priority. Keeping an emu as a pet also requires proper permits and licenses, which Jeffrey promptly applied for. He submitted the necessary paperwork to the appropriate authorities and ensured that he was abiding by all the legal requirements and regulations associated with owning an emu. Over time, Jeffrey became an emu expert, which allowed him to provide the birds with the optimal care they needed to thrive. Soon, his emu became the talk of the town, and people would visit his property to catch a glimpse of the majestic and unusual creature. Jeffrey's dedication to learning how to properly care for his emu resulted in a deep bond between him and the bird. His beloved emu, which he named Eric, grew to trust and love Jeffrey in return. Together, they lived happily on the sprawling property, enjoying each other's company and the unique, captivating experience of a man and his emu."},{"prompt":"Teacher:In this task, you're given a pair of sentences in the Persian Language written in the Persian alphabet.

Article: Spending beyond one's means is becoming a national problem for Americans.Borrowing has become so easy that it takes great willpower for people to refuse it.\\"I received a number of gold MasterCard and gold Visa card offers in the mail during the past two months,\\"said one computer engineer at AT &T Bell Laboratories in Chicago.\\"I got three of them in one day last week.\\" Lenders are providing easy credit for borrowers.Many banks now offer every borrower a great variety of credit,a service once offered almost only to big companies.Norwest Bank Minneapolis offers lending programs for cars and boats that can cut monthly payments nearly m half .Carmakers,too,are lengthening easier terms.Ford Motor Credit states that 45 % of its recent lendings has been for sixty months,rather than the sixty-six-month period that was usual before. The total consumer debt in the United States rose 73 percent between 1974 and 1984,as the debt for each man,woman,and child increased from 10,264 to 26,566.Huge debt now is present in our economy at all levels.As a nation,we are more than 7 trillion in debt,and the total keeps increasing astonishingly. As we have over borrowed,so have we overspent.In late 986,the share of after-tax income that Americans saved sank below 2 percent for a short time,less than half the figure at which we saved only 10 years ago.Americans now are buying from foreigners between about 50 and 100 billion more Mercedes and Toyotas, Paris fashions,and tours to Europe than the Boeing 747s, agriculture machinery , or Kansas wheat that the foreigners bought from America. The country could not produce and pay for all the things it wanted. To make a long story short, we Americans have serious problems in keeping down spending and keeping up personal savings.It is high time for us American people to learn the basics of long-term money management.

The dog's owner, an attractive young woman, seduces Ace to avoid paying the detective's fee- a feat that Ace hardly resists.Late in the night at Miami Stadium, a group of individuals break in and steal the Miami Dolphins' mascot- a trained dolphin named Snowflake. Next morning, the Dolphin's Head of Operations Roger Podacter (Troy Evans) and his Chief Publicist named Melissa Robinson (Courtney Cox) are instructed to find the missing Snowflake before the upcoming Super Bowl (out of fear that the theft will affect the superstitious football players). A member of their staff was previously a client of Ace Ventura so they decide to call in this \\"pet detective\\" in to try investigating.Meanwhile, Ace is trying to capture a rare bird with a reward of 25,000 with no success. After receiving the request from Melissa to investigate, Ace goes to the stadium and takes a look inside Snowflake's tank, finding a small stone in the filter system. Roger spots a team of reporters heading to the tank and is worried (fearing the negative press that would result from knowledge of Snowflake's abduction). Ace poses as an eccentric animal trainer and manages to drive the reporters (Antoni Corone and Margo Peace) away.Later that day, Ace Ventura stops in at the local police headquarters. After an altercation with Sgt. Aguado (John Capodice), Ace meets his friend Detective Emilio (Tone Loc) to find out what leads the police may have. Emilio admits that a missing animal case isn't a priority for the police but they suspect that one of the local animal rights groups, who have repeatedly protested the Miami Dolphin's ownership of Snowflake, may be responsible. At this point, Emilio's superior, attractive female Lt.

Later, while he is in the bathroom, she hears screams outside and goes naked to the window. Seeing a man attacking a young woman, she opens the window and the assailant runs away. When the media report the murder of a young woman near Terry's flat that night, he thinks the police should know what Sylvia saw but, to protect her, claims he was at the bedroom window. At a police lineup, neither he nor the victim Denise is able to pick out the attacker Carl. Despite the feeble evidence against him, Carl is put on trial for the assault and during the proceedings his lawyer proves that since Terry is short-sighted he could not have witnessed the incident. Carl goes free, leaving not only the police and the prosecution but also Denise and Sylvia aghast at Terry's ineptness. In the courtroom, Carl recognised Sylvia as the woman at the window. Desperate to warn her, Terry finds her at a ballet performance and tells her she must go to the police, but she refuses all further involvement. As he leaves, he sees Carl's distinctive truck parked outside and rushes in again. He is too late, however, for in the dark she has been stabbed fatally and dies in Terry's arms.

The first question: \\"Why do smokers not care about non-smokers around them and smoke freely in public domain?\\" focuses on the disregard some smokers may have for the well-being or comfort of non-smokers when they choose to smoke in public areas. This question addresses the issue of secondhand smoke, which can have harmful effects on bystanders who are exposed to it.

The second question: \\"Why don't smokers think that smoking is a bad habit?\\" delves into the personal views and beliefs of smokers concerning their own habit. This question is about the understanding or perception smokers might have of the negative consequences of smoking, such as the risk of developing serious health issues, addiction, and the financial burden it can cause.

Last summer, when arguably Europe's most talented youngster was bought by Chelsea for 50m, the future looked so bright. The newly crowned European champions made a blistering start to the English Premier League season, with the Belgian the focal point for Chelsea as they wowed critics and fans alike with some wonderfully inventive football. Fast forward six months and the 22-year-old Hazard, who earns a reported 270,000 a week, was reduced to kicking a ball boy as Chelsea's season took another turn for the worse. It had been a frustrating night for Hazard. For more than an hour he had tried but failed to get his team Chelsea out of a big hole as the London team desperately attempted to turn their season round in a cup match against Welsh side Swansea City. But when a 17-year-old ball boy decided it was time to engage in some time wasting -- he lay on the ball after it had gone out of play -- the red mist descended over Hazard. The Belgian, whose modus operandi as a player is more sumptuous flicks and stepovers than sly skullduggery, aimed a kick at the youngster's midriff. Cue bedlam. Hazard, who had previously never been sent off in his professional career, was red carded by the referee, South Wales Police briefly contemplated pressing charges and Chelsea -- not for the first time this season -- were facing a public relations disaster of their own making. \\"The boy put his whole body onto the ball and I was just trying to kick the ball and I think I kicked the ball and not the boy,\\" Hazard told the Chelsea website. \\"I apologise. \\"The ball boy came in the changing room and we had a quick chat and I apologised and the boy apologised as well, and it is over. Sorry.\\" Too late. The British media and social media website Twitter had already gone into overdrive. \\"Football's fresh shame,\\" was the verdict of the Daily Mail -- a reference to English football's continuing ability to attract the wrong headlines -- while Manchester United defender Rio Ferdinand tweeted: \\"I'm not the authorities but in my eyes it's a red for all those asking. Us players do put refs in bad spots at times unfortunately!\\" Immediately after the sending off, Hazard did find support -- from Chelsea's official Twitter account. \\"Has football gone mad? Hazard is sent off for kicking the ball under a ball boy attempting to smother the ball rather than return it,\\" the club wrote on the account, which has over 1.79 million followers. However, Chelsea quickly sent a more diplomatic tweet: \\"Apologies for earlier ballboy tweet. Hazard has now met with the ballboy and has said sorry.\\" If initially Hazard was condemned for actions, he also won plenty of support, with the ball boy -- reported by the British media to be the son of millionaire businessman who sits on the Swansea board -- coming in for plenty of criticism. \\"After reviewing last nights footage, I've come to the conclusion that the games gone,\\" tweeted Marseille midfielder Joey Barton, who has nearly two million Twitter followers. \\"Ballboys aged 17, time wasting, then rollin round like ..they've been shot. Games gone. He was actually claiming to be best time waster in the world on twitter yesterday! What's that all about? ... Hazard only crime is he hasn't kicked him hard enough.\\" After the game Hazard apologized to the 17-year-old ball boy, who also said sorry to the Chelsea forward, though the Belgian is likely to be banned for a minimum of three games by the English Football Association for lashing out in the way he did. More woe for Chelsea boss Benitez. The ball boy furore is the last thing under pressure Chelsea interim manager Rafa Benitez needs just now. Hazard's kick and red card is just the latest in series of setbacks following the club's exit from the European Champions League and its dismal league form which has seen the London team fall 11 points off the lead, leaving Chelsea to focus on cup competitions -- the FA Cup and the Europa League. The Hazard incident overshadowed Swansea's achievement of reaching a first major cup final in its 100-year history after their 2-0 aggregate win over Chelsea. The Welsh club, which almost went out of the Football League 10 years ago, will now face fourth-tier Bradford City in the League Cup final at Wembley on February 24. \\"Over two legs Chelsea had the ball more than us,\\" said Swansea manager Michael Laudrup. \\"That is normal, that is Chelsea, but today they didn't really have any good chances. We had some good chances. \\"They had to score at least two but to be honest we deserved it. They didn't score once in 180 minutes. Minnow Bradford in fairytale triumph. \\"What Bradford has done - there are no words. They have beaten three Premier League teams, it is marvelous. If I had a hat on I would take it off.\\" In the Premier League, Arsenal thrashed West Ham 5-1 at Emirates Stadium. Olivier Giroud scored twice, while Lukas Podolski, Santi Cazorla and Theo Walcott were also on target for the Gunners. Arsene Wenger's men are now four points off fourth place which holds the coveted prize of Champions League football. In Spain, Real Madrid booked its place in the last four of the Copa del Rey, despite being reduced to nine men during the 1-1 draw at Valencia. Leading 2-0 from the first leg, Real opened the scoring a minute before the break through Karim Benzema. Alberto Costa's 52nd minute strike brought the home side level before Fabio Coentrao and Angel Di Maria were sent off. Jose Mourinho's side will play Malaga or league leader Barcelona in the next round. In the night's other tie, Sevilla cruised past nine-man Real Zaragoza 4-0 thanks to two goals from Alvaro Negredo. Ronaldo inspires Real Madrid. Zaragoza lost defender Jose Fernandez to a straight red card after 26 minutes before Fran Gonzalez followed him down the tunnel 40 minutes later. Spain striker Negredo fired his side ahead after 36 minutes before Ivan Rakitic doubled Sevilla's advantage. Negredo netted his second from the spot before Manu del Moral completed the rout to set up a last-four clash with either Atletico Madrid or fierce rival Real Betis. In Italy, AS Roma claimed a 2-1 win over Inter Milan in the first leg of its Coppa Italia semifinal. Alessandro Florenzi headed home Ivan Peris' cross on 13 minutes with Mattia Destro adding a second. Inter pulled goal back just before the break when Rodrido Palacio latched on to Esteban Cambiasso's free-kick and fired into the net. Swansea star helps the homeless.

Please answer the following question: Process: - You breathe in - Air goes through all the little branches in your lungs to fill up the air sacs, or alveoli - Oxygen goes through the walls of the alveoli and into the capillaries - The oxygen goes into the bloodstream - Oxygen is left and carbon dioxide is picked up - You breathe it out through your lungs - Perturbation hypothesis: suppose less air is breathed in happens, how will it affect a SMALLER amount of oxygen being delivered to the blood stream. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"Yes, the perturbation hypothesis you proposed, wherein less air is breathed in, does have a direct effect on the process of oxygen delivery to the bloodstream. If less air is breathed in, there will be a smaller amount of oxygen available in the lungs to make the exchange at the alveoli. Consequently, the following effects can be observed: 1. Decreased oxygen exchange: When a smaller amount of air is inhaled, fewer alveoli are filled with oxygen. This leads to a reduced surface area available for oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange between the alveoli and the capillaries. 2. Reduced oxygen saturation in the blood: Due to the decreased oxygen exchange, there will be less oxygen diffusing into the bloodstream. The red blood cells' hemoglobin will not be fully saturated with oxygen, leading to a lower oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood. 3. Insufficient oxygen supply to tissues: As the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood is lowered, the delivery of oxygen to various tissues and cells throughout the body is also compromised. This can lead to reduced cellular functions, energy production, and overall bodily performance. 4. Compensatory mechanisms: The body tries to compensate for the reduced oxygen intake by increasing the breathing rate and heart rate in an attempt to bring more oxygen into the lungs and to circulate it throughout the body. However, these compensatory mechanisms may not always be sufficient to meet the body's oxygen demands. 5. Potential long-term effects: If the perturbation persists over an extended period, it could lead to chronic hypoxia, a state where the body does not receive an adequate oxygen supply. Chronic hypoxia can result in various health conditions such as fatigue, shortness of breath, impaired cognitive function, and could potentially lead to more severe consequences like organ damage. In summary, the perturbation hypothesis wherein less air is breathed in directly affects the process of oxygen delivery to the bloodstream and can have significant consequences on the body's function and overall health."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Given the question: Process: - The sun gives off radiation - The radiation is aborbed by the Earth - Some of the radiation goes back into space - Some is trapped by the atmosphere - If too much heat is trapped - Global warming occurs. Question: suppose hurting mitosis to proceed normally happens, how will it affect a SMALLER greenhouse effect. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect The answer is:","completion":"The question you have provided is a bit confusing, as it seems to combine two unrelated topics: the greenhouse effect (or global warming) and the perturbation of mitosis. I will try to address both of these topics separately, and then discuss the potential connection between them based on the question. First, let's discuss the greenhouse effect. As you correctly mentioned, the process can be described as follows: 1. The sun emits radiation. 2. Earth absorbs this radiation and emits some of it back toward space. 3. Some of this outgoing radiation is trapped by the atmosphere (due to greenhouse gases), which causes the planet to warm. 4. If too much heat is trapped, global warming occurs. Now, let's discuss mitosis. Mitosis is the process in which a cell divides into two daughter cells. It is a critical aspect of growth, development, and repair in multicellular organisms. Any disruptions to the normal process of mitosis can lead to various diseases, including cancer. You asked how \\"hurting mitosis to proceed normally\\" would affect a smaller greenhouse effect, and whether it leads to more, less, or no effect. If I interpret your question correctly, you are asking if a disruption in the process of mitosis could somehow influence the greenhouse effect and global warming. There is no direct connection between the cellular process of mitosis and the greenhouse effect. As such, any perturbation or disruption in the mitosis process would likely have no effect on the greenhouse effect or global warming. These two phenomena operate on vastly different levels of biological and environmental organization. However, it is essential to mention that the implications of large-scale disruptions to the normal process of mitosis could have indirect impacts on global well-being and sustainability. For example, organisms affected by abnormal mitosis could experience population declines, which might alter ecosystem dynamics and have shared consequences for the planet. But these changes would not directly impact the greenhouse effect or global warming itself. In conclusion, based on the information provided and the two topics being unrelated, a disruption in the process of mitosis would have no direct effect on the greenhouse effect or global warming."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Second question: How do the beliefs of the atomic theory from Democritus and Aristotle differ? Are these two questions asking the same thing? OPT: (A). no (B). yes","completion":"First question: How did Aristotle's and Galileo's theories of motion differed from each other? Aristotle's and Galileo's theories of motion have considerable differences, mainly because of their distinct approaches and the time periods they were developed. Aristotle's theory of motion (Aristotelian motion) was based on his observations and philosophical thoughts during the 4th century BCE. In his theory, he proposed several key ideas: 1. Natural motion: According to Aristotle, objects have a natural state they strive to achieve. For example, he believed that a rock falls to the ground because its natural place is the Earth's surface. 2. Forced motion: Aristotle stated that an object only continues to move when there is a continuous force applied to it, such as a person pushing a cart. Once the force stops, the movement also stops. 3. Motion is regarded as a combination of matter and form. Aristotle believed that objects moved due to a balance between their internal properties (matter and form) and external influences (natural forces). On the other hand, Galileo Galilei, an Italian scientist born in the 16th century, came up with his theory of motion based on experiments and empirical evidence. He proposed the following concepts, which significantly differed from Aristotle's views: 1. Inertia: Galileo postulated that an object in motion stays in motion, and an object at rest stays at rest unless an external force acts upon it. The concept of inertia suggested that it isn't necessary for a constant force to be applied to maintain motion. 2. Uniform motion: Galileo studied objects falling (free fall) and the inclined plane to understand the natural behavior of objects in motion. He discovered that objects in free fall accelerate at a constant rate, regardless of their mass. 3. Galileo also investigated pendulum motion and, as a result, made significant contributions to the development of theories on momentum and kinetic energy. Second question: How do the beliefs of the atomic theory from Democritus and Aristotle differ? Democritus and Aristotle had contrasting views on the atomic theory. Democritus, a Greek philosopher born in the 5th century BCE, introduced the idea of indivisible and eternal particles called \\"atoms.\\" According to Democritus: 1. Atoms are the fundamental building blocks of the universe and exist in various shapes and sizes. 2. Atoms combine in different configurations and ratios to create various compounds and elements. 3. Void or empty space exists between atoms, making it possible for them to move. In contrast, Aristotle disagreed with Democritus' atomic theory and proposed a distinct concept called the four-element theory. According to Aristotle: 1. All matter is composed of four basic elements: earth, water, air, and fire. 2. These elements can be transformed into one another through a process called \\"substantial change\\". 3. Aristotle dismissed the existence of void and believed that there is no empty space between the elements. As seen, these questions are not asking the same thing. The first question is about the differences between Aristotle's and Galileo's theories of motion, while the second question compares the beliefs in atomic theory by Democritus and Aristotle. Therefore, the answer is: (A). no"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Siyasi analistler bölünmüş durumda. Could you please translate this to English?","completion":"The sentence \\"Siyasi analistler bölünmüş durumda.\\" translates to \\"Political analysts are divided.\\" in English. In a more detailed explanation, this sentence essentially highlights that political analysts have differing opinions, viewpoints, or interpretations about a specific political issue, event, or policy. These experts in political science may have disagreements stemming from the data they use, the theoretical framework they employ, or the arguments they put forth. It is common for political analysts to be divided as political opinions can be subjective, and different cases and contexts may lead to diverse conclusions. Depending on the political issue in question, the degree of disagreement can range from minor to significant. For example, two political analysts may have opposing predictions about the outcomes of an election or the impact of a new policy. Additionally, these divisions could be because of the analysts' own ideological stance or the methodology they choose to adopt. Furthermore, these disagreements may be influenced by the social, economic, or historical background of the analysts. These factors could influence the perspectives that analysts bring to the table when analyzing a political issue, leading to different theories, conclusions, or policy recommendations. Also, the nature and scope of political analysis play a role in the divisions among political analysts. Political analysis is an expansive field, encompassing various sub-disciplines such as comparative politics, international relations, political economy, and political philosophy. With each sub-discipline containing its own set of theories and methodologies, it is natural for political analysts to reflect these differences in their analyses. In conclusion, the sentence \\"Siyasi analistler bölünmüş durumda.\\" emphasizes that political analysts have disagreeing standpoints regarding a particular political matter. This division can be because of various factors such as the analysts' backgrounds, theoretical framework, ideology, as well as the nature of political science as a diverse and encompassing discipline. Differences and disagreements are expected in this field, and they contribute to the richness and growth of political analysis."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Please answer the following question: SEOUL — South Korean Foreign Minister Kang, Kyung-wha said on Wednesday that the U.S. and South Korea jointly made the decision to suspend combined military exercises scheduled for August, but would not confirm if her government was given advanced notice before U.S. President Trump announced his intention to cancel the drills, after he met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore on June 12. “We have made it clear that this is a goodwill gesture to strengthen the dialogue momentum at this point, but they are not irreversible. They could quickly come back should we see the dialogue momentum losing speed or North Korea not living up to its denuclearization commitment,” said Foreign Minister Kang. During a press briefing in Seoul, the foreign minister said she was in in close communication with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo about the drills directly following the Singapore summit. And while the announcement canceling the exercises came suddenly, Kang said, South Korea was also considering this option to keep diplomatic momentum moving forward following the U.S.-North Korea summit where Kim reaffirmed his commitment to the “complete denuclearization” of North Korea. The now cancelled Ulchi Freedom Guardian exercises normally held in August usually bring in 3,000 more American troops from abroad and involve 50,000 South Korean troops. No decision has yet been made whether the other large-scale joint exercise held in the spring would be suspended as well. At the Singapore summit Trump said he would cancel the “war games” that he said were both enormously expensive and “provocative,” as an act of good faith and in response to North Korea’s commitment to denuclearization, its continued suspension of nuclear and missile teats, and the recent closing of its nuclear testing site. North Korea has long called for the end of these joint military exercises that it says are offensive “rehearsals for war.” In the past U.S. officials refused to suspend the joint drills, that they defended as defensive in nature...

Given the following context: Bennett was born in Sheffield, Yorkshire, the third child and only son of Robert Bennett, the organist of Sheffield parish church, and his wife Elizabeth, née Donn. In addition to his duties as an organist, Robert Bennett was a conductor, composer and piano teacher; he named his son after his friend William Sterndale, some of whose poems the elder Bennett had set to music. His mother died in 1818, aged 27, and his father, after remarrying, died in 1819. Thus orphaned at the age of three, Bennett was brought up in Cambridge by his paternal grandfather, John Bennett, from whom he received his first musical education. John Bennett was a professional bass, who sang as a lay clerk in the choirs of King's, St John's and Trinity colleges. The young Bennett entered the choir of King's College Chapel in February 1824 where he remained for two years. In 1826, at the age of ten, he was accepted into the Royal Academy of Music (RAM), which had been founded in 1822. The examiners were so impressed by the child's talent that they waived all fees for his tuition and board.Bennett was a pupil at the RAM for the next ten years. At his grandfather's wish his principal instrumental studies were at first as a violinist, under Paolo Spagnoletti and later Antonio James Oury. He also studied the piano under W. H. Holmes, and after five years, with his grandfather's agreement, he took the piano as his principal study. He was a shy youth and was diffident about his skill in composition, which he studied under the principal of the RAM, William Crotch, and then under Cipriani Potter, who took over as principal in 1832. Amongst the friends Bennett made at the Academy was the future music critic J. W. Davison. Bennett did not study singing, but when the RAM mounted a student production of The Marriage of Figaro in 1830, Bennett, aged fourteen, was cast in the mezzo-soprano role of the page boy Cherubino (usually played by a woman en travesti). This was among the few failures of his career at the RAM. The Observer wryly commented, \\"of the... answer the following question: What is the last name of the person whose mother died in 1818?

Movie plot title: The Exorcist III Movie plot: The film begins with the point of view of someone wandering through the streets of Georgetown, a voice informing us \\"I have dreams... of a rose... and of falling down a long flight of stairs\\". The point of view shows a warning of evil about to arrive later that night at a church. Demonic growls are heard, leaves and other street trash suddenly come flying into the church as a crucifix comes to life. It then cuts to Lieutenant William F. Kinderman (George C. Scott) at a crime scene, where a 12-year-old boy named Thomas Kintry has been murdered.Kinderman takes his friend, a priest named Father Dyer (Ed Flanders), out to see their mutually favorite film It's a Wonderful Life. Kinderman later relates the gruesome details of the murder of the young boy he was investigating that morning, including his crucifixion. Another murder soon takes place; a priest found decapitated in a church. Dyer is shortly hospitalized and found murdered the next day, with the words \\"IT'S A WONDERFULL LIFE\\" written on a wall in Dyer's blood.At each murder scene, the fingerprints at the crime scenes do not match up, indicating a different person was responsible for each. Kinderman tells hospital staff the reason for his unease: fifteen years ago the vicious serial killer, \\"The Gemini\\" (Brad Dourif), was executed; with every victim he cut off the right index finger and carved the Zodiac sign of Gemini into the palm of their left hand. Kinderman noticed the hands of the three new victims and verified that the Gemini's sign has been there. The Gemini Killer also always used an extra \\"L\\" in his notes sent to the media, such as \\"usefull\\" or \\"carefull\\". Furthermore, to filter out false confessions, the original Gemini Killer's true mutilations were kept a secret by the Richmond police's homicide department; the newspapers were made to wrongfully report that the left middle finger was severed and that the Gemini sign was carved on the back of the victim.Kinderman visits the head of the psychiatric ward, Dr. Temple (Scott Wilson), who relates...

Step 1: Identify the gripes Bennett's gripes are: 1) Gingrich honored Jesse Jackson by inviting him to sit with Gingrich's wife during the State of the Union address. 2) Gingrich apologized to Jackson for Rep. Step 2: Examine any implications of the gripes Bennett's gripes could suggest that he may not approve of Gingrich's actions or decisions involving Jesse Jackson. However, the gripes themselves do not mention Bennett wanting to sit next to Mrs. Gingrich during the State of the Union address or not being invited. So, to answer the question, it does not logically follow from Bennett's specific gripes that \\"Bennett wanted to sit next to Mrs. Gingrich during the State of the Union address but wasn't invited.\\" The gripes mainly indicate Bennett's disapproval of Gingrich's actions toward Jesse Jackson, but they do not provide direct evidence about Bennett's desires for attending and seating at the event."},{"prompt":"I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article.

Options: - become adult - row boat - drive - go out to play - begin school Explain why a human would choose \\"row boat\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","completion":"A human would choose \\"row boat\\" to answer the question above for several reasons: Step 1: Understanding the context and options - Analyzing the question, it becomes clear that it's asking what activity a child could learn while in a lake. This means we should focus on options that are related to lake-related activities. - Evaluating the options, some of them can be eliminated right away as they are not related to lake activities or are unrelated to what a child would learn: * Become adult is not an activity and doesn't have anything to do with being in a lake. * Drive is typically learned on roads and land, not in a lake. * Begin school is not related to being in a lake, as school is a separate institution. Step 2: Identifying relevant options At this point, the relevant options are: * Row boat * Go out to play Step 3: Analyzing the relevance of the remaining options - Out of these two options, \\"row boat\\" seems more appropriate because: * Rowing a boat is a specific skill that can be learned while in a lake since boats are commonly used on lakes for various activities, including leisure, exercise, or even transportation. * Row boat is a more focused answer, emphasizing on a particular skill that is unique to the context of a lake and commonly associated with that environment. While \\"go out to play\\" can happen near a lake, it is a more general activity and lacks the specificity that \\"row boat\\" offers. Conclusion: Considering the context and analyzing the options, it becomes clear that \\"row boat\\" best answers the question because it is a specific activity that a child can learn while in a lake and is also age-appropriate. Hence, a human would choose \\"row boat\\" as the answer to the question."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Is the review positive or negative? Answer:","completion":"The review can be considered as predominantly positive with a slight negative aspect mentioned. To elaborate, the reviewer begins by describing the item as \\"good\\" and mentions that it works very well, which indicates that they are generally satisfied with its performance and functionality. This positive assessment is a clear indication that the writer has had a favorable experience with the product. However, the reviewer also briefly describes a negative aspect when mentioning that they were unable to find replacement batteries for the item at local stores. This difficulty in finding necessary components could lead to potential problems for the user, as they were unable to use the product when the batteries died. This issue represents a minor drawback to the product's overall usability and convenience. Despite the minor inconvenience mentioned, the reviewer concludes by stating that the item is \\"good\\" overall. This reaffirms the positive sentiment conveyed at the beginning of the review and suggests that the benefits and positive aspects of the product outweigh the downsides.

Generate a question about the following movie plot: After sustaining a head wound in combat, decorated World War II veteran Eddie Rice (John Payne) is treated at a San Francisco military hospital for a permanent form of amnesia. This leaves him with no knowledge of his life, family and friends prior to his enlistment, a void that the army intelligence unit was unable to fill as they couldn't find any information about him, other than the fact he enlisted in Los Angeles.

Rice follows this advice and he promptly runs into people who recognize him. However, he is recognized not as Eddie Rice, but as Eddie Riccardi, a dangerous gangster gone missing, whose past behavior generates mistrust among the police and all those who knew him in the past. Furthermore, ruthless crime boss Vince Alexander (Sonny Tufts), who was betrayed by Eddie before he left the town, is now out for revenge.

Do you think the right answer to the question \\"what will die if they become too cold?\\" is \\"most organisms\\", given that if an animal or plant becomes too cold then they will die? Options: 1). Yes. 2). No. Answer:","completion":"1). Yes. The right answer to the question \\"what will die if they become too cold?\\" is indeed \\"most organisms.\\" When an animal or plant becomes too cold, it can lead to damage or even death, as most organisms are not adapted to survive extremely low temperatures. Temperature is a critical factor that affects biochemical reactions, cellular functions, and overall physiology of living organisms. In general, if the temperature is below the optimal range for an organism, their metabolism and other vital processes can slow down, ultimately causing them harm. For example, many animals, such as mammals and birds, are warm-blooded and must maintain a constant internal body temperature to ensure proper functioning of their organ system. When environmental temperatures drop too low, these organisms risk suffering from hypothermia, which can lead to death if not addressed. Similarly, plants can also be negatively affected by cold temperatures. Chilling stress can inhibit photosynthesis and cellular respiration, subsequently suppressing growth and development. Extreme cold may cause plant cells to freeze, leading to cell damage or death. Some plants have developed mechanisms to protect themselves from freezing, such as those growing in cold environments, but these adaptations are typically not enough to protect them from sustained or extreme freezing temperatures. In summary, most organisms will die if they become too cold, as their essential biological processes cannot function well outside of their specific optimal temperature range."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Whole black peppercorns can be used to flavor long-simmered sauces or soups. When used in this fashion, a subtle, almost floral, pepper flavor is imparted into the food. Choose from: [+] The flavors are impressive but when used in moderation, it can leave the upper crust with a greasy mess.

[+] When ground, some of the essential oils of the peppercorns are disbursed into the air and the resulting flavor is pungent. Crushed peppercorns retain most of their essential oils, giving them a very pungent flavor that pairs well with the taste of beef.. The answer should be","completion":"When ground, some of the essential oils of the peppercorns are disbursed into the air and the resulting flavor is pungent. Crushed peppercorns retain most of their essential oils, giving them a very pungent flavor that pairs well with the taste of beef. This perfect harmony of flavors makes pepper-crusted steak a favorite among many food enthusiasts. To achieve an evenly distributed and intense pepper flavor while maintaining the texture of the crust, it's crucial to utilize the right technique. First, start by selecting a high-quality cut of steak, such as a ribeye or tenderloin. Ensure the steak is well-trimmed, removing excess fat which could interfere with the pepper crust development. Pat the steak dry using paper towels to remove any surface moisture; this will help the peppercorns adhere better. Season the steak generously with kosher salt according to your taste preferences; the salt will help to enhance the flavor of both the meat and the pepper. Next, prepare the peppercorns. Using a mortar and pestle or a spice grinder, coarsely grind whole black peppercorns. It's recommended to freshly grind the peppercorns to release the maximum amount of essential oils, resulting in a more vibrant flavor. Be cautious not to grind the peppercorns too finely, as this can lead to an overly spicy and slightly bitter taste. Instead, aim for a coarser, chunkier consistency which will maintain the texture and create a delightful crust. Now, spread the crushed peppercorns evenly on a flat surface, such as a cutting board or a sheet of wax paper. Press the steak firmly onto the crushed peppercorns, ensuring that all sides are well-coated. Applying gentle pressure will help the peppercorns to adhere to the surface of the steak, forming a thick, even layer. Preheat a heavy skillet or griddle over medium-high heat and add a small amount of high-smoke point oil, such as grapeseed or avocado oil. Once the oil is shimmering, carefully place the pepper-crusted steak into the pan. Cook the steak for approximately 3-5 minutes per side, depending on the thickness and desired level of doneness. The high heat will cause the peppercorns to form a mouth-watering crust, while the interior of the steak remains tender and juicy. After reaching your preferred level of doneness, remove the steak from the pan and allow it to rest for at least 5 minutes. This step is essential, as it gives the juices that have been drawn to the surface during cooking time to redistribute back into the meat, ensuring a succulent result. Finally, serve the pepper-crusted steak alongside your favorite side dishes, and enjoy the bold flavor that the combination of black pepper and quality beef provides. This delicious and versatile dish can be easily customized with different combinations of spices or a complementary sauce to create a unique and memorable dining experience."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Question: \\"what was the philosophy of the others?\\" Context: \\"The leading naturalist in Britain was the anatomist Richard Owen, an idealist who had shifted to the view in the 1850s that the history of life was the gradual unfolding of a divine plan. Owen's review of the Origin in the April 1860 Edinburgh Review bitterly attacked Huxley, Hooker and Darwin, but also signalled acceptance of a kind of evolution as a teleological plan in a continuous \\"ordained becoming\\", with new species appearing by natural birth. Others that rejected natural selection, but supported \\"creation by birth\\", included the Duke of Argyll who explained beauty in plumage by design. Since 1858, Huxley had emphasised anatomical similarities between apes and humans, contesting Owen's view that humans were a separate sub-class. Their disagreement over human origins came to the fore at the British Association for the Advancement of Science meeting featuring the legendary 1860 Oxford evolution debate. In two years of acrimonious public dispute that Charles Kingsley satirised as the \\"Great Hippocampus Question\\" and parodied in The Water-Babies as the \\"great hippopotamus test\\", Huxley showed that Owen was incorrect in asserting that ape brains lacked a structure present in human brains. Others, including Charles Lyell and Alfred Russel Wallace, thought that humans shared a common ancestor with apes, but higher mental faculties could not have evolved through a purely material process. Darwin published his own explanation in the Descent of Man (1871).\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"The philosophy of the others who rejected natural selection but supported \\"creation by birth\\" was the belief in a gradual unfolding of a divine plan in the history of life.

They both want to know what the effect of removing Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes will be on the real estate sector. Let me explain this to you. Imagine you have a big jar of cookies. In this jar, there are 500 cookies and 1000 cookies. One day, your mom says you can't have any more 500 or 1000 cookies. Now you have to use smaller cookies – like 100 cookies or 50 cookies – for everything. The real estate sector is kind of like that jar of cookies. People used to use big notes (like Rs 500 and Rs 1000) to buy houses and buildings. But when those big notes are taken away, it becomes harder for people to make big transactions in cash. They have to use smaller notes or other ways of paying, like cheques or online payments. This affects the real estate sector because many people used to use the big notes – especially in illegal activities, like hiding money they didn't want the government to know about. When the big notes are banned, it becomes difficult for them to do this, and the real estate sector slows down a bit. This could cause the prices of houses and buildings to change. I hope this helps!

With a deep sense of piety and respect in his heart, he gently closed his ancient eyes, burdened by the knowledge of centuries, and clasped his hands together, palms pressed against each other in a sacred ritual that dates back to time immemorial. The soft, golden glow of dawn painted long, mesmerizing shadows around him, illuminating the ornate gold and marble of the temple’s inner sanctum with an ethereal, almost otherworldly light. In this solemn, hallowed setting, he began to offer his morning prayers, his voice a whispering echo reverberating in the corners of the temple, lost amongst the gentle gong resounding in the background, a soft reminder of the divine presence perceived by mortal beings. His words were peaceful, gentle, and filled with a profound hope, an anthem of love, faith, trust, and a request for divine guidance in his times of joy and trials. As he plunged deeper into his meditations, a certain tranquility blanketed the temple, a silent testimony to the spiritual bond that linked the mortal sage to his heavenly master. This routine, this sacred communion in the form of prayers, was his offering to his beloved deity, an offering born out of utter devotion and a humble plea for universal peace and prosperity. It was an act of reverence that held an unconditional surrender, trust, and an implied acknowledgement of divine power, which resonated in each uttered syllable, a silent music serene enough to pierce any hardened heart. And so, each day, in the tranquil hours of solemn dawn, this holy offering took place within the hallowed walls of the temple, an age-old ritual echoing within the divine realms of the gods, heralding the beginning of a new day."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

These thick clouds block sunlight from reaching the ground. So, when there's more rain in an environment, there will be less sunlight because the clouds are hiding it. It's just like when you're playing hide and seek, and your friend hides the toy behind their back - you know it's there, but you can't see it. Now, about electricity - this is a little different. When it rains a lot, it doesn't directly mean that there will be less electricity available. But, sometimes when there's a big storm with lots of rain and wind, it can damage power lines or cause power outages. This makes it harder for electricity to reach our homes for a little while. It's kind of like when you accidentally unplug your night light - it won't work until it's plugged in again.

The area is also known for its fruits, vegetables, eggs, and seafood. When I first moved to the area years ago, I had no idea I would be living in such a rich area! After the summer, local festivals practically celebrate the richness of the county every weekend. From Egg Days, Tomato Festival to Seafood Festival, Sonoma County has something for everyone. An event held every year is one of the most special in the area, which celebrates the harvest of tomatoes, showing over 170 kinds of this tasty fruit. Cooks prepare the most favorite tomato-inspired dishes. You can enjoy all kinds of food while listening to live music, and taste the world famous Kendall Jackson wine. Another great feature of this event is the opportunity to take part in the yearly competition with your own tomatoes. Tomatoes are judged on looks, taste, and weight and winners will be awarded . If you're planning on visiting and want to attend this event, get your ticket early as it sells out quickly. This year, to celebrate Tomato Festival, I decided to plant a few tomatoes in a wine barrel that had kept a lemon tree before. The tree, after about 6 years, finally did not produce fruits anymore, so I changed to plant 3 tomato plants instead. The three wine barrel plants stand over six feet tall and that's above the top of the barrel! They have lots of flowers and some have started to produce fruits. As usual, harvest may be late this year, but the quality of my tomatoes will be excellent. I believe I'll realize my dream of being the best tomato gardener.

Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","completion":"To determine if the premise entails the hypothesis, let's break down the given information and analyze the relationship between the statements. Premise: Launches start from the Pont Sainte-Madeleine behind the Ceteau des Rohan. Hypothesis: The races end at the back of Ceteau des Rohan. The premise provides information about the starting point of launches or races, which is at Pont Sainte-Madeleine located behind the Ceteau des Rohan. However, it doesn't give any clear information about where the races end. Now, let's consider the hypothesis. The hypothesis states that the races end at the back of Ceteau des Rohan. It proposes a specific ending point for the races, but its relationship with the given premise is not explicit or necessarily implied. Entailment occurs when the truth of one statement (in this case, the hypothesis) logically follows and is guaranteed by the truth of another statement (the premise). In other words, if the premise is true, then the hypothesis must also be true for entailment to exist. In this situation, it's important to note that the starting point doesn't necessarily imply the ending point. The premise only tells us where the races begin, but it doesn't establish any information about their concluding point (where they end). Without more information, it cannot be concluded that the races indeed end at the back of Ceteau des Rohan just because they start from Pont Sainte-Madeleine behind the Ceteau des Rohan. Therefore, based on the given information in the premise, it does not entail the hypothesis. They are two separate statements discussing the starting and ending points of the races, and the connection between them is not necessarily guaranteed. Additional information or context would be required to establish a relationship that would lead to the entailment of the hypothesis by the premise."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In fact, the natural synthesis of lactose occurs only in mammary tissue, whereas most other carbohydrates are plant products. Human milk contains about 7.5% lactose, and cow’s milk contains about 4.5%. This sugar is one of the lowest ranking in terms of sweetness, being about one-sixth as sweet as sucrose (seeTable 16.1 \\"The Relative Sweetness of Some Compounds (Sucrose = 100)\\" in Section 16.3 \\"Important Hexoses\\"). Lactose is produced commercially from whey, a by-product in the manufacture of cheese. It is important as an infant food and in the production of penicillin. Lactose is a reducing sugar composed of one molecule of D-galactose and one molecule of D-glucose joined by a β-1,4-glycosidic bond (the bond from the anomeric carbon of the first monosaccharide unit being directed upward).

Kurtis Eugene Warner (born June 22, 1971) is a former American football quarterback. He played for three National Football League (NFL) teams: the St. Louis Rams, the New York Giants, and the Arizona Cardinals. He was originally signed by the Green Bay Packers as an undrafted free agent in 1994 after playing college football at Northern Iowa. Warner went on to be considered the best undrafted NFL player of all time, following a 12-year career regarded as one of the greatest stories in NFL history. On January 3, 2009, Warner led the Cardinals in their victory over the Atlanta Falcons 30-24 at home in the first round of the playoffs. During the game Warner went 19 for 32 passing, a completion percentage of 59.4%, for 271 yards. He threw two touchdowns and one interception. This win represented the first time the Cardinals had won a post-season home game since the 1947 NFL Championship Game. On January 10, Warner helped the Cardinals defeat the Carolina Panthers 33-13 in Charlotte, North Carolina in the second round of the playoffs. During the game Warner went 21 for 32 passing, for 220 yards, a completion percentage of 65.6%, with two touchdowns and one interception. This win was the first time the Cardinals had won a game on the East Coast the entire 2008 season, after having lost away games to the Panthers, Washington Redskins, Philadelphia Eagles, New York Jets, and the New England Patriots. On January 18, Warner threw for 279 yards, four touchdowns, and no interceptions against the Philadelphia Eagles to lead the Cardinals to their first Super Bowl appearance in history. Warner is one of three quarterbacks who made Super Bowl starts with two different teams (the others are Craig Morton [1970: Dallas Cowboys and 1977: Denver Broncos] and Peyton Manning [2006 & 2009: Indianapolis Colts and 2013 & 2015: Denver Broncos]). Warner also became the third quarterback in NFL history to win a conference championship with two different teams (following Craig Morton and Earl Morrall). In Warner's third career Super Bowl appearance on February 1, the Cardinals lost Super Bowl XLIII 27-23 to the Pittsburgh Steelers, leaving him with a career 1-2 record in Super Bowls. Despite losing, Warner still managed to throw for 377 yards (the fourth-highest total in Super Bowl history). He completed 72.1% of his passes, and had a quarterback rating of 112.3. Warner had now recorded the three highest single-game passing yardage totals in the history of the Super Bowl, and joined Roger Staubach, Terry Bradshaw, Joe Montana, John Elway, and Tom Brady as the only quarterbacks to throw a touchdown pass in three different Super Bowls. Warner had taken his team to the Super Bowl every year that he played as the starting quarterback during all regular and post season games. What were some of his post season highlights?","completion":"Kurt Warner's illustrious career included several post-season highlights that contributed to his reputation as one of the greatest NFL quarterbacks of all time. Here are some of his most memorable moments: 1. Super Bowl XXXIV (1999 Season) - Warner led the St. Louis Rams to victory in Super Bowl XXXIV, defeating the Tennessee Titans 23-16. He was named Super Bowl MVP for his performance, which included throwing for 414 yards and 2 touchdowns. Warner's 73-yard touchdown pass to Isaac Bruce with less than two minutes left in the game secured the win for the Rams. 2. 1999 NFL Playoffs - In addition to winning Super Bowl XXXIV, Warner also played exceptionally well throughout the 1999 NFL Playoffs. He threw for a combined 8 touchdowns and only 3 interceptions in three games, leading the Rams to victories over the Minnesota Vikings and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers before defeating the Titans in the Super Bowl. 3. 2001 NFL Playoffs - Warner and the St. Louis Rams returned to the Super Bowl in the 2001 season, although they lost to the New England Patriots 20-17. Throughout the 2001 playoffs, Warner threw for 6 touchdowns and 1 interception in three games. His performance in the playoffs only solidified his reputation as a top-tier quarterback. 4. 2008 NFL Playoffs - In the 2008 playoffs, Warner led the Arizona Cardinals to their first Super Bowl appearance in history. Over the course of the post-season, he threw for 1,147 yards, 11 touchdowns, and just 3 interceptions. 5.

Context: Jimbob Blakey wasn't so much given birth to as clambered right out of his mother himself. He weighed in at almost thirteen pounds, came ready-fitted with a shock of fat black hair and a couple of razor teeth. Jimbob's folks loved him like most folks love their little ones, maybe more. They'd been trying so hard for a child, suffered more mid-term miscarriages than the ewes they shuttled off to market most Thursdays. They dressed him in a one-year babygro and took him home to their hill farm. They fought to get up nights and give him his milk. His teeth made breast-feeding impossible. They sat hours gazing down in his cot. They dressed him fine and took him to their church and gave their thanks. Showed him off like the proud parents they were. Others cooed and smiled. But they never asked to hold. They gave thanks the Blakeys were happy, and that the monkey-baby had not been born to them. Jimbob's folks never gave a second thought that their boy might be different. The first Spring he walked, he stomped the moors in his welly-boots helping herd the pregnant ewes down in-by. He copied his father, kicking and cuffing at the stragglers, when the flock was returned to the hills in May. As Jimbob grew, his hair became thicker, his arms longer. His head shrunk down on his shoulders. At check-ups, nurses fixed smiles and pronounced him healthy. Doctors said, 'he'll make you a strapping lad.' His mother smiled, her heart swelled. When he was three, she sent him to nursery. She wanted him to mix with other kids. To taste life off the hard hills. She said, 'it'll do him the world of good.' Jimbob hated leaving the farm. He clung to his mother. She drove away, blinking tears. On the third day, she took a phone call. 'It's Jimbob,' they said. 'He's scaring the other kids.'The truth hit Jimbob's mother like a hammer.

Social worker Julie Ridsdale has been off sick for ten years after losing a string of legal battles against employers Birmingham City Council. A social worker has been off sick for ten years during a £45,000 legal wrangle with Birmingham city council over her bullying claims. Julie Ridsdale last went to work for the council in December 2003, before being signed off long term sick. Despite losing a string of battles with the authority - including claims of bullying and disability discrimination - the 54-year-old, from Bromsgrove, technically remains a council employee. The saga began in 2003 when she fell. foul of bosses after leaving work to collect her son from school,. despite her claims it had been agreed. Mother-of-three Ms Ridsdale , who felt she was being bullied, responded by submitting a grievance after being accused of abandoning a case. In. December of that year, she was signed off with depression and by 2004. was receiving incapacity benefit. She remained off work until January,. 2005, when social services dismissed her through sustained ill-health. The. last day she worked was December 16 2003. While on sick leave she was. given six months full pay and 3 months half pay - ending in September. 2004. Although she lost her job over her record of ill health, she won it back on appeal. over wrongful dismissal in September 2005, but she said her career stalled and. she her depression hit 'new depths'. She. later made a failed compensation claim for disability discrimination,. spawned by her accusations the local authority failed to make. adjustments to help her overcome ill-health. The saga began in 2003. Ms Ridsdale won her job back on appeal eight years ago after being dismissed over her record of ill health, but she was then signed of with depression once again after her 'career stalled' And. a civil personal injury claim also fell without being heard. Now she. has been hit with a bill for almost £7,000 in legal costs. She said: 'My career and life have. been ruined by it. The effect on my family has been massive and my. children have been very affected. 'The toll this has taken on my health has been catastrophic and continues. 'In the nine years I've been off I felt really ill all the way through. I've still got ongoing depression. 'I've been incredibly sad - it's felt like a continuation of the bullying. They've been so heartless. 'I had been a well respected social worker and the council know they did wrong. 'I will not let this go because I have been wronged and want an apology, but I don’t know where I go from here.' The council insisted it had done all it could to resolve the dispute and stressed that Ms Ridsdale, who earned £1,200-a-month, was no longer on the payroll. A council spokesman said: 'Ms Ridsdale took the council to an employment tribunal and the civil courts and both hearings found in the council’s favour, with the tribunal finding that we had acted in good faith in seeking to resolve matters with her internally. 'While she remains an employee of the council she has not been well enough to return to work for some time and has therefore not been in receipt of any salary. 'Now legal proceedings have concluded we will seek to work with Ms Ridsdale to progress matters. 'We have maintained regular contact with Ms Ridsdale with the ultimate aim of trying to resolve her on-going employment dispute. 'All those involved in the matter have been acutely aware of her ill-health and have sought to ensure that matters are progressed in a sensitive manner and as speedily as possible in complex and difficult circumstances.'

She needed something, something that she could grab onto, and hold, hold until it hurt, hold until blood made racing red lines down her arms, until her hands were raw. She left the room and walked quietly into the now guest room that had been Rob's. Opening the closet, she found the teddy bear that Rob had once confided in and held it in her arms tight as she slumped down on the bed. A quiet sobbing rang through the house accompanied only by the chime of the grandfather clock in the living room every fifteen minutes. As Jan lay on the guest room bed she soon resorted to deep gasps, knowing that meager tears would never be forceful enough to express her worry to those that listened. \\"Just bring him home, bring him home, bring him home,\\" she mumbled over and over, each time changing the tone slightly in a desperate attempt to make her pleading sound more real. She could hear the occasional snore of her husband and she hated him for it. What kind of person could find sleep at a time like this? Why wasn't he awake worrying? Why wasn't he with her? Her thoughts became dark like blood, evil little monsters eating at her sanity. If her son was crazy and not just a drug addict she could see how easy it was to fall over the line. \\"Please God, please God, please God, please Rob, Please Rob, Please Rob, Please Rob.\\" Soon, a sleep came but it was peppered with demons.

In that posting , I described how to disable autorun for Windows XP and Windows 2000 and I just revised it to include Vista . In his December blog , Abrams writes , \\" Fundamentally , there are two types of readers here . The first type will disable autorun and be more secure . The second type will eventually be victims . \\" Do n't be a victim , disable autorun ( also known as autoplay ) for all devices . Why would the second type eventually be the victims ?","completion":"The second type of readers referred to in the article would eventually be victims because they choose not to disable the autorun (also known as autoplay) feature for their devices. This decision, in turn, could potentially lead to a less secure computing environment, putting them at risk of falling prey to malware attacks, data breaches, and other security-related issues. Autorun or autoplay is a feature in Windows operating systems that automatically launches or executes actions, such as opening files or running applications, when devices like USB flash drives, CDs, or DVDs are inserted. Although it was designed to simplify user experience, autorun has been exploited by cybercriminals as a means to spread malware. For instance, an attacker could load a malicious executable file onto a USB drive, configure it to use autorun, and then distribute the drive to unsuspecting users. When an individual plugs in the infected USB drive, the autorun feature could then automatically execute the malware without any user interaction. This could lead to various negative outcomes, including unauthorized access to sensitive information, data loss, system crashes, or even the spread of the malware to other connected devices. By disabling autorun, users can significantly minimize the risk of becoming victims of such attacks. This is because, without autorun, the malicious software would not launch automatically, and the user would have to manually execute the file, which is less likely to occur if they are aware of the potential risks associated with the autorun feature. In conclusion, the second type of readers would eventually be victims because they opt not to disable autorun, thereby exposing themselves to an increased likelihood of encountering malware attacks and other security threats. To maintain a more secure computing environment, it is advisable for users to disable autorun following the guidelines provided in the article for Windows XP, Windows 2000, and Vista."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The approach was soon extended to morphology by John McCarthy and Alan Prince, and has become a dominant trend in phonology. The appeal to phonetic grounding of constraints and representational elements (e.g. features) in various approaches has been criticized by proponents of 'substance-free phonology', especially Mark Hale and Charles Reiss.\\", answer the following question.

When her first sister was born, Lin took turns with her mom holding the baby late into the night. \\"I almost did everything that was supposed to be a parent's job, but I felt proud of myself,\\" she said. Not all of Lin's classmates shared her experiences because of the family planning policy , a law that was carried out in China about forty years ago. But the situation is about to change. A new policy made on October 29 said all couples can now have two children. The new policy is expected to help raise the population of China. Recently, China has been facing an aging population and labor shortages because of the low birth rate . The two-child policy may also be the gift for every only child. Researchers found that growing up with a brother or sister can have good influence on one's mental health. \\"Brothers and sisters do matter in unique ways.

U.S. President Donald Trump is sending a 4.4 trillion budget request to Congress that includes money for a southern border wall and building up the military, but is projected to increase the federal deficit by more than 1 trillion. White House officials all but acknowledged the proposal unveiled Monday has little chance of becoming law — Congress alone controls federal government spending. But the White House insisted the budget proposal still sends an important message about Trump's priorities. \\"This is a messaging document,\\" White House budget director Mick Mulvaney told reporters at a briefing Monday. The Trump budget calls for major cuts to domestic programs such as Medicare, Medicaid and food stamps. But the plan would still not balance the federal budget, in part because of reduced federal revenue due to tax cuts passed last year. Democrats widely rejected the plan. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called the proposal a \\"brutal collection of broken promises and staggering cuts.\\" The proposal's failure to eliminate debt is also likely to upset some Republicans, who have traditionally opposed budget deficits. \\"It's simply adjusting to the Washington, D.C., we live in,\\" Mulvaney said, stressing that the new budget plan would help \\"turn the tide\\" on national debt. The White House proposal builds on the massive, two-year spending bill passed last week by Congress and signed by the president. That bill includes a major boost for the military, as well as domestic programs. Mulvaney, a former lawmaker and long-time opponent of federal debt, has acknowledged he likely would not have supported the bill were he still in Congress. But he said the new White House proposal does not mean that all of the money approved by Congress must be spent. \\"These are spending caps, these are not spending floors,\\" he said. Under the two-year budget deal reached last week by Congress, the Pentagon will get a record-high 700 billion for 2018 — fulfilling a Trump campaign pledge. \\"We took care of the military like it's never... who would not have supported the bill? - Mulvany - Pelosi - not enough information - Trump Answer:","completion":"To perform the task of analyzing the given information, I will go step-by-step and justify my steps: Step 1: Identify the main points in the text - President Trump sends a 4.4 trillion budget request to Congress. - The budget includes money for a border wall and military enhancement. - The proposal is projected to increase the federal deficit by over 1 trillion. - The budget calls for major cuts to domestic programs. - The plan does not balance the federal budget. - White House acknowledges the proposal may not pass. Step 2: Analyze the parties' positions - President Trump and White House budget director Mick Mulvaney believe the budget sends an important message about priorities, even if it does not pass. - Democrats, such as House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, reject the budget proposal, calling it a \\"collection of broken promises and staggering cuts.\\" - The failure to eliminate debt may also upset some Republicans who traditionally oppose budget deficits.

Abstract: Most cancer cells activate telomerase to elongate telomeres and achieve unlimited replicative potential. Some cancer cells cannot activate telomerase and use telomere homologous recombination (HR) to elongate telomeres, a mechanism termed alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT). A hallmark of ALT cells is the recruitment of telomeres to PML bodies (termed APBs). Here, we show that the SMC5/6 complex localizes to APBs in ALT cells and is required for targeting telomeres to APBs. The MMS21 SUMO ligase of the SMC5/6 complex SUMOylates multiple telomere-binding proteins, including TRF1 and TRF2. Inhibition of TRF1 or TRF2 SUMOylation prevents APB formation. Depletion of SMC5/6 subunits by RNA interference inhibits telomere HR, causing telomere shortening and senescence in ALT cells. Thus, the SMC5/6 complex facilitates telomere HR and elongation in ALT cells by promoting APB formation through SUMOylation of telomere-binding proteins.. Title: The SMC5/6 complex maintains telomere length in ALT cancer cells through SUMOylation of telomere-binding proteins","completion":"To address this task, I'll analyze the given abstract and title, and compare the main points in both.

Just for kids, I had to continue to live and work as small-town doctor at my medical clinic in Hawaii. My kids had gone to live on the mainland, and I was alone. Then they asked me to have a family trip. On our trip, we turned on the TV at the motel and saw the second plane crash into the World Trade Center. Seeing it falling down, I said to my kids: \\"I'm going to Afghanistan\\". And a few weeks later, international Medical Corps sent me to set up 20 clinics in provinces where people had no health care. In these field clinics surrounded by frightening shoots or deadly bombs, we were eventually serving 27,000 patients a month in a very busy schedule. Tired and nervous, I gradually had a sense of achievement, a sense of purpose, and my depression went away. In the years to follow, I went to Indonesia after the tsunami, Pakistan after the earthquakes, Sudan after the civil warm and Iraq after more and more bombs. Each time after disasters one after another, hundreds of people were killed, wounded and many more had to flee. We once set up movable clinics in an area with 19,000 _ , and it was supposed to hold 13,000 originally. Flu broke out, one of the biggest killers of kids in refugee camps, and it spread like wildfire. Water and food were also serious problems. \\"Adventures or not?\\" I often asked myself.

American Airlines Flight 11: FAA Awareness. Although the Boston Center air traffic controller realized at an early stage that there was something wrong with American 11, he did not immediately interpret the plane's failure to respond as a sign that it had been hijacked. At 8:14, when the flight failed to heed his instruction to climb to 35,000 feet, the controller repeatedly tried to raise the flight. He reached out to the pilot on the emergency frequency. Though there was no response, he kept trying to contact the aircraft. At 8:21, American 11 turned off its transponder, immediately degrading the information available about the aircraft. The controller told his supervisor that he thought something was seriously wrong with the plane, although neither suspected a hijacking. The supervisor instructed the controller to follow standard procedures for handling a \\"no radio\\" aircraft. The controller checked to see if American Airlines could establish communication with American 11. He became even more concerned as its route changed, moving into another sector's airspace. Controllers immediately began to move aircraft out of its path, and asked other aircraft in the vicinity to look for American 11. At 8:24:38, the following transmission came from American 11: American 11: We have some planes. Just stay quiet, and you'll be okay. We are returning to the airport. The controller only heard something unintelligible; he did not hear the specific words \\"we have some planes.\\" The next transmission came seconds later: American 11: Nobody move. Everything will be okay. If you try to make any moves, you'll endanger yourself and the airplane.

It was probably William the Conqueror who gave the city and its castle to Bishop Odo of Bayeux, the king's half brother. On William's death in September 1087 his territories were divided between his two sons. Robert, the elder, inherited the title of Duke of Normandy and William Rufus became King of England. A significant number of Norman barons objected to dividing Normandy and England, and Bishop Odo supported Robert's claim to the English throne. Several others, including the earls of Northumberland and Shrewsbury and the Bishop of Coutances came out in support of Robert. Odo prepared Rochester Castle for war and it became one of the headquarters of the rebellion. Its position in Kent made it a suitable base for raids on London and its garrison could harry William's forces in the county. William set off from London and marched towards Rochester to deal with the threat. Before he arrived, news reached the king that Odo had gone to Pevensey Castle, which was under the control of Robert, Count of Mortain. William turned away from Rochester and seized Pevensey. The captured Odo was forced to swear to hand over Rochester to William's men. The king despatched a force with Odo in tow to demand Rochester's surrender. Instead of yielding, the garrison sallied and captured the entire party. In response William laid siege to the city and castle. Contemporary chronicler Orderic Vitalis recorded that the siege began in May 1088. Two siege-castles were built to cut off the city's supply lines and to protect the besiegers from sorties. Conditions within the city were dire: disease was rampant, exacerbated by the heat and flies. The garrison ultimately capitulated and terms were agreed. Odo, Eustace, Count of Boulogne, and Robert de Belleme, son of the Earl of Shrewsbury, were allowed to march away with their weapons and horses but their estates in England were confiscated. This marked the end of the castle's role in the rebellion, and the fortification was probably abandoned shortly afterwards. The siege-castles were...

Here is an article: In St. Louis, Michael Sam might have found the perfect spot to pursue an NFL career and try to become the league's first openly gay player. He'll have three former Missouri teammates with him on the Rams, including fellow draft pick E.J. Gaines. Sam will be playing for a team with many fans that rooted for him when he was in college, and supported him when he publicly came out. And in coach Jeff Fisher, he'll be playing for someone who didn't shy away from being part of NFL history. Maybe more than any other place in the NFL, Sam will be allowed to concentrate on playing football and making the team, which is no guarantee for a seventh-round draft choice. ''I think Michael and his entire team feel he went to what was ultimately the right stage and the right place, with the right coach and the right system,'' said Howard Bragman, a public relations expert who has been working with Sam. ''Any rookie already has pressure and Michael has added pressure.'' Sam was picked by St. Louis near the end of the seventh round Saturday, with the 249th overall pick. He'll join former Missouri players T.J. Moe, a receiver, and Tim Barnes, a center, along with Gaines, when the Rams start preparing for the 2014 season. Moe and Sam were in the same recruiting class at Missouri. ''I'll certainly do my best to make him feel right at home,'' Moe said. ''It's much bigger deal to the media than it is to the players. Here it's all about football.'' An NFL.com writer was in the Rams' draft room and reported late Saturday night that Fisher unexpectedly suggested taking Sam, a player the team had not given much consideration to before. Fisher is going into his third season with St. Louis after spending 17 seasons with the Titans franchise. ''We're in an age of diversity. Players understand that, they know that,'' Fisher said. ''People will try to make it a distraction but it's not a distraction.'' Wade Davis, who is gay and came out publicly well after his playing days, was in training camp with the Tennessee Titans twice when Fisher was their coach. ''As someone who played for Coach Fisher, Michael Sam couldn't be going to a better place,'' said Davis, who is now the executive director of the ''You Can Play Project,'' an advocacy group that works to take homophobia out of sports. Davis said that while Sam is breaking new ground as an openly gay athlete entering a major male professional sports league, he won't be the first gay athlete whose teammates knew he was gay. Davis added the bond and intimacy that comes from being a teammate, and the hard work it requires, makes pro sports a better place than most to integrate a gay co-worker. ''I'm a firm believer that sports team, unlike any other job, are more accepting of differences because you put them aside to pursue a common goal,'' David said. Missouri coach Gary Pinkel lived through that scenario. Sam came out to his teammates and coaches before the Tigers' 2013 season. They went on to play in the Southeastern Conference championship game. Sam was the conference's defensive player of the year. ''It's amazing how sports can have influence on everything,'' he said. ''I think sports will have such a big influence that one day this will not be big news. My whole thing is, everybody's different. Just respect people.'' At Missouri, students and the Columbia community rallied around Sam after he came out. In February, Sam and the rest of the football team were honored at halftime of a Missouri basketball game. An anti-gay group held a protest outside the arena. Fans and students surrounded the arena, many wearing T-shirts with the slogan ''Stand With Sam'' on them, to ensure the protesters didn't get too close. Columbia is about 2 hours from St. Louis, pretty much halfway between St. Louis and Kansas City on I-70. There is plenty of overlap between Missouri fans and Rams fans. Sam's story has been told in detail in the St. Louis market and he was allowed to come out on his own schedule. ''The media knows him and has protected him in the past,'' Bragman said. ''He feels perfectly comfortable, with a support system in place. That's huge.'' St. Louis is a relatively small media market and the Rams, a promising team, but one coming off consecutive 7-9 seasons, are not one of the NFL's marquee teams. Bragman said Sam, who grew up in Galveston, Texas, should have some space and comfort in St. Louis that he wouldn't have elsewhere. ''He's not a particularly worldly kid. Now all of sudden, he's in Seattle or San Francisco, far away from home. Or in New York, with Page 6,'' said Bragman, referencing the New York Post's famous gossip page. That's not a problem in St. Louis. ''I don't think there could have been a better situation,'' Bragman said.

Movie title: My Name is Ivan Movie plot: On the Eastern front during World War II, the Soviet army is fighting the invading German Wehrmacht. The film features a non-linear plot with frequent flashbacks. After a brief dream sequence, Ivan Bondarev, a 12-year-old Russian boy, wakes up and crosses a war-torn landscape to a swamp, then swims across a river. On the other side, he is seized by Russian soldiers and brought to the young Lieutenant Galtsev, who interrogates him. The boy insists that he call \\"Number 51 at Headquarters\\" and report his presence. Galtsev is reluctant, but when he eventually makes the call, he is told by Lieutenant-Colonel Gryaznov to give the boy pencil and paper to make his report, which will be given the highest priority, and to treat him well. Through a series of dream sequences and conversations between different characters, it is revealed that Ivanâs mother and sister (and probably his father, a border guard) have been killed by German soldiers. He got away and joined a group of partisans. When the group was surrounded, they put him on a plane. After the escape, he was sent to a boarding school, but he ran away and joined an army unit under the command of Gryaznov. Burning for revenge, Ivan insists on fighting on the front line. Taking advantage of his small size, he is successful on reconnaissance missions. Gryaznov and the other soldiers grow fond of him and want to send him to a military school. They give up their idea when Ivan tries to run away and rejoin the partisans. He is determined to avenge the death of his family and others, such as those killed at the Maly Trostenets extermination camp (which he mentions that he has seen). A subplot involves Captain Kholin and his aggressive advances towards a pretty army nurse, Masha, and Galtsev's own undeclared and unrequited feelings for her. Much of the film is set in a room where the officers await orders and talk, while Ivan awaits his next mission. On the walls are scratched the last messages of doomed prisoners of the Germans. Finally, Kholin and Galtsev ferry Ivan... A:","completion":"Ivan Bondarev ran away from school.

Article: In the past, people who graduated from college felt proud of their academic achievements and confident that their degree would help them to find a good job. However, in the past four years the job market has changed greatly. This year's college graduates are facing one of the worst job markets. For example, Ryan Stewart, a graduate of San Jose State University, got a degree in religious studies, but he has not gotten any job offers. He points out that many people already working are getting laid off and don't have jobs, so it's even harder for new college graduates to find jobs. Four years ago, the future looked bright for his class of 2006. There were many high-tech(\\"dot com\\") job opportunities, graduates received many job offers, and they were able to get jobs with high salaries and benefits such as health insurance and paid vacations. However, \\"Times have changed. It's a new market,\\" according to an officer of the university. The officer says students who do find jobs started preparing two years ago. They worked during summer vacations, they have had several short-time jobs, and they majored in fields that are still paying well, such as accounting or nursing. Even teaching is not a secure profession now. Ryan Stewart wanted to be a teacher. But instead he will probably go back to school in order to become a college teacher. He thinks college teaching could be a good career even in a bad economy. In conclusion, these days a college degree does not automatically lead to a good job with a high salary. Some students can only hope that the value of their degree will increase in the future. Question: Why does Ryan Stewart want to be a college teacher? Options: A: Teaching jobs are well-paid.

Preston North End goalkeeper Thorsten Stuckmann has claimed Wayne Rooney apologised for the 'dive' that won Manchester United a penalty during their FA Cup fifth-round tie. Rooney went down under a challenge by Stuckmann in the 88th minute, and the England captain scored the resulting penalty to seal the 3-1 win over their League One opposition on Monday night. Match of the Day presenter Gary Lineker and Stan Collymore were among those criticising Rooney after replays showed there was no contact. Wayne Rooney touched the ball past Preston North End goalkeeper Thorsten Stuckman during the FA Cup tie. Rooney went down a moment after and several of the Preston players were unhappy with his actions. Rooney lies down on the ground before the penalty is given by referee Phil Dowd late on at Deepdale. Rooney scored from the spot-kick to put Manchester United 3-1 up on Monday night as they won the match. 'After the game Rooney told me: \\"Sorry, it was my chance to get a penalty. I had to use that\\",' Stuckmann told The Sun. England manager Roy Hodgson was forced to defend his captain and Stuckmann remains adamant it was an unfair call by referee Phil Dowd. 'I say it clear: That was no penalty,' the keeper added. 'I also believe that if the situation had happened the other way around, one of our strikers against the United keeper, the ref wouldn't have given the penalty. I have no doubt about that.' The goal was Rooney's first in 952 minutes since scoring twice in the 3-1 win over Newcastle United on Boxing Day, and United will now face Arsenal in the FA Cup quarter-finals. Gary Lineker wrote this on Twitter and discussed it further with England manager Roy Hodgson on BBC. Gary Lineker: Roy, he's your captain. Was he diving there? Roy Hodgson: No, not for me, he's just taking evasive action. If you're refereeing the game without the replays that we've seen now a number of times, I don't think any of us would have said that's not a penalty. The goalkeeper's come out that way very rashly and gone with both feet, and Wayne's touched the ball past him. Lineker: But he hasn't touched him Roy? Hodgson: Well...there you go. Kevin Kilbane: Well there’s no contact. It’s a rash challenge yes, but there’s no contact. He tries to leave his leg in there as well, just looking for it. Phil Neville: I think when the keeper’s flying in like that he has to get out of the way. And yeah you might say it’s a dive, but I think he had to get out of the way because if he had left his leg in there it’d have been a leg-breaker. Kilbane: It’s still a dive though. Neville: He had to dive to get out of the way, though. Kilbane: But it’s a dive, Phil. Neville: He had to get out of the way otherwise he’d have snapped his leg. Kilbane: He can hurdle the challenge though can’t he, and then continue his run. Neville: It’s a penalty for me – it’s a reckless challenge.

The unpretentious and relaxed ambience made it a comfortable space to socialize in, with the staff creating an atmosphere that felt as if they were welcoming you into their home. Speaking of the staff, the attention to detail and level of service they provided was truly impeccable. Our server was knowledgeable about the menu, answering all of our questions with great detail and personal experiences, and providing amazing recommendations. Their attentiveness never wavered throughout the evening, and they went out of their way to ensure our needs were well met. It was the perfect blend of personal and professional that elevated our dining experience to a whole new level. Now for the pièce de résistance - the food! The quality and presentation of each dish were astounding. We began with the chef's selection of appetizers, and every single one was a symphony of flavors that danced on our palates. Each ingredient showcased the freshest and finest quality, from the locally sourced vegetables to the expertly prepared meats. The creativity behind each dish also left us eager for the next culinary surprise to make its way to our table. The main courses were just as incredible. I opted for the pan-seared salmon, which was cooked to perfection with a beautiful crust on the outside while maintaining a tender and moist interior. The accompanying aromatic herb sauce and seasonal vegetables were not only visually stunning but absolutely delicious alongside the already impressive salmon. My partner raved about their slow-roasted lamb shank, which was so tender it nearly fell off the bone. The accompanying red wine reduction was rich and velvety, tying the dish together and providing a luxurious dining experience. Despite being nearly full, we couldn't resist trying one of their heavenly desserts. We opted to share the chocolate soufflé - and what a treat it was! The moment our spoons broke through the delicate crust, an eruption of molten chocolate goodness was revealed, and each bite was a delectable journey worth every last calorie. In conclusion, this hidden gem has single-handedly redefined my expectations for all future dining experiences. The exceptional service, atmosphere, and exquisite dishes made for an unforgettable night, and I will eagerly recommend this establishment to friends and family alike.

They are also known for role-playing video games such as the \\"Dragon Knight\\" series and visual novel adventure games such as \\"YU-NO\\". - Dragon Knight II (II) is a fantasy-themed eroge role-playing video game in the \\"Dragon Knight\\" franchise that was originally developed and published by ELF Corporation in 1990-1991 only in Japan as the first sequel to the original \\"Dragon Knight\\" from 1989. The game is an erotic dungeon crawler in which a young warrior Takeru fights to lift a witch's curse that has turned girls into monsters. - MSX is the name of a standardized home computer architecture, first announced by Microsoft on June 16, 1983, and marketed by Kazuhiko Nishi, then Vice-president at Microsoft Japan and Director at ASCII Corporation. Microsoft conceived the project as an attempt to create unified standards among various hardware makers of the period. - Japan (\\"Nippon\\" or \\"Nihon\\" ; formally \\"\\" or \\"Nihon-koku\\", means \\"State of Japan\\") is a sovereign island nation in Eastern Asia. Located in the Pacific Ocean, It is lying off the eastern coast of the Asia Mainland (east of China, Korea, Russia) and stretching from the Sea of Okhotsk in the north to the East China Sea and near Taiwan in the southwest. - An is a Japanese pornographic video game. History. Japanese eroge, also known as H-Light novels or hentai games, have their origins in the early 1980s, when Japanese companies introduced their own brands of microcomputer to compete with those of the United States. Competing systems included the Sharp X1, Fujitsu FM-7, MSX, and NEC PC-8801. NEC was behind its competitors in terms of hardware (with only 16 colors and no sound support) and needed a way to regain control of the market. Thus came the erotic game. The first commercial erotic computer game, \\"Night Life\\", was released by Koei in 1982. It was an early graphic adventure, with sexually explicit images. That same year, Koei released another erotic title, \\"Danchi Tsuma no Yuwaku\\" (\\"Seduction of the Condominium Wife\\"), which was an early role-playing adventure game with colour graphics, owing to the eight-color palette of the NEC PC-8001 computer. It became a hit, helping Koei become a major software company. - A microcomputer is a small, relatively inexpensive computer with a microprocessor as its central processing unit (CPU). It includes a microprocessor, memory, and minimal input/output (I/O) circuitry mounted on a single printed circuit board. Microcomputers became popular in the 1970s and 1980s with the advent of increasingly powerful microprocessors. The predecessors to these computers, mainframes and minicomputers, were comparatively much larger and more expensive (though indeed present-day mainframes such as the IBM System z machines use one or more custom microprocessors as their CPUs). Many microcomputers (when equipped with a keyboard and screen for input and output) are also personal computers (in the generic sense). - MS-DOS (; acronym for \\"Microsoft Disk Operating System\\") is a discontinued operating system for x86-based personal computers mostly developed by Microsoft. It was the most commonly used member of the DOS family of operating systems, and was the main operating system for IBM PC compatible personal computers during the 1980s and the early 1990s, when it was gradually superseded by operating systems offering a graphical user interface (GUI), in various generations of the graphical Microsoft Windows operating system by Microsoft Corporation. - A disk operating system (abbreviated DOS) is a computer operating system that can use a disk storage device, such as a floppy disk, hard disk drive, or optical disc. A disk operating system must provide a file system for organizing, reading, and writing files on the storage disk. Strictly speaking, this definition does not apply to current generations operating systems, such as versions of Microsoft Windows in use, while this definition is actually only used for older generations of operating systems. - Fantasy is a fiction genre set in an imaginary universe, often but not always without any locations, events, or people from the real world. Most fantasy uses magic or other supernatural elements as a main plot element, theme, or setting. Magic and magical creatures are common in many of these imaginary worlds. Fantasy is generally distinguished from the genres of science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three, all of which are subgenres of speculative fiction. - A role-playing video game (commonly referred to as role-playing game or RPG, and in the past was also known as computer role-playing game or CRPG) is a video game genre where the player controls the actions of a character (and/or several party members) immersed in some well-defined world. Many role-playing video games have origins in pen-and-paper role-playing games (Including \\"Dungeons & Dragons\\") and use much of the same , settings and game mechanics. Other major similarities with pen-and-paper games include developed story-telling and narrative elements, player character development, complexity, as well as replayability and immersion. The electronic medium removes the necessity for a gamemaster and increases combat resolution speed. RPGs have evolved from simple text-based console-window games into visually rich 3D experiences. Since the 1980s, Role-playing is the most commercially viable video game genre in Japan, and has more market share of any other genre in the japanese gaming industry, although in the 2010s first-person shooters and western iOS and Android games were becoming rapidly and increasingly popular in that country. - Koei Co., Ltd. is a Japanese video game publisher, developer, and distributor founded in 1978. The company is known for its historical simulation games based on the novel \\"Romance of the Three Kingdoms\\", as well as simulation games based on pseudo-historical events. - FreeDOS (formerly Free-DOS and PD-DOS) is a free operating system for IBM PC compatible computers. It intends to provide a complete DOS-compatible environment for running legacy software and supporting embedded systems. - Knights of Xentar is an eroge role - playing video game published for the PC DOS in North America by Megatech Software in 1995 and has been originally published as Dragon Knight III in Japan in 1991 . It is part of the Dragon Knight series of games created by Japanese game developer ELF , who originally released the game for the NEC PC - 8801 computer in 1991 , followed by ports for the Sharp X68000 and PC Engine CD platforms . The game is a sequel of Dragon Knight and Dragon Knight II. Its gameplay system is different from that of previous installments of the Dragon Knight series , resembling this of the early Final Fantasy ( even more in the PC version ) series instead of first - person - view dungeon crawler , and enabling the player to explore the entire world of the game . Some of the characters were renamed in the in English and German localized Knights of Xentar release , including the protagonist Takeru 's name changed to Desmond . - DR-DOS (DR DOS, without hyphen up to and including version 6.0) is an operating system of the DOS family, written for IBM PC-compatible personal computers. It was originally developed by Gary Kildall's Digital Research and derived from Concurrent PC DOS 6.0, which was an advanced successor of CP/M-86.

We were told to find ourselves a table, so we sat in an attractive area sort of like a small stage. No waitress came by for 10 minutes, so we decided to visit the restroom; there was just one, with one toilet. But a woman rushed in ahead of us, carrying a bundle of clothes. Several minutes later, when she reappeared, we realized this was our waitress—arriving late and pushing us customers out of the way so she could change. OK… We each used the restroom and returned to our table. But it was not our table anymore. Along came the manager to explain she needed to set aside the stage-like area for a very special group. My daughter and I had already been debating whether to stay or leave. We stayed only because we were very hungry and worried that we’d have to start waiting all over again if we tried a different place. We were led to our new table: a lonely little table in the hall leading to the toilet. I was ready to get out of there, pronto, but my daughter spotted her favorite meal on the menu. But after another 15 minutes, with the lone waitress not appearing, we both shook our heads and got up… Oh, here’s the waitress! We ordered. Fifteen minutes later, no food. We got up again and exited past the stage-like area, which was just as empty as it had been when we were ejected. The very special people had not arrived—so (had we been served) we could have enjoyed our meal right there. We did find food elsewhere. The first place closed in less than a month. Good riddance!

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Can you tell me the answer to where does the gravitational potential energy of an object come from (site 1)??","completion":"Yes, I'd be happy to help explain where the gravitational potential energy of an object comes from. Gravitational potential energy is an important concept in classical physics, and it is related to the energy an object possesses due to its position within a gravitational field. To understand this concept fully, let's break it down step by step. 1. Gravitational force: Any two objects with mass will have an attractive force between them due to gravity. This force is determined by the masses of the objects and the distance between them. Sir Isaac Newton first formulated this in his Universal Law of Gravitation, which is represented mathematically as: F = G * (m1 * m2) / r^2 Here, F is the gravitational force between two objects, G is the gravitational constant (approximately 6.674 x 10^-11 N m²/kg²), m1 and m2 are the masses of the two objects, and r is the distance between their centers of mass. 2. Work and energy: To lift or move an object against gravity, you must exert a force on the object, which results in work being done. Work, in the context of physics, is the product of force and the distance moved in the direction of the force. The work done on the object increases its energy. This energy can be in various forms, such as kinetic energy (due to the object's motion) or potential energy (due to the object's position). 3. Gravitational potential energy: The potential energy of the object increases when work is done against gravity, and decreases when the object falls under the influence of gravity. In other words, gravitational potential energy (GPE) is the energy an object has due to its position within a gravitational field. It is mathematically calculated as: GPE = m * g * h Here, GPE is the gravitational potential energy, m is the mass of the object, g is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.81 m/s² on Earth’s surface), and h is the height above a reference point, usually the Earth’s surface. The gravitational potential energy of an object, therefore, comes from the work done against the gravitational force to move or lift the object to a certain position in a gravitational field. This work is converted into energy that is stored within the object in the form of potential energy. The greater the mass of the object, the greater the height or distance it is raised, and the stronger the gravitational field in which it is located, the more potential energy the object will have. When the object is allowed to fall under the influence of gravity, this stored potential energy converts back into other forms of energy, such as kinetic energy."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

While I appreciate the convenience it brings, there are a few aspects that left me feeling that this app deserves a 3-star rating. Firstly, the user interface is quite simple and easy to navigate, which is a plus point for those who are not tech-savvy. However, it lacks a sleek and modern design, making it feel a bit outdated compared to other apps in the market. Secondly, I found the synchronization process can sometimes be slow and glitchy. There were a few instances when the app would freeze during syncing, which forced me to restart the app. This can be frustrating, particularly when you are in a hurry to access your contacts. On the positive side, the app has a feature to remove duplicate contacts and merge information, which I found very useful in organizing my contact list. However, the lack of customization options for group management (e.g. creating, renaming, or deleting groups) detracts from its overall usefulness. Lastly, I must address the app's compatibility with different platforms. While it works well with Android devices, it encounters some issues when syncing with iOS devices. This greatly limits the utility of this app for users who have contacts spread across multiple platforms. In summary, the ro.weednet.contactssync app offers basic functionality for syncing contacts but could benefit from improvements in its speed, design, and compatibility to provide a more comprehensive user experience. With these enhancements, I believe the app has the potential to merit a higher rating."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Write an article based on this summary: Decide what type of garden to grow. Decide what specific plants to include in your garden. Choose a spot for your garden. Make a garden design.","completion":"Title: Creating Your Dream Garden: A Comprehensive Guide Introduction A beautiful and well-tended garden can offer great benefits, such as enhancing the aesthetics of your home, increasing property value, and providing a space for relaxation and leisure. However, designing and creating the perfect garden can sometimes be a daunting task. In this article, we will guide you through the essential steps to create a garden you will enjoy and be proud of. These steps include deciding on the type of garden you want, selecting specific plants, choosing the perfect location, and designing a garden layout. 1. Deciding on the type of garden The first important decision in creating your garden is to decide on the type of garden you want to grow. Here are some common garden styles to consider: a) Flower Garden: If you love blooming flowers and vibrant colors, a flower garden could be the perfect choice for you. Flower gardens can be designed with various planting schemes and combinations of annuals, perennials, and bulb plants. b) Vegetable Garden: If you're passionate about growing your food, a vegetable garden will help you achieve that goal. This garden type can also encompass various other edible plants, such as fruits, herbs, or edible flowers. c) Native Plants Garden: This garden style focuses on indigenous plants, which are generally low maintenance and highly adaptable to local climate conditions. A native plants garden promotes biodiversity and helps create a habitat for local wildlife. d) Zen Garden: If you're looking for a serene, peaceful space for meditation and relaxation, a Zen garden could be the perfect fit. Zen gardens typically consist of natural elements such as rocks, gravel, sand, and a limited selection of plants. e) Wildlife Garden: This garden type prioritizes the creation of a habitat for various wildlife species like birds, bees, and butterflies. Key elements of a wildlife garden include birdhouses, bee houses, native plants, and water sources. 2. Selecting specific plants Once you have chosen the type of garden you wish to create, the next step is to decide on the specific plants to include. Factors to consider while selecting your plants include: a) Compatibility: Make sure the plants you choose are compatible with each other. This means considering factors like sunlight requirements, water needs, and soil preferences. b) Climate: Select plants that can thrive in your local climate. Check the plant hardiness zone for your area to help you select plants that will be suited to your location. c) Aesthetics: Choose plants that will create an attractive and cohesive look, depending on your desired garden style. Consider aspects like color combinations, textures, and plant heights. d) Maintenance: Be aware of the maintenance requirements for your chosen plants. If you're not prepared to spend significant time caring for your garden, opt for low-maintenance plants. 3. Choosing the perfect spot for your garden The location of your garden will depend on factors such as: a) Available space: Determine how much space is available in your yard for creating a garden. b) Sunlight: Assess the amount of sunlight your selected spot receives throughout the day. This factor plays a crucial role in the success of your garden, as most plants require at least 6 hours of sunlight per day. c) Water access: Make sure your garden location has easy access to water, either through a nearby hose or watering system. d) Soil quality: Healthy soil is crucial for plant growth. Check the quality of the soil in your chosen spot and, if needed, consider adding compost, organic matter, or other soil amendments to improve it. 4. Designing your garden layout Once you have chosen your desired garden type, plants, and location, it is time to design the layout for your garden. Remember to consider the following aspects: a) Focal points: Create focal points in your garden, such as sculptures, water features, or specimen plants, to draw attention and add visual interest. b) Pathways: Incorporate pathways for people to walk through and easily access different areas of the garden. c) Plant placement: Consider the mature size of your plants when deciding their placement. Also, ensure that each plant receives the required amount of sunlight. d) Balance and harmony: Aim to achieve a harmonious balance of plant heights, colors, and textures in your garden to create a cohesive and visually appealing design. Conclusion Creating a beautiful and functional garden can be a gratifying and rewarding experience. By carefully considering the garden type and plant choices, selecting the right location, and designing a well-planned layout, you can ensure your garden thrives and brings you joy for years to come.

What is the answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who picked which version of the text to reprint? from the following article ? The \\"magnificent and accurate\\" Shakespeare edition which Boydell began in 1786 was to be the focus of his enterprise—he viewed the print folio and the gallery as offshoots of the main project. In an advertisement prefacing the first volume of the edition, Nicol wrote that \\"splendor and magnificence, united with correctness of text were the great objects of this Edition\\". The volumes themselves were handsome, with gilded pages that, unlike those in previous scholarly editions, were unencumbered by footnotes. Each play had its own title page followed by a list of \\"Persons in the Drama\\". Boydell spared no expense. He hired the typography experts William Bulmer and William Martin to develop and cut a new typeface specifically for the edition. Nicol explains in the preface that they \\"established a printing-house ... [and] a foundry to cast the types; and even a manufactory to make the ink\\". Boydell also chose to use high-quality wove Whatman paper. The illustrations were printed independently and could be inserted and removed as the purchaser desired. The first volumes of the Dramatic Works were published in 1791 and the last in 1805. Boydell was responsible for the \\"splendor\\", and George Steevens, the general editor, was responsible for the \\"correctness of text\\". Steevens, according to Evelyn Wenner, who has studied the history of the Boydell edition, was \\"at first an ardent advocate of the plan\\" but \\"soon realized that the editor of this text must in the very scheme of things give way to painters, publishers and engravers\\". He was also ultimately disappointed in the quality of the prints, but he said nothing to jeopardize the edition's sales. Steevens, who had already edited two complete Shakespeare editions, was not asked to edit the text anew; instead, he picked which version of the text to reprint. Wenner describes the resulting hybrid edition: The thirty-six plays, printed from the texts of Reed and Malone, divide into the following three groups: (1) five plays of the first three numbers printed from... Answer:","completion":"The first name of the person who picked which version of the text to reprint is George.

This is because the Earth's crust was cooling during this time, allowing rocks and continental plates to form. Some scientists believe that since Earth was hotter then, plate tectonic activity was more vigorous, which led to a much greater rate of recycling of crustal material. The increased recycling could have prevented cratonisation and continent formation, as the mantle needed to cool down and convection slow down before these processes could take place. Additionally, some researchers argue that the subcontinental lithospheric mantle was too buoyant to subduct, which also could have contributed to the lack of Archean rocks and hindered the formation of continents during the early Archean. The absence of Archean rocks might be a result of erosion and subsequent tectonic events due to these conditions during a hotter period on Earth.

L. Hunley takes his ship, the H.L. Hunley, out in the Charleston, South Carolina harbor and it sinks with all hands. As the blockade still needs to be broken, Brig. Gen. P. G. T. Beauregard has the ship raised and puts George E. Dixon in charge. He starts looking for a crew and after some difficulty finally finds enough volunteers to man it. They practice cranking the propeller. The crew do not all get along with each other. Dixon flashes back to the Battle of Shiloh, where a gold coin given to him by his wife (who was later killed in a steamboat explosion caused by a drifting mine) deflected a bullet and saved his life. They take the ship down and sit on the bottom to see how long they can stay down and almost get stuck. The U.S. Navy is warned about the sub. The crew votes that if after an attack they are stuck on the bottom, they will open the valves, flooding the ship, rather than suffocate. They go out to attack the USS Wabash, but the attack fails. Following the warning the ship has draped metal chain netting over the side. Also the rope which was attached to the torpedo they were to release under the ship gets loose and becomes entangled in the propeller. It has to be cut loose while sailors on the Wabash shoot at the Hunley. Beauregard proposes putting the torpedo at the end of a long spar. The USS Housatonic is ordered to change its position in the harbor and always be ready to steam, meaning it cannot hang metal netting over the side. The Hunley's second in command, Lt. Alexander, is ordered to Mobile, Alabama, and a young soldier who had been volunteering to join the crew is allowed to do so. contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the object raised by Brig.

In humans, the middle ear works as an impedance equalizer between the outside air's low impedance and the cochlear fluid's high impedance. In whales, and other marine mammals, there is no great difference between the outer and inner environments. Instead of sound passing through the outer ear to the middle ear, whales receive sound through the throat, from which it passes through a low-impedance fat-filled cavity to the inner ear. The whale ear is acoustically isolated from the skull by air-filled sinus pockets, which allow for greater directional hearing underwater. Odontocetes send out high frequency clicks from an organ known as a melon. This melon consists of fat, and the skull of any such creature containing a melon will have a large depression. The melon size varies between species, the bigger the more dependent they are of it. A beaked whale for example has a small bulge sitting on top of its skull, whereas a sperm whale's head is filled up mainly with the melon.The whale eye is relatively small for its size, yet they do retain a good degree of eyesight. As well as this, the eyes of a whale are placed on the sides of its head, so their vision consists of two fields, rather than a binocular view like humans have. When belugas surface, their lens and cornea correct the nearsightedness that results from the refraction of light; they contain both rod and cone cells, meaning they can see in both dim and bright light, but they have far more rod cells than they do cone cells. Whales do, however, lack short wavelength sensitive visual pigments in their cone cells indicating a more limited capacity for colour vision than most mammals. Most whales have slightly flattened eyeballs, enlarged pupils (which shrink as they surface to prevent damage), slightly flattened corneas and a tapetum lucidum; these adaptations allow for large amounts of light to pass through the eye and, therefore, a very clear image of the surrounding area. They also have... contains an answer for the question: What part of the eye is enlarged in the animal that are not thought to have a good sense of taste?, what is it ?

California's Proposition 64, which is leading in the polls, could create a multibillion-dollar marijuana industry by legalizing the recreational use the drug for adults in the state. Similar measures are on the ballot in Arizona, Nevada, Maine and Massachusetts. Marijuana could be legalized for medical use in Florida and three other states. Medical marijuana is already permitted in half the 50 U.S. states, and recreational use is allowed in Alaska, Colorado, Washington state, Oregon and the District of Columbia.

Write a question about the following article: Mantua is the ancestral city where the male line of the Gonzaga dynasty ruled, first as marquesses, then after 1540 as dukes, in vassalage to the Holy Roman Empire. Monferrato was a duchy since 1574 on the eastern side of Piedmont, and an Imperial fief since the eleventh or twelfth century. The Gonzagas had enlarged their realm with Monferrato after receiving it in dowry from the wife of duke Frederick II Gonzaga. On 22 September 1612, Francis IV, Duke of Mantua and Monferrato died at the age of 26. His death occurred only a couple of months after the death of his father Vincent I, Duke of Mantua. He left only a three-year-old daughter, Maria of Mantua. Francis IV also had two younger brothers who, both being cardinals, could not marry and were thus ineligible to succeed to Mantua's throne. Nonetheless, Francis' two brothers, Ferdinando I and Vincenzo II , eventually did become Dukes of Mantua. Despite marrying, following the resignation of Ferdinando and the expulsion of Vincenzo from the Sacred College of Cardinals, neither produced any legitimate children. A crisis erupted when Vincenzo II died on 26 December 1627 at the age of 33, the same day that his niece Maria Gonzaga's marriage with Charles de Nevers was celebrated.

The great Elizabethan mansion, home of her ancestors but denied to her through agnatic primogeniture, held enormous importance for her throughout her life. Sissinghurst was a substitute for Knole, and she greatly valued its familial connections. In 1913 Sackville-West married Harold Nicolson, a diplomat at the start of his career. Their relationship was unconventional, with both pursuing multiple, mainly same-sex, affairs. After breaking with her lover Violet Trefusis in 1921, Sackville-West became increasingly withdrawn. She wrote to her mother that she would like \\"to live alone in a tower with her books\\", an ambition she achieved in the tower at Sissinghurst where only her dogs were regularly admitted. From 1946 until a few years before her death, Sackville-West wrote a gardening column for The Observer, in which, although she never referred directly to Sissinghurst, she discussed a wide array of horticultural issues. In an article, \\"Some Flowers\\", she discussed the challenge of writing effectively about flowers: \\"I discovered this only when I started to do so. Before ...

James was a quiet boy, preferring to spend his afternoons in the local park, shooting basketballs into a single hoop under a sky now orange, now violet. He often wore an old hand-me-down pair of basketball shorts and a tattered T-shirt that were now too small for his growing frame. In this town where people were whispering his name, James pursued his passion with the dreams of a dedicated athlete. His one goal: to become the best basketball player in Willowbrook. 1. Establish James's passion for basketball and humbleness of his surroundings. The townspeople of Willowbrook had always been obsessed with their annual Shooting Stars Basketball Tournament. Both kids and adults alike looked forward to this event, eager either to show off their skills on the court or to cheer for their favorite contestants. The previous year's winner, a confident, tall boy named Ralph, had held the title of the town's best player for two straight years. 2. Introduce the primary setting and event around which the story will revolve. As the date of the tournament approached, James couldn't help but feel a mix of excitement and anxiety. He knew he had been practicing every day, rain or shine, but the thought of competing against the likes of seasoned players like Ralph made him doubt himself. James's mother, sensing her son's apprehension, handed him his father's lucky charm -- a small bronze basketball keychain. \\"Your father would've wanted you to have this,\\" she said with a smile. \\"Just remember to give it your all, and the results will follow.\\" 3. Present the protagonist's inner struggles and provide an emotional connection to his family. Feeling reassured by his mother's words and the weight of the keychain in his pocket, James mustered up the courage to sign up for the tournament. The day finally arrived, and the entire town gathered in the park, ready for an intense day of basketball. Confident players like Ralph strutted around, while others, like James, silently focused on the competition ahead. 4. Move the storyline toward the main event and showcase the start of character development. The tournament began, and one by one, contestants stepped up to take their shots. Cheers from the crowd echoed across the park as each player showcased their abilities. James, standing in line, took deep breaths and focused on his father's lucky charm. When his turn came, he stepped forward and began shooting baskets with remarkable precision, surprising both himself and the spectators. 5. Intensify the climax of the story by highlighting the protagonist's turning point. Unexpectedly, the final round came down to James and Ralph, who was both visibly shocked and slightly annoyed by James's sudden prowess. The crowd held their breath as Ralph and James began the contest. However, Ralph's pride and overconfidence made him sloppy, and he missed critical shots. James, on the other hand, kept his focus and executed every shot with the utmost care and patience. 6. Build suspense and drama by emphasizing the rivalry and placing the protagonist in a face-off. As the final buzzer rang out, the crowd burst into applause. James had outperformed everyone's expectations and finally made a name for himself in the town of Willowbrook. Even Ralph was forced to admit that James was a worthy opponent, a sentiment he muttered through gritted teeth. The results were clear: James was now the most talented basketball player in town. With the support and encouragement of his family, as well as the memory of his father, he made the most shots and won the contest. 7.

Given the following passage \\"Darwin was hard at work on his \\"big book\\" on Natural Selection, when on 18 June 1858 he received a parcel from Wallace, who stayed on the Maluku Islands (Ternate and Gilolo). It enclosed twenty pages describing an evolutionary mechanism, a response to Darwin's recent encouragement, with a request to send it on to Lyell if Darwin thought it worthwhile. The mechanism was similar to Darwin's own theory. Darwin wrote to Lyell that \\"your words have come true with a vengeance, ... forestalled\\" and he would \\"of course, at once write and offer to send [it] to any journal\\" that Wallace chose, adding that \\"all my originality, whatever it may amount to, will be smashed\\". Lyell and Hooker agreed that a joint publication putting together Wallace's pages with extracts from Darwin's 1844 Essay and his 1857 letter to Gray should be presented at the Linnean Society, and on 1 July 1858, the papers entitled On the Tendency of Species to form Varieties; and on the Perpetuation of Varieties and Species by Natural Means of Selection, by Wallace and Darwin respectively, were read out but drew little reaction. While Darwin considered Wallace's idea to be identical to his concept of natural selection, historians have pointed out differences. Darwin described natural selection as being analogous to the artificial selection practised by animal breeders, and emphasised competition between individuals; Wallace drew no comparison to selective breeding, and focused on ecological pressures that kept different varieties adapted to local conditions. Some historians have suggested that Wallace was actually discussing group selection rather than selection acting on individual variation.\\", answer the following question. Note that the answer is present within the text. Question: What facet of Wallace's theory made historians think Wallace might actually be discussing group selection rather than the impact of natural selection on individuals? The answer to this question is:","completion":"The facet of Wallace's theory that made historians think he might actually be discussing group selection rather than the impact of natural selection on individuals is that Wallace focused on ecological pressures that kept different varieties adapted to local conditions, rather than emphasizing competition between individuals as Darwin did. Wallace also did not draw any comparison to selective breeding, which Darwin used as an analogy for natural selection. These differences in focus and explanation led some historians to suggest that Wallace was discussing group selection instead of selection acting on individual variation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In the premise, there are two main components: a. \\"Still others believed that total (historical) cost should be the long-term goal.\\" b. \\"the use of latest acquisition cost allowed only until such historical cost data would be available.\\" Step 2: Examine the relation between these components. Component (a) states that some people believe the total historical cost should be a long-term goal. Component (b) says that the latest acquisition cost is allowed until historical cost data is available, implying that once historical cost data is available, the latest acquisition cost usage will be replaced by total historical cost usage.

Answer the following question: A blind baby is doubly handicapped. Not only is it unable to see, but because it cannot receive the visual stimulus from its environment that a sighted child does, it is likely to be slow in intellectual development. Now the ten-month old son of Dr. and Mrs. Dennis Daughters is the subject of an unusual psychological experiment designed to prevent a lag in the learning process. With the aid of a sonar-type electronic that he wears on his head, infant Dennis is learning to identify the people and objects in the world around him by means of echoes . The device is an improvement of the \\"Sonicguide\\", an instrument produced by Telesensory Systems, Inc., of Palo Alto, Calif, and used by blind adults in addition to a smart or guide dog. As adapted for Dennis, it consists of a battery-powered system about the size of a half dollar that is on a headgear. A transmitter sends out an ultrasonic pulse that creates an 80 degree cone of sound at 6 feet. Echoes from objects within the cone are perceived (felt) as sounds that vary in pitch and volume with the size and distance of the object. The closer an object is, the lower the pitch, and the larger the object, the louder the signal. Hard surfaces produce a sharp ping, while soft ones send back signals with a slightly fuzzy quality. An object slightly to the right of Denny's sends back a louder sound to his right ear than to the left. Thus , by simply moving his head right and left and up and down, he can not only locate an object but also get some notion of its shape and size, thanks to the varying qualities of sounds reaching his ears as the cone of ultrasound passes _ . Dennis likes to use the device to play a kind of peek-a-boo with his mother. Standing on her knee and facing her directly, he receives a strong signal in both ears. By turning his head away, he makes her seem to disappear. \\"From the first time he wore it,\\" says Mrs. Daughters, \\"it was like a light going on in his head.\\" What remains to be determined is how well the device will help Dennis cope with... Infant Dennis becomes the subject of the experiment most probably because _ . A) he already lags behind the sighted children B) he leads a life as normal as any other children C) he is at the early stage of the learning process D) he has the aid of a sonar-type electronic device Answer:","completion":"C) he is at the early stage of the learning process In the given passage, it is mentioned that Dennis is a ten-month-old baby. It is a well-known fact that babies at this age are at early stages of their learning process. The experiment aims at preventing a lag in this learning process, especially for a blind child who might face difficulties due to the lack of visual stimuli. Since Dennis is at the ideal age where early intervention can make a significant difference, he becomes a suitable subject for the experiment. Therefore, option C appears to be the correct answer among the given choices."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Summarize: Gilmour recorded Rattle That Lock with The Liberty Choir, a rehabilitation project that includes former Wandsworth Prison inmates and local singers. The rock legend said the choir gives prisoners \\"real hope and optimism\\". His son Charlie did time in Wandsworth in south London in 2011 after being arrested at a tuition fees protest. He spent four months in jail after being convicted of violent disorder for his part in the 2010 protest, where he swung from a flag on the Cenotaph and threw a bin at a royal convoy. David Gilmour told BBC News: \\"Charlie's experience was something that has impacted on us and has made us more aware of the prison system and what could and should be done to improve it. \\"We're just helping out by being part of this initiative, which will hopefully spread.\\" The Liberty Choir, run by vocal coach MJ Paranzino and writer Ginny Dougary, takes members of the South London Choir into Wandsworth Prison for weekly sessions with serving inmates. They also run regular sessions outside jail, where former offenders can join members of the South London Choir. Seven of these former inmates were part of the 30-strong choir that sang on Rattle That Lock. Gilmour and wife Polly Samson have also donated money to allow The Liberty Choir to expand to other jails. Why did you get involved with The Liberty Choir? David Gilmour: It's wonderful, seeing all these guys singing in the prison along with people from the South London Choir. They are close to the end of their sentences, and they then have a place outside prison where they feel part of the community, and that's very good for them, to feel valued. Did Charlie's experiences make you want to get involved? Yes, we got to see how the system worked and there's a lot wrong with the system, but there are many other initiatives that people are taking into their own hands within prisons and for prisoners. This one, with the dual thing of doing it inside prison and on the outside as well, is a different step that we think is very good. You went into Wandsworth on Tuesday - what did you do? We joined a regular session where 20-something prisoners and about 20 people from the choir outside get to sing along and are taught. MJ is a brilliant teacher. They come week in, week out, and there's a waiting list inside prison because the room available is small. The maximum number they can get in is about 20, but there are many, many more who want to take part. What have the current or former prisoners said about the choir? I've had conversations with some of the guys in the prison and some who have recently been released, and they all think it's a fantastic programme and are very keen for it to be widened and spread to other prisons. It gives them real hope and optimism that they don't just come out of prison into a vacuum and the same temptations. This gives them at least one night a week with something to do where they feel valued, and they can join in with something artistic that is uplifting. Is the song Rattle That Lock about prison? No, it's just something to encourage people to step out and stand up for themselves and not be apathetic. Will you continue your relationship with the choir? Yes, Polly and I are both founder supporters. We give money to them. We have a charitable foundation that supports all sorts of things. This is one of them, and we are very keen that this should continue and expand. We both intend to go back into Wandsworth and maybe other places if they open their doors to this sort of thing in the future. David Gilmour's single Rattle That Lock is out now and his solo album of the same name is out on 18 September. Summary:","completion":"David Gilmour, a rock legend, recorded \\"Rattle That Lock\\" with The Liberty Choir, a rehabilitation project that involves former Wandsworth Prison inmates and local singers.

Since we have q terms on both sides, add 33*q to both sides to move all the q terms to one side. 54*q + 33*q + 870 = -33*q + 33*q This simplifies to: 87*q + 870 = 0 Step 2: Isolate the q term by moving the constant term (870) to the other side of the equation. Subtract 870 from both sides: 87*q = -870 Step 3: Solve for q To solve for q, divide both sides by 87: q = -870 / 87 Now, simplify the fraction: q = -10 So, the solution to the given equation 54*q + 870 = -33*q is q = -10."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A commemorative plaque was first dedicated there in 1957. The site is now occupied by 1500 Broadway, which houses offices, retail, and ABC Studios. He was the son of Irish immigrant actor James O'Neill and Mary Ellen Quinlan, who was also of Irish descent. Context: After suffering from multiple health problems (including depression and alcoholism) over many years, O'Neill ultimately faced a severe Parkinsons-like tremor in his hands which made it impossible for him to write during the last 10 years of his life; he had tried using dictation but found himself unable to compose in that way. While at Tao House, O'Neill had intended to write a cycle of 11 plays chronicling an American family since the 1800s. Only two of these, A Touch of the Poet and More Stately Mansions, were ever completed. As his health worsened, O'Neill lost inspiration for the project and wrote three largely autobiographical plays, The Iceman Cometh, Long Day's Journey into Night, and A Moon for the Misbegotten. He managed to complete Moon for the Misbegotten in 1943, just before leaving Tao House and losing his ability to write. Drafts of many other uncompleted plays were destroyed by Carlotta at Eugene's request. O'Neill died in Room 401 of the Sheraton Hotel (now Boston University's Shelton Hall) on Bay State Road in Boston, on November 27, 1953, at the age of 65. As he was dying, he whispered his last words: \\"I knew it. I knew it. Born in a hotel room and died in a hotel room.\\" Dr. Harry Kozol, the lead prosecuting expert of the Patty Hearst trial, treated O'Neill during these last years of illness. He also was present for O'Neill's death and announced the fact to the public. O'Neill is interred in the Forest Hills Cemetery in Boston's Jamaica Plain neighborhood. In 1956 Carlotta arranged for his autobiographical play Long Day's Journey into Night to be published, although his written instructions had stipulated that it not be made public until 25 years after his death. It was produced on stage to tremendous critical acclaim and won the Pulitzer Prize in 1957. This last play is widely considered to be his finest. Other posthumously-published works include A Touch of the Poet (1958) and More Stately Mansions (1967). The United States Postal Service honored O'Neill with a Prominent Americans series (1965-1978) 1 postage stamp. Question: was he treated for the depression?

Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Summarize the following: When you’ve finished your first draft of your paper, step away from it for at least a little while. Waiting to revise for a day or two is ideal, although that may not be possible under a deadline. Getting your mind away from your essay is beneficial in that it allows you to come back at it with a fresh perspective. You’ll see errors and areas for expansion that you never would have considered before. This is another reason why it is best to not procrastinate when writing an essay of this type. You will need ample time to complete the process in a patient way in order to create your best possible work. As soon as you know that you’ll need to write an essay it is a good idea to approach a friend or classmate and ask them to spend a bit of time looking over your rough draft. Before you hand over your draft it is a good idea to let you reader know if there are any particular ‘trouble areas’ that you would like them to focus on. You might say, “Please focus on the word choice as that is a weakness of mine.” Once you’ve given your paper some down time and had another person look it over you will then need to start the personal revision process. Find a quiet place where you can sit down and closely read over your essay word-by-word. Look for both macro (large, major) and micro (smaller, details) issues and make these changes. Some people find it helpful to print out your paper at this point and make your revisions on a hard copy. This can also protect you in the event that you experience any computer troubles. One strategy is to split your revisions into two parts: one revision for grammar and spelling and another to examine the organization and content of your paper. When you are writing a ‘split’ topic essay, such as a compare/contrast or cause/effect, it is particularly important to make your transitions clear and obvious to the reader. This will signal to your reader that you are switching from one area to another.

California wildfire evacuees return to destroyed homes: 'All of it is gone' Thousands of people driven from their homes by a massive northern California wildfire began to trickle back to their neighborhoods Thursday, and some saw what they most feared: nothing. “All of it is gone. It’s so surreal,” Layna Rivas said through tears in a phone interview just after she discovered her home in Clearlake Oaks had burned to the ground. “It looked like a bomb went off everywhere. It’s all black.” Rivas kept chickens and said she saw only one walking through the rubble. Forty-three homes were destroyed and 13,000 people were ordered or warned to evacuate as the blaze chewed through nearly 109 square miles of dry brush. Related: California wildfires overwhelm drought-stricken state – in pictures Evacuees from a handful of neighborhoods were allowed to return home, and the number could increase in the next 24 hours as firefighting operations wind down. “We have crews coming in and out of those tiny roadways,” state fire spokeswoman Blanca Mercado said. “It’s not just the fire, there’s still a lot of things behind the scenes logistically.” Residents were anxious to check on their pets and possessions, but many were stuck camping in cars and trailers, drinking coffee from Styrofoam cups and hoping their houses had not been reduced to ash. Cassandra Raffaelli and others were staying in the parking lot at a Moose Lodge, a fraternal organization that was serving food to evacuees. She had been there since Sunday and doesn’t know what she will find when she returns home to Spring Valley, a town in a parched rural area 100 miles north of San Francisco. “To go home, to go to your house, see it (burned) and stuff, that’s my major fear,” she said. The flames mowed down some dwellings and left others untouched near Clear Lake, the largest freshwater lake fully within California. Some houses a mile apart were completely burned, while nearby buildings and trees weren’t touched by the flames. Chairs, burned books and broken dishes sat in piles of ash, and burned-out cars dotted the landscape. At one home, a metal table and chair sat in the middle of its scorched foundation. The eerie quiet was broken only by chirping birds and the sound of helicopters overhead. Amid the destruction, crews were gaining ground, getting the blaze close to halfway contained after more than a week fighting its erratic behavior. It’s the largest of 23 fires statewide and has the attention of nearly a third of the 10,000 firefighters dispatched to blazes in drought-stricken California. Wildfires throughout the west have fed off dry conditions in Washington state, Montana, Arizona and elsewhere. California governor Jerry Brown visited fire crews and said the state is hotter and drier than it’s ever been, making blazes more severe and extending fire season. “This is the beginning of the fire season, and it’s acting like it’s the end,” Brown said. Thomas Tompkins, of Spring Valley, which so far hasn’t been affected by the fire, has been living in an RV with his wife, Beth, since Saturday. They packed their belongings, grabbed their two dogs and two cats, and got out quickly. “Hopefully today they’ll let us back in,” he said. “This is nice, but after a while, I have to go back to work.” At the Moose Lodge, there was a sense of safety. The club has been feeding breakfast, lunch and dinner to about 80 people and was stocked with water, snacks and bedding. “The overwhelming response from the community would bring a tear to your eye,” said Joe Welz, a retiree from Spring Valley who evacuated. “This is humanity at its best.” What was this article about?","completion":"This article is about the aftermath of a massive northern California wildfire that forced thousands of people from their homes.

The Legislative Assembly of Manitoba was established on 14 July 1870. Political parties first emerged between 1878 and 1883, with a two-party system (Liberals and Conservatives). The United Farmers of Manitoba appeared in 1922, and later merged with the Liberals in 1932. Other parties, including the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF), appeared during the Great Depression; in the 1950s, Manitoban politics became a three-party system, and the Liberals gradually declined in power. The CCF became the New Democratic Party of Manitoba (NDP), which came to power in 1969. Since then, the Progressive Conservatives and the NDP have been the dominant parties.Like all Canadian provinces, Manitoba is governed by a unicameral legislative assembly. The executive branch is formed by the governing party; the party leader is the premier of Manitoba, the head of the executive branch. The head of state, Queen Elizabeth II, is represented by the Lieutenant Governor of Manitoba, who is appointed by the Governor General of Canada on advice of the Prime Minister. The head of state is primarily a ceremonial role, although the Lieutenant Governor has the official responsibility of ensuring that Manitoba has a duly constituted government.The Legislative Assembly consists of the 57 Members elected to represent the people of Manitoba. The premier of Manitoba is Brian Pallister of the PC Party. The PCs were elected with a majority government of 40 seats. The NDP holds 14 seats, and the Liberal Party have three seats but does not have official party status in the Manitoba Legislature. The last provincial general election was held on 19 April 2016.

Fact 2: The fact is that ice seldom freezes or thaws at a uniform rate. Given the two facts above, answer the question \\"What is the rate of ice wedging?\\" with the following options: - In the winter - erosion - mechanical - Physical weathering - Dilution - friction - it fluctuates - kinetic The answer to this question is:","completion":"It fluctuates. Ice wedging, which is a form of physical weathering, occurs due to the cycles of freezing and thawing water. When water enters into cracks, it freezes and expands, causing the crack to widen. As temperatures rise, the ice melts, and the water flows deeper into the crack, enabling the process to repeat. The reason for the fluctuating rate of ice wedging is that ice seldom freezes or thaws at a uniform rate. Several factors influence the rate of ice wedging, including: 1. Temperature variations: This is the primary factor affecting ice wedging. In colder climates, the process of freezing water and thawing can happen more frequently, leading to a greater rate of ice wedging. Additionally, fluctuations in temperature throughout the day or season can accelerate or retard the rate at which ice wedging occurs. 2. Moisture availability: The presence of water in the cracks of rocks is essential for ice wedging. In areas with limited precipitation or low humidity, the rate of ice wedging may be slower due to inadequate water supply. 3. The type of rock: Rocks with a higher porosity and permeability, such as sandstone or limestone, typically allow water to infiltrate more easily, resulting in a greater rate of ice wedging. On the other hand, rocks with low porosity, such as granite, can limit the rate. 4. The presence of natural fractures: Some rocks may have existing fractures that facilitate water infiltration. In these cases, the rate of ice wedging may be higher. Given these factors, the rate of ice wedging is not constant and can vary significantly throughout different times and locations. It is important to note that while ice wedging is a physical weathering process, other agents of weathering, such as erosion and friction, play a role in breaking down rocks and contributing to the overall landscape changes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

What is the answer for the question: What was the first name of the person who calculated critical mass of a sphere of uranium in a theoretical paper? from the following article ? At Birmingham, Oliphant's team had reached a different conclusion. Oliphant had delegated the task to two German refugee scientists, Rudolf Peierls and Otto Frisch, who could not work on Oliphant's radar project because they were enemy aliens and therefore lacked the necessary security clearance. Francis Perrin had calculated the critical mass of uranium to be about 40 tonnes (39 long tons; 44 short tons). He reckoned that if a neutron reflector were placed around it, this might be reduced to 12 tonnes (12 long tons; 13 short tons). Peierls attempted to simplify the problem by using the fast neutrons produced by fission, thus omitting consideration of moderator. He too calculated the critical mass of a sphere of uranium in a theoretical paper written in 1939 to be \\"of the order of tons\\".Peierls knew the importance of the size of the critical mass that would allow a chain reaction to take place and its practical significance. In the interior of a critical mass sphere, neutrons are spontaneously produced by the fissionable material. A very small portion of these neutrons are colliding with other nuclei, while a larger portion of the neutrons are escaping through the surface of the sphere. Peierls calculated the equilibrium of the system, where the number of neutrons being produced equalled the number escaping.Niels Bohr had theorised that the rare uranium-235 isotope, which makes up only about 0.7% of natural uranium, was primarily responsible for fission with fast neutrons, although this was not yet universally accepted. Frisch and Peierls were thus able to revise their initial estimate of critical mass needed for nuclear fission in uranium to be substantially less than previously assumed. They estimated a metallic sphere of uranium-235 with a radius of 2.1 centimetres (0.83 in) could suffice. This amount represented approximately 1 kilogram (2.2 lb) of uranium-235. These results led to the Frisch–Peierls memorandum, which was the initial step in the development of the nuclear arms programme in Britain. This...

Impressed, the driver told Lennon that he could have a harmonica if he came to Edinburgh the following day; the harmonica had been stored in the Edinburgh bus depot after a passenger had inadvertently left it on a bus. The professional instrument quickly replaced Lennon's toy. He would continue to play the harmonica, often using the instrument during the Beatles' Hamburg years, and it became a signature sound in the group's early recordings. His mother taught him how to play the banjo, later buying him an acoustic guitar. At 16, he played rhythm guitar with the Quarrymen.As his career progressed, he played a variety of electric guitars, predominantly the Rickenbacker 325, Epiphone Casino and Gibson J-160E, and, from the start of his solo career, the Gibson Les Paul Junior. Double Fantasy producer Jack Douglas claimed that since his Beatle days Lennon habitually tuned his D-string slightly flat, so his Aunt Mimi could tell which guitar was his on recordings.

By using synonyms or slightly rephrasing the sentence structure, the same essential message can be conveyed, allowing for effective communication and comprehension. In this specific case, the paraphrasing maintains the central idea of calculating the static component by comparing it to the dynamic component and total soil resistance, ensuring that the message is clearly understood."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Is demand used to mean the same thing in the next two sentences? The automobile reduced the demand for buggywhips. His demands for attention were unceasing.","completion":"When approaching this task, I will compare the meaning of the word \\"demand\\" in both sentences. Step 1: Analyze the first sentence \\"The automobile reduced the demand for buggywhips.\\" In this sentence, \\"demand\\" refers to the desire or need from consumers to purchase and use a specific product, in this case, buggywhips. The introduction of automobiles led to a decrease in this desire, as automobiles provided a more efficient and modern form of transportation compared to buggies requiring buggywhips. Step 2: Analyze the second sentence \\"His demands for attention were unceasing.\\" In this sentence, \\"demands\\" refers to the persistent requests or claims made by an individual (in this case, \\"his\\") for attention from others. This usage conveys a sense of expecting or requiring something, in this case, attention. Step 3: Compare the meanings of \\"demand\\" in both sentences Comparing the meanings, it is evident that \\"demand\\" in the first sentence pertains to the economic concept and consumer behavior, while \\"demands\\" in the second sentence refers to personal requests or expectations. Conclusion: The word \\"demand\\" does not mean the same thing in both sentences. In the first sentence, it refers to consumer desire or need for a product, while in the second sentence, it refers to someone's persistent requests or claims for attention."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Measure your kayak and your storage space ahead of time to make sure your kayak will fit. Kayaks take up a lot of room and should not be in contact with other objects when being stored. It is best to store it indoors so that it is protected. You could store it in a garage, basement, shed, or any other indoor storage area. Only store it outside as a last resort. If you'll be storing it for long periods of time and have minimal space at your home, you can have the kayak professionally stored. Many kayak schools, kayak rentals, marinas, paddling clubs, or state beaches have available kayak storage. Make sure your kayak won’t be subjected to extreme heat or cold. Avoid temperatures below freezing or above 100 degrees Fahrenheit (37.7 degrees Celsius). This is important so that your kayak doesn’t become brittle or damaged. Storing your kayak in direct sunlight is the worst option. The heat will warp the plastic and fade the surface. If you're storing the kayak in your garage, make sure it's in a dark area. Make sure you are not storing your kayak near a direct heat source either. Use a mild all-purpose cleaner (such as diluted Castile soap) and a sponge to wipe down your kayak. Make sure to clean the inside and outside. There should be no remaining dirt or residue. Rinse thoroughly with water after cleaning with soap so that no soap remains on the kayak. Although kayaks are built for use in water, they are not made to be wet continually. Water will begin to break down the kayak’s surface. If it is covered and there is any moisture inside, mold and mildew will grow. To dry your kayak, wipe it with a towel and empty any water from its hatch or drain plug. Any fabric or soft materials on your kayak, such as the seat, should be removed for storage. This is especially important when storing outside. Soft materials should be stored somewhere dry and not too cold, like in a closet. Whether storing your kayak outside or inside, it is a good idea to use a cover. This will protect your kayak from the elements outside and from dust and critters in a garage. You can buy a special kayak cover, use a cover for the cockpit, or use a simple tarp and drape it over your kayak for added protection. It using a tarp, it is best to create space between the tarp and the kayak so that water or snow will not build up on top of the kayak (if it is outside) and so that any remaining moisture isn’t locked inside the kayak. To use the tarp like a tent, tie a rope a few feet off the ground in between two trees or poles. Drape the tarp over the rope and place the kayak in its mini “tent.”","completion":"The article explains how to properly store a kayak by measuring the space and choosing an appropriate location, avoiding extreme temperatures and sunlight, cleaning and drying it, removing soft materials, and using a cover or tarp for protection."}]`),Y={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:B},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:M,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const i=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return i?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.prompt&&e.prompt.toLowerCase().includes(i)||e.completion&&e.completion.toLowerCase().includes(i)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(i=>setTimeout(i,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},P={class:"search-container"},H={class:"card-container"},D={key:0,class:"empty-state"},q=["disabled"],j={key:0},R={key:1};function N(i,e,h,m,n,s){const p=g("PoemCard");return a(),o("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",P,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>n.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,n.searchQuery]]),n.searchQuery?(a(),o("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>n.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",H,[(a(!0),o(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,f)=>(a(),k(p,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),o("div",D,' No results found for "'+d(n.searchQuery)+'".
