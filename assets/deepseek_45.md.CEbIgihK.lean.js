Answer:","completion":"The newspaper you are referring to, of which David Dinsmore is a former editor, is The Sun. The Sun, a British tabloid newspaper, was originally launched as a broadsheet on September 15, 1964, by the International Publishing Corporation (IPC). It replaced the defunct Daily Herald. However, its circulation began to decline, and in 1969, Rupert Murdoch's News Corp acquired the newspaper. On November 17, 1969, Rupert Murdoch relaunched The Sun as a tabloid newspaper. He wanted to turn the struggling newspaper into a more dynamic and sensationalist daily publication that would appeal to a wider audience. It was at this time that The Sun transformed into the tabloid that it is known as today. The move to a tabloid format significantly impacted the overall style and content of the paper, focusing more on human-interest stories, sports, and sensational news items. Today, The Sun remains one of the largest daily newspapers in the United Kingdom. David Dinsmore served as the editor of The Sun from June 2013 to September 2015. He played a significant role in overseeing the paper's direction during his tenure. In 2015, he was succeeded by Tony Gallagher, who is the current editor of the newspaper."},{"prompt":"Given the following context: Candaules, King of Lydia, Shews his Wife by Stealth to Gyges, One of his Ministers, as She Goes to Bed, occasionally formerly known as The Imprudence of Candaules, is a 45.1 by 55.9 cm (17.8 by 22.0 in) oil painting on canvas by English artist William Etty, first exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1830. It shows a scene from the Histories by Herodotus, in which Candaules, king of Lydia, invites his bodyguard Gyges to hide in the couple's bedroom and watch his wife Nyssia undress, to prove to him her beauty. Nyssia notices Gyges spying and challenges him to either accept his own execution or to kill Candaules as a punishment. Gyges chooses to kill Candaules and take his place as king. The painting shows the moment at which Nyssia, still unaware that she is being watched by anyone other than her husband, removes the last of her clothes. Etty hoped that his audience would take from the painting the moral lesson that women are not chattels and that men infringing on their rights should justly be punished, but he made little effort to explain this to audiences. The painting was immediately controversial and perceived as a cynical combination of a pornographic image and a violent and unpleasant narrative, and it was condemned as an immoral piece of the type one would expect from a foreign, not a British, artist. It was bought by Robert Vernon on its exhibition, and in 1847 was one of a number of paintings given by Vernon to the nation. The work retained its controversial reputation in later years, and when The Art Journal bought the reproduction rights to Vernon's former collection in 1849 they did not distribute reproductions of Candaules. In 1929 it was among several paintings transferred to the newly expanded Tate Gallery, where as of 2018 it remains. answer the following question: Where does the painting that not get distribution of reproductions reside today?","completion":"The painting resides at the Tate Gallery."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Greg and Paul were two neighbors. They were both into mycology. Greg researched AM fungi, while Paul studied other types of mycorrhizal fungi. Which researcher learned more about AM fungi reallocating their resources to intraradical hyphae? Hint: Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi vary across many environmental gradients. Their tolerance to freezing and drying is known to shift between AM fungal taxa. AM fungi become less prevalent and diverse at higher soil nutrient and moisture concentrations, presumably because both plants allocate less carbon to AM fungi and AM fungi reallocate their resources to intraradical hyphae in these environmental conditions. Over the long term, these environmental conditions can even create local adaptation between plant hosts, AM fungi and the local soil nutrient concentrations. A:","completion":"To answer this question, I will first analyze the given information and then compare the knowledge of the two researchers. Step 1: Analyze the information provided - Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi vary across environmental gradients. - Their tolerance to freezing and drying shifts between AM fungal taxa. - AM fungi become less prevalent and diverse in higher soil nutrient and moisture concentrations. - In these conditions, plants allocate less carbon to AM fungi, and AM fungi reallocate their resources to intraradical hyphae. - Long-term environmental conditions can create local adaptation between plant hosts, AM fungi, and local soil nutrient concentrations. Step 2: Compare the knowledge of Greg and Paul - Greg researched AM fungi. - Paul studied other types of mycorrhizal fungi (not specifically AM fungi). Step 3: Determine which researcher learned more about AM fungi reallocating their resources to intraradical hyphae Since Greg specifically researched AM fungi, it is likely that he learned more about their characteristics, including their resource allocation to intraradical hyphae. Paul, on the other hand, studied other types of mycorrhizal fungi and may not have focused as much on the specific traits of AM fungi. Conclusion: Greg, who researched AM fungi, likely learned more about AM fungi reallocating their resources to intraradical hyphae."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Choose option [a] for tying an overhand knot, as it provides the correct technique for forming the knot. Option [b] does not result in the desired outcome. 2. To begin, I would take a piece of string, rope, or cord to be knotted. Choosing the right material ensures the knot will hold securely and function as intended. 3.

Toshi, the protagonist of this narrative, reflects on an earlier performance which may have been evidently awkward or uncomfortable for him. During an interview, presumably with a journalist or a media personality, Toshi opens up about an acting or artistic experience that took place on stage. The use of \\"great embarrassment\\" emphasizes the level of distress or unease that Toshi associates with this past event. However, without further context, it is difficult to pinpoint the exact nature of Toshi's stage experience. It could range from a failed performance, a wardrobe malfunction, or even an emotional or mental breakdown while being on stage. It can be inferred that the incident had a significant impact on Toshi, to the point where it was still ingrained in his memory during the interview. It is likely that the intent behind sharing this story in the interview is to humanize Toshi, allowing the audience to empathize with him and see that even successful individuals face difficult situations in their professional journeys. Additionally, discussing it might have been a cathartic move for Toshi, providing him a chance to be open and honest about an unpleasant memory that, in hindsight, shaped his career or personal growth. In conclusion, Toshi's disclosure of his embarrassing stage experience serves as a window into the vulnerability and struggles faced by artists and performers, allowing us to see that they are not immune to mishaps.

Q: SEOUL — Despite recent tensions over North Korea’s nuclear and missile tests, life is actually quite normal for American military families living at Camp Humphreys in South Korea, which is the largest overseas Army installation in the world. Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Puskas tries to come to most of his daughters’ high school soccer games at Camp Humphreys. In fact, his family’s lifestyle at this sprawling U.S. military base is similar to one they would lead back home. “We go to church on Sundays. We see all our friends there. We’re on the soccer field most of the afternoons, or just going for bike ride, the same things we would do if we were back in the States,” said Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Puskas, with the U.S. Eight Army. This is Puskas’ fourth tour in Korea. He met and married his Korean wife Mi-jung, during an earlier tour. His children have spent much of their lives at military bases in Korea. “I think it has given me a wider world view and has helped me understand other people a lot more,” said Elizabeth Puskas, the eldest daughter of the family who will attend college next year in the United States. The U.S. military in Korea is consolidating its forces in Camp Humphreys, including its military headquarters, as it moves to close older bases in congested Seoul and other regions of the country. Camp Humphreys is now the size of a small city, encompassing over 140 square kilometers of land, with construction underway to expand its capacity to accommodate over 40,000 people. There are modern apartments for soldiers and their families, schools, movie theaters, shopping centers and fast food restaurants to help bring some of the comforts of home to military life in Korea. The base even has its own golf course. “I have been around the army for part of the last 40 years as a soldier and now as a civilian, and this is as normal as any army post I’ve ever been on.

Blackman's departure from the Scottish Affairs Committee will enable her to focus on the unique challenges faced by Aberdeen North, a diverse constituency with a population of over 80,000, consisting of urban centers, smaller towns, and vast rural areas. By being more present in her constituency, Blackman aims to identify and tackle these issues more effectively and to give a stronger voice to her constituents in the Scottish and UK parliaments. The importance of spending time in one's constituency cannot be overstated for a Member of Parliament. This allows them to build and maintain strong relationships with their constituents and keep their finger on the pulse of local concerns and aspirations. In turn, this enables MPs to better represent the broader context of the community and to inform their decision-making and voting records in Parliament. Aberdeen North has faced various challenges over recent years, ranging from the city's dwindling oil industry, high unemployment rates, affordable housing, and ongoing issues related to poverty and homelessness. Another key issue requiring attention in the area is the continuing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including its effects on the local economy, essential services such as healthcare, and education. By more actively engaging with the locals, community leaders, and various stakeholders, Kirsty Blackman will be better equipped to address these pressing concerns and work on viable solutions. This approach requires liaising with a mix of institutions, businesses, and individuals to identify the best possible outcomes for all parties involved. In addition to working on local issues, Blackman's departure from the Scottish Affairs Committee does not signify that she will disengage from matters of national and international importance. She will continue to make her voice heard on key issues such as Scotland's independence, climate change, and social justice, using her increased understanding of her constituent's needs to inform her positions on these topics. In conclusion, Kirsty Blackman's decision to step down from Westminster's Scottish Affairs Committee to dedicate more time to her Aberdeen North constituency demonstrates her commitment to her constituents and a willingness to listen, learn, and address their challenges and aspirations. As she takes on this new, locally-focused challenge, her constituents can expect a more accessible, accountable, and informed representative, ready to fight for their interests both at home and on the national stage."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Brown claimed that he was a co-founder and that his contributions to the original concept and design of the app warranted recognition and monetary compensation. Following a legal back-and-forth between the parties, the case was scheduled for trial. In the midst of preparing for the potentially damaging and high-profile lawsuit, Snapchat faced external challenges as well. While the company continued to grow at an astonishing pace, bolstering partnerships with major brands and expanding their user base, competitors like Instagram and Facebook introduced similar features, aiming to capture a slice of the ephemeral messaging market. Amidst these mounting challenges, it became apparent to Spiegel, Murphy, and Brown that resolving the lawsuit would prove beneficial to everyone involved. In September 2014, the three sat down for negotiations, hoping to reach an amicable agreement that acknowledged Brown's contributions. After several days of discussion, they finally settled on an undisclosed sum. Brown's lawyer announced that the settlement amount was 'mutually satisfactory,' and the lawsuit was dismissed, allowing for all parties to move on from the conflict. Once the case was resolved, the now-acknowledged co-founder Frank Reginald Brown IV released a public statement expressing his relief at the settlement. 'I am gratified that the dispute has now been resolved and my contributions to the initial creation of Snapchat have been recognized,' he said. 'I am now looking forward to pursuing new opportunities and continuing to innovate.' With the lawsuit behind them, Spiegel, Murphy, and Brown were able to focus on their individual pursuits, as they had all learned valuable lessons from the experience. Snapchat continued to thrive as an essential digital communication platform, maintaining its strong user base and devising new ways to generate revenue. Brown, with his considerable financial settlement, pursued personal projects and continued to innovate, venturing into the technology industry by investing in various start-ups. In the years following the settlement, Snapchat continued to evolve while facing increased competition. Spiegel and Murphy remained committed to driving the company forward as they implemented new features, advertising strategies, and partnerships. Meanwhile, Brown took the knowledge and experience he had gained from the creation of Snapchat and channeled it into new endeavors. Ultimately, the story ended with each of the three parties acknowledging their respective roles in the creation and success of Snapchat. They were able to settle their differences and close this particular chapter in their lives, moving forward wiser and with a greater understanding of the value of collaboration, communication, and innovation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:I read this background article the other day: Farsightedness, or hyperopia, is the condition in which distant objects are seen clearly, but nearby objects appear blurry. It occurs when the eyeball is shorter than normal (see Figure below ). This causes images to be focused in a spot that would fall behind the retina (if light could pass through the retina). Hyperopia can be corrected with convex lenses. The lenses focus images farther forward in the eye, so they fall on the retina instead of behind it.

Summarize this article: For Americans across the nation, housing expenses are typically the largest costs of living. Not only is a house the biggest purchase in most Americans’ lives, but also monthly rent or mortgage payments often exceed what is spent on food, luxury, savings, and transportation combined. Similarly, property taxes make up the bulk of taxes paid each year by most people in the United States. Property taxation is almost always done at the state and local level. A range of government bodies, including cities, counties, school boards, safety departments, and utility commissions, levy property taxes in a variety of ways. Of the 3.1 trillion in taxes the federal government collected in fiscal 2014, more than two-thirds came from income and payroll taxes. Only 1% came from estate and trust taxes — levied on the exchange of property after death and perhaps the only federal tax that could be considered a property tax. Click here to see the states with the highest (and lowest) property taxes. Using data from the Tax Foundation, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed property taxes paid in each state as a percentage of home values. The effective property tax rate is as high as 2.38% in New Jersey, and as low as 0.28% in Hawaii. Compared to sales, income, corporate, and other forms of taxation, property taxes make up the largest share of state and local tax collections in 26 states. In most cases this was due to the high effective tax rate. In a few states the absence of other major tax types could explain the disproportionate reliance on property taxation. Of the 25 states with the highest property tax rates, Delaware, Wyoming, Virginia, Montana, and Nevada residents do not pay at least one major tax whatsoever. Six of the 25 states levying the lowest property tax rates also do not have at least one major tax. In 16 of the top 25 states, property taxes make up at least a third of state and local tax collections. In New Hampshire, more than two-thirds of state and local taxes come from property taxes. Of the 25 states collecting the lowest property tax rates, property taxes accounted for one-third or more of collections in only four states. General sales or other taxes tended to comprise the bulk of taxes collected by these states. Home values are taken into consideration by state and local governments when determining property tax rates. Values can also often dictate how much revenue state and local governments collect in the form of property taxes. However, the states with the highest property tax rates do not necessarily have the most expensive housing markets, nor do low-tax states necessarily have relatively low home values. New Jersey, New Hampshire, Vermont, Connecticut, and New York are each home to some of the highest property tax rates nationwide as well as some of the highest home values. Other states such as Wisconsin, Texas, and Nebraska, however, also have relatively high property tax rates but also below average home values. Hawaii, where the typical owner-occupied housing unit is valued at 528,000 — the highest in the country — also has the lowest effective property tax rate of any state. To identify the states with the highest and lowest property taxes, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed 2013 average effective property tax rates on owner-occupied housing in each state from the Tax Foundation. Taxes paid by businesses, renters, and others were excluded from the Tax Foundation’s calculation. Total property tax collections per capita from 2006 through 2013, the sources of tax collections by tax type for 2012, and state and local tax burdens as a percentage of state income for each state in 2013 also came from the Tax Foundation. Property tax collections are based on the average property tax deduction taken on the Schedule A, per tax return, from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). While this is not equivalent to the average property collections at the state level, this estimate is often used as an estimate. Cost of living figures in 2013 for each state came from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). Household median income, median home value, and poverty rates came from the U.S. Census Bureau’s 2014 American Community Survey (ACS).

A house is the biggest purchase in most Americans’ lives, and monthly rent or mortgage payments often exceed what is spent on food, luxury items, savings, and transportation combined. Property taxes, which are usually done at the state and local level, make up the bulk of the taxes paid each year by most people in the United States. The effective property tax rate varies across the country, with New Jersey having the highest rate at 2.38% and Hawaii having the lowest at 0.28%. Property taxes account for the largest share of state and local tax collections in 26 states. Home values are taken into consideration when determining property tax rates and can often dictate how much revenue state and local governments collect in the form of property taxes. However, states with the highest property tax rates do not necessarily have the most expensive housing markets, nor do low-tax states necessarily have relatively low home values."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

He was voted the \\"10th Greatest Guitarist\\" by Guitar World magazine, and has sold over 15 million records. A three-time Grammy Award winner and fifteen-time nominee, Vai started his music career in 1978 at the age of 18 as a transcriptionist for Frank Zappa, and joined his band from 1980 to 1983. He embarked on a solo career in 1983 and has released eight solo albums to date. Steve Vai, a descendant of Italian immigrants, was born in Carle Place, New York on June 6, 1960. He is the fourth son of John and Theresa Vai. He described his first experiences with music as, \\"at the age of five I walked up to [a] piano, hit a note, and noticed that to the right the notes go higher and to the left the notes go lower. In that very moment, I had a full-on epiphany. I was flooded with the instinctual realization of how music was created and how it worked from a theoretical standpoint--the whole language of music was very obvious. I also understood immediately, instinctually, and unequivocally something that has only deepened through the years that the creation of music is an infinite personal expression. I realized that I could do this, I could make music, and it could be whatever I want.\\" It was a year later, at the age of six, that Vai experienced his first introduction to the guitar, remembering that, \\"I saw this nine-year-old boy playing the guitar in my grade school auditorium, and that was another epiphany that I had. It was my first recognition of the instrument. When I saw that guitar and I saw this kid playing it, I knew instinctually that I was going to play the guitar someday, and that it would be my instrument. Don't ask me how I knew, I just knew. It was the coolest thing I had ever seen.\\" As a young child, Vai was influenced by the music his parents had listened to. One album in particular that he cites as his \\"musical awakening\\" was the original motion picture soundtrack to the 1961 film West Side Story. At age eleven, Vai was introduced to the contemporary rock and progressive music of the era, and after hearing the guitar solo to Led Zeppelin's \\"Heartbreaker\\" at age twelve, decided to begin playing the guitar. In 1973, Vai began to take guitar lessons from fellow New York native Joe Satriani, and played in local bands (The Ohio Express, Circus, and Rayge) throughout his high school years. Vai cites artists such as Jimmy Page, Brian May, Ritchie Blackmore, Jeff Beck, Jimi Hendrix, as well as jazz fusion guitarists Allan Holdsworth and Al Di Meola as some of his major influences in that time period. In 1978, to further pursue his interest in music composition and theory, Vai attended Berklee College of Music in Boston, Massachusetts. While at Berklee, Vai began working for Frank Zappa as a transcriptionist, and in the middle of his fourth semester, moved to California to start his career as a session and touring artist for Zappa. Also while at Berklee, Vai met his future spouse Pia Maiocco, with whom he has been together since; they have two children. In 2000, Vai was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Music from Berklee.

What evidence supports this claim?","completion":"The claim that the sports world is unfairly dominated by a male-orientated world-view is supported by several pieces of evidence. This evidence can be seen through various aspects, including media coverage, pay disparity, representation in leadership, and cultural perception. Here, we will outline a detailed analysis of each area. 1. Media coverage: One of the most apparent examples of male dominance in the sports world is the disproportionate amount of media coverage for male and female athletes. Various studies have shown that women's sports only receive a small fraction of sports media coverage. For instance, a 25-year longitudinal study conducted by the University of Southern California's Center for Feminist Research indicates that despite the growing popularity of women's sports, media coverage has remained relatively stagnant, with women receiving only 4.9% of all media coverage globally. 2. Pay disparity: The gender pay gap is another significant issue in the world of sports. The salaries of male athletes, particularly in popular sports like soccer, basketball, and tennis, are considerably higher than their female counterparts. For example, Forbes' 2021 list of highest-paid athletes did not include a single woman among the top 50. This clear pay disparity is also evident in prize money for various sports competitions around the world. Despite some sports having equal prize money, like in tennis majors, others continue to have substantial pay differences. 3. Representation in leadership and coaching roles: Another crucial aspect that supports the claim of male dominance in sports is the underrepresentation of women in leadership roles within sports organizations. This extends to both coaching and administrative roles. Data from the Tucker Center for Research on Girls & Women in Sport reveals that only 42.9% of head coaches in collegiate women's sports are women. Additionally, looking at the larger sports organizations, such as the International Olympic Committee (IOC), only 33.3% of the members are women, while in the executive board, it's just 30.8% (data as of January 2021). 4. Cultural perception and sexism: In some societies, there is still a prevalent cultural perception that women are unsuitable for sports or cannot perform at the same level as men. This perception is further reinforced by the presence of stereotypes and media portrayals that often objectify female athletes, evaluating them based on their appearance rather than their athletic abilities. Similarly, female athletes often face sexism, prejudice, and underestimation of their achievements. This can contribute to female athletes receiving less sponsorship and marketing opportunities compared to their male counterparts. 5. Lack of resources and investment: The unequal distribution of resources and investment in women's sports is another factor that supports the claim of male dominance in the sports world. Many female athletes struggle with inadequate training facilities, lack of funding, and minimal support, resulting in a disparity in performance and development between male and female athletes in certain sports. Schools and colleges may also prioritize male sports programs which further perpetuates this disparity. In conclusion, the prevalence of male dominance in the sports world is evident through the disparities in media coverage, pay, representation in leadership roles, cultural perception, and the unequal distribution of resources and investment. The deeply entrenched presence of these factors reflects the male-orientated world-view dominating the sports industry, highlighting the need for social and institutional changes to ensure equal opportunities and recognition for all athletes, regardless of their gender."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What industry was hit by a global depression?, using the article: The Kingdom of Mysore reached a peak in economic power under Hyder Ali and Tipu Sultan, in the post-Mughal era of the mid-late 18th century. They embarked on an ambitious program of economic development, aiming to increase the wealth and revenue of Mysore. Under their reign, Mysore overtook the Bengal Subah as India's dominant economic power, with productive agriculture and textile manufacturing.Tipu Sultan is credited with founding state trading depots in various locations of his kingdom. In addition, he founded depots in foreign locations such as Karachi, Jeddah and Muscat, where Mysore products were sold. During Tipu's rule French technology was used for the first time in carpentry and smithing, Chinese technology was used for sugar production, and technology from Bengal helped improve the sericulture industry. State factories were established in Kanakapura and Taramandelpeth for producing cannons and gunpowder respectively. The state held the monopoly in the production of essentials such as sugar, salt, iron, pepper, cardamom, betel nut, tobacco and sandalwood, as well as the extraction of incense oil from sandalwood and the mining of silver, gold and precious stones. Sandalwood was exported to China and the Persian Gulf countries and sericulture was developed in twenty-one centers within the kingdom.The Mysore silk industry was initiated during the rule of Tipu Sultan. Later the industry was hit by a global depression and competition from imported silk and rayon. In the second half of the 20th century, it however revived and the Mysore State became the top multivoltine silk producer in India.Under Tipu Sultan, Mysore enjoyed one of the world's highest real wages and living standards in the late 18th century, higher than Britain, which in turn had the highest living standards in Europe. Mysore's average per-capita income was five times higher than subsistence level, i.e. five times higher than 400 (1990 international dollars), or 2,000 per capita.

Question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What was the name of the person who supported himself in England? ? In 1870, concerned at the dominance of German music and the lack of opportunity for young French composers to have their works played, Saint-Saëns and Romain Bussine, professor of singing at the Conservatoire, discussed the founding of a society to promote new French music. Before they could take the proposal further, the Franco-Prussian War broke out. Saint-Saëns served in the National Guard during the war. During the brief but bloody Paris Commune that followed, his superior at the Madeleine, the Abbé Deguerry, was murdered by rebels; Saint-Saëns was fortunate to escape to temporary exile in England where he arrived in May 1871. With the help of George Grove and others he supported himself while there, giving recitals. Returning to Paris in the same year, he found that anti-German sentiments had considerably enhanced support for the idea of a pro-French musical society. The Société Nationale de Musique, with its motto, \\"Ars Gallica\\", had been established in February 1871, with Bussine as president, Saint-Saëns as vice-president and Henri Duparc, Fauré, Franck and Jules Massenet among its founder-members. As an admirer of Liszt's innovative symphonic poems, Saint-Saëns enthusiastically adopted the form; his first \\"poème symphonique\\" was Le Rouet d'Omphale (1871), premiered at a concert of the Sociéte Nationale in January 1872. In the same year, after more than a decade of intermittent work on operatic scores, Saint-Saëns finally had one of his operas staged. La princesse jaune (\\"The Yellow Princess\\"), a one-act, light romantic piece, was given at the Opéra-Comique, Paris in June. It ran for five performances.Throughout the 1860s and early 1870s, Saint-Saëns had continued to live a bachelor existence, sharing a large fourth-floor flat in the Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré with his mother. In 1875, he surprised many by marrying. The groom was approaching forty and his bride was nineteen; she was Marie-Laure Truffot, the sister of one of the composer's pupils. The marriage was not a success. In the words of the... Answer:","completion":"The name of the person who supported himself in England is Camille Saint-Saëns.

Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","completion":"Answer 1: Geography Day Celebrated on January 14 Geography Day is celebrated on January 14 to honor the birthday of Alexander von Humboldt, a Prussian geographer, naturalist, and explorer who significantly contributed to the field of geography. Born on September 14, 1769, Humboldt is best known for his exploration of Latin America, during which he collected a vast amount of data on the region's physical geography, climate, flora, and fauna. His work had a profound impact on geography as a discipline, as well as on the scientific community in general, as it stimulated further exploration and research in numerous fields. Among his most significant contributions are the concept of \\"isotherms\\" – the lines on a map that connect areas of equal temperatures – and his extensive research on climate zones. To honor his immense contributions, January 14 is celebrated as Geography Day to raise awareness about the importance of geography and its critical role in understanding our planet and its various natural phenomena. Answer 2: The Celebration of November 14 November 14 is celebrated for various reasons across the world, depending on the specific country or culture. In India, for example, November 14 is observed as Children's Day in remembrance of the birthday of Jawaharlal Nehru, the first Prime Minister of India. Nehru had a special affection for children and was often affectionately referred to as \\"Chacha Nehru\\" (Uncle Nehru). The day emphasizes the importance of nurturing and educating children, who are the future of the nation. In another instance, World Diabetes Day is also observed on November 14. This global event was introduced in 1991 by the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) and the World Health Organization (WHO) to address the escalating health risks associated with diabetes. November 14 was chosen to honor the birthday of Sir Frederick Banting, who co-discovered insulin along with Charles Best in 1921. The day is aimed at raising awareness about diabetes, its prevention, and the importance of proper healthcare for people with diabetes. Conclusion: Though they share a common purpose of raising awareness and honoring important personalities, the reasons for celebrating Geography Day on January 14 and November 14 events are not the same. Geography Day is specifically dedicated to celebrating the achievements of Alexander von Humboldt, while November 14 covers a variety of occasions such as Children's Day in India and World Diabetes Day. Each of these celebrations is unique and has its distinct significance."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

Title: Balls of Fury Movie plot: Eleven year old Randy Daytona becomes anxious when he learns that his father Peter has bet on his performance in the 1988 Summer Olympics table tennis finals. During his first game between his opponent Karl Wolfschtagg from the German Democratic Republic, Daytona has an accident and suffers an injury. Unable to continue, he loses the match. Loan sharks in the employ of criminal mastermind Feng murder his father, and Daytona leaves competitive ping-pong. Nineteen years later, Daytona is dismissed from the Peppermill casino and meets FBI agent Ernie Rodriguez, who requests his assistance in arresting Feng for running guns. Feng's hidden jungle hideout hosts a black-market Ping-Pong tournament, and Daytona's invitation is a way for the FBI to infiltrate Feng's organization. When Daytona agrees, Rodriguez tells him to win enough championships that Feng's scouts notice him. After losing a local tournament, Daytona is apprenticed to a blind man in Chinatown named Wong, who was Feng's former mentor. Daytona also meets Wong's niece, Maggie. When locals vandalize Master Wong's house for violating their edict against teaching white people ping pong, Daytona is forced to play against \\"The Dragon\\", a young girl, in exchange for Wong's right to stay. After Daytona beats the Dragon, Feng's men take notice of his win and bring Daytona, Rodriguez, and Wong to Feng's facility. Daytona handily beats his first opponent, Freddy \\"Fingers\\" Wilson, though he is unnerved to learn that the tournament is literally sudden deathâthe loser is killed by a poisoned dart delivered by Feng's majordomo, Mahogany. After Daytona attempts unsuccessfully to escape, Feng invites him to join his side and reveals that he only finished half of Wong's training. He says it would be the ultimate satisfaction to win Daytona away from Wong. Feng also shows Daytona his specially modified ping-pong table.

A re-recorded version of the song \\"M-80 (Explosive Energy Movement)\\" was featured in the game \\"Amplitude\\". The song \\"She Loves Me Not\\" was featured in the game \\"NHL 2003\\". The songs \\"She Loves Me Not\\" and \\"Walking Thru Barbed Wire\\" were recorded in 1999 and can be found on Papa Roach's 1999 release.

Popular music composers and songwriters are often multi-instrumentalists. In pop and rock, it is more common than in classical or jazz for performers to be multi-instrumentalists on instruments that are not from the same family: it is common for pop and rock musicians to play both guitar and keyboards. Many bluegrass musicians are multi-instrumentalists. Some musicians' unions or associations specify a higher rate of pay for musicians who double on two or more instruments for a performance or recording. - Montreal officially Montréal in both Canadian English and French, is the most populous municipality in Quebec and the 2nd-most populous in Canada.

From the 17th through 19th centuries, the merging of folk beliefs about group differences with scientific explanations of those differences produced what one scholar has called an \\"ideology of race\\". According to this ideology, races are primordial, natural, enduring and distinct. It was further argued that some groups may be the result of mixture between formerly distinct populations, but that careful study could distinguish the ancestral races that had combined to produce admixed groups.

Blot the liquid until there is very little left on the surface of the mattress. Do not rub the mattress to remove the liquid, as this will just make the liquid absorb more into the mattress. Take a few teaspoons of baking soda and sprinkle it on the mattress. Let it sit on the mattress for a few minutes. The baking soda will help to absorb any remaining liquid on the mattress and remove odor. After the baking soda has been on the mattress for a few minutes, vacuum it up. Use an all-purpose cleaner for fabric on the mattress. You can also make your own cleaner by combining one part warm water and one part white vinegar. Spray the cleaner on the mattress and let it sit for three to five minutes. Make sure you cover all of the wet areas on the mattress with the cleaner. You can apply several layers of the cleaner to the mattress if the smell is strong. Use a dry towel or cloth to blot the mattress once the cleaner has been absorbed. Blot the entire mattress well. This will prevent mold in the mattress and ensure the mattress is as dry as possible. Sprinkle the mattress one more time with the baking soda. Then, let the mattress air dry for at least 18 hours. This will ensure the mattress has time to completely dry. You may need to sleep somewhere else for the night if you were planning on sleeping on the mattress. Do not try to sleep on the mattress until it is completely dry. Once the mattress has time to dry, use a vacuum to clean up the baking soda. You can then put the mattress outside or in an area with good ventilation in your home. This will allow any remaining smell to fade away. Touch the mattress to confirm it is dry before you use it again.

Berg city used only gas powered vehicles while Hill city used electrical vehicles. The two cities had a similar population and vehicle numbers. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which city had fewer problems with carbon monoxide? Hint: Gasoline-powered vehicles emit a lot of harmful materials. Nitrogen oxides are formed when atmospheric nitrogen reacts with oxygen at the high temperatures found in a car engine. Carbon monoxide is a by-product of incomplete combustion of hydrocarbons. Evaporated and unused fuel releases volatile hydrocarbons into the atmosphere to help form smog. The presence of a catalytic converter in the exhaust system of the car causes these materials to react and be changed into less harmful products. A:","completion":"Hill city had fewer problems with carbon monoxide. Justification: From the provided information, gasoline-powered vehicles, like those in Berg city, emit a lot of harmful substances including carbon monoxide, a byproduct of incomplete combustion of hydrocarbons. With the city fully dependent on such vehicles, it's logical to infer that the levels of carbon monoxide would be relatively high. On the contrary, Hill city uses electrical vehicles, which do not burn fossil fuels like gasoline, so they won't produce carbon monoxide emissions directly. Therefore, Hill city would have fewer problems with carbon monoxide compared to Berg city."},{"prompt":"Instructions: Indicate if the following Polish tweet contains cyber-bullying content with 'Yes'; otherwise, respond with 'No'.

Answer the following question given this paragraph: The diagrams above can serve as a pathway to understanding evolutionary history. The pathway can be traced from the origin of life to any individual species by navigating through the evolutionary branches between the two points. Also, by starting with a single species and tracing back towards the \\"trunk\\" of the tree, one can discover that species' ancestors, as well as where lineages share a common ancestry. In addition, the tree can be used to study entire groups of organisms. Another point to mention on phylogenetic tree structure is that rotation at branch points does not change the information. For example, if a branch point was rotated and the taxon order changed, this would not alter the information because the evolution of each taxon from the branch point was independent of the other. Many disciplines within the study of biology contribute to understanding how past and present life evolved over time; these disciplines together contribute to building, updating, and maintaining the “tree of life. ” Information is used to organize and classify organisms based on evolutionary relationships in a scientific field called systematics. Data may be collected from fossils, from studying the structure of body parts or molecules used by an organism, and by DNA analysis. By combining data from many sources, scientists can put together the phylogeny of an organism; since phylogenetic trees are hypotheses, they will continue to change as new types of life are discovered and new information is learned.

You can put it under your pillow and look forward to finding some money there in the morning. And then you can watch your new permanent tooth grow in its place. But if a permanent tooth falls out, that's a problem. There isn't another one under the gum that can replace it. Unfortunately, this happens to some older people. And if permanent teeth fall out-or need to be pulled-an older person might need dentures. Dentures, known as false teeth, are a set of replacement teeth for any teeth that are missing. There are partial dentures, which take the place of only a few teeth and prevent the others from changing position. If all the teeth are gone, the person would need complete dentures, which replace every tooth in the mouth. Dentures can cause pains at first and take little time to get adjusted to. They also need special care. They should be brushed daily with a special denture brush and cleanser and soaked in denture solution when not in the mouth. Dentures are important for older folks because, without teeth, it's hard to smile, talk, and eat properly. But it can be a little _ if you see someone take out his or her dentures. It can also be strange to see someone, like a grandparent, without dentures in because he or she won't have any teeth. Try not to make fun of the person because this could cause hurt feelings. People usually lose their permanent teeth due to periodontal disease, or gum disease, which is caused by bacteria that attacks the gums. Diseased gums aren't strong and healthy, so teeth can get loose and fall out. Older people often have many cavities that have been filled over the years, and these fillings can weaken over time, leading to more tooth decay. Question: A person wearing dentures_.

He said he nearly threw the bottle back into the water after pulling it out of a fishing net. Then he noticed something inside. The bottle in good condition contained a Danish postcard with two German stamps,dated May 17,1913. Although dampness had made most of the writing illegible ,the readable part of the message asked whoever found it to return it to an address in Berlin. It even contained two stamps to pay for postage. From the address,researchers found that the postcard was written by a man named Richard Platz,who was 20 years old when he wrote the message. While he was hiking on the Baltic coast with a nature appreciation group,he threw the bottle into the sea. Then the researchers began a search for any living relatives of his.

Speaking with reporters in the Oval Office, Trump said that he congratulated Putin -- a figure who has loomed over his administration because of Russia's meddling in the 2016 election -- on winning another term. The result of the election, however, was never in doubt, given Putin's autocratic stranglehold on power.

At Eynsford, with Moeran as his co-tenant, Heseltine presided over a bohemian household with a flexible population of artists, musicians and friends. Moeran had studied at the Royal College of Music before and after the First World War; he avidly collected folk music and had admired Delius during his youth. Although they had much in common, he and Heseltine rarely worked together, though they did co-write a song, \\"Maltworms\\". The other permanent Eynsford residents were Barbara Peache, Heseltine's long-term girlfriend whom he had known since the early 1920s, and Hal Collins, a New Zealand Māori who acted as a general factotum. Peache was described by Delius's assistant Eric Fenby as \\"a very quiet, attractive girl, quite different from Phil's usual types\\". Although not formally trained, Collins was a gifted graphic designer and occasional composer, who sometimes assisted Heseltine. The household was augmented at various times by the composers William Walton and Constant Lambert, the artist Nina Hamnett, and sundry acquaintances of both sexes.The ambience at Eynsford was one of alcohol (the \\"Five Bells\\" public house was conveniently across the road) and uninhibited sexual activity. These years are the primary basis for the Warlock legends of wild living and debauchery. Visitors to the house left accounts of orgies, all-night drunken parties, and rough horseplay that at least once brought police intervention. However, such activities were mainly confined to weekends; within this unconventional setting Heseltine accomplished much work, including settings from the Jacobean dramatist John Webster and the modern poet Hilaire Belloc, and the Capriol Suite in versions for string and full orchestra. Heseltine continued to transcribe early music, wrote articles and criticism, and finished the book on Gesualdo. He attempted to restore the reputation of a neglected Elizabethan composer, Thomas Whythorne, with a long pamphlet which, years later, brought significant amendments to Whythorne's entry in The History of Music in...

Her father made a great deal of money in trade. During school,her parents took her to Italy to explore the country's many cultural treasures. One of the private art collections Isabella visited in Milan had a deep influence on her. She wrote to her friends about her dream of owning a house one day with an art collection like the one she had seen in Italy. In Paris, Isabella became a close friend of one of her classmates, Julia Gardner, whose family was from Boston. Julia would later introduce Isabella to her brother, Jack. In 1860, Isabella Stewart married Jack Gardner. The couple had too much art to fit inside their home. So they decided to start planning a museum. Mrs. Gardner didn't like the cold and empty spaces of many museums during her time. She wanted a warm museum filled with light. She once said that she decided years ago that _ . America was a young country developing quickly in other areas. But the country needed more chances for people to see beautiful examples of art. After her husband's death in 1898, Isabella knew she had no time to lose in building her museum. She bought land, hired a building designer, and supervised every detail of her museum's construction. Mrs. Gardner opened her museum on January 1,1903. The museum was then called Fenway Court. She invited her friends that night for a special musical performance. The next month, she opened the museum to the public. At first, visits were limited to twenty days out of the year. Visitors paid one dollar to enter. Isabella Stewart Gardner died in 1924 in Boston.

Context: The White House says China's proposal to abolish presidential term limits — a move that could make Xi Jinping president for life — is an internal matter for Beijing. \\"I believe that's a decision for China to make about what's best for their country,\\" press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said at a Monday press briefing. Term limits, Sanders said, are something Trump \\"supports here in the United States, but that's a decision that would be up to China.\\" The Chinese Communist Party proposed removing the presidential two-term limit from China's constitution, state media reported Sunday. The move would be a further consolidation of power for Xi, who is already seen as one of China's most powerful leaders in decades. On Monday, U.S. President Donald Trump praised Xi, saying he has a \\"very good relationship\\" and \\"great respect\\" for the Chinese leader. \\"I think that President Xi is unique. He's helping us with North Korea,\\" Trump said during a White House meeting with U.S. governors. Trump has not specifically addressed the issue of China removing term limits. To some, Sanders' comments are the latest evidence of a break in the long-standing U.S. tradition of encouraging democracy in China, and reflect an unwillingness to criticize undemocratic regimes. \\"In effect, she is saying that the U.S. is OK with Xi Jinping simply asserting that he will remain in power indefinitely,\\" said Sophie Richardson, China director at Human Rights Watch. \\"Does she realize China isn't a democracy?\\" During the presidential campaign, Trump regularly slammed China and its trade policies. But since becoming president, Trump has toned down the criticism. Instead, Trump has prioritized working with China to address North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile programs. However, several reports suggest the White House could soon announce trade decisions, such as tariffs on Chinese imports, that could strain the U.S.-China relationship.

In fact, I’d have them draw one on the first day of school and one toward the end of the year and to see the change over time was always so interesting. At least once during the year, likely toward the beginning, I would center a lesson around self portraits. In younger classes, there would be more than one. Creating a self portrait teaches students to be aware of themselves. Where is her head in relation to her body? Where are her feet in relation to her legs? It also teaches children spatial awareness. Where should he begin…with his feet or with his head? Where on the paper should his head be placed? How far down should his arms go? How can his whole body fit on a single piece of paper? A Lesson on Creating Self Portraits Whether you are in a classroom, or teaching a child at home, here is a simple lesson on creating self portraits geared toward young children, anywhere from age 2 through age 6. Keep in mind that their final product will show various levels of writing development, depending on what stage of writing they are in. (Basically, a two-year-old’s drawing should look very different than that of a five-year-old.) The teacher will need to model how to draw a self portrait. Gather the children around an easel or board and clip a paper to it. Narrate the process as you walk through the steps. “I am going to draw a picture of myself. I am going to start with my head.” Use your hands to show your actual head on yourself so students are aware of what you talking about.

Sentence 1: 'You haven't shot me yet, Natalia,' I pointed out. Sentence 2: I pointed out that I had not been shot. If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","completion":"Yes, the second sentence is true if the first sentence is true. Here's why: In sentence 1, the speaker is addressing someone named Natalia, and they note, 'You haven't shot me yet, Natalia.' This is the speaker's way of pointing out that they have not been shot by Natalia. The phrase 'You haven't shot me yet' directly implies that the speaker has not been shot, and Natalia is the person who has not shot the speaker. In sentence 2, 'I pointed out that I had not been shot,' the speaker recounts the same information from the first sentence. This sentence, however, lacks the explicit mention of Natalia and the temporal marker 'yet.' Regardless, the underlying message stays the same: the speaker has not been shot. Therefore, if the first sentence is true (the speaker has not been shot by Natalia), then the second sentence is also true (the speaker has not been shot). However, it's crucial to note that while the second sentence can confirm that the speaker was not shot, it does not provide information about who has not shot the speaker and does not include the potential future implication carried by 'yet.' Nonetheless, if the speaker has truly not been shot, as stated in sentence 1, then sentence 2 is unquestionably valid because it states the same central event — the speaker has not been shot."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Born on October 29, 1948, in Birmingham, Alabama, Catherine Elise Jackson, professionally known as Kate Jackson, began her acting career with roles in various television series such as 'Dark Shadows,' 'The Rookies,' and 'The Six Million Dollar Man.' However, it was her portrayal of 'Sabrina Duncan' in 'Charlie's Angels' that catapulted her to stardom. The show, created by Ivan Goff and Ben Roberts, premiered on September 22, 1976, and was an instant hit. Kate Jackson starred alongside Farrah Fawcett and Jaclyn Smith, who played Jill Munroe and Kelly Garrett, respectively. The trio portrayed detectives working for an unseen and elusive millionaire named Charles Townsend, voiced by John Forsythe. The show's premise revolved around the crime-solving adventures of these three private detectives, who were referred to as \\"Angels\\" by their boss, Charlie. As Sabrina Duncan, Kate Jackson was the smart and resourceful member of the team, often taking the lead in investigating cases. Her character, considered the most level-headed among the Angels, played a crucial role in the strategies and planning needed to crack the case. Jackson starred in the first three seasons of 'Charlie's Angels' before leaving the show in 1979. Actress Shelley Hack replaced her in the fourth season, playing a new character, Tiffany Welles. Although Kate Jackson's time on 'Charlie's Angels' was limited to just three seasons, her portrayal of Sabrina Duncan had a lasting impact. The character remains an integral part of the show's history and a symbol of female empowerment in the male-dominated television landscape. Following 'Charlie's Angels,' Jackson continued her acting career with roles in television shows like 'Scarecrow and Mrs. King,' 'Baby Boom,' and 'The Silence of the Hams.' She also directed episodes of TV series and acted in numerous TV movies, cementing her legacy as a versatile and talented actress in the entertainment industry."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

March 11, 2004, attacks killed 191 people and wounded 1,800. Explosives were left on the Spanish trains in sports bags and backpacks.","completion":"Title: Remembering the Madrid Train Bombings: A Look Back at Spain's Deadliest Terrorist Attack Five Years On On March 11, 2021, Spain commemorated the fifth anniversary of the Madrid train bombings, an event that shook the nation and the world. The March 11, 2004 attacks, popularly known as 11-M, claimed the lives of 191 innocent people and left more than 1,800 others wounded. It remains one of the deadliest terrorist attacks in European history, deeply changing the course of Spanish society, politics, and security measures. The Madrid train bombings were a series of coordinated attacks, targeting commuter trains during the morning rush hour. The attackers left explosives hidden in sports bags and backpacks on four separate trains, ultimately causing devastation to three train stations: Atocha, El Pozo del Tío Raimundo, and Santa Eugenia. The attackers, believed to be an Al-Qaeda-inspired jihadist cell, chose the date of March 11 as a symbolic gesture. It marked 911 days after the September 11, 2001 attacks in the United States, signaling their ambition to inflict horror on a scale comparable to that experienced in New York City and Washington DC. As the news of the bombings spread, people across the globe were struck by the gruesome nature of the attack. It brought back memories of the 9/11 attacks, leading people to question the safety of public transportation systems and the reality that no place, no matter how ordinary or mundane, could be completely safe from terrorist threats. The aftermath of the bombings saw an outpouring of global support for Spain, as the bereaved struggled to come to terms with the loss of their loved ones. Spanish citizens, as well as those living in other countries, were united in grief and a determination to stand against terrorism. In Spain, a controversial decision by then-Prime Minister José María Aznar to attribute the attack to the Basque separatist group ETA, rather than radical Islamists, triggered mass protests and contributed to the electoral defeat of the ruling Partido Popular (PP) government. The truth eventually emerged about the attackers' jihadist motives, leading to sweeping changes in political and security policies both within Spain and throughout Europe. Over the past five years, Spain has taken significant steps to strengthen its counter-terrorism measures. Increased surveillance, intelligence-gathering efforts, and cooperation with other European countries have helped thwart numerous terrorist plots, making public transport and other potential targets more secure. However, as with any nation, the duty to protect citizens from terrorism remains an ongoing challenge. The Madrid train bombings of March 11, 2004, serve as a harrowing reminder of the indiscriminate nature of terrorism and the lengths to which extremist groups will go to further their twisted ideologies. As Spain marks the fifth anniversary of this horrific tragedy, it is important for us to remember the victims and honor their memories, while continuing to stand together against the forces of hatred and violence that aim to divide us. In commemorating the fifth anniversary of the Madrid train bombings, we not only remember the victims and their families but also recommit ourselves to the continued fight against terrorism. It has been a collaborative effort, not only within Spain but throughout Europe and the world. The sacrifices of those who lost their lives on March 11, 2004, will not be forgotten and serve as a reminder of the need for vigilance and unity in the face of hatred and violence."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose the heat is lowered happens, how will it affect MORE salt being removed from the water. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","completion":"The proposed perturbation of lowering the heat source during the described evaporation process would not directly contribute to more salt being removed from the water. In fact, it could slow down the overall distillation process. The removal of salt from the water in this process is due to the principle of distillation, where water is converted into water vapor by heating and then recondensed as it cools, leaving behind the salt. The rate of this process is largely dependent on the amount of heat applied -- the higher the heat, the faster water will turn to vapor, and the faster the distillation process. If the heat is lowered, it will take longer for the water to reach its boiling point, slow down the evaporation process, and thus prolong the distillation process. It doesn't necessarily help in removing more salt. The salt left behind is simply because it doesn't evaporate with the water, not because of the heat level. Therefore, the perturbation of lowering the heat would have an indirect effect, mainly on the time efficiency of the process, but not on the quantity of salt being removed.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Write a summary based on this article: Donald Trump is going all out to persuade seven-term Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch to seek reelection — a push aimed in no small part at keeping the president’s longtime nemesis, Mitt Romney, out of the Senate. Romney has been preparing to run for Hatch’s seat on the long-held assumption that the 83-year-old would retire. Yet Hatch, the longest-serving Republican senator in history, is now refusing to rule out another campaign — a circumstance Romney’s infuriated inner circle blames squarely on the president. Their suspicions are warranted: Trump has sounded off to friends about how he doesn't like the idea of a Sen. Romney. Story Continued Below The president’s mostly behind-the-scenes campaign to sway Hatch will burst into public view on Monday, when he arrives in Salt Lake City to hold a well-choreographed event designed to showcase his affection for the powerful Senate Finance Committee chairman. Trump’s appearance is ostensibly official in purpose: He will announce his decision to reduce the size of Utah’s Bears Ears and Grand-Staircase Escalante national monuments, a cause that Hatch has championed. But it's also undeniably political: to use the trappings of presidential power to get a veteran lawmaker to rethink his long anticipated plans to leave the Senate. Hatch is slated to ride with Trump both ways on Air Force One — a total of roughly nine hours round trip. After descending from the plane together, the two will meet with Mormon leaders and then head to the state Capitol for the signing of the executive order, according to three White House officials. Hatch will introduce Trump, who in turn is expected to lavish praise on the senator. After the order is signed, Hatch is expected to receive the president’s pen. The public display of affection isn’t just about blocking Romney, senior administration officials say. Trump has felt loyal to Hatch since the senator defended him in the wake of the “Access Hollywood” tape episode late in the 2016 campaign. Hatch stuck by Trump even as other members of Utah’s Republican delegation withdrew their support. Sign up here for POLITICO Huddle A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.

More recently, Hatch has played a key role in moving Trump's prized tax reform bill through the Senate. Trump aides say the president's bond with Hatch began long before Romney emerged as a potential successor. Hatch visited Trump in the Oval Office during the first week of his presidency for a lengthy discussion about the then-vacant Supreme Court seat and Utah’s national monuments. Yet people close to Romney are convinced that Trump’s main motivation is to keep the 2012 GOP presidential nominee out of the Senate. Romney himself has expressed frustration with the ongoing uncertainty about Hatch’s plans, said three Republicans who’ve spoken with him recently. The former Massachusetts governor has pointed out that it was Hatch who urged him to consider running in the first place, but now appears to be wavering on whether to step aside. \\"Hatch is a known entity for Trump and has been really good for the president for the most part,\\" said Kirk Jowers, a friend of Romney who formerly served as the chairman and general counsel of his political action committee. \\"He knows for a fact he's not going to get that with Romney. I don't know that he knows what he's going to get with Romney, but it's not going to be what he's got with Hatch.\\" Indeed, there’s widespread concern within the White House that Romney in the Senate could make Trump’s life difficult. During the 2016 campaign, the former Massachusetts governor emerged as the de-facto leader of the GOP establishment’s “Never Trump” campaign, delivering a nationally watched speech in which he blasted candidate Trump as a “phony, a fraud” and implored the party to stop him. Hatch, by contrast, went all-in for Trump in Utah, where Trump received just 46 percent of the vote but still carried the state because of a third-party candidate. Before the election, the senator also campaigned for Trump in four states, hitting the trail with the candidate’s son Donald Trump Jr. While many Republicans air their issues with Trump publicly, Hatch has usually chosen to telegraph his concerns in private discussions with the president. “I’ll just put it this way. Sen. Hatch was one of the leading voices for the president during the entire campaign,” said Don Peay, a Trump family friend who led his Utah campaign. “Hatch clearly was a strong supporter of Trump from the beginning,” said Peay, who helped to organize Monday’s event. Trump’s push to get Hatch to run for an eighth term has taken place in furtive phone calls and West Wing visits. In early October, the senator called the president to invite him to Utah to announce his monument plan, said one person briefed on the discussion. Near the end of the call, the president conveyed a request. “Orrin,” he said, “I really hope you will consider running again.” Hatch told Trump he hadn't made up his mind. Their mutual endearment has at times been public. When Hatch was asked last week by reporters about Trump’s decision to retweet several anti-Muslim videos, the senator said he wasn’t “aware” of the firestorm — and then praised Trump. “I’ll say this for ya.’ He’s been one of the best presidents I’ve served under, and the reason is he’s not afraid to make decisions. He’s not afraid to take on the big boss around here,” Hatch said. Trump responded by tweeting out a video of the remark. “Thank you @SenOrrinHatch,” he added. “Let’s continue MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!” Romney’s post-election relationship with Trump has been far more ... complicated. During the transition, Trump considered appointing Romney secretary of state. Trump was expecting not to like Romney but was surprised by how well they jelled during the interview process, something he told aides repeatedly at the time. Trump ultimately decided against Romney. As the year wore on, the former governor praised the new president for some of his personnel choices. But he also made his differences known. During an appearance in Park City, Utah, in June, Romney told a group of prominent Republican donors that Trump’s White House was too consumed by palace intrigue. He also offered an implicit critique of the president’s “America First” approach to foreign policy, growing emotional as he outlined the country’s humanitarian responsibilities overseas. Then, in August, Romney struck again — this time to implore the president to apologize for equating white supremacists who sowed violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, with their counterprotesters. “Mr. President,” Romney wrote in a Facebook message, “act now for the good of the country.” Romney has been making the rounds in Utah amid speculation that Hatch is nearing retirement, huddling with an array of Republican figures including state House Speaker Greg Hughes. Romney has told people that while he wouldn’t be reflexively anti-Trump as a senator, he would be more than willing to let his criticisms be known. Some Trump allies contend that Utah would be better served by having a presidential loyalist in the seat. \\"I think he could be a great ally of the president but, as you well know, they're very different people and have very different personalities,\\" said Hughes, who recently met with Romney in his office in the state Capitol. \\"Sen. Hatch,” he added, “understands the president very well.\\" Asked who the president would rather have in the seat, Hughes, who was once mentioned as a candidate for a position in the Trump administration, said he had little doubt: \\"I think the president enjoys having a strong ally.\\" Romney, for his part, won’t be at Monday event. He was invited but, several people close to him said, will be out of town. Over the weekend, Romney wrote a tweet that underscored his respect for Hatch but also, perhaps, hinted at a belief that the senator had now accomplished what he needed to before moving on. “A very big week for Utah’s own Senator @OrrinHatch,” he wrote, “with tax reform, Bears Ears reversion, and a presidential visit.” ||||| Washington • When Air Force One descends into Salt Lake City on Monday morning, planes departing and arriving will be held, causing momentary delays for travelers. And President Donald Trump’s motorcade — mixed with pending snow showers — will likely cause some headaches for drivers in Utah’s capital city as he zips around to meet with Mormon church leaders and speak at the state Capitol. Trump, visiting Utah to announce he’ll shrink Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante national monuments, will be brief — he’s spending less than three hours on the ground — but will consume the state’s focus for the day. Monday marks Trump’s first visit to the state as president, though no public events are scheduled for residents to see him. Trump arrives just before 11 a.m. Monday at the Utah Air National Guard Base attached to Salt Lake City International Airport. From there, he heads to Welfare Square to meet with officials from The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and where he’s expected to take a quick tour of the faith’s humanitarian efforts for the needy. After that, Trump will appear at the Capitol to sign an executive order reportedly removing some 2 million acres from the national monuments created by his Democratic predecessors in southern Utah. Sen. Orrin Hatch and Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, who are traveling with the president from Washington, are expected to speak as well. Trump departs Salt Lake City at 1:35 p.m. The Capitol event is open only to invited guests, guaranteeing a friendly crowd excited about the reductions in the monument, as well as pre-credentialed m edia. A protest also is planned in the area. The Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance told supporters in an email and Facebook post that it is planning a protest starting at 10:45 a.m. just across from the Capitol grounds along 300 North, calling Trump’s actions an “egregious assault on America’s public lands” that amounts to “the largest rollback of protected areas in U.S. history. It is also an appalling affront to Native American tribes who sought healing and cross-cultural understanding through protection of their sacred sites and ancestral homelands.” The group cautioned, “This is a peaceful protest. We do not condone violence or destruction of property.” Article continues below Sportsmen for Fish and Wildlife, founded by Don Peay, one of Trump’s biggest Utah backers, took out a full-page ad in Utah’s metro newspapers Sunday to thank Trump for “hearing the voice of the Utah people, and for protecting our lands, wildlife and heritage of our public lands.” As with any presidential visit, police are likely to shut down freeways and some roads as Trump and his motorcade move about Salt Lake City. The area around Welfare Square, just west of downtown, and the Capitol are likely to be secured as well. ||||| Summary:","completion":"President Trump is actively trying to persuade seven-term Utah Senator Orrin Hatch to seek re-election, a move aimed at blocking Mitt Romney, a vocal critic of Trump, from attempting to gain a Senate seat.

However, Hatch is now not ruling out running again, which Romney and his team blame on Trump.

Armed with a stake, he impales the woman, who, as he looks on, immediately ages from young to old. Whilst he does this, the sun sets, and when he turns to Dracula's coffin with the intention of killing the vampire, he finds it empty. Looking up, Harker is in time to see the Count shut the door and they are both plunged into darkness... A few days have passed Dr. Van Helsing then arrives in Klausenburg, looking for Harker. An inn keeper's daughter gives him Harker's journal. When he arrives at the castle, it is deserted; a hearse carriage speeds by with a coffin in it. In the crypt, Van Helsing is horrified to discover Harker lying in a coffin as a vampire. Staking Harker, he leaves to deliver the veiled news of Harker's death in person to a wary Arthur Holmwood and his wife Mina, brother and sister-in-law of Harker's fiancÃ©e Lucy Holmwood. Lucy is ill, so the news is kept from her and Lucy's little niece, Tania. But, when night falls, Lucy removes the crucifix from round her neck, opens the doors to her terrace and lays bare her neck â already, it bears the mark of a vampire bite.

Process: - You inhale - The air enters the mouth and nose - The diaphragm contracts - Air fills all the sacks in the lungs - Oxygen passes through the sacks into capillaries - The blood is passed to the blood in the capillaries - The blood carries the oxygen to the heart - The heart pumps the oxygenated blood to the body. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose Every breath I exhale carbon dioxide happens, how will it affect greater lung capacity. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Yes, the perturbation hypothesis that suggests \\"every breath I exhale, carbon dioxide happens\\" does have an effect, both directly and indirectly, on the process of respiration and lung capacity. To understand the effects, let's first examine the normal process of respiration in more detail. Inhaling and exhaling are essential components of the respiratory system for exchanging oxygen (O2) and carbon dioxide (CO2) between the body and the environment. As you breathe in, air is drawn into the lungs, which causes the expansion of the chest cavity. The diaphragm, a muscular sheet located below the lungs, contracts and flattens to create a vacuum, and air is drawn into the lungs. This process allows oxygen-rich air to enter the alveoli, tiny air sacs found in the lungs. The oxygen diffuses through the alveoli walls and into the surrounding capillaries, where it binds to hemoglobin in red blood cells. At the same time, carbon dioxide, a waste product produced by cells during cellular respiration, is transported from cells to the alveoli via the bloodstream. The carbon dioxide then diffuses back into the alveoli and is finally exhaled as a waste product. The perturbation hypothesis suggests that a higher amount of carbon dioxide is exhaled with every breath. This could arise from factors such as increased metabolic activity, physical exertion, or underlying medical conditions. This increase in carbon dioxide exhalation would have direct and indirect effects on the respiratory process and lung capacity. Direct effects: 1. Increase in the breathing rate: The body maintains an optimal balance of oxygen and carbon dioxide levels in the blood. An increase in carbon dioxide production would trigger the body to adjust its breathing rate, resulting in more rapid and deeper breaths, so as to remove the excess waste product effectively. This increased breathing rate could enhance the lung capacity, as the lungs need to work more efficiently to expel the carbon dioxide. 2. Increased demand on the alveoli: With an increase in carbon dioxide production, the alveoli will need to work harder to maintain proper gas exchange, which could encourage the expansion of lung tissue and greater lung capacity over time. Indirect effects: 1. Response to aerobic exercise: Aerobic exercises like running, cycling, or swimming require the body to produce more energy, which results in the production of higher amounts of carbon dioxide. As a result, the respiratory system needs to adjust its efficiency to accommodate these changes. Regular aerobic exercise can lead to an increase in lung capacity, as they train the respiratory muscles, like the diaphragm, to be stronger and more efficient. 2. Impact on the cardiovascular system: An increased production of carbon dioxide can cause the heart to pump harder, as it needs to ensure that the oxygen-rich blood is delivered to all parts of the body while also removing the carbon dioxide from the bloodstream. Over time, this increased demand on the heart could contribute to an improvement in cardiovascular fitness and lung capacity. In conclusion, the perturbation hypothesis of increased carbon dioxide exhalation does have both direct and indirect effects on the respiratory process and lung capacity. Increased carbon dioxide production could lead to an enhancement in lung capacity by demanding higher efficiency from the respiratory and cardiovascular systems. Regular aerobic exercise and maintaining optimal lung health contribute significantly to improving overall lung capacity and function."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

The way to achieve this may not be simple. It is very difficult for a nation to give help directly to people in another nation. The United Nations Organization (UNO) could undertake to direct the distribution of aid. Here however rises the problem of costs. Also tied with this is time. Perhaps the UNO could set up a body of devoted men and women in every country who can speedily distribute aid to victims of floods and earthquakes. More than the help that one nation can give to another during a disaster; it would be more effective to give other forms of help during normal times. A common proverb says, \\" _ \\" If we follow this wise saying, it would be right to teach people from less developed nations to take care of themselves. For example, a country could share its technology with another. This could be in simple areas like agriculture or in more complex areas like medical and health care or even in building satellites. Even small country is able to help less developed nations. Sometimes what is take for granted, like the setting up of a water purification plant or the administration of a school, could be useful for countries which are looking about to solve common problems. It does not cost much to share such simple things. Exchange students could be attached for a number of months or years and learn the required craft while on the site. They can then take their knowledge back to their homelands and if necessary come back form time to time to clear doubts or to update themselves. Such aid will be truly helpful and there is no chance of it being temporary or of it falling into the wrong hands. Many countries run extensive courses in all sorts of skills.

[Other reviews of Payton Curry's chef-in-residence at Welcome Diner: http://www.yelp.com/biz/payton-curry-at-welcome-diner-phoenix] THE VEGETARIAN ANGLE When you can date a review to the exact day (and with good reason), you know that you're in a special place. We ate at Payton Curry's pop-up restaurant at the Welcome Diner last night, April 19, 2011, and the following is what we ate, but you may have a different menu on Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday evenings from 5pm-close through July 4. Chef, I hear, tries to keep it real and keep it local and fresh when sourcing his menu, so it changes each week. McClendon's Select was mentioned more than once. (PRICE NOTE: On Tuesdays from 10pm-close, the menu is 1/2 price to be sure Curry exhausts his fresh produce and meats.) Welcome Diner was serving about 12 people when we arrived, 6 at the inside counter and three couples outside dotting the front yard, set up with a picnic table, a sawhorse, some two tops, and glass tabletop lanterns. The food came out quickly, and our gracious and knowledgeable server asked if we'd like our dishes as they were prepared or in courses. We opted for the former. My darling dining partner and I shared all four dishes. THOSE DAMN GREEN BEANS We started with green beans, as crisp as they were picked, with just one tip snapped off, just like my grandmother taught me. These were served with a citrus creme fraiche and some recently picked tarragon. I always love dairy with tarragon, and this dish, served cool (not cold) if I remember, was dusted with local bee pollen, granular bits that taste of honey and something else and melt on your tongue. MOZZARELLA The menu insists there's basil in this tangential rendition of caprese -- and there probably is -- but the takeaway message from this panko-encrusted slab of mozzarella with the sweetest tomatoes I've eaten is a sweet-n-sour burst with every olive oily bite. A standout appetizer. GNOCCHI If you're like me, when you've eaten or prepared gnocchi before, you assume they get plopped into the boiling salted water before the plump up and rise to the surface. Not so fast, Barilla Boy. Payton Curry's gnocchi, I believe, are (dry?) pan-seared on both sides, keeping all the doughy, gummy deliciousness often lost in the water. The madeira wine and cream reduction here smothers the pillowy gnocchi and tooth-tender walnuts and squiggly good morel mushrooms in a way that makes you close your eyes, shut off your hearing, and attempt to pour all of your sensory energy into taste and smell. When eating this dish, I more than once covered my face with my hand to shield what may have been unflattering facial pangs of ecstasy. LEMON CURD We struggled to choose this dessert over the Strawberry Olive Oil Cake and Strawberry Malt, but we got our strawberry fix as the second layer in this delectable parfait, topped with the airiest foamy meringue, and served in a mason jar. The macerated strawberries made you want to relive childhood and replace mom's jelly with Payton's strawberries to accompany Laura Scudder in your PB&J sandwich. We clanged spoons at the bottom of the jar for the last bit of bee pollen. 62 with tax and tip. We didn't bring a BYOB wine but would next time. (The 13 corkage fee seems high, but there ought to be an explanation for that.) Everyone working in the tiny dinette and serving the tables outside had huge smiles and loads of enthusiasm for what they were contributing to the Garfield neighborhood and to the downtown culinary scene. Others are taking notice, too. Michelle Laudig (former restaurant critic at Phoenix New Times) and Aaron Chamberlin of St. Francis both dropped in during our dinner. I worry about the AZ heat baking the charm out of patio dining in May, June, and July for Chef Curry, but I hope to return in April...maybe on a Tuesday at 10pm for half-price eats.

Late Middle Japanese (11851600) saw changes in features that brought it closer to the modern language, as well as the first appearance of European loanwords. The standard dialect moved from the Kansai region to the Edo (modern Tokyo) region in the Early Modern Japanese period (early 17th centurymid-19th century).

Cincinnati scored on its first possession, when Andy Dalton threw to A. J. Green for an 82-yard touchdown. The Lions tied it later in the first quarter on a 3-yard TD pass from Matthew Stafford to Brandon Pettigrew. A 36-yard field goal by David Akers gave the Lions a 10-7 second quarter lead. But late in the quarter, Akers had a 34-yard field goal attempt blocked by Carlos Dunlap, which the Bengals returned all the way to the Lions 40 yard line despite fumbling during the return. That set up a 12-yard TD strike from Andy Dalton to Marvin Jones just before the first half closed, giving Cincinnati a 14-10 lead. The teams exchanged TD passes in the third quarter. First, Dalton hit Tyler Eifert for a 32-yard TD, and Stafford followed shortly after with a 27-yard TD toss to Calvin Johnson. Mike Nugent connected on a 48-yard field goal late in the third to put the Bengals up 24-17. The Lions tied the game at 24 in the fourth quarter, when Calvin Johnson leaped up and beat three Bengals defenders in the end zone on a 50-yard pass from Matthew Stafford. After the game, Stafford called Johnson's play \\"one of the best catches I have ever seen.\\" Late in the fourth quarter, a punt by the Bengals Kevin Huber pinned the Lions at their own 6 yard line. Detroit attempted to kill enough clock to get the game to overtime, but could only gain one first down and 17 yards. Detroit punter Sam Martin then shanked a punt that netted only 28 yards before going out of bounds at the Cincinnati 49 with 26 seconds left in the game. Three plays and 15 yards later, Mike Nugent boomed a 54-yard field goal as time expired to give the Bengals a 27-24 victory. The aerial attack for both teams produced big numbers.

Answer choices: - Solar energy - sunlight - Heat energy - rain or sun shine - flow of electrons - rays or beams - Energy. - seasons change A:","completion":"A stronger sun can be experienced as the season changes due to the position of the Earth relative to the sun as well as changes in sunlight intensity during different times of the year. Based on the given answer choices: - Solar energy: Solar energy itself doesn't bring a stronger sun, but a stronger sun can generate increased solar energy. - Sunlight: The intensity of sunlight can vary during the seasons, which could bring a stronger sun in terms of brightness and warmth. - Heat energy: A stronger sun can produce more heat energy, making the environment warmer. - Rain or sun shine: These are weather conditions and do not directly bring a stronger sun, but sunlight can be more intense during clear days as compared to cloudy or rainy ones. - Flow of electrons: This is unrelated to a stronger sun, as the flow of electrons is a component of electrical processes. - Rays or beams: This refers to the sun's rays, which transmit heat and light energy. More intense rays or beams can contribute to a stronger sun. - Energy: A stronger sun emits more energy in the form of light and heat, but energy itself doesn't bring a stronger sun. - Seasons change: As the seasons change, Earth's tilt and position relative to the sun can cause variations in sunlight intensity, which in turn can result in a stronger sun during some seasons. In summary, the most direct answer to what can bring a stronger sun is the change in seasons, which can lead to increased sunlight and heat energy as the Earth's position relative to the sun varies.

The first customer through the door at 8am was Jake Lee, 17, from Epping, Essex, who had camped outside the store for more than 20 hours with best friends Joe Woodcock, 17, and John Mansdorp, also from Essex. While braving the cold, the trio were given food and drinks by sympathetic Apple staff with several other customers offering them hundreds of pounds to replace them in line. As Jake ran into the store, after a countdown, he was greeted by screams and cheers from dozens of excited staff members who hugged and high-fived him before posing for the world’s media. The exhausted but “elated” performing arts student was then led up to the second floor under arch of hands, while quipping “let’s hope my card works”. “This is just amazing,” he told The Daily Telegraph just moments after he had bought the 64GB iPad with the help of some extra money from his father. “It is exactly what I thought it would be. This is just fantastic. It is unreal. I can't explain it, it is just ridiculously amazing. I just want to have a go on it now. “I have not slept for ages but I still have to go to college.\\" To applause from staff and clutching his new possession, which was later disclosed was bought with cash, he added: \\"I just want to play with this. It is so cool. It was so worth lining up.” He was still going to synchronise hundreds of his iPad music apps on his new purchase. Others in the line could not contain their excitement at their new purchase. Ian Harper, 41, from Northampton, queued for 16 hours and was the first customer to leave the store with the new iPad. \\"I feel fantastic,” the bank clerk said. “I'm looking forward to playing games now. I was one of the first people and that feels great. But I'm tired now.” Andy Parkinson, a communications engineer, 51, who bought his iPad in London said: \\"I’m going to use it for the Internet, e-mail, video, and controlling the other Macs at home. I think it is a big hit here. It already looks very good.” East London school student Mitchell Marks, 14, was able to get his new iPad after his mother, Tracy Rahilly, 42, lined up outside the store overnight. “This is just amazing. It is just the best,” he said. His mother said she had never seen her son so happy. “This is just fantastic,” she said. “I have not slept all night but this has been definitely worth it.” Edward Cook, 25, from Greenwich, south east London, said he was \\"thrilled\\" to have purchased his gadgets after a 10-hour wait. \\"I'm very excited but also quite tired. I've been here since 2am,” he said. \\"For me it (the iPad) is a novelty toy. The novelty may wear off but for now it is quite exciting.\\" Stephen Fry, the comedian, had his new iPad delivered but he attended the launch. “I just like the sensuality of the product, it is just such a nice thing to use,” he told reporters. “This is quite something isn’t it?” While not a “paid spokesman” he said he was a huge fan of the company and likened Steve Jobs, the chief executive, to Jack Warner, the famed boss of Warner Bros. In Birmingham, around 200 people lined up outside the Bull Ring's Apple Store for their doors to open at 8am. \\"I cannot wait to get my hands on it,\\" said first in the queue Adam Bullas, 24. Gadget fans who queued all night outside Belfast's Apple store said it was a great experience. Lisa McCormick, 27, from Lisburn on the outskirts of Belfast, said: \\"A black curtain was put up in front of the store so we could not see in, but at around 7am we got free coffee sent round from Starbucks, before the curtain fell. \\"Everyone cheered and we were all 'high-fived' as we walked in. It was great craic.\\" Apple was forced to push back its original late April UK launch date because of \\"overwhelming demand\\" for the iPad in the US. The company's website is already warning that iPad pre-orders made now will not ship until June 7. Apple sold more than one million iPads in the US since it was launched in April, making it a faster seller than the iPhone. The iPad was first announced in the United States in January. British sales figures for Friday's launch were unavailable, an Apple spokeswoman said. The British launch also came as the iPad went on sale in eight other countries on Friday — Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Spain, Switzerland - with tens of thousands lining up from the early hours, with some waiting up to 40 hours to purchase. Alejandro Barras, manager of the Apple store in downtown Madrid, said the iPad sold out one hour after opening. Earlier this week, The California-based company’s market value hit more than 222bn (£152.5bn), edging it ahead of Microsoft, which has a market capitalisation of 219bn (£150.5 bn). Apple is now the second most valued company, behind the world’s largest, ExxonMobil. The oil giant is worth 282bn (£193.8bn). A string of suicides at a Chinese factory that churns out iPads and other high-tech items did not dampen the British launch after concerns were raised about conditions for workers who faced tremendous time pressures and harsh discipline for mistakes. In response, Apple issued a statement expressing commitment to ensuring that conditions \\"throughout our supply chain are safe and workers are treated with respect and dignity\\".

Australia's capital is Canberra, and its largest urban area is Sydney. - Wellington is the capital city and second most populous urban area of New Zealand, with residents. It is at the south-western tip of the North Island, between Cook Strait and the Rimutaka Range. Wellington is the major population centre of the southern North Island and is the administrative centre of the Wellington Region, which also includes the Kapiti Coast and Wairarapa. As the nation's capital city, the New Zealand Government and Parliament, Supreme Court and most of the civil service are based in the city. - Fiji ((), officially the Republic of Fiji, is an island country in Melanesia in the South Pacific Ocean about northeast of New Zealand's North Island. Its closest neighbours are Vanuatu to the west, New Caledonia to the southwest, New Zealand's Kermadec Islands to the southeast, Tonga to the east, the Samoas and France's Wallis and Futuna to the northeast, and Tuvalu to the north. - Cook Strait lies between the North and South Islands of New Zealand. It connects the Tasman Sea on the northwest with the South Pacific Ocean on the southeast, and runs next to the capital city, Wellington. It is wide at its narrowest point, and is considered one of the most dangerous and unpredictable waters in the world. - Auckland is a city in the North Island of New Zealand. It is the most populous urban area in the country. Auckland has a population of , which constitutes percent of New Zealand's population. It is part of the wider Auckland Regionthe area governed by the Auckland Councilwhich also includes outlying rural areas and the islands of the Hauraki Gulf, resulting in a total population of . Auckland also has the largest Polynesian population of any city in the world. The Mori language name for Auckland is or , meaning \\"Tmaki with a hundred lovers\\", in reference to the desirability of its fertile land at the hub of waterways in all directions. It has also been called karana, the Mori enunciation of \\"Auckland\\". - The Kaweka Range ( also known as the Kaweka Ranges ) of mountains is located in inland Hawke 's Bay in the eastern North Island of New Zealand . It forms part of the mountainous spine of the North Island which runs from Wellington to East Cape , including the Tararua and Ruahine ranges . The range lies between the city of Napier , 55 kilometres ( 34 mi ) to the southeast , and Lake Taupo , 50 kilometres ( 31 mi ) to the northwest . It is the source of many rivers which flow into Hawke Bay , including among them the Tutaekuri , Mohaka , and Ngaruroro Rivers . The highest point in the range is Kaweka J ( 1,724 metres ( 5,656 ft ) ) . The bush line varies from 1000 m to 1300 m. A tramping track follows the ridge line of the entire range . The Kaweka challenge is a running race held annually in the range since 1990 . - Tectonic uplift is the portion of the total geologic uplift of the mean Earth surface that is not attributable to an isostatic response to unloading. While isostatic response is important, an increase in the mean elevation of a region can only occur in response to tectonic processes of crustal thickening (such as mountain building events), changes in the density distribution of the crust and underlying mantle, and flexural support due to the bending of rigid lithosphere. - New Zealand is an island nation in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. The country geographically comprises two main landmassesthat of the North Island, or Te Ika-a-Mui, and the South Island, or Te Waipounamuand numerous smaller islands. New Zealand is situated some east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and roughly south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its long period of isolation, New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal, fungal and plant life. The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's capital city is Wellington, while its most populous city is Auckland. - The Pacific Ocean is the largest of the Earth's oceanic divisions. It extends from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Southern Ocean (or, depending on definition, to Antarctica) in the south and is bounded by Asia and Australia in the west and the Americas in the east. - The South Island or Te Waipounamu (\\"Mori\\") is the larger of the two major islands of New Zealand, the other being the smaller but more populous North Island. It is bordered to the north by Cook Strait, to the west by the Tasman Sea, and to the south and east by the Pacific Ocean. The South Island covers and is influenced by a temperate climate. - New Caledonia is a special collectivity of France located in the southwest Pacific Ocean, east of Australia and east of Metropolitan France.

Complete the following sentence. Ending a relationship was easy for Jessica but not Tanya because OPT: A). Jessica was more blunt. B). Tanya was more blunt.","completion":"Ending a relationship was easy for Jessica but not Tanya because Jessica was more blunt. There seem to be significant emotional variances and personality differences between Jessica and Tanya, particularly when it comes to dealing with relationships and their terminations. Jessica, being the more blunt one, tends to be straightforward, candid, and usually unreserved about expressing her feelings and thoughts. This disposition enables her to maintain easier communication in all aspects of her life, including her relationships. When she deems that a relationship is no longer sustainable or healthy for her, she can directly address the issue and voice out her feelings. She doesn’t shy away from potentially uncomfortable conversations and can be upfront about her need to end the relationship. Her lack of fear regarding conflict or confrontation empowers her to make difficult but necessary decisions with relative ease. She tends not to prolong situations that make her unhappy, and this straightforwardness makes it easier for her to sever ties when she feels it's necessary. On the other hand, Tanya, who lacks Jessica’s blunt approach, might encounter heightened difficulties when confronting a similar situation. Her nature might prevent her from expressing her dissatisfaction candidly or from being straightforward about her desire to leave the relationship. It can be challenging for Tanya to end relationships due to fear of confrontation, hurting the other person's feelings, or dealing with potential backlash. Tanya might also struggle with the guilt of disappointment and hurt she might cause the other person. She might linger in unhealthy or unhappy relationships longer, because of her difficulty in expressing her authentic emotions. Tanya's approach to relationships may be considered more sensitive or empathetic by some, as it considers deeply the feelings of the other person. However, it is worth remembering that while being mindful of others' feelings is generally positive, it can become detrimental if it inhibits a person from doing what's best for their own well-being. In this contrast, we can understand why ending a relationship is easier for Jessica, with her blunt nature, and not so for Tanya. Nonetheless, it is crucial to remember that whether a person is direct like Jessica or more considerate like Tanya, no approach is inherently superior. It highly depends on the specific circumstances and how each approach is employed. Both can learn and grow from their respective traits. Jessica can benefit from exercising more empathy in her interactions, while Tanya can focus on becoming more assertive and prioritizing her personal needs when necessary."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Now some countries use 50 kilograms of paper for each person in a year. But countries like America, England and Sweden certainly use more paper than other countries. Paper was first made in China about 2000 years ago. It was made from the hair-like parts of certain plants. Paper was not made in southern Europe until about the year 1100. In 1500, a German named Schaeffer found out that one could make the best paper from trees. After that the forest countries of Canada, Sweden, America, Finland became the most important ones in paper making. When we think of paper, we think of newspapers, books and writing paper.

Answer the above question based on the context below: On July 9, 1790, Congress passed the Residence Act, which approved the creation of a national capital on the Potomac River. The exact location was to be selected by President George Washington, who signed the bill into law on July 16. Formed from land donated by the states of Maryland and Virginia, the initial shape of the federal district was a square measuring 10 miles (16 km) on each side, totaling 100 square miles (259 km2).Two pre-existing settlements were included in the territory: the port of Georgetown, Maryland, founded in 1751, and the city of Alexandria, Virginia, founded in 1749. During 1791–92, Andrew Ellicott and several assistants, including a free African American astronomer named Benjamin Banneker, surveyed the borders of the federal district and placed boundary stones at every mile point. Many of the stones are still standing.A new federal city was then constructed on the north bank of the Potomac, to the east of Georgetown. On September 9, 1791, the three commissioners overseeing the capital's construction named the city in honor of President Washington. The federal district was named Columbia (a feminine form of \\"Columbus\\"), which was a poetic name for the United States commonly in use at that time. Congress held its first session in Washington on November 17, 1800.Congress passed the District of Columbia Organic Act of 1801 that officially organized the District and placed the entire territory under the exclusive control of the federal government. Further, the unincorporated area within the District was organized into two counties: the County of Washington to the east of the Potomac and the County of Alexandria to the west. After the passage of this Act, citizens living in the District were no longer considered residents of Maryland or Virginia, which therefore ended their representation in Congress.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. I have a new situation: Bob is a biologist. Today, he has four samples of organisms to test, sample A, sample B, sample C, and sample D. He induced higher respiration rate in sample A. Then he induced no respiration rate in sample B. Next, he classified sample C as heterotrophic and sample D as autotrophic. But I can use this background: There must be more to this story than just gas exchange with the environment. To begin to appreciate the role of oxygen inside your body, think about when your breathing rate increases: climbing a steep slope, running a race, or skating a shift in a hockey game. Respiration rate correlates with energy use, and that correlation reflects the link between oxygen and energy metabolism. For this reason, the chemical process inside your cells that consume oxygen to produce usable energy is known as cellular respiration . During this process, energy is converted from glucose , in the presence of oxygen, into numerous ATP molecules. The glucose, of course, comes from the food you eat. In biological terms, you do not eat because you are hungry, you eat to get energy. Other heterotrophic organisms also acquire glucose from other organisms, whereas autotrophic organisms make their own glucose, mostly through photosynthesis. What is an answer for this question: Would sample D make their own glucose or acquire it from other organisms?","completion":"Based on the given information, sample D is classified as autotrophic. Autotrophic organisms are capable of synthesizing their own glucose, primarily through the process of photosynthesis. In photosynthesis, autotrophs convert light energy into chemical energy, which is stored in the form of glucose, using carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O) as raw materials. Therefore, sample D, as an autotrophic organism, would make its own glucose rather than acquire it from other organisms. This is in contrast to heterotrophic organisms, like sample C, which obtain glucose from consuming other organisms, as they lack the ability to produce their own glucose. Autotrophic organisms, such as plants, algae, and certain bacteria, act as primary producers in ecosystems, converting sunlight into energy and providing a source of glucose and nutrients for heterotrophic organisms, which include animals, fungi, and certain bacteria. It is important to note that oxygen plays a crucial role in the process of cellular respiration for both autotrophs and heterotrophs. In cellular respiration, organisms consume oxygen and glucose to produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP), water, and carbon dioxide. ATP serves as the primary energy currency for cells, powering various cellular processes. In summary, sample D, as an autotrophic organism, would make its own glucose through processes such as photosynthesis; it would not obtain glucose from other organisms.

Question: Why didn't they meet that evening? - They were both busy doing their own work. - They waited for each other at different places. - They went to the street corner at different times.","completion":"To complete this task, I will first analyze the dialogue between W and M and find the crucial information related to the question. 1. W asks George where he was yesterday evening, as they were supposed to meet at the concert. 2. M (George) responds that he waited for W at the corner of W's street and then looked for W at their flat, but the housekeeper said W was out. Now I will consider the given answer options and justify which one matches the situation based on the dialogue: A) They were both busy doing their own work. - This doesn't seem to be the explanation since they both expressed their intention to meet each other. B) They waited for each other at different places. - This seems to be the correct answer because, according to the dialogue, W was at the concert and expected to see George there, while M (George) was waiting at the corner of W's street. C) They went to the street corner at different times. - This could be a possible but incomplete explanation because there is no clear information about the time they were at the street corner.

It's really easy and fun. Just follow these simple steps and you'll have a tasty meal in no time! 1. Gather your supplies and ingredients: First, we need to prepare our cooking tools and yummy ingredients. We'll need a large pot to cook the beans, a pan for the vegetables, and a bowl for soaking the beans. Ask your mom or dad to help you if needed. Our ingredients include: - Beans (kidney or black beans) - Water - Cumin (a type of spice) - Onion - Garlic - Ginger - Tomatoes - Chili powder - Turmeric (a yellow spice) - Garam masala (a special mixture of spices) - Salt 2. Soak the beans: Before we cook the beans, we need to soak them in water for a while. Fill a big bowl with water, and put the beans inside it. Leave them there for several hours or overnight, then drain the water. This helps the beans to cook faster and better. 3. Cook the beans: Now, it's time to cook our beans. Fill a large pot with fresh water and put the beans inside. With the help of an adult, put the pot on the stove and cook the beans until they are soft. (That means they're easy to squish!) 4. Toast the cumin: Cumin is a yummy spice that makes our bean dish tasty. Put a small pan on the stove, and when it's hot, add the cumin. Keep stirring the cumin around until it smells nice and toasty. Remember, ask an adult for help with the stove! 5. Sauté the onion, garlic, and ginger: Slice up the onion, garlic, and ginger into small pieces. Then, in a big pan, cook them with a little oil until they become soft and golden. This will make our bean dish extra special! 6. Add the tomatoes, chili powder, and turmeric: Chop up the tomatoes and put them in the pan with the onion, garlic, and ginger. Also, add a little bit of chili powder and turmeric. The turmeric makes it a pretty yellow color! 7. Add the beans to the sauté mixture: Once the beans are cooked and soft, carefully mix them in with the onion, garlic, ginger, tomatoes, and spices. It's starting to look and smell so yummy! 8. Season with garam masala and salt: Finally, add a little bit of garam masala and salt to your bean dish. This makes it taste even better! Give it a good stir so all the flavors mix together. And there you go, little buddies! You've made a delicious and healthy bean dish.

Movie plot title: School Ties Movie plot: David Greene (Fraser) is a working-class Jewish teenager from Scranton, Pennsylvania during the 1950s, who is given an unusual football scholarship to become the school's starting quarterback at an exclusive Massachusetts protestant prep school, St. Matthew's, or St. Matt's.In this film about coming of age and prejudice, Greene's Jewish heritage is first insulted in a hometown bar and it is after this that his father tells him that he \\"can't fight his way through life like this\\" even if his Jewish background is insulted; this is his big chance to go to Harvard.Greene is exposed to prejudice from his first day at his new school. His new football coach, Coach McDevitt, drives him onto the campus. His coach, awkwardly asks about any special \\"dietary\\" needs David might have, presumably because of his Jewish background and stresses to not to tell the other boys any more about himself than he has to. When he meets the \\"other big men on campus\\" --Dillon, Connors, Van Kelt, Reece-- he becomes aware of their feelings towards Jews in a conversation about team follower McGivern's new hi-fi he \\"Jewed down\\" from forty to thirty dollars.Greene finds his faith tested when he attends Protestant chapel and when he must choose between going to temple for Rosh Hashanah as his father wishes and playing football. He copes with this second challenge by playing the game where he establishes himself as the team's leader and throws a long touchdown pass late in the 4th quarter to give St. Matt's a 13-7 win in the game, and later that night reciting Jewish prayers in the chapel in honor of Rosh Hashanah.Beyond dealing with religious prejudice this film deals with social prejudices, abuse of power, and the concept of honor. Fairly early on in the film, it becomes clear that although they are gifted by the circumstances of birth, not all of Greene's classmates are gifted academically.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. I have a new situation: Jennifer is currently looking for a new city to move to since she is looking to change her life and just do something different. Jennifer is a strong environmentalist and doesn't want to move to a city that contributes a lot to climate change since she feels it's every person's duty to take care of the Earth. She looks online and finds out about two cities in Minnesota that are several hundred miles apart. Jamestown has a very famous water park and uses coal to generate the city's electricity. Dapperton, the other city she is considering, has a neat hobby shop that Jennifer likes and the city uses nuclear power for its electricity needs. But I can use this background: In the U.S., the majority of electricity is produced by burning coal or other fossil fuels. This causes air pollution, acid rain, and global warming. Fossil fuels are also limited and may eventually run out. Like fossil fuels, radioactive elements are limited. In fact, they are relatively rare, so they could run out sooner rather than later. On the other hand, nuclear fission does not release air pollution or cause the other environmental problems associated with burning fossil fuels. This is the major advantage of using nuclear fission as a source of energy. What is an answer for this question: Given Jennifer's stance on the environment, which city shouldn't she move to?","completion":"Given Jennifer's strong commitment to environmentalism and her desire to live in a city that does not contribute significantly to climate change, it would be more appropriate for her to avoid moving to Jamestown. There are several reasons why Jennifer should consider Dapperton instead. Firstly, as mentioned in the background information, the majority of electricity in the U.S. is produced by burning coal or other fossil fuels, which leads to air pollution, acid rain, and global warming. Jamestown, having a coal-fired power plant, would contribute to these environmental issues, thereby conflicting with Jennifer's values. As a strong environmentalist, she should avoid supporting a city that relies heavily on such unsustainable and polluting energy sources. On the other hand, Dapperton uses nuclear power as its primary source of electricity. Although nuclear fission produces nuclear waste, it does not release air pollution or cause the environmental problems associated with burning fossil fuels. It can be considered a cleaner energy source when compared to coal, making it a more suitable option for someone with Jennifer's concerns. Furthermore, the fact that nuclear fission generates a significant amount of power using relatively small amounts of fuel makes it an efficient energy choice, despite the finite supply of radioactive elements. In addition to the environmental aspects, Dapperton also has an appealing local attraction that Jennifer likes: a hobby shop. This can contribute to her overall happiness and satisfaction with the city, providing her with an additional incentive to move there. Lastly, it is worth noting that both Jamestown and Dapperton are located in Minnesota and are several hundred miles apart, meaning that Jennifer will still be able to enjoy the state's natural beauty and quality of life in either city. However, her environmentalist values and preferences for cleaner energy sources make Dapperton the more appropriate choice. In conclusion, considering Jennifer's stance on the environment and her commitment to preserving the Earth, she should avoid moving to Jamestown due to its reliance on coal-generated electricity and its associated environmental impacts. Instead, she should consider Dapperton, which utilizes a cleaner, albeit finite, energy source in the form of nuclear power and offers local attractions that align with her interests and contribute to her well-being."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Given the question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person whose art also bears some stylistic resemblance to the work of European post-impressionists such as Vincent van Gogh? , can you please find it? Thomson was largely self-taught. His experiences as a graphic designer with Toronto's Grip Ltd. honed his draughtsmanship. Although he began painting and drawing at an early age, it was only in 1912, when he was well into his thirties, that he began to paint seriously. His first trips to Algonquin Park inspired him to follow the lead of fellow artists in producing oil sketches of natural scenes on small, rectangular panels for easy portability while travelling. Between 1912 and his death in 1917, Thomson produced hundreds of these small sketches, many of which are now considered works in their own right, and are mostly found in the Art Gallery of Ontario in Toronto, the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa, the McMichael Canadian Art Collection in Kleinburg and the Tom Thomson Art Gallery in Owen Sound.Thomson produced nearly all of his works between 1912 and 1917. Most of his large canvases were completed in his most productive period, from late 1916 to early 1917. The patronage of James MacCallum enabled Thomson's transition from graphic designer to professional painter. Although the Group of Seven was not founded until after his death, his work was sympathetic to that of group members A. Y. Jackson, Frederick Varley, and Arthur Lismer. These artists shared an appreciation for rugged, unkempt natural scenery, and all used broad brush strokes and a liberal application of paint to capture the beauty and colour of the Ontario landscape. Thomson's art also bears some stylistic resemblance to the work of European post-impressionists such as Vincent van Gogh. Other key influences were the Art Nouveau and Arts and Crafts movements of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, styles with which he became familiar while working in the graphic arts.

(Click to read the question--but in brief, it had to do with why one guy named Bill had managed to discourage unwanted pursuit by a gal named Janet, when another guy named Bill had not.) Does it follow that \\"Click to read the question, which is about a guy named Bill, said the website.\\"?","completion":"It does not directly follow that \\"Click to read the question, which is about a guy named Bill, said the website,\\" because there is not enough context to fully understand the scenario. However, from the given context, we can infer that the question is related to a situation where two individuals named Bill had different outcomes in discouraging unwanted pursuit by a woman named Janet. To provide a detailed and long answer, let's dive deeper into possible reasons for the difference in outcomes. 1. Communication Style: One Bill might have been more effective in communicating his disinterest when encountering Janet's pursuit. Clear and direct communication is essential in these circumstances. This Bill may have expressed his lack of interest in a way that left no room for ambiguity, ensuring Janet would not persist with her pursuit. 2. Persistence: In contrast, the other Bill might have been less successful in discouraging Janet due to her persistence. Sometimes people do not take a hint or give up easily, leading to continued unwanted pursuit. 3. Personality Differences: People's personalities could have played a significant role in the effectiveness of each Bill's attempt to discourage Janet. One Bill's personality may have aligned more closely with Janet's, making it harder for her to let go of her pursuit, whereas the other Bill may have had a personality that clashed or did not resonate with Janet's, making it easier for her to accept his disinterest. 4. Initial Attraction Level: The level of initial attraction could have influenced the effectiveness of each Bill's attempt to discourage Janet. The Bill who was initially less attractive to Janet might have had an easier time convincing her to relinquish her pursuit, while the other Bill, who was more attractive to Janet, may have had a harder time getting her to back off. 5. Social Circle and Environment: Different social environments and the presence or absence of mutual friends can also impact the effectiveness of discouraging unwanted pursuit. One Bill may have been in a social setting where it was easier to avoid or navigate away from Janet's pursuit, while the other Bill could have found himself consistently in close proximity to Janet due to overlapping social circles or other factors. 6. Timing: Timing can play a crucial role in the success of discouraging unwanted pursuit. One Bill may have communicated his disinterest at an opportune time when Janet was more emotionally equipped to handle the rejection, while the other Bill may have expressed his disinterest when Janet was more vulnerable or emotionally invested, making it difficult for her to accept and move on. In conclusion, it does not follow directly that \\"Click to read the question, which is about a guy named Bill, said the website,\\" as the context provided is limited. However, based on the context given, we can hypothesize that there are various factors, such as communication style, personality differences, initial attraction level, social environment, and timing, that have influenced the success of each Bill's attempts to discourage unwanted pursuit by Janet."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Of course you can't remember, but they can. They have photos or videos from a ceremony of some kind. In the United States, the proud parents of a new baby often put something on their front door. It's an exciting time for them, and they want to share the good news with their neighbors. For example, they put balloons on their door. Pink balloons mean the baby is a girl. Blue ones are for boys. People around the world often celebrate a new baby's birth with some kinds of ceremonies, perhaps a religious ceremony. This perhaps takes place when a baby is a few days or weeks old. Take what people do in Mexico as an example, many new parents dress their babies in special clothes take them to church.In some African countries, the family plants a tree near the house. In Korea, there is a traditional ceremony on the baby's 100th day. And it's the same in China. On that day, all family members and friends get together to have a big meal, with all the best wishes that the baby will grow up happily and healthily. The parents of new babies often receive presents. In the United States, friends send cards, flowers or baby clothes. In China, family members and friends give money or presents.

In this case, the sentence is: \\"The movie has generic virtues, and despite a lot of involved talent, seems done by the numbers.\\" We can break this down into a few key phrases: 1. \\"generic virtues\\" - This phrase usually means common or ordinary positive aspects. \\"Generic\\" could be interpreted as a little negative, but \\"virtues\\" is a positive term. So, the sentiment of this phrase is slightly positive. 2. \\"despite a lot of involved talent\\" - This phrase suggests that there are talented people involved with the movie, which is generally a positive notion. 3. \\"seems done by the numbers\\" - This phrase implies that the movie follows a formulaic approach and is not very original or creative. This gives a negative sentiment to the sentence. As we assess these key phrases, we can see that the sentence has a mixture of slightly positive and negative sentiments. However, the overall sentiment leans more on the negative side due to the implication that the movie is formulaic and uninspired. Based on this analysis, we can classify the sentiment of this sentence as \\"NEG\\" (Negative)."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Other public festivals were not required by the calendar, but occasioned by events. The triumph of a Roman general was celebrated as the fulfillment of religious vows, though these tended to be overshadowed by the political and social significance of the event. During the late Republic, the political elite competed to outdo each other in public display, and the ludi attendant on a triumph were expanded to include gladiator contests. Under the Principate, all such spectacular displays came under Imperial control: the most lavish were subsidised by emperors, and lesser events were provided by magistrates as a sacred duty and privilege of office. Additional festivals and games celebrated Imperial accessions and anniversaries. Others, such as the traditional Republican Secular Games to mark a new era (saeculum), became imperially funded to maintain traditional values and a common Roman identity. That the spectacles retained something of their sacral aura even in late antiquity is indicated by the admonitions of the Church Fathers that Christians should not take part. If it is possible to answer this question, answer it for me (else, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): Under what auspices did public displays come during the Principate?","completion":"Under the Principate, which is a title that was held by the first Roman Emperor, Augustus, and the ones that came after him, all the big, showy public displays came under their control. This means the Emperor was the one in charge of planning and organizing these events. The most extravagant ones were paid for by the Emperor himself, and the smaller ones were taken care of by other public officials, a bit like helping to plan a school event.

They are the descendants of free blacks and of escaped slaves (called maroons) who allied with Seminole groups in Spanish Florida. Historically, the Black Seminoles lived mostly in distinct bands near the Native American Seminole. Some were held as slaves of particular Seminole leaders; but they had more freedom than did slaves held by whites in the South and by other Native American tribes, including the right to bear arms. The Black Seminole culture that took shape after 1800 was a dynamic mixture of African, Native American, Spanish, and slave traditions. Adopting certain practices of the Native Americans, maroons wore Seminole clothing and ate the same foodstuffs prepared the same way: they gathered the roots of a native plant called coontie, grinding, soaking, and straining them to make a starchy flour similar to arrowroot, as well as mashing corn with a mortar and pestle to make sofkee, a sort of porridge often used as a beverage, with water added-- ashes from the fire wood used to cook the sofkee were occasionally added to it for extra flavor. They also introduced their Gullah staple of rice to the Seminole, and continued to use it as a basic part of their diets. Rice remained part of the diet of the Black Seminoles who moved to Oklahoma. Initially living apart from the Native Americans, the maroons developed their own unique African-American culture, based in the Gullah culture of the Lowcountry. Black Seminoles inclined toward a syncretic form of Christianity developed during the plantation years. Certain cultural practices, such as \\"jumping the broom\\" to celebrate marriage, hailed from the plantations; other customs, such as some names used for black towns, reflected African heritage. As time progressed, the Seminole and Blacks had limited intermarriage, but historians and anthropologists have come to believe that generally the Black Seminoles had independent communities. They allied with the Seminole at times of war. The Seminole society was based on a matrilineal kinship system, in which inheritance and descent went through the maternal line. Children were considered to belong to the mother's clan, so those born to ethnic African mothers would have been considered black by the Seminole. While the children might integrate customs from both parents' cultures, the Seminole believed they belonged to the mother's group more than the father's. African Americans adopted some elements of the European-American patriarchal system. But, under the South's adoption of the principle of partus sequitur ventrem in the 17th century and incorporated into slavery law in slave states, children of slave mothers were considered legally slaves. Under the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850, even if the mother escaped to a free state, she and her children were legally considered slaves and fugitives. As a result, the Black Seminoles born to slave mothers were always at risk from slave raiders.

Question: What is Desmond Young's rank? Movie title: The Desert Fox: The Story of Rommel Movie plot: The movie opens in November 1941 with a British submarine-launched commando raid on the shores of Libya. The target of the raid is General Erwin Rommel of the German Afrika Korps, who is enjoying considerable success against British troops in North Africa. The daring raid produces plenty of casualties but misses Rommel. Rommel is gaining legendary status with his British enemies.A captured British Lieutenant Colonel, Desmond Young, soon has a chance encounter with the celebrated Rommel in the midst of a desert artillery barrage. Rommel treats Young with respect and chivalry, inspiring the British officer after the war to investigate the life and mysterious death of the great general.Rommel's story is told in retrospect, beginning with the defeat of German forces at El Alamein in late 1942. Rommel, by now a Field Marshal, had been away from the front on medical leave, but he is forced to return in an attempt to stem the British tide. Rommel fights gallantly but becomes increasingly disenchanted with Hitler's interference and maniacal insistence on victory or death.Shortly before the total defeat of German forces in North Africa in the spring of 1943, Rommel is again invalided back to Germany. In the hospital, Rommel is visited by his wife Lucie (Jessica Tandy), his son Manfred, and Dr. Karl Strolin (Cedric Hardwicke), the Lord Mayor of Stuttgart and an early conspirator against Hitler. Strolin's presence arouses the suspicion of the SS and Gestapo. Rommel confides to Strolin that Hitler has accused him of cowardice and hinted at having him shot, and that Hitler had callously abandoned his beloved Afrika Korps. He further confides that Hitler no longer believes victory is possible, and that he only fights on because the Allies would never make peace with him. That can only mean that Germany and her people will be forced to fight to the death. Strolin provides Rommel with a dire warning about Hitler's unstable and vindictive nature.Rommel returns to active duty in November 1943, overseeing the defensive...

Roberts, highly advanced for somebody of such a young age - alike the bigger sister, who was reading Science Is Science, and it's grandfather who's reading a science-fiction comic. Ian is clumsy and stubles on entering... again. Ian has brought a present, but Dr. Who insists in showing him his last invention.

The machine will transport everything in time and place.Barbara appears and jumps to Ian's arms. He steps back and sets the machine onto motion with the four of them inside. The scenery immediately changes: they are on a place of jungle twigs and burnt soil called Skaro. It's another planet. Susan is excited to have the opportunity to go around and investigate. She find a kind of alien flower. Barbara screams at the small statue of a crocrodile. On the mayhem, Ian falls onto the thing and breaks it.Susan find the lights of empty buildings. Barbara starts thinking that something terrible happened in that place, and that it's dangerous. Ian tells Dr. Who that he's expected at home, so that they must return. Finally, who obliges.

Question: Question: Who is the wisest of the three mothers? If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Mother of Tears Context: The film begins with members of the Catholic Church digging up the body of a 19th-century church official, whose casket has a box-shaped urn chained to it. Inside the box they discover artifacts belonging to Mater Lachrymarum (Moran Atias), the last surviving member of the Three Mothers; an ancient trio of powerful black witches. In particular, the box contains a magic cloak that, when worn by Mater Lachrymarum, increases her powers significantly. The urn is shipped to the Museum of Ancient Art in Rome where Sarah Mandy (Asia Argento), an American studying art restoration, works. Sarah is dating the curator Michael Pierce, a single father who is away from the museum that night. With help from the assistant curator, Sarah opens the box and finds the cloak, a dagger, and three statues representing the three witches. Sending Sarah to her office to retrieve tools to help her translate the text on the artifacts, the curator is promptly attacked by the demonic agents of Mater Lachrymarum. Sarah arrives too late to save her boss (who is being disembowelled by the monsters) and starts to flee the museum. Unfortunately, she is pursued by Mater Lachrymarum's familiar (a baboon) and is only able to escape when a disembodied voice magically throws open a series of locked doors keeping her trapped inside the museum. Sarah tells the police what happened as she spends the night with Michael and his son. Michael visits the Cardinal who sent him the urn only to find out that, shortly after mailing the urn to him, he had a severe stroke and is now in a coma. An assistant of the priest gives Michael a piece of paper, which the Cardinal was writing on before collapsing. On it is scrawled the name \\"Mater Lachrymarum\\". As he leaves the hospital, a pair of witches observe Michael leaving the building. Back in Rome, chaos descends as a wave of mass suicides, murder, and violence engulfs the city. Sarah continues her own research only to be summoned by Michael to his apartment. The witches have kidnapped his young son and won't...

Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","completion":"In order to analyze this situation, it's important to differentiate between the premise, which is a statement that is assumed to be true, and the hypothesis, which is a proposed explanation or assumption based on limited evidence. We will then determine if the truth of the premise will make the hypothesis true. The Premise: \\"Jane shook her head.\\" In this statement, we understand that Jane made a motion with her head, typically from side to side, which often signifies disagreement or disapproval. The Hypothesis: \\"Jane waved her head.\\" This statement suggests that Jane made another movement with her head. Waving one's head is a somewhat ambiguous term, as it could imply a few different motions; However, for the purpose of this discussion, we can assume that it means Jane moved her head in a back-and-forth motion. Now, to evaluate whether the truth of the premise guarantees the truth of the hypothesis, we need to see if there is a logical connection between the two statements. From the language used in these statements, it can be inferred that these are two distinct actions. Shaking one's head, as previously noted, is a side-to-side movement, whereas waving one's head is assumed to be a different motion (likely back and forth). Consequently, we can say that there is no direct logical connection between the premise and the hypothesis. Therefore, it is not possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then the hypothesis is true as well. The truth of the premise (Jane shaking her head) does not guarantee the truth of the hypothesis (Jane waving her head), since these are separate actions and don't have a clear causal relationship. It is entirely possible for Jane to shake her head (disagree or express disapproval) without waving her head.

He had the good opportunity to see various tidal conditions. First he saw the spring tide, which he noted as case A. About a week later he saw the neap tide. He noted that as case B. Rob got curious about the science behind various tidal conditions. But I can use this background: When the Moon is at first quarter or third quarter, the Sun and Moon are separated by 90° when viewed from the Earth, and the solar tidal force partially cancels the Moon's tidal force. At these points in the lunar cycle, the tide's range is at its minimum; this is called the neap tide, or neaps. Neap is an Anglo-Saxon word meaning \\"without the power\\", as in forðganges nip (forth-going without-the-power).Spring tides result in high waters that are higher than average, low waters that are lower than average, 'slack water' time that is shorter than average, and stronger tidal currents than average. Neaps result in less extreme tidal conditions. There is about a seven-day interval between springs and neaps. What is an answer for this question: In which case the low waters would be higher, case A or case B? A:","completion":"In case B, the low waters would be higher. This is because case B refers to the neap tide, during which the tidal range is at its minimum. Neap tides have less extreme tidal conditions, meaning the high waters are not as high and the low waters are not as low compared to the spring tide (case A). In contrast, the spring tide (case A) has high waters that are higher than average and low waters that are lower than average.

Please answer the following question: Use information from the paragraph to answer the question. Question: Will induces diffusion in a gas and a liquid. The gas likely diffuses much faster or slower? Paragraph : This is also called diffusion, and the process is much faster in gases than in liquids, because the particles in gases are further apart. A:","completion":"Based on the given paragraph, the process of diffusion is much faster in gases than in liquids. The primary reason for this increased rate of diffusion in gases is attributed to the fact that particles in gases are further apart from each other compared to those in liquids. Diffusion is the process in which particles spread out evenly within a given space as a result of their inherent kinetic energy, which drives them to move randomly. In both gases and liquids, molecules are in constant motion, colliding with each other and their container walls. However, there are some key factors that cause the difference in diffusion rates between gases and liquids: 1. Particle spacing: In gases, the particles are spaced much further apart than they are in liquids. This allows them to travel greater distances without being obstructed by neighboring particles, making diffusion more efficient. In contrast, the particles in liquids are more tightly packed together, which results in more frequent collisions, thereby slowing down the rate of diffusion. 2. Kinetic energy: Since gas molecules possess higher kinetic energy than liquid molecules, they tend to move at faster speeds, resulting in quicker diffusion. The increased movement and speed of these gas particles contribute to the overall faster rate of diffusion compared to that in liquids. 3. Intermolecular forces: Lower intermolecular forces in gases allow the particles to move more freely than in liquids, where these forces are much stronger. The stronger forces in liquids keep particles relatively closer, thus slowing down the diffusion process as the particles encounter more resistance while moving. In conclusion, induced diffusion in a gas occurs at a much faster rate than in a liquid due to the greater spacing between gas particles, their higher kinetic energy, and the weaker intermolecular forces present in gases compared to liquids."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

(CNN) -- The U.S. space shuttle program retired in 2011, leaving American astronauts to hitchhike into orbit. But after three long years, NASA's successor is almost ready to make an entrance. Orion, the agency's newest manned spaceship, is being prepared for its first mission in December. In future missions, it will journey into deep space -- to Mars and beyond -- farther than humans have ever gone before. Orion comes loaded with superlatives. It boasts the largest heat shield ever built and a computer 400 times faster than the ones on the space shuttles. It will be launched into space on the most powerful rocket NASA has ever made. No astronauts will be aboard the December flight, which will test the spacecraft's systems for future manned missions. Final work on the spacecraft is under way at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Orion came one step closer to completion this month with the stacking of the crew module atop the service module. \\"Now that we're getting so close to launch, the spacecraft completion work is visible every day,\\" Orion Program Manager Mark Geyer said in a statement. A 3,600-mile journey When complete, the Orion capsule will resemble a fencing foil, with a tall spire shooting up from a rounded base. At the top will sit a launch abort system, with downward-facing thrusters that would save the crew from a jarring crash in the event of a rocket malfunction. The bottom portion, the service module, will perform various functions such as in-space propulsion and cargo storage. Nestled between the two will be the crew module, capable of supporting human life from launch until recovery. Attached to the service module will be a United Launch Alliance Delta IV Heavy rocket. For the first time since the space shuttle's debut launch in 1981, the crew compartment will ride on the tip of the rocket rather than hanging onto its side, evoking the configuration of the famous Apollo or Gemini missions.

But so, evidently, was the Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe, according to a recent study. Brahe, who was born in 1546 and died in 1601, was a keen observer of the heavens. But he also was exposed to enough gold while he was alive for it to show up in tests of his hair— in fact, researchers found about 20 to 100 times the amount of gold in hair samples from Brahe’s corpse than is normal today. The hair came from his eyebrows, beard, and scalp, and the scientists also found evidence in his bones that he’d been exposed to gold. The work was carried out by Kaare Lund Rasmussen, an associate professor at the University of Southern Denmark. Brahe’s body was exhumed in 2010. DA VINCI DISCOVERY: RARE DRAWING, VALUED AT 16 MILLION, FOUND “We found traces of gold in Tycho Brahe's hair, and we can establish that he was exposed to gold while these hairs were still on his body,” Rasmussen said, in a statement. He thinks that Brahe got the gold into his system because of his lifestyle— like the plates from which he ate. “It may have been the cutlery and plates of gold, or maybe the wine he drank contained gold leaf. It's also possible that he concocted and consumed elixirs containing gold, or that he worked with alchemy,” Rasmussen said. While gold was found in the highest amounts, the researchers also found evidence of other substances, like silver, arsenic, and iron, though not enough to poison the famed Renaissance astronomer. And while some had thought that Brahe had died from mercury poisoning, this research and past research shows that wasn’t the case. FEATHERED DINOSAUR TAIL FRAGMENT TRAPPED IN AMBER AMAZES SCIENTISTS The researchers were even able to figure out, based on Brahe’s hair and how it grew, that his exposure to the gold and other elements actually decreased in a period of about two months before he died. That means that the astronomer might have been weak before he passed away, and unable to spend time in his laboratory. “What Tycho Brahe died of is therefore still uncertain,” Rasmussen added. One theory has it that he died from an infected bladder. Brahe is also known for his nose, or lack thereof. He lost part of it in a sword fight, and wore a prosthesis— that metal piece was made of brass, previous research showed, not silver, as had been thought. The study about the golden hair was published in the journal Archaeometry.

Answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What date did Jimi Hendrix play Maple Leaf Gardens? ? In 1969, American rock musician Jimi Hendrix, who was then at the height of his career, was arrested, tried, and acquitted in Canada for drug possession. On May 3, 1969, customs agents at Toronto International Airport detained Hendrix after finding a small amount of what they suspected to be heroin and hashish in his luggage. Four hours later, after a mobile lab confirmed what had been found, he was formally charged with drug possession. Released on 10,000 bail, Hendrix was required to return on May 5 for an arraignment hearing. During a performance at Maple Leaf Gardens later that night, he displayed a jovial attitude, joking with the audience and singing a few lines of mock opera for comedic effect. At a preliminary hearing on June 19, Judge Robert Taylor set a date for December 8, at which Hendrix would stand trial for two counts of illegal possession of narcotics, for which he faced as many as 20 years in prison. While there was no question as to whether the drugs were in Hendrix's luggage, in order for the Crown to prove possession they had to show that he knew they were there. In his cross-examination of Canadian customs officials, defense attorney John O'Driscoll raised doubts about whether the narcotics belonged to Hendrix, who had no drug paraphernalia in his luggage or needle tracks on his arms. After a trial that lasted for three days, the jury deliberated for 8 hours before returning a not guilty verdict, acquitting Hendrix of both charges. The incident proved stressful for Hendrix, and it weighed heavily on his mind during the seven months that he awaited trial. Two weeks after the arrest, he told his friend, journalist Sharon Lawrence, that his fear of needles discouraged him from using heroin and that associating with junkies had convinced him it was not a drug he wanted to use. Both of Hendrix's Experience bandmates, Mitch Mitchell and Noel Redding, later stated that they had been warned about a planned drug bust the day before flying to Toronto and they believed that drugs had been planted...

Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?","completion":"Yes, both of these questions seem to be inquiring about the same basic idea: how does the technology behind a metro smart card operate? So here is a detailed answer: Metro smart cards, like many other types of smart cards, are based on a technology known as radio frequency identification (RFID). RFID technology enables contactless communication between the card and the card reader. This technology is also found in a variety of other settings, such as in access control systems, inventory tracking systems, and even in some credit cards. The smart card itself contains an embedded microprocessor, which is essentially a small computer with its own memory and operating system. The microprocessor is what allows the card to store and process information. For a metro smart card, the most important piece of information is likely the cardholder's balance, or the amount of money currently available on the card for use in paying metro fares. The process works as follows: 1. When you approach the metro gate to enter, you will engage with a card reader. This reader uses radio waves to communicate with the RFID chip in your metro smart card. You don't have to insert your card into a slot or swipe it through a reader, you just have to bring it close to the reader (usually within a few centimeters). 2. The reader will send a signal to the chip in your card, \\"waking it up\\" so that it can communicate with the reader. The signal contains a request for information, specifically the information that the card's microprocessor has stored about your account balance. 3. The microprocessor will then communicate with the card reader, sending the requested information back to the reader. At the same time, the microprocessor may also update its own records, subtracting the appropriate fare from your account balance. 4. Once the reader has received the information from your card, it will open the metro gate, allowing you to enter. The process is typically extremely quick and can often be completed in less than a second. An additional benefit of using RFID technology in smart cards is its security. Because the cards use radio waves for communication, the card doesn't have to leave your hand to be read, which decreases the chance of it being lost or stolen. Furthermore, the information communicated between the card and the reader is typically encrypted, to protect against unauthorized access. In short, metro smart cards and their associated readers represent an efficient system for managing fares in a public transportation setting. Through the use of sophisticated RFID and microprocessor technologies, these cards can provide quick, secure access to the metro system while also updating and storing information about the cardholder's account balance."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Movie title: The Three Musketeers Movie plot: In 1625 France, following in his late fathers footsteps, D'Artagnan (Chris O'Donnell) sets off to Paris in hopes of becoming a member of the Musketeers, a band of men sworn to serve and protect the King of France. D'Artagnan is pursued by Gérard and his brothers, who accuse him of blemishing their sister's honor. Gérard had saw his sister kissing D'Artagnan goodbye or as D'Artagnan put it \\"she wanted to give me something to remember her by!\\". At Musketeer headquarters, Captain Rochefort (Michael Wincott) and the cardinal's guards have disbanded the musketeers as per the orders of Cardinal Richelieu (Tim Curry), the King's minister, ostensibly to help fight in an impending war with England. Rochefort confides to the Cardinal that there are three musketeers that have refused to relinquish their duties: Athos (Kiefer Sutherland), Porthos (Oliver Platt), and Aramis (Charlie Sheen).Upon reaching Paris, the headstrong D'Artagnan has a series of chance physical encounters with these same three musketeers, resulting in D'Artagnan accepting a sword duel with each one that very day. D'Artagnan arrives at the Ruins for his first duel and, much to his surprise, Athos, Porthos and Aramis reveal themselves as musketeers.

A single-select problem: Is the question answered in a satisfactory fashion? Available options: * yes. * no.","completion":"The French, German, Dutch, and Belgian governments finally came to a compromise in regards to managing the European Central Bank (ECB) after a series of negotiations. The primary issue at stake was the selection of the ECB president and the influence each country would have within the central bank. The eventual compromise centered around the appointment of the ECB's first president and his successor, as well as reaching agreements on other aspects, such as voting rights and rotating seats, to ensure a more balanced representation of the member countries. The origins of the disagreement lay in the different preferences of these countries for the ECB presidency. The German government favored Wim Duisenberg, the Dutch central bank governor, while the French government preferred Jean-Claude Trichet, the French central bank governor. To resolve this stalemate, a gentleman's agreement was made. According to this agreement, Duisenberg would become the first ECB president but would step down before the end of his eight-year term, allowing Trichet to become his successor. In addition to the gentleman's agreement, the compromise included modifications in the decision-making process within the ECB. These alterations aimed to resolve concerns about the power dynamics among the eurozone countries. One prominent change was the introduction of a rotating system for voting rights on the Governing Council, the main decision-making body of the ECB. Under the revised structure, the number votes on the Governing Council would be changed to ensure greater fairness. The six largest eurozone economies would share four votes on a rotating basis, while the remaining smaller eurozone countries would share 11 votes. This new system offered a better balance of voting power for both large and small economies within the European Union. In conclusion, the French, German, Dutch, and Belgian governments were able to compromise on the management of the ECB by addressing the conflicts surrounding the appointment of the president and decision-making dynamics. The gentleman's agreement, which allowed Duisenberg to serve an abbreviated term as the ECB's first president, followed by Trichet, resolved disagreements over the leadership issue. Additionally, modifications to the voting rights and the decision-making structure within the ECB ensured a more balanced representation of member countries, satisfying the concerns of various governments."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

The phenomenon, which occurs when Venus's orbit brings the planet between Earth and the sun, takes place roughly twice a century—the last transit was on June 8, 2004—and won't happen again until 2117. One of the rarest of celestial events will take place today--the next transit of Venus, when the planet will appear as a small, dark disk moving across the face of the sun. Jenny Zhou has details on Lunch Break. Photo: NASA. Unlike in a solar eclipse, in which the moon temporarily obscures the sun, Venus will appear as a small black dot passing across the sun in the daytime sky. Spectators are advised to wear special solar eyeglasses, or dark, polarized lenses such as welder's glasses, to prevent eye damage. Venus will slide between the Sun and Earth next week, the last such transit for 117 years. Video: Reuters Richard Vondrak, deputy director of Solar System Exploration at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, said studying the event is \\"important in understanding our place in space.\\" The transit of Venus was critical to the determination of Earth's distance from the sun, and thus the size of the solar system, Dr. Vondrak said. In the late 19th century, scientists finally ascertained the distance based on data from several transits, after a mathematician first proposed observing the transits back in 1663. Enlarge Image Close Associated Press This June 8, 2004, file photo shows the transit of Venus, which occurs when the planet Venus passes between the Earth and the Sun, is pictured in Hong Kong. Jay M. Pasachoff, an astronomy professor at Williams College in Williamstown, Mass., said such events continue to provide scientists with insight into planets in Earth's solar system and beyond. Dr. Pasachoff, who will be in Maui, Hawaii, for the transit, will be studying it for clues to Venus's atmosphere as sunlight passes through the outer rim of the planet. He said scientists hope the same method can be used to study atmospheres on exoplanets, distant planets outside the solar system. Viewers on the East Coast of the U.S. can watch the transit of Venus with their protective glasses from 6 p.m. EDT until sunset, Dr. Vondrak said. It can be viewed from most parts of the world, but not from Portugal or from big swaths of Spain, South America and Africa. From many parts of Europe, people will be able to view the latter part of the 6½-hour transit after sunrise. Alaska and Hawaii are the only two states from which it will be possible to view the full transit. Dr. Vondrak said people can watch the transit without special glasses by tuning in to NASA's live webcast of the event from Mauna Kea, Hawaii, starting at 5:45 p.m. EDT. \\"So many people are missing the fact that it's a 21st-century topic,\\" Dr. Pasachoff said. \\"It gives us a last chance in over 100 years to test ideas about distant planets.\\" ||||| The rare Transit of Venus is coming Tuesday afternoon in the United States, and it's a once-in-a-lifetime viewing chance for West Coast viewers. The next time this astronomical phenomena will happen is 2117. At its heart, the exquisite show in the heavens is simple — Venus will cross paths between the sun and the Earth, and Earthlings will see a tiny dot floating across the surface of the sun over several hours. How to view the Transit of Venus? You could buy a pair of solar glasses from a planetarium, like the Griffith Observatory in Los Angeles, which will sell them Tuesday after 12 p.m. for 2.99 a pair. An even better view, also at the Observatory, is seeing the transit magnified by a telescope, equipped with special solar filters. PHOTO GALLERY: Solar eclipse You can also try buying No. 14 welder's glass from a welder's shop or home improvement store. Or use a pair of binoculars, preferably with more than seven times magnification, to project the sun's light onto the sidewalk or a piece of paper. If you're able to find an image of the sun, look for a tiny dot showing the image of Venus. Don't look at the sun directly. The sun's rays are so bright it will obscure Venus, and you could damage your vision. If all else fails, watch a live NASA webcast from Hawaii. This week's viewing will be only the eighth time the Transit of Venus has happened since the telescope was invented, according to NASA's Fred Espenak. It will begin at 3:06 p.m. Pacific Daylight Time, and hit the center of its journey at 6:25 p.m. The sun sets in Los Angeles at 8:02 p.m., but in points west — such as Alaska, Hawaii, Australia, eastern Asia, and most of Europe — the show will go on for two more hours. (The transit will occur on Wednesday for points west of the International Date Line.) As long as clouds don't interfere with the view, most of the world will be able to see at least part of the Transit of Venus, except for southeastern South America, western Africa, Portugal and Spain. Entire lifetimes can go by with no one being able to see a Transit of Venus, but we're living in a lucky time to see what Espenak calls one of the rarest of planetary alignments. The viewings occur only twice every 120 years. Since the telescope's invention, Espenak says, it was only viewable in 1631, 1639, 1761, 1769, 1874 and 1882; the last viewable transit happened in 2004 but happened before sunrise in the western United States. ||||| A:","completion":"This task asks you to summarize multiple news articles separated by the token \\"|||||\\".

Which researcher observed that growth in height is about 10 centimeters (almost 4 inches) per year in the average male? Hint: Another obvious change that occurs during puberty is rapid growth. This is called the adolescent growth spurt . In boys, it is controlled by testosterone. The rate of growth usually starts to increase relatively early in puberty.

Let's analyze each option in more detail: Option A: Remove the old screen and replace it with new material. In this option, you will be removing the damaged screen from the window and replacing it with a new, undamaged screen. This solution will provide you with a more consistent and satisfactory result. A new screen will have uniform mesh, which will provide better protection against bugs and debris while allowing proper air circulation. Additionally, a new screen will most likely have a longer life span than patching up the old screen with temporary solutions. Moreover, replacing the old screen will provide an aesthetically pleasing appearance, maintaining the look of the window and its surroundings. Option B: Buy a roll of duct tape and cover the hole on the inside then go outside and repeat the process. In this option, you would be using duct tape to cover the hole in the screen, both from the inside and the outside. While this may be a quick and easy fix, it is not the most reliable solution. Duct tape is a temporary fix and may not be the best choice for repairing damaged screens. The adhesive on the tape can wear off over time, causing it to peel away and expose the hole once again. This option may also affect the air circulation in an undesirable way, as the taped area will obstruct airflow in that region. Furthermore, using duct tape to cover the hole will not provide an aesthetically pleasing appearance, and it may degrade the overall look of the window and its surroundings.

Background: Thomas Cowperthwait Eakins (July 25, 1844 - June 25, 1916) was an American realist painter, photographer, sculptor, and fine arts educator. He is widely acknowledged to be one of the most important artists in American art history. For the length of his professional career, from the early 1870s until his health began to fail some 40 years later, Eakins worked exactingly from life, choosing as his subject the people of his hometown of Philadelphia. He painted several hundred portraits, usually of friends, family members, or prominent people in the arts, sciences, medicine, and clergy. Context: Eakins' first works upon his return from Europe included a large group of rowing scenes, eleven oils and watercolors in all, of which the first and most famous is Max Schmitt in a Single Scull (1871; also known as The Champion Single Sculling). Both his subject and his technique drew attention. His selection of a contemporary sport was \\"a shock to the artistic conventionalities of the city\\". Eakins placed himself in the painting, in a scull behind Schmitt, his name inscribed on the boat. Typically, the work entailed critical observation of the painting's subject, as well as preparatory drawings of the figure and perspective plans of the scull in the water. Its preparation and composition indicates the importance of Eakins' academic training in Paris. It was a completely original conception, true to Eakins' firsthand experience, and an almost startlingly successful image for the artist, who had struggled with his first outdoor composition less than a year before. His first known sale was the watercolor The Sculler (1874). Most critics judged the rowing pictures successful and auspicious, but after the initial flourish, Eakins never revisited the subject of rowing and went on to other sports themes. At the same time that he made these initial ventures into outdoor themes, Eakins produced a series of domestic Victorian interiors, often with his father, his sisters or friends as the subjects. Home Scene (1871), Elizabeth at the Piano (1875), The Chess Players (1876), and Elizabeth Crowell and her Dog (1874), each dark in tonality, focus on the unsentimental characterization of individuals adopting natural attitudes in their homes. It was in this vein that in 1872 he painted his first large scale portrait, Kathrin, in which the subject, Kathrin Crowell, is seen in dim light, playing with a kitten. In 1874 Eakins and Crowell became engaged; they were still engaged five years later, when Crowell died of meningitis in 1879. Question: When did his career begin?

Q:The Madrigal Ocean and the Listy Ocean are two bodies of water currently under observation by scientists on a planet nearly identical to Earth. Although the studies have just started, the scientists have already discovered that the salinity of the Madrigal Ocean is much lower than that of the Listy Ocean. This isn't much information, but it's progress and the scientists are not going to stop their studies until they learn all that they can about these waters. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Is the Madrigal Ocean probably connected to more or less rivers than the Listy Ocean? Hint: Located mostly in the Arctic north polar region in the middle of the Northern Hemisphere, the Arctic Ocean is almost completely surrounded by Eurasia and North America. It is partly covered by sea ice throughout the year and almost completely in winter. The Arctic Ocean's surface temperature and salinity vary seasonally as the ice cover melts and freezes; its salinity is the lowest on average of the five major oceans, due to low evaporation, heavy fresh water inflow from rivers and streams, and limited connection and outflow to surrounding oceanic waters with higher salinities. The summer shrinking of the ice has been quoted at 50%. The US National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) uses satellite data to provide a daily record of Arctic sea ice cover and the rate of melting compared to an average period and specific past years. A:","completion":"The Madrigal Ocean is probably connected to more rivers than the Listy Ocean. This conclusion can be drawn based on the hint provided, which states that the Arctic Ocean has the lowest salinity among the five major oceans on Earth. The low salinity is due to factors like low evaporation, heavy freshwater inflow from rivers and streams, and limited connection to surrounding oceanic waters with higher salinities. Since the Madrigal Ocean has a lower salinity than the Listy Ocean, it would likely be linked to a greater number of rivers, similar to the Arctic Ocean. This would result in more freshwater being deposited into the Madrigal Ocean, thus reducing the overall salinity levels."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

As the can heats up, it may explode. The kinetic-molecular theory explains why. The air inside the rigid can of soup is given more kinetic energy by the heat coming from the campfire. The kinetic energy causes the air molecules to move faster and they impact the container walls more frequently and with more force. The increase in pressure inside may eventually exceed the strength of the can and it will explode. An additional factor is that the soup may begin boiling which will then aid even more gas and more pressure to the inside of the can. and the situation: When studying the kinetic-molecular theory, two teams of students did and experiment. Team A heated a can of soup over the fire without venting it first, team B heated a can of soup, but vented it first. Answer the following question: Which team had a higher likelihood of their can exploding? Answer:","completion":"Team A had a higher likelihood of their can exploding due to the reasons explained by the kinetic-molecular theory. By heating the can of soup over the fire without venting it first, Team A created a closed system with no room for the expanding gas molecules to escape. As the heat from the campfire increased the kinetic energy of the air molecules inside the can, they moved faster and collided with the container walls more frequently and with greater force. This led to an increase in pressure inside the can. Additionally, the soup inside the can began to boil due to the increased heat, creating more gas and contributing to the pressure buildup inside the can. As the pressure continued to rise, it exceeded the strength of the can, leading to a higher likelihood of explosion. On the other hand, Team B vented their can of soup before heating it. By doing so, they allowed the expanding gas molecules and steam produced by the boiling soup to escape, thereby preventing a significant buildup of pressure inside the can. As a result, Team B's can had a lower risk of exploding compared to Team A's can. In conclusion, based on the kinetic-molecular theory and the given experimental conditions, Team A's unvented can of soup had a higher likelihood of exploding due to the accelerated molecular movement and pressure buildup within the closed container. Team B's vented can allowed for a release of pressure, which significantly reduced the chances of an explosion."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Here is an article: WASHINGTON—The Obama administration agreed to back the lifting of United Nations sanctions on two Iranian state banks blacklisted for financing Iran’s ballistic-missile program on the same day in January that Tehran released four American citizens from prison, according to U.S. officials and congressional staff briefed on the deliberations. The U.N. sanctions on the two banks weren’t initially to be lifted until 2023, under a landmark nuclear agreement between Iran and world powers that went into effect on Jan. 16. The U.N. Security Council’s delisting of the two banks, Bank Sepah and Bank Sepah International, was part of a package of tightly scripted agreements—the others were a controversial prisoner swap and transfer of 1.7 billion in cash to Iran—that were finalized between the U.S. and Iran on Jan. 17, the day the Americans were freed. The new details of the delisting have emerged after administration officials briefed lawmakers earlier this month on the U.S. decision. According to senior U.S. officials, a senior State Department official, Brett McGurk, and a representative of the Iranian government signed three documents in Geneva on the morning of Jan. 17. One document committed the U.S. to dropping criminal charges against 21 Iranian nationals, and Tehran to releasing the Americans imprisoned in Iran. Another committed the U.S. to immediately transfer 400 million in cash to the Iranian regime and arrange the delivery within weeks of two subsequent cash payments totaling 1.3 billion to settle a decades-old legal dispute over a failed arms deal. The U.S. agreed in a third document to support the immediate delisting of the two Iranian banks, according to senior U.S. officials. In the hours after the documents were signed at a Swiss hotel, the different elements of the agreement went forward: The Americans were released, Iran took possession of the 400 million in cash, and the U.N. Security Council removed sanctions on Bank Sepah and Bank Sepah International, these officials said. “Lifting the sanctions on Sepah was part of the package,” said a senior U.S. official briefed on the deliberations. “The timing of all this isn’t coincidental. Everything was linked to some degree.” A documentary published by Tasnim News Agency, an Iranian media outlet affiliated with the elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, claimed in February that Iranian government officials had demanded that Sepah be taken off the sanctions list as part of a deal to release the prisoners. The Obama administration, under the nuclear deal reached in July 2015, agreed to lift Treasury Department sanctions on Bank Sepah, but U.N. penalties were to remain in place for eight years. But after the nuclear deal was forged, U.S. officials said, there was a continued dialogue with Iran about the status of the two banks before the deal went into effect in January. Tehran argued that the banks were critical to the country’s economy and international trade. Bank Sepah is Iran’s oldest bank and one of its three largest in terms of assets. Bank Sepah International, based in London, was key to financing Iran’s international trade before sanctions were imposed. U.S. officials said there was a desire in Washington to harmonize the U.N. sanctions list with the U.S.’s. And they said Washington believed Iran had earned more sanctions relief because Tehran had been implementing the terms of the nuclear agreement, which called for a major scaling back of its infrastructure and production of nuclear fuel. “The issue of Bank Sepah has been one of many topics we discussed with Iran in our overall diplomatic discussions,” said a second senior administration official briefed on the deliberations. Another senior administration official said lifting sanctions on Bank Sepah and its London affiliate was in the spirit of the commitment by the U.S. and other world powers to provide Iran with sanctions relief. Administration critics and some congressional officials said they believed the move broke the commitments the administration made to Congress about the deal. The Obama administration had told Congress that under the deal the U.S. would lift sanctions only on companies and individuals tied to Iran’s nuclear development. Sanctions on those involved in missile development were to remain in place, these critics said. The Obama administration has repeatedly said it is committed to rolling back Iran’s ballistic missile program. “By agreeing to remove U.N. and EU sanctions eight years early on Iran’s main missile financing bank, the administration effectively greenlighted their nuclear warhead-capable ballistic missile program,” said Mark Dubowitz, a top critic of the Iran nuclear deal at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a Washington think tank. The U.S. Treasury Department sanctioned Bank Sepah, Bank Sepah International and its then-chairman in 2007 for their alleged role in backing Iran’s missile program. The designation didn’t mention what direct role the entities allegedly played in helping Iran’s nuclear program. At the time, the Treasury said that Bank Sepah and Bank Sepah International had provided financial support to Iranian-state owned companies and organizations developing Iran’s missile program. These included Iran’s Aerospace Industries Organization and the Shahid Hemmat Industries Group. “Bank Sepah is the financial linchpin of Iran’s missile procurement network and has actively assisted Iran’s pursuit of missiles capable of carrying weapons of mass destruction,” the Treasury said in a January 2007 statement. Iran has conducted up to 10 ballistic missile tests since the forging of the nuclear agreement in July 2015. The U.N. Security Council has condemned Tehran’s actions but hasn’t moved to impose any new sanctions on the country.In March, the Treasury Department imposed sanctions on two Iranian companies it said were working with Shahid Hemmat Industries. U.S. officials said the Obama administration closely vetted the activities of all individuals and entities tied to Bank Sepah before supporting the lifting of U.S. and U.N. sanctions. “We have the ability to quickly reimpose U.S. sanctions if Bank Sepah or any other entity engages in activities that remain sanctionable,” said the second senior U.S. official. The Obama administration’s decision to send such large amounts of cash to Iran has fueled charges in Congress that the White House paid ransom to Tehran to secure the release of the American prisoners. The White House has repeatedly denied the charge, saying the 1.7 billion settlement saved the U.S. as much as 8 billion that it could have owed Iran if it lost, as was expected, a court proceeding that was taking place in The Hague, Netherlands. The administration has said the cash was used as “leverage” to make sure the American prisoners were released. The dispute in Washington has only deepened in recent weeks, as senior Pentagon officials, including Secretary of Defense Ash Carter, told Congress in a hearing that they weren’t notified by the White House about the cash transfer. The chairman of the Joints Chief of Staff, Marine Gen. Joe Dunford, said at a hearing last week that he found it “troubling” that the U.S. provided Tehran with so much cash, which he argued could be used for “spreading malign influence.” Write to Jay Solomon at jay.solomon@wsj.com and Carol E.

The most widely accepted estimate for the Middle East, including Iraq, Iran and Syria, during this time, is for a death rate of about a third. The Black Death killed about 40% of Egypts population. Half of Pariss population of 100,000 people died. In Italy, the population of Florence was reduced from 110,000–120,000 inhabitants in 1338 down to 50,000 in 1351. At least 60% of the population of Hamburg and Bremen perished, and a similar percentage of Londoners may have died from the disease as well. In London approximately 62,000 people died between the years between 1346 and 1353. While contemporary reports account of mass burial pits being created in response to the large numbers of dead, recent scientific investigations of a burial pit in Central London found well-preserved individuals to be buried in isolated, evenly spaced graves, suggesting at least some pre-planning and Christian burials at this time. Before 1350, there were about 170,000 settlements in Germany, and this was reduced by nearly 40,000 by 1450. In 1348, the plague spread so rapidly that before any physicians or government authorities had time to reflect upon its origins, about a third of the European population had already perished. In crowded cities, it was not uncommon for as much as 50% of the population to die. The disease bypassed some areas, and the most isolated areas were less vulnerable to contagion.

Answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What was the debut album of the band that took its name from a fictional Phoenician city? Opeth was formed as a death metal band in 1989 in Stockholm, Sweden, by lead vocalist David Isberg. Isberg asked former Eruption band member Mikael Åkerfeldt, who was just 16 years old at the time, to join Opeth as a bassist. When Åkerfeldt showed up to practice on the day after Isberg invited him, it became clear that Isberg had not told the band members, including the band's current bassist, that Åkerfeldt would be joining the band. An ensuing argument led to all members but Isberg and Åkerfeldt leaving to form a new project. The band name was derived from the word \\"Opet\\", taken from the Wilbur Smith novel The Sunbird. In this novel, Opet is the name of a fictional Phoenician city in South Africa translated as \\"City of the Moon\\". Isberg and Åkerfeldt recruited drummer Anders Nordin, bassist Nick Döring, and guitarist Andreas Dimeo. Unsatisfied with Opeth's slow progress, Döring and Dimeo left the band after their first performance, and were replaced by guitarist Kim Pettersson and bassist Johan De Farfalla. After the next show, De Farfalla left Opeth to spend time with his girlfriend in Germany, and was initially replaced by Mattias Ander, before Åkerfeldt's friend Peter Lindgren took on the role of bassist. Rhythm guitarist Kim Pettersson left following the band's next performance, and Lindgren switched to guitar, with the role of bassist falling to Stefan Guteklint. The following year, David Isberg left the band citing \\"creative differences\\".Following Isberg's departure, Åkerfeldt took over vocal duties and he, Lindgren, and Nordin spent the next year writing and rehearsing new material. The group began to rely less on the blast beats and aggression typical of death metal, and incorporated acoustic guitars and guitar harmonies into their music; developing the core sound of Opeth. Bassist Guteklint was dismissed by the band after they signed their first record deal with Candlelight Records in 1994. Opeth initially employed former member De Farfalla as a session bassist for their demo recordings, and he...

So far, the campaign has raised almost 4,000 for the 'Shining' actress. Stanley Kubrick's daughter is spearheading an effort to raise funds for ailing actress Shelley Duvall, who starred in her father's iconic film The Shining. Vivian Kubrick began raising funds on Friday for Duvall after it was announced the 67-year-old, who now lives in Texas, was going to appear on a Friday episode of Dr. Phil. \\"I just think she deserves a great deal more respect,\\" Kubrick told The Hollywood Reporter. \\"I am just trying to collect as much money as I can.\\" Kubrick, who noted she did not know whether Duvall was receiving government benefits, told THR she would first seek professional financial advice before distributing the funds to Duvall in order to protect any current benefits she may depend on. A simple trust fund may be a good solution, she added. \\"I think more and more people now realize how brutal the Hollywood system is and how people aren't really taken care of even though the studio system has benefited greatly from their talent,\\" Kubrick told THR. \\"And I know many of them make a lot of money, but like with any artist, the money is not something that just keeps pouring in. And if you aren't blessed with business sense, you might not have held onto the money.\\" Kubrick also noted that she hopes to secure Duvall health insurance through the Screen Actors Guild, if it is possible. Duvall, who has been out of the public eye for more than a decade, seems to be suffering from mental health issues. For instance, she told the show's host, Phil McGraw, that she believes her Popeye co-star, the late Robin Williams, is still alive, just a shape-shifter. Duvall was also worried that any doctors she might visit at the behest of McGraw might try to kill her. On Thursday, Kubrick, who has not seen Duvall since her father wrapped production on The Shining, blasted McGraw for, in her opinion, exploiting the former actress and called for a boycott of the episode. On Friday, she launched a GoFundMe page for Duvall. \\"[My father] was absolutely thrilled with her performance, I know that much,\\" Kubrick laments about Duvall. \\"He said she was a fantastic Wendy Torrance, and she was. She was beautifully vulnerable and kooky and someone you might believe would stay with a Jack Torrance character.\\" So far, Kubrick's campaign for Duvall has raised more than 4,000. And Kubrick was not alone in her disgust at McGraw's segment. Mia Farrow and her son, journalist Ronan, also criticized the show for taking advantage of someone ill for ratings.

Now in his first full term at the helm, the former Leyton Orient boss feels this is the time for his work to be judged fairly. \\"I understand football managers are judged every day, every game,\\" said Slade. \\"When I came into the club there was a lot of work that needed to be done.

When you're talking to the girl you like, you want to make her feel special. People like it when others take an interest in them and the girl you like is no different. Showing that you care about her thoughts will make her more interested in you, as a result. Ask her opinion on things, even if it's something silly. For example: say you're wearing a shirt that your friend doesn't like, ask for her opinion on whether the shirt is silly or not. Tell her she's the final judge. It'll make her laugh and feel important. Pay attention to the things that she does and says, so you can ask questions about it. For example, if she mentions going rock climbing, ask her how she got started rock climbing and what she enjoys about it. People like talking about themselves, so before you jump in with stories of your own, ask her another question about what she thinks. In this day and age people have really lost the skill of listening (Really listening) to one another. Real listening is when you take the time to absorb what someone is saying rather than thinking about the next thing you're going to say or what you're going to have for dinner. For example: even if you're at a loud party, when you're having a conversation with her, maintain eye contact, ask questions and if your mind strays, ask for clarification (you can use the loud party as an excuse: \\"Sorry, it's really loud in here. Can you repeat what you just said?\\"). To this end, when you're having a conversation with her, don't fidget with stuff, or keep looking all around the room, or keep checking your phone. She'll feel that you don't really care what she has to say. Laughter is a great way to bond with someone. This doesn't mean that you need to be the class clown (Actually, it will probably work best if you aren't). All this means is that you make her laugh and say a few entertaining things. Now, everyone has a different sense of humor and you know her best, but if you're not sure there are a few things to do that rarely fail. Gently poke fun at yourself. You don't have to do a big self-deprecating speech (in fact that will make you seem not confident), but a few jabs at yourself will get her laughing and show that you don't take yourself too seriously. For example: talk about how you got hit in the head with a soccer ball that day when you weren't paying attention, or that time you went to the wrong class because you forgot what day it was. Bring up something funny that you saw that day (or within the previous week). It should be something a little out of the ordinary and funny. For example: ask her if she's ever ended up entangled with a bunch of zombies and then tell her about the zombie walk you accidentally ended up in the middle of. Flirting can be very hit or miss and is to be used with caution. Since everyone is different, there is no one-size-fits-all approach to flirting with someone. Humor and eye contact are the two big ones, but you can subtly flirt in other ways. Unless she's made it explicitly clear, flirting really obviously can be off-putting to some girls. Keep that in mind when you're hanging out with her. If you aren't a good flirt, eye contact and humor will probably be your best bets. Flirting over text, however, can be a great, non-threatening type of flirting. Of course, you want this to be only supplementary to your interactions in person. Keep texts short, sometimes a picture is worth more than a hundred words (especially a funny picture; do NOT send explicit pictures unless she has actually asked for them!). It's good to have a reason to text. You could say something like \\"saw this and thought of you\\" (and then send a picture). Giving her the right compliment can be a great way of expressing interest and flirting. Don't do something basic like \\"you're the most beautiful girl I've ever met\\" (it comes across as insincere). Instead, say something like \\"Did you realize your sweater matches your eyes? it's a beautiful color,\\" or \\"of course you aced that test, you're super smart!\\" In the end, the best way to act around the girl you like is to tell her how you feel. She might otherwise never know. It can seem super intimidating or scary to bare your feelings like that (and it is a very brave act!). But, otherwise you both will be in this uncomfortable holding pattern. Don't do it in front of everyone. Choose a time and place where you're both sober and in your right mind. Simply say \\"Hey, I really like you and I was wondering if you'd like to go on a date sometime.\\" Don't do this over the phone or text or social media, because you will come across as a coward and most girl's don't find that a particularly attractive quality. Respect her decision, even if she says \\"no.\\" It can hurt when someone says no, but remember that it isn't about you as a person, it's simply that your proposal didn't work for her (because she isn't interested, or because she already has a boyfriend, or she's into girls, etc.). You can ask why if you must, but if she simply says \\"Because I'm not interested\\" that's your answer and leave it at that. If she says \\"yes,\\" then yay! Now you two can get to planning a super fun first date. The relationship might not work out, but you proved your bravery by asking her out and your worth by treating her with respect.

A liberal arts college aims to impart a broad general knowledge and develop general intellectual capacities, in contrast to a professional, vocational, or technical curriculum. Students in a liberal arts college generally major in a particular discipline while receiving exposure to a wide range of academic subjects, including sciences as well as the traditional humanities subjects taught as liberal arts. Although it draws on European antecedents, the liberal arts college is strongly associated with American higher education, and most liberal arts colleges around the world draw explicitly on the American model. - Illinois is a state in the midwestern region of the United States, achieving statehood in 1818. It is the 5th most populous state and 25th largest state in terms of land area, and is often noted as a microcosm of the entire country.

Mousetraps are usually set in an indoor location where there is a suspected infestation of rodents. Larger traps are designed to catch other species of animals; such as rats, squirrels, other small rodents, or other animals. - A census is the procedure of systematically acquiring and recording information about the members of a given population. It is a regularly occurring and official count of a particular population. The term is used mostly in connection with national population and housing censuses; other common censuses include agriculture, business, and traffic censuses. The United Nations defines the essential features of population and housing censuses as \\"individual enumeration, universality within a defined territory, simultaneity and defined periodicity\\", and recommends that population censuses be taken at least every 10 years. United Nations recommendations also cover census topics to be collected, official definitions, classifications and other useful information to co-ordinate international practice. - Abingdon is a city in Knox County, Illinois, 50 miles (80 km) west of Peoria.

After the party, Lovell, who had orbited the Moon on Apollo 8, tells his wife Marilyn that he intends to return to the Moon and walk on its surface. On October 30, 1969, as Lovell conducts a VIP tour of NASA's Vehicle Assembly Building, his boss Deke Slayton informs him that he and his crew will fly the Apollo 13 mission instead of Apollo 14. Lovell, Ken Mattingly, and Fred Haise train for their new mission. Days before launch, Mattingly is discovered to have been exposed to rubella, and the flight surgeon demands his replacement with Mattingly's backup, Jack Swigert, as a safety precaution. Lovell initially resists breaking up his team, but relents when Slayton threatens to bump his crew to a later mission. As the launch date approaches, Marilyn has a nightmare about her husband's safety, but goes to the Kennedy Space Center the night before launch to see him off. On April 11, 1970, Apollo 13 Flight Director Gene Kranz gives the go-ahead from Houston's Mission Control Center for launch. After the Saturn V rocket climbs through the atmosphere, an engine on the second stage cuts off prematurely, but the craft still reaches its Earth parking orbit. After the third stage re-fires, sending Apollo 13 to the Moon, Swigert docks the Command/Service Module Odyssey with the Lunar Module Aquarius and pulls it away from the spent stage. Three days into the mission, the crew sends a live television transmission from Odyssey, which the networks decline to broadcast live. After Swigert performs a standard housekeeping procedure, one of two liquid oxygen tanks explodes, emptying its contents into space and sending the craft tumbling. The other tank is soon found to be leaking. Mission Control aborts the Moon landing, Lovell and Haise hurriedly power up Aquarius as a \\"lifeboat\\" for the return home, and Swigert shuts down Odyssey before its battery power runs out.

Question: Thor locks Elle an Stella out of the ship knowing that they will do what? Movie title: Starcrash Movie plot: In the distant future, a starship with an \\"important passenger\\" tries to find the base of the ruthless Count Zarth Arn, when the ship attacked by a mysterious weapon which red globs of energy enter the ship and drive the crew to madness, killing each other off.Meanwhile, in another part of the galaxy, space outlaw and smuggler Stella Star (Caroline Munroe) and her companion Akton (Marjor Gortner), are on a smuggling run when they run into the Imperial Space Police led by the space robot 'L' (or Elle in a more formal tile). After a spaceship chase sequence, Akton and Stella escape from their pursuers by jumping into hyperspace, a faster-than-light travel. They happen to find one of the escape pods from the starship in the opening scene, and find one still-alive survivor. But shortly afterwards, they are finally apprehended by the police who have also followed their hyperspace travel route.Tried, convicted and found guilty of piracy, both Akton and Stella are sentenced to life in prison. A few days later, on a prison colony, Stella manages to create a diversion and escape. But she is found by the chief-of-police Thor (Robert Tessier) who takes her to a orbiting main ship where she is reunited with Akton. It is here that they are contacted by the Emperor of the Galaxy (Christopher Plummer) via a hologram, who thanks them for the discovery of the survivor of the starship and they are granted clemency to help find one of three missing escape pods from the ship which contain the Emperor's son. The Emperor is in feud with the rouge Count Zarth Arn (Joe Spinell) who has hidden a secret weapon on a remote planet and will use it to overthrow him and take over the galaxy for himself and his legion of evil warriors. With Chief Thor and the robot Elle accompanying them, the Emperor tells Stella and Akton to find the Count's secret weapon as well as rescue his son who may be still alive.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: Article: A new study has found that it may be possible to train people to be more intelligent, increasing the brainpower they had at birth. Until now,it has been widely assumed that the kind of mental ability that allows us to solve new problems without having any relevant previous experience--what psychologists call fluid intelligence--is innate and cannot be taught(though people can raise their grades on tests of it by practicing). But in the new study,researchers describe a method for improving this skill,along with experiments to prove it works. The key, researchers found, was carefully structured training in working memory--the kind that allows memorization of a telephone number just long enough to dial it.This type of memory is closely related to fluid intelligence,so the researchers reasoned that improving it might lead to improvements in fluid intelligence. First they measured fluid intelligence of volunteers using standard tests.Then they trained each in a complicated memory task--the child's card game,in which they had to recall a card they saw and heard.During the course, they needed to ignore irrelevant items, monitor ongoing performance,manage two tasks at the same time and connect related items to one another in space and time. The four groups experienced a half-hour of training daily for 8, 12, 17 and 19 days, respectively.To make sure they were not just improving their test-taking skills,the researchers compared them with control groups that took the tests without the training. The results, published Monday in The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,were striking.Improvement in the trained groups was a lot greater.Moreover,the longer they trained, the higher their scores were.All performers,from the weakest to the strongest,showed significant improvement. \\"Our results show you can increase your intelligence with proper training.\\" said Dr Jaeggi, a co-author of the paper.\\"No one knows how long the gains will last after training stops,\\" he added, \\"and the experiment's design did not allow the...

Never even got close to putting them in the ground-I bought 3 of them and now I get to pay the shipping back. By the time I box them up, take them to shipping just to get the remainder of my money back-might as well just throw them away and save the aggravation. Go for it if you feel lucky. Does this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment? Answer:","completion":"The product review conveys a negative sentiment. The reviewer seems to be deeply dissatisfied and frustrated with the product. It doesn't meet his/her expectations and was unable to function properly, according to the user's experience. Firstly, the user referred to the product as 'terrible', which implies an overall negative impression. The reviewer also mentioned having struggled with the product for three days, which indicates that the product is not user-friendly or straightforward to operate. The reviewer even mentioned attempts to understand the functionality of the product better by referring to videos and reading other reviews but to no avail, expressing that the product does not work as advertised. Secondly, the user's frustration is evident in the fact that the product seems to be malfunctioning, it 'can't stay cocked' and 'releases itself' before the safety latch comes on. Also, the buyer was unable to install them, as indicated by the phrase 'Never even got close to putting them in the ground'. This speaks volumes about the product's significant performance problems, according to this customer's experiences. Thirdly, buying a total of three units of the product and experiencing the failings in all of them suggests a consistent problem with the product's quality or design, furthering the negative sentiment. Lastly, the agony of needing to pay for the return shipping is another pain point for the reviewer. They commented that the effort and cost involved in returning the products might not be worth the refund, which implies not just a disappointing product but an inconvenient and costly overall customer experience. The concluding remark 'Go for it if you feel lucky' is a sarcastic comment and distinctly negative, suggesting that purchasing this product is a gamble and that other potential buyers may not want to take the risk. This sarcastic tone heightens the negativity of the review, emphasizing the reviewer's dissatisfaction. Therefore, based on these observations, it is clear that the given review carries a negative sentiment about the product."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Definition: In this task, you will be shown a prompt from a judicial decision and multiple holding statements derived from citations following text in a legal decision. Holdings represent the governing legal rule when the law is applied to a particular set of facts. There are five answer choices for each citing text. The correct answer is the holding statement that corresponds to the citing text. You should write an incorrect option. Even though there exist multiple wrong answers, we only need a single wrong answer. There is a <HOLDING> token in the position of the citing text prompt where the holding statement was extracted. Input: & Health Review Comm’n, 649 F.2d 1160, 1165 (5th Cir. Unit B July 9, 1981)). As for the knowledge element (the one at issue in this case), the Secretary can prove employer knowledge of the violation in one of two ways. First, where the Secretary shows that a supervisor had either actual or constructive knowledge of the violation, such knowledge is generally-imputed to the employer. See Georgia Elec. Co. v. Marshall, 595 F.2d 309, 321 (5th Cir.1979); New York State Elec. & Gas Corp., 88 F.3d at 105; see also Secretary of Labor v. Access Equip. Sys., Inc., 18 O.S.H. Cas. (BNA) 1718, at *9 (1999). An example of actual knowledge is where a supervisor directly sees a subordinate’s misconduct. See, e.g., Secretary of Labor v. Kansas Power & Light Co., 5 O.S.H. Cas. (BNA) 1202, at *3 (1977) (<HOLDING>). An example of constructive knowledge is where Holding statements: (A) holding that because the supervisor directly saw the violative conduct without stating any objection his knowledge and approval of the work methods employed will be imputed to respondent (B) holding that the use of the word or in a statute indicates that any of the listed alternative methods will suffice (C) holding that the foundational prerequisites are unnecessary where the test result is admitted in evidence without objection when evidence of one of the issues in the case is admitted without objection the party against whom it is offered waives any objection to the evidence and it may be properly considered even if the evidence would have been excluded upon a proper objection (D) holding that to preserve an alleged error in the admission of evidence a timely objection must be made to the introduction of the evidence specific grounds for the objection should be stated and a ruling on the objection must be made by the trial court (E) holding that constructive knowledge was shown where the supervisor who had just walked into the work area was 10 feet away from the violative conduct Output:","completion":"(B) holding that the use of the word or in a statute indicates that any of the listed alternative methods will suffice"},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer:","completion":"In order to provide a comprehensive and detailed validation of the suggested answer, we will first break down the original question and the suggested answer, and then analyze if the provided information is sufficient, accurate, and appropriate. Original Question: What are web related servers? Based on the question, it seems that you are asking for an explanation or a description of servers that play a role in web-based processes or host web applications. Suggested Answer: Multiple web servers may be used for a high traffic website, here four Sun Fire X4200 servers are installed together. The suggested answer addresses the fact that multiple web servers can be employed for high-traffic websites, and it provides a specific example of four Sun Fire X4200 servers being used in such a scenario. However, the suggested answer fails to provide an adequate explanation or description of what web-related servers are, as requested by the original question. A more suitable and detailed answer to the original question would be: Web-related servers are computing systems designed to handle requests, process data, and deliver web content (such as web pages and applications) to clients via the internet or internal networks. Web-related servers can be broadly categorized into several types, including: 1. Web server: A web server is specifically designed to host websites and provide requested web pages or files to clients via the HTTP or HTTPS protocols. Examples of web server software include Apache HTTP Server, Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS), and NGINX. 2. Application server: An application server hosts and runs web applications, providing business logic and computational resources necessary for web-based application execution. This server type often handles tasks like data validation and database communication. Examples include WildFly, GlassFish, and IBM WebSphere. 3. File server: A file server stores and manages files, making them accessible to clients over a network. File servers facilitate remote access, sharing, and secure data storage. Examples include Network Attached Storage (NAS) devices or File Transfer Protocol (FTP) servers. 4. Database server: A database server retrieves, stores, and manages data for web-based applications housed in relational or non-relational databases. Popular database servers include Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle Database, and MySQL. 5. Proxy server: A proxy server sits between clients and other servers, acting as an intermediary to optimize performance and provide security features. Proxy servers can help with load distribution, caching, and monitoring resources, while also mitigating the risk of potential cyberattacks. In conclusion, while the suggested answer provides a specific example of utilizing multiple web servers for a high traffic website, it fails to address the original question about what web-related servers are. The aforementioned detailed answer should provide a more comprehensive and informative response to the original query."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Red ribbons are tied at each end. a scissor","completion":"Based on the provided information and context, the most logical next event would be for someone to use the scissors to carefully cut the tape and ribbon, in order to unwrap the gift and reveal its contents. Here is a detailed and long answer outlining how this event may unfold: 1. Preparing to unwrap the gift: The person who is about to unwrap the gift should make sure they have enough space on a table, floor, or any flat surface. This allows them to comfortably unwrap the gift without damaging the contents. They may also grab a small trash bag or designated container to dispose of the wrapping materials, keeping the workspace tidy as they proceed. 2. Cutting the tape: The individual would then hold the scissors with one hand, making sure that they have a firm and comfortable grip on the scissors. Using a pair of scissors with a pointed tip is useful for greater precision when cutting the tape. They would carefully slide the tip of the scissors under the tape, making sure not to puncture the wrapping paper or the gift inside. Once the scissors are in place, they can then apply gentle pressure to cut the tape without tearing the wrapping paper. 3. Cutting the ribbons: Having successfully cut the tape, the person would now move on to cutting the red ribbons on both ends. They can use their other hand to steady the ribbon, holding it in place so it doesn't move as they cut. The person should take care not to accidentally cut too close to the gift inside, as this could damage the contents. Once the ribbons have been cut, they can be removed and placed in the designated disposal container. 4. Removing the clear plastic: With the tape and ribbons out of the way, it is now time to remove the clear plastic that surrounds the gift. The person should gently lift the plastic from one corner, being mindful not to damage the gift or the wrapping paper underneath. They can then delicately peel the plastic away, repeating this process for each remaining corner. Once the plastic has been fully removed, it should also be placed in the designated disposal container. 5. Unwrapping the gift: With the clear plastic, tape, and ribbons removed, the person can now proceed to unwrap the gift. They should gently lift the edges of the wrapping paper and pull them away from the gift. If the paper is taped to the gift itself, they can use the scissors to carefully cut this tape as well. As the wrapping paper is removed, the person should continue to be gentle in order to preserve the gift inside. 6. Revealing the contents: Once the wrapping paper has been completely removed, the gift will be revealed. The person who unwrapped the gift can now take a moment to appreciate the contents before properly disposing of all the wrapping materials and cleaning up the workspace. This step-by-step process outlines the most logical next event following the given scenario – unwrapping the gift-wrapped present using a scissor."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

According to the text, in many parts of the world, Napa cabbage is known as \\"Chinese cabbage.\\" The term \\"Chinese cabbage\\" is used since it can be easily distinguished from the regular cabbage that we are familiar with, which belongs to the Brassica oleracea species. Furthermore, the text indicates that in Australia, Napa cabbage is referred to as \\"wombok.\\" Napa cabbage is characterized by its elongated shape, crinkly pale green leaves, tender white stalks, and mild flavor. Its versatility makes it suitable for a wide range of culinary uses, ranging from raw consumption in salads to cooked preparations such as stir-fries, soups, and pickling. A well-known example of Napa cabbage usage is in the traditional Korean side dish called kimchi, where the vegetable is salted, seasoned, and fermented.

Question: Which British-based clothing and adult toy company is named after the secretary of the male founder Caborn Waterfield? Answer:","completion":"The British-based clothing and adult toy company named after the secretary of the male founder, Caborn Waterfield, is Ann Summers. The company was founded in 1972 and has since become a household name in the United Kingdom, known for selling a range of lingerie, adult toys, and other intimate products. Caborn Waterfield, a businessman and entrepreneur, established the company with the intention to revolutionize the adult retail market in the UK. Before founding Ann Summers, the adult retail space in the UK had a somewhat seedy reputation and was primarily dominated by male-oriented shops. Waterfield's vision was to create a brand that would break away from this stigma and cater to both men and women equally, offering a diverse range of products to enhance their intimate lives. The name Ann Summers was inspired by Waterfield's secretary, Annice Summers, because he wanted a catchy name that would appeal to both genders and reflect the company's mission to provide products for the evolving sexual needs of couples. Waterfield ultimately chose his secretary's name because he felt it had the right mix of approachability and female-empowerment. Ann Summers has grown substantially since its founding, now operating over 100 retail stores in the UK and Ireland, as well as an extensive online presence. The company is widely credited with transforming the way adult products are sold by creating a more welcoming and inclusive shopping environment. Its stores are brightly lit and have a women-friendly atmosphere, reflecting the company's commitment to breaking down the barriers surrounding the adult retail industry. In addition to offering a diverse range of products for women and men, Ann Summers has also become a pioneer in hosting 'party plan' events, which are similar to Tupperware-style parties. At these events, which usually take place in the homes of Ann Summers' consultants or party hosts, women can get together to discuss and try a selection of the company's products in a comfortable and private setting. Ann Summers prides itself on promoting a sex-positive message and empowering women and men to explore their desires in a safe, judgment-free space. This approach has led to its sustained success, allowing the company to remain relevant and adapt to the changing cultural landscape over the years. The brand has come a long way, and its strong focus on inclusivity and female empowerment has helped redefine the adult retail market in the UK."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Despite my anticipation, my experience at this establishment was nothing short of disappointing. Upon entering, I found the ambiance of the restaurant quite lackluster and ordinary. The dim lighting made it difficult to navigate through the room, and the tables felt cramped. Service started as a slow trudge, taking 20 minutes just to get water and have our orders taken. Without any exaggeration, my main course was an epicurean calamity. I ordered the grilled salmon with lemon herb sauce, and what arrived resembled a sad, overcooked slab of fish, completely devoid of any sauce. My dining companions did not fare any better - the risotto was mushy and bland, while the steak was cooked unevenly and lacked seasoning. What struck me as worse than the poor quality of food was the apathetic attitude of the staff. When I approached them to express my dissatisfaction, they provided a lukewarm apology but failed to offer any solution or compensation. For a restaurant that is supposedly top-tier, this is absolutely unacceptable. My overall experience at \\"The Happy Plate\\" left me feeling unimpressed and dissatisfied.

The décor was elegant and inviting, with tasteful artwork and just the right level of lighting to create a warm, comfortable atmosphere. \\"The Flavorful Oasis\\" offers a wide variety of dishes, making it hard to choose from their extensive menu. Eventually, I decided on the pan-seared sea bass with a tropical mango salsa, accompanied by garlic mashed potatoes. When I took my first bite, I was transported to culinary heaven. The sea bass was cooked to perfection, flaky and tender on the inside, while the mango salsa was a harmonious blend of sweetness and acidity. The garlic mashed potatoes were creamy and packed with flavor - utter decadence on a plate! The stellar service we experienced only added to our fantastic evening. Our server was attentive, friendly, and knowledgeable about the menu, consistently ensuring we were enjoying our meal and never in need of anything. Furthermore, the owner even paid us a visit to inquire about our dining experience, emphasizing their genuine commitment to customer satisfaction.

The father of the bride, Dominick Bertolo (Luther Adler) is a Mafia don, as is the groom's brother, Frank. And among those paying their respects as guests at the wedding are mob leaders like Egan (Murray Hamilton), Rotherman (Val Avery) and Levin (Alan Hewitt), who are the equals of Frank and Dominick in the New York region's organized crime. These capos within the Organization meet as a board to coordinate their business. The majority becomes increasingly unhappy with Frank's position, as he seems opposed to every new idea. Frank also dispenses justice on his own in the old Sicilian fashion, without seeking approval from the others.

Frank still fondly remembers his father, who also was a mafioso who was assassinated in a hit.

Aristotle believed that emotions were an essential component of virtue. In the Aristotelian view all emotions (called passions) corresponded to appetites or capacities. During the Middle Ages, the Aristotelian view was adopted and further developed by scholasticism and Thomas Aquinas in particular. There are also theories of emotions in the works of philosophers such as René Descartes, Niccolò Machiavelli, Baruch Spinoza and David Hume.

Regular readers of Beauty Best Friend may recall that I reviewed their Full Cream Moisturiser last year, but having received this Oil Cleansing Method* cleanser in a goody bag from a blogger event a couple of months ago it fired up my love for them all over again! MooGoo is an Australian natural skincare brand that was first created when the founder adapted a cream used in dairy farms to help a family member with a skin problem. Their products contain lots of natural oils and are not tested on animals – well, apart from the very first of their products that was created for cows! Moogoo Oil Cleansing Method is an all natural cleansing oil that can be used in two ways…. you can use it like a wash-off cleanser by applying a few drops to the face then rinsing it off with warm water, or my favourite method is to massage the oil into the skin then place a warm flannel or muslin over the face to allow the oil to draw any impurities out of the skin, before wiping away the oil. This is a great way of starting off a DIY facial at home! There are four varieties of Oil Cleansing Method, I’ve been using the one for Oily Skin but it’s also available in Normal, Combination and Dry too. The ingredients include ‘drawing oils’ that help to lift dirt and germs off the skin so they can be washed away, plus the Oily one contains Juniper Oil which helps to prevent bacteria on the skin, great for helping keep spots at bay.

In other words, you need to apply the knowledge of geometry to find the volume of the described cube. The guidelines provided are the dimensions of the original cube: its volume is 64 cubic feet. The second cube has length, width, and height, which are twice the corresponding dimensions of the original cube. Using these guidelines, here's what you have to do: 1. Understand the properties of a cube. A cube has equal length, width, and height, and the volume of a cube is calculated by cubing the length of any side. So, if the cube has a volume of 64 cubic feet, it means that the side length of this cube is the cube root of 64, which is 4 feet. 2. Now consider the second cube, which is twice as long, wide, and high as the original cube. Therefore, the length, width, and height of this cube would be 2 times the respective dimensions of the original cube. In this case, 2 times the side length of the original cube (4 feet) gives you 8 feet. 3. Calculate the volume of the second cube. Unlike area, volume scales cubically, meaning that every dimension is cubed (multiplied by itself twice). Thus, the volume of the second cube is the cube of its side length; that is, 8 feet cubed or (2 * 4 feet) cubed equals 512 cubic feet.

The bulk of the larger states, and some groups of small states, were integrated through a different, four-step process. The first step in this process was to convince groups of large states to combine to form a \\"princely union\\" through the execution by their rulers of Covenants of Merger. Under the Covenants of Merger, all rulers lost their ruling powers, save one who became the Rajpramukh of the new union. The other rulers were associated with two bodies—the council of rulers, whose members were the rulers of salute states, and a presidium, one or more of whose members were elected by the rulers of non-salute states, with the rest elected by the council. The Rajpramukh and his deputy Uprajpramukh were chosen by the council from among the members of the presidium. The Covenants made provision for the creation of a constituent assembly for the new union which would be charged with framing its constitution. In return for agreeing to the extinction of their states as discrete entities, the rulers were given a privy purse and guarantees similar to those provided under the Merger Agreements.Through this process, Patel obtained the unification of 222 states in the Kathiawar peninsula of his native Gujarat into the princely union of Saurashtra in January 1948, with six more states joining the union the following year. Madhya Bharat emerged on 28 May 1948 from a union of Gwalior, Indore and eighteen smaller states.

Sverdrup and Oftedal had been concerned about hierarchy within the Christian church as well as the study of the Bible. They believed that, according to the New Testament, the local congregation was the correct form of God's kingdom on earth.

The prince's estate and wealth may be located mainly or wholly outside the geographical confines of the principality. - Liechtenstein , officially the Principality of Liechtenstein, is a doubly landlocked German-speaking microstate in Central Europe. It is a constitutional monarchy with the rank of principality, headed by the Prince of Liechtenstein. - Montafon (in local dialect: \\"\\"Muntafu\\")\\" is a 39 km long valley in the federal state of Vorarlberg (Austria) that is crossed by the river Ill (Vorarlberg). It extends from the city of Bludenz and the Verwall Alps in the north, to the Silvretta and Rätikon mountain range in the south. Piz Buin is with 3312m the highest peak within the Silvretta mountain range. - Gorfion is a mountain on the border of Austria and Liechtenstein in the Rätikon range of the Eastern Alps , with a height of 2,308 metres ( 7,572 ft ) . - A mountain range (also mountain barrier, belt, or system) is a geographic area containing numerous geologically related mountains. A mountain system or system of mountain ranges, sometimes is used to combine several geological features that are geographically (regionally) related. On Earth, most significant mountain ranges are the result of plate tectonics, though mountain ranges are formed by a range of processes, are found on many planetary mass objects in the Solar System and are likely a feature of most terrestrial planets. - The Central Eastern Alps, also referred to as Austrian Central Alps or just Central Alps comprise the main chain of the Eastern Alps in Austria and the adjacent regions of Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Italy and Slovenia. - The Alpine Rhine Valley is a glacial alpine valley, formed by the part of the Alpine Rhine (German: ) between the confluence of the Anterior Rhine and Posterior Rhine at Reichenau and the Alpine Rhine's mouth at Lake Constance. From Reichenau, the Alpine Rhine flows east, passing Chur and turning north, forms the border between the canton of St. Gallen of Switzerland on the left, west side and first Liechtenstein and then Vorarlberg, Austria on the right, east side. The Swiss-Austrian border follows the historical bed of the Rhine, but today the river follows an artificial canal within Austria for the final . The Rhine Valley in this area extends to about . Its upper third has the character of an Alpine valley, enclosing a bottom plain of about across. Downstream of Vaduz, the valley widens considerably, developing into a broad plain, measuring some across at its lower end along the southern shores of Lake Constance. From the point of the Rhine's emergence from Lake Constance, it is known as High Rhine. - Central Europe lies between Eastern Europe and Western Europe. The concept of Central Europe is based on a common historical, social and cultural identity. Central Europe is going through a phase of \\"strategic awakening\\", with initiatives such as the CEI, Centrope or V4. While the region's economy shows high disparities with regard to income, all Central European countries are listed by the Human Development Index as very highly developed. - Vorarlberg is the westernmost federal state (\\"Bundesland\\") of Austria. Although it has the second-smallest area (Vienna is the smallest) and population (Burgenland is less populated), it has the second-highest population density (after Vienna).

The peaks and mountain passes are lower compared to the Western Alps, while the range itself is broader and less arched. - The Rätikon is a mountain range of the Central Eastern Alps located at the border between Vorarlberg, Liechtenstein and Graubünden. It is the geological border between the Eastern and Western Alps and stretches from the Montafon as far as the Rhine. In the south, the Prättigau is its limit, in the north the Walgau. In the east, it borders the Silvretta groups. - The Alps are the highest and most extensive mountain range system that lies entirely in Europe, stretching approximately across eight Alpine countries: Austria, France, Germany, Italy, Liechtenstein, Monaco, Slovenia, and Switzerland. The mountains were formed over tens of millions of years as the African and Eurasian tectonic plates collided. Extreme shortening caused by the event resulted in marine sedimentary rocks rising by thrusting and folding into high mountain peaks such as Mont Blanc and the Matterhorn. Mont Blanc spans the FrenchItalian border, and at is the highest mountain in the Alps. The Alpine region area contains about a hundred peaks higher than 4000 metres (just over 13,000 feet). - A constitutional monarchy (also known as a parliamentary monarchy) is a form of monarchy in which the sovereign exercises their authorities in accordance with a written or unwritten constitution. Constitutional monarchy differs from absolute monarchy (in which a monarch holds absolute power), in that constitutional monarchs are bound to exercise their powers and authorities within the limits prescribed within an established legal framework. Constitutional monarchies range from countries such as Morocco, where the constitution grants substantial discretionary powers to the sovereign, to countries such as Sweden or Denmark where the monarch retains very few formal authorities. - The Prättigau Valley, in the canton of Graubünden (Grisons), Switzerland, is home to the world-famous ski resorts of Klosters and neighbouring Davos in the Landwasser Valley. At its heart is the river Landquart. The valley extends upwards from Landquart, a key transport terminal just north of Chur, the capital of Grisons.

Q:Depleted soils can be protected from soil erosion by groundcover plants such as naturally growing grasses in agroforestry systems. These help to stabilise the soil as they increase cover compared to short-cycle cropping systems. Soil cover is a crucial factor in preventing erosion. Cleaner water through reduced nutrient and soil surface runoff can be a further advantage of agroforestry. The runoff can be reduced by decreasing its velocity and increasing infiltration into the soil. Compared to row-cropped fields nutrient uptake can be higher and reduce nutrient loss into streams.Further advantages concerning plant growth: Dan, a renowned pedologist, visited two farms near his home town. Grape farm had depleted soils and a low crop production, while Fruit farm, having parcels with depleted soils in the past, established an agroforestry system starting a decade ago which helped stabilize soil and increase production. Which farm didn't obtain cleaner water as a result of their farming methods? A:","completion":"Grape farm didn't obtain cleaner water as a result of their farming methods. Step 1: Identify the key information. In this case, we have: - Depleted soils can be protected from erosion by groundcover plants in agroforestry systems - Agroforestry helps in preventing erosion, stabilizing soil, and increasing soil cover - Agroforestry can lead to cleaner water through reduced nutrient and soil surface runoff - Fruit farm implemented an agroforestry system a decade ago, which helped stabilize soil and increase production - Grape farm had depleted soils and low crop production Step 2: Compare the farming methods of the two farms. Fruit farm implemented an agroforestry system that helped stabilize soil and increase production. Grape farm, on the other hand, had depleted soils and low crop production, which indicates that they did not adopt agroforestry practices. Step 3: Determine which farm didn't obtain cleaner water as a result of their farming methods.

Problem:As a boy, a reclusive and antisocial Sufferton resident, Max Seed, was disfigured in a school bus crash that killed everyone else involved in it. In 1973, Seed began torturing and murdering people, filming some of his victims starving to death in his locked basement, and ultimately racking up a bodycount of 666. In 1979, Seed is arrested by Detective Matt Bishop in a siege that claims the lives of five of Bishop's fellow officers. Seed is sentenced to death by electric chair, and incarcerated on an island prison, where he is a model inmate, only acting out when he kills three guards who try to rape him.On Seed's execution date, the electric chair fails to kill him after two shocks. Not wanting Seed to be released due to a state law that says any convicted criminal who survives three jolts of 15,000 volts each for 45 seconds walks, the prison staff and Bishop declare Seed dead and bury him alive in the prison cemetery. A few hours later, Seed digs his way out of his grave and returns to the prison, where he kills the executioner, doctor, and warden before swimming back to the mainland. The next day, while investigating the massacre, Bishop realizes Seed was responsible when he discovers the serial killer's empty cemetery plot.Over the course of several months Seed kills dozens of people, with one long shot showing him beating a bound woman with a lumberjack's axe for five straight minutes. One day, a videotape showing Bishop's house is sent to the detective's office. Knowing this means Seed is going to go after his family, Bishop races home, finding his wife, Sandy, and daughter, Emily, gone, and the four officers charged with guarding the house dismembered in the bathroom.Driving to Seed's old residence, Bishop is lured into a basement room containing a television and a video camera, and locked inside. The television turns on, and depicts Seed with Sandy and Emily. Emily informs Bishop that Seed wants Bishop to shoot himself. When Bishop hesitates, Seed kills Sandy with a nail gun, prompting Bishop into shooting himself in the head, believing that doing so will make Seed release his daughter.

Please answer the following question: Given the fact that: The gravitational force between two objects decreases as the objects move further apart. Answer the question: What is the gravitational effect on an object that is far from Earth by Earth high or low? A:","completion":"The gravitational effect on an object that is far from Earth by Earth high or low can be analyzed through the principle of gravitational force, which is described by Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation. According to this law, the gravitational force between two objects is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers. Mathematically, the gravitational force (F) is given by: F = (G * m1 * m2) / r^2 where: - G is the gravitational constant (6.67430 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2) - m1 and m2 are the masses of the two objects (in this case, Earth and the object) - r is the distance between the centers of the two objects When the object is at a high distance (far) from Earth, the value of r will be large, and as a result, the gravitational force (F) will be lower. On the other hand, when the object is close to Earth (low distance), the value of r will be smaller, and thus the gravitational force (F) acting on the object will be higher. In summary, the gravitational effect on an object that is far from Earth (high distance) will be lower, and the effect will be higher when the object is closer to Earth (low distance). It is important to note that the gravitational force never becomes zero, but it keeps decreasing with increasing distance between the objects."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

At that time, June always said, \\" If I got rich, I would buy a bigger apartment and a new wardrobe .\\" Of course, she said this just for fun and she never imagined that she would really become rich. A few years ago, June was surprised and excited when she came into a fortune from her uncle, who had been single. After receiving it, she made a shopping list. On it she wrote down all the ways she could use to spend the money. Every time I told her not to spend all of the money and to save some, she would always say impatiently , \\" I know, I know!\\" One day, when I was in June's home, she passed a piece of paper to me. \\"I thought over your suggestion for several nights. I've decided how to use the money. I hope my money will be helpful to those who need help,\\" she said. I was pleased to hear what she said.

Cut away dead or diseased branches. Prune off wispy branches. Cut off branches that are rubbing against the main stem. Prune 1/3 of the plant over several seasons to \\"restart\\" your plant. Article:","completion":"Title: How to Take Care of Your Plant: A Simple Guide for Little Gardeners Hey, little gardener! Today, I'm going to tell you how to take care of your plants by doing something called \\"pruning.\\" Pruning means cutting off some parts of the plant to help it grow better and stay healthy. So grab your kid-safe scissors and let's learn how to do this together! 1. Look for Extra Stems First, we are going to look for what we call \\"secondary stems.\\" These are like the extra arms of the plant that grow really close to the ground. If your plant is all grown up (or \\"mature\\"), you might see two or three of these extra stems. 2. Give the Seed Pods a Haircut Next, we want to find the seed pod branches. Seed pods are like little houses that the plant's seeds live in. The branches holding these seed pods might have some extra, unnecessary parts at their tops. So, just like you get a haircut, we are going to give these branches a little snip at the top. 3. Remove the Unhealthy Parts Sometimes, some parts of our plants get sick or don't look good. These are usually the dead or diseased branches. It's important to help your plant stay healthy by gently cutting away these parts. 4. Say Goodbye to Thin Branches Now, look for thin, weak branches that we call \\"wispy branches.\\" These branches don't help the plant grow very well, so we want to remove them by cutting them off. 5. Stop Branches from Rubbing Against Each Other You know how when you and your friends play \\"London Bridge,\\" you hold hands? Well, sometimes branches do that too, but it's not very good for your plant. We need to cut off the branches that are rubbing against the main stem of the plant. That way, they won't give your plant boo-boos. 6. Give Your Plant a Fresh Start Lastly, we'll do what's called \\"restarting\\" your plant. This doesn't mean starting all over. It just means we're going to help your plant feel like new again! How? By pruning off one-third of the plant. But don't do this all at once! Help your plant restart by doing this over a few different times, like over a few seasons. And that's it! Great job, little gardener! Now your plant should be all set to grow big and strong. Remember, taking care of plants is a fun and important job, so keep practicing and you'll be a plant pro in no time!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person whose third Benhardt play was La Tosca? , can you please find it? The French playwright Victorien Sardou wrote more than 70 plays, almost all of them successful, and none of them performed today. In the early 1880s Sardou began a collaboration with actress Sarah Bernhardt, whom he provided with a series of historical melodramas. His third Bernhardt play, La Tosca, which premiered in Paris on 24 November 1887, and in which she starred throughout Europe, was an outstanding success, with more than 3,000 performances in France alone.Puccini had seen La Tosca at least twice, in Milan and Turin. On 7 May 1889 he wrote to his publisher, Giulio Ricordi, begging him to get Sardou's permission for the work to be made into an opera: \\"I see in this Tosca the opera I need, with no overblown proportions, no elaborate spectacle, nor will it call for the usual excessive amount of music.\\"Ricordi sent his agent in Paris, Emanuele Muzio, to negotiate with Sardou, who preferred that his play be adapted by a French composer. He complained about the reception La Tosca had received in Italy, particularly in Milan, and warned that other composers were interested in the piece. Nonetheless, Ricordi reached terms with Sardou and assigned the librettist Luigi Illica to write a scenario for an adaptation.In 1891, Illica advised Puccini against the project, most likely because he felt the play could not be successfully adapted to a musical form. When Sardou expressed his unease at entrusting his most successful work to a relatively new composer whose music he did not like, Puccini took offence. He withdrew from the agreement, which Ricordi then assigned to the composer Alberto Franchetti. Illica wrote a libretto for Franchetti, who was never at ease with the assignment. When Puccini once again became interested in Tosca, Ricordi was able to get Franchetti to surrender the rights so he could recommission Puccini. One story relates that Ricordi convinced Franchetti that the work was too violent to be successfully staged. A Franchetti family tradition holds that Franchetti gave the work back as a grand...

It is measured by assessing the patterns of variation in temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, wind, precipitation, atmospheric particle count and other meteorological variables in a given region over long periods of time. Climate differs from weather, in that weather only describes the short-term conditions of these variables in a given region. - Agriculture is the cultivation and breeding of animals, plants and fungi for food, fiber, biofuel, medicinal plants and other products used to sustain and enhance human life. Agriculture was the key development in the rise of sedentary human civilization, whereby farming of domesticated species created food surpluses that nurtured the development of civilization. The study of agriculture is known as agricultural science. The history of agriculture dates back thousands of years, and its development has been driven and defined by greatly different climates, cultures, and technologies. Industrial agriculture based on large-scale monoculture farming has become the dominant agricultural methodology. - Food is any substance consumed to provide nutritional support for the body. It is usually of plant or animal origin, and contains essential nutrients, such as carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins, or minerals. The substance is ingested by an organism and assimilated by the organism's cells to provide energy, maintain life, or stimulate growth. - Management (or managing) is the administration of an organization, whether it be a business, a not-for-profit organization, or government body. Management includes the activities of setting the strategy of an organization and coordinating the efforts of its employees or volunteers to accomplish its objectives through the application of available resources, such as financial, natural, technological, and human resources. The term \\"management\\" may also refer to the people who manage an organization. - The Caribbean (or ) is a region that consists of the Caribbean Sea, its islands (some surrounded by the Caribbean Sea and some bordering both the Caribbean Sea and the North Atlantic Ocean) and the surrounding coasts. The region is southeast of the Gulf of Mexico and the North American mainland, east of Central America, and north of South America. - A breed is a specific group of domestic animals having homogeneous appearance (phenotype), homogeneous behavior, and/or other characteristics that distinguish it from other organisms of the same species. Breeds are formed through genetic isolation and either natural adaptation to the environment or selective breeding, or a combination of the two. Despite the centrality of the idea of \\"breeds\\" to animal husbandry and agriculture, no single, scientifically accepted definition of the term exists. A breed is therefore not an objective or biologically verifiable classification but is instead a term of art amongst groups of breeders who share a consensus around what qualities make some members of a given species members of a nameable subset. - <onlyinclude> Agricultural science is a broad multidisciplinary field of biology that encompasses the parts of exact, natural, economic and social sciences that are used in the practice and understanding of agriculture. (Veterinary science, but not animal science, is often excluded from the definition.)</onlyinclude> - A currency (from , \\"in circulation\\", from ) in the most specific use of the word refers to money in any form when in actual use or circulation as a medium of exchange, especially circulating banknotes and coins. A more general definition is that a currency is a \\"system of money\\" (monetary units) in common use, especially in a nation. Under this definition, US dollars, British pounds, Australian dollars, and European euros are examples of currency. These various currencies are recognized stores of value and are traded between nations in foreign exchange markets, which determine the relative values of the different currencies. Currencies in this sense are defined by governments, and each type has limited boundaries of acceptance. - The Dominican Republic is a sovereign state occupying the eastern two-thirds of the island of Hispaniola, in the Greater Antilles archipelago in the Caribbean region. The western one-third of the island is occupied by the nation of Haiti, making Hispaniola one of two Caribbean islands, along with Saint Martin, that are shared by two countries. The Dominican Republic is the second-largest Caribbean nation by area (after Cuba) at , and 3rd by population with 10.08 million people, of which approximately three million live in the metropolitan area of Santo Domingo, the capital city. - Plants are mainly multicellular, predominantly photosynthetic eukaryotes of the kingdom Plantae. - In economics, products can be classified into goods and services. Goods are items that are tangible, such as books, pens, salt, shoes, hats and folders. Services are activities provided by other people, such as doctors, lawn care workers, dentists, barbers, waiters, or online servers. According to economic theory, consumption of goods and services is assumed to provide utility (satisfaction) to the consumer or end-user, although businesses also consume goods and services in the course of producing other goods and services. - Port-Margot is a commune in the Borgne Arrondissement, in the Nord Department of Haiti. It has 36,937 inhabitants. - The Caribbean Sea is a sea of the Atlantic Ocean in the tropics of the Western Hemisphere. It is bounded by Mexico and Central America to the west and south west, to the north by the Greater Antilles starting with Cuba, to the east by the Lesser Antilles, and to the south by the north coast of South America. - Fiber or fibre (from the Latin fibra) is a natural or synthetic substance that is significantly longer than it is wide. Fibers are often used in the manufacture of other materials. The strongest engineering materials often incorporate fibers, for example carbon fiber and ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene. - A fuel is any material that can be made to react with other substances so that it releases chemical or nuclear energy as heat or to be used for work. The concept was originally applied solely to those materials capable of releasing chemical energy but has since also been applied to other sources of heat energy such as nuclear energy (via nuclear fission and nuclear fusion). - The history of agriculture records the domestication of plants and animals and the development and dissemination of techniques for raising them productively. Agriculture began independently in different parts of the globe, and included a diverse range of taxa. At least 11 separate regions of the Old and New World were involved as independent centers of origin. - A biofuel is a fuel that is produced through contemporary biological processes, such as agriculture and anaerobic digestion, rather than a fuel produced by geological processes such as those involved in the formation of fossil fuels, such as coal and petroleum, from prehistoric biological matter. Biofuels can be derived directly from plants, or indirectly from agricultural, commercial, domestic, and/or industrial wastes. Renewable biofuels generally involve contemporary carbon fixation, such as those that occur in plants or microalgae through the process of photosynthesis. Other renewable biofuels are made through the use or conversion of biomass (referring to recently living organisms, most often referring to plants or plant-derived materials). This biomass can be converted to convenient energy-containing substances in three different ways: thermal conversion, chemical conversion, and biochemical conversion. This biomass conversion can result in fuel in solid, liquid, or gas form. This new biomass can also be used directly for biofuels. - Borgne is an arrondissement in the Nord Department of Haiti. It has 83,823 inhabitants. Postal codes in the Borgne Arrondissement start with the number 15. - Hispaniola (Spanish: \\"La Española\\"; Latin: \\"Hispaniola\\"; Taíno: \\"Haiti\\") is the 22nd-largest island in the world, located in the Caribbean island group, the Greater Antilles. It is the second largest island in the Caribbean after Cuba, and the tenth most populous island in the world. - Medicinal plants have been identified and used throughout human history. Plants make many chemical compounds that are for biological functions, including defence against insects, fungi and herbivorous mammals. At least 12,000 such compounds have been isolated so far; a number estimated to be less than 10% of the total. Chemical compounds in plants mediate their effect on the human body through processes identical to those already well understood for the chemical compounds in conventional drugs; thus herbal medicines do not differ greatly from conventional drugs in terms of how they work. This enables herbal medicines to have beneficial pharmacology, but also gives them the same potential as conventional pharmaceutical drugs to cause harmful side effects. Moreover, plant material comes with a variety of compounds which may have undesired effects, though these can be reduced by processing. - An economy (From Greek \\"household\\" and o \\"manage\\") is an area of the production, distribution, or trade, and consumption of goods and services by different agents in a given geographical location. Understood in its broadest sense, 'The economy is defined as a social domain that emphasizes the practices, discourses, and material expressions associated with the production, use and management of resources'. Economic agents can be individuals, businesses, organizations, or governments. Economic transactions occur when two parties agree to the value or price of the transacted good or service, commonly expressed in a certain currency, but monetary transactions are only a small part of the economic domain. - Animals are multicellular, eukaryotic organisms of the kingdom Animalia (also called Metazoa). The animal kingdom emerged as a basal clade within Apoikozoa as a sister of the choanoflagellates. Sponges are the most basal clade of animals. Animals are motile, meaning they can move spontaneously and independently at some point in their lives. Their body plan eventually becomes fixed as they develop, although some undergo a process of metamorphosis later in their lives. All animals are heterotrophs: they must ingest other organisms or their products for sustenance. - Haiti , officially the Republic of Haiti, is a sovereign state located on the island of Hispaniola in the Greater Antilles archipelago of the Caribbean Sea. It occupies the western three-eighths of the island, which it shares with the Dominican Republic. Haiti is in size and has an estimated 10.6 million people, making it the most populous country in the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) and the second-most populous country in the Caribbean as a whole. - The Greater Antilles is a grouping of the larger islands in the Caribbean Sea: Cuba, Hispaniola (containing Haiti and the Dominican Republic), Puerto Rico, Jamaica, and the Cayman Islands. The Greater Antilles constitute over 90% of the land mass of the entire West Indies, as well as over 90% of its population, with the balance made of the archipelago of the Lesser Antilles, which is a chain of islands to the east (running north-south and encompassing the eastern edge of the Caribbean Sea where it meets the Atlantic Ocean) and south (running east-west off the northern coast of South America). - Borgne ( Haitian Creole : Obòy ) is a commune in the north coast of Haiti , west of Cap - Haïtien and northwest of Limbé , in Nord Department . The economy there is based on agriculture and fishery . Other nearby places include Port - Margot , Robin , and Fond La Grange . Borgne is currently in the early stages of developing a \`\` sister cities '' relationship with Honeoye Falls , New York , United States . Satellite view of Borgne - Monoculture is the agricultural practice of producing or growing a single crop, plant, or livestock species, variety, or breed in a field or farming system at a time. Polyculture, where more than one crop is grown in the same space at the same time, is the alternative to monoculture. Monoculture is widely used in both industrial farming and organic farming and has allowed increased efficiency in planting and harvest. - Trade, or commerce, involves the transfer of goods and/or services from one person or entity to another, often in exchange for money. A network that allows trade is called a market. - A farm is an area of land that is devoted primarily to agricultural processes with the primary objective of producing food and other crops; it is the basic facility in food production. The name is used for specialised units such as arable farms, vegetable farms, fruit farms, dairy, pig and poultry farms, and land used for the production of natural fibres, biofuel and other commodities. It includes ranches, feedlots, orchards, plantations and estates, smallholdings and hobby farms, and includes the farmhouse and agricultural buildings as well as the land. In modern times the term has been extended so as to include such industrial operations as wind farms and fish farms, both of which can operate on land or sea. - Ants are eusocial insects of the family Formicidae and, along with the related wasps and bees, belong to the order Hymenoptera. Ants evolved from wasp-like ancestors in the Cretaceous period, about 99 million years ago and diversified after the rise of flowering plants. More than 12,500 of an estimated total of 22,000 species have been classified. They are easily identified by their elbowed antennae and the distinctive node-like structure that forms their slender waists. - Culture can be defined in numerous ways. In the words of anthropologist E.B. Tylor, it is \\"that complex whole which includes knowledge, belief, art, morals, law, custom and any other capabilities and habits acquired by man as a member of society.\\" Alternatively, in a contemporary variant, \\"Culture is defined as a social domain that emphasizes the practices, discourses and material expressions, which, over time, express the continuities and discontinuities of social meaning of a life held in common.\\" - A civilization, or civilisation (see spelling differences), is any complex society characterized by urban development, social stratification, symbolic communication forms (typically, writing systems), and a perceived separation from and domination over the natural environment by a cultural elite. Civilizations are intimately associated with and often further defined by other socio-politico-economic characteristics, including centralization, the domestication of both humans and other organisms, specialization of labour, culturally ingrained ideologies of progress and supremacism, monumental architecture, taxation, societal dependence upon farming as an agricultural practice, and expansionism. - Fond La Grange is a village near Borgne, Haiti. A hospital is located there. The hospital is run by the Alyans Sante Borgne, a partnership between the nongovernmental organization H.O.P.E. (Haiti Outreach Pwoje Espwa, based in Rochester New York) and the Haitian government's ministry of public health (MSPP). - Borgne is a commune in the Borgne Arrondissement, in the Nord department of Haiti. The economy there is based on agriculture and fishery. Other nearby places include Port-Margot, Robin, and Fond La Grange. Borgne is currently in the early stages of developing a \\"sister cities\\" relationship with Honeoye Falls, New York, United States. - Established in 1973, the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) is an organization of fifteen Caribbean nations and dependencies. CARICOM's main purposes are to promote economic integration and cooperation among its members, to ensure that the benefits of integration are equitably shared, and to coordinate foreign policy. Its major activities involve coordinating economic policies and development planning; devising and instituting special projects for the less-developed countries within its jurisdiction; operating as a regional single market for many of its members (Caricom Single Market); and handling regional trade disputes.

GOP All but Ready to Mourn Loss of Staten Island NEW YORK -- For almost three decades, the congressional seat that includes Staten Island and a slice of Brooklyn has been a reliably Republican redoubt, the last conservative bastion in a city that is so overwhelmingly left-leaning and Democratic that it has become synonymous with \\"liberal\\" and \\"elite.\\" But after a series of twists and turns that shocked even jaded New Yorkers, the 13th Congressional District seat is now rated by Democrats nationally as their surest bet for a pickup in November. And stunned Republicans are left lamenting how the once safe district has become for them the Unlucky 13th. \\"This is going Democratic -- I don't think there's any question about that,\\" said former borough president Guy Molinari, the dean of Staten Island Republicans. He held the congressional seat for nine years himself before handing it over to his daughter, Susan Molinari. \\"It's sad losing this seat,\\" he said. \\"It's bad for the city.\\" Democrats are banking heavily on City Councilman Michael McMahon, who won the Democratic primary and has been endorsed by Sens. Hillary Rodham Clinton and Charles E. Schumer, as well as Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg (I). Loss of the 13th District seat would only add to the woes of the Republican Party statewide, which was once dominated by figures such as Nelson Rockefeller and Alfonse D'Amato but now seems headed for extinction. Democrats hold the governor's office, both U.S. Senate seats, and the State Assembly, and they are within striking distance of taking control of the state Senate in November. Only six of the state's 29 members of Congress are Republican, and Democrats are eyeing two seats as prime targets: the 13th and the 29th District seat of Rep. John R. \\"Randy\\" Kuhl Jr. in Western New York. The GOP's troubles are so bad that many Republicans are openly pleading with former mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani to get into the governor's race in 2010, if for no other reason than to try to resuscitate the state party. (Giuliani has been campaigning for Sen. John McCain for president and has made no statement about his plans). The implosion in Staten Island began in May, when popular Republican Rep. Vito J. Fossella, who has held the seat since 1997, was arrested in Virginia for drunken driving, and it was discovered he had a mistress and an out-of-wedlock child. He announced he would not seek reelection. To replace Fossella, the Staten Island Republican establishment settled on Francis H. Powers, a retired Wall Street executive and major GOP donor. But in late June, Powers died of a heart attack. Molinari said he had met with Powers two days earlier, and \\"we spent most of the time talking about his health.\\" One by one over the summer, various Republican figures declined to run for the seat, perhaps fearing a Democratic landslide in New York during a presidential-election year with an unpopular representative of the party in the White House. With Republicans unable to find a strong contender, former state assemblyman Robert Straniere stepped forward -- much to the chagrin of party leaders. Straniere served 24 years in the legislature in Albany but was dogged much of that time by questions about his tangled personal finances, bad real estate deals and failed business ventures, most recently a high-end hot dog restaurant in Manhattan that he shut down in July after only a year. Straniere won a bitter primary against cardiologist Jamshad Wyne after a campaign that included accusations that Wyne was using the nickname \\"Jim\\" to conceal his Pakistani and Muslim origins. The battle was so ugly that Wyne later quit the Republican Party and his job as party finance chief for Staten Island, claiming he was denied the nomination because of racism.

There have been some surprising events that led to this change, like a popular person from the Republican team deciding not to run for re-election.

The answer is:","completion":"The Servants were a prominent British band, emerging from the vibrant indie art rock scene of the mid-1985 and active until 1991. They found a niche in the progressive music landscape, cultivating a dedicated fan base that revered their unique style and musical prowess. Operating under the imprint of the Cherry Red Captured Tracks label, The Servants were based in the United Kingdom and featured David Westlake and Luke Haines in their lineup. Both of these members played a significant part in shaping the band's identity and contributed heartily to its body of work. David Westlake is primarily known as the primary impresario of The Servants, offering both deft musician skills coupled with a keen sense of artistic direction. Known for his deep insights into the indie art rock genre, Westlake brought a unique blend of sophistication and raw energy to the band's music. He was integral to crafting the band's distinct sense of style and aesthetic, setting them apart in a thriving and competitive music scene. Similarly, Luke Haines played a significant role in The Servants' trajectory, bringing his distinctive musical attributes to the table. His collaborative synergy with Westlake created a signature sound that helped define the band's musical character. Their music was a tasteful concoction of indie rock, underscored with elements of art rock — a genre known for challenging the norms of the popular music of the time by experimenting with various musical forms and rich atmospheric arrangements. The Servants were under the professional management of the Cherry Red Captured Tracks label. As a label known for housing adventurous and pioneering indie artists, it undoubtedly offered the right platform for The Servants. They took advantage of this with their unique brand of music and cultural resonance, creating a sound worthy of their label’s reputation. The band's official website, www.lostsheep.com/davidwestlake, hosts exclusive content that provides a deeper dive into their musical journey, including behind-the-scenes material, recorded performances, interviews, and other essential elements that offer an intimate snapshot into their artistic evolution. Unfortunately, though the band ceased to be active by 1991, their legacy persists. They left behind an impressionable music catalog revered by fans and critics alike. The Servants made a considerable impact during their active years, influencing the indie art rock genre and imparting their innovative spirit to their contemporaries and the bands that would come after them. The band's representation is perhaps best encapsulated in an image simply referred to as \\"The Servants.png.\\" This visual piece can be found on various digital platforms, embodying the band's vibe and legacy, showcasing the group’s style reflective of their artistic journey and serving as an appropriate reminder of the band's profound influence on the global indie art genre. In conclusion, The Servants were a band born of the United Kingdom's indie art rock scene, active between 1985 and 1991. While their journey may have been relatively short-lived, their significant influence and standout performances continue to resonate in the art rock scene even decades later. Through their innovation and fearless explorations of musical form, The Servants have left a long-lasting mark on the musical landscape, and their legacy continues to inspire."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Both of them are trying to change their skin complexion to help their appearances at the competition. Robin begins exposing her skin to high amounts of UV light several days a week. Samantha decides not to use any UV light and instead just uses lotion to help her skin. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Who will produce lower amounts of melanin? Hint: The epidermis also contains melanocytes , which are cells that produce melanin. Melanin is the brownish pigment that gives skin much of its color. Everyone has about the same number of melanocytes, but the melanocytes of people with darker skin produce more melanin. The amount of melanin produced is determined by heredity and exposure to UV light, which increases melanin output. Exposure to UV light also stimulates the skin to produce vitamin D . Because melanin blocks UV light from penetrating the skin, people with darker skin may be at greater risk of vitamin D deficiency. Answer:","completion":"Samantha will produce lower amounts of melanin compared to Robin. This is because melanin production is determined by heredity and exposure to UV light. Since Robin is exposing her skin to high amounts of UV light several days a week, her melanocytes will produce more melanin in response to this increased exposure. On the other hand, Samantha is not using any UV light and is only relying on lotion for her skin, so her melanin production will not be stimulated to the same extent as Robin's."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: We all enjoy the beautiful show of color1s as leaves change each autumn. But did you ever wonder how and why this happens? To answer the question, first you have to understand what leaves are and what they do. Leaves are nature's food factories. Plants take water from the ground through their roots. And they take a gas called carbon dioxide from the air. Plants use sunlight to turn water and carbon dioxide into glucose . Glucose is a kind of sugar. Plants use glucose as food for energy and as a building block for growing. The way plants turn water and carbon dioxide into sugar is called photosynthesis . That means, \\"putting together with light\\". A chemical called chlorophyll helps photosynthesis. Chlorophyll is what gives plants their green color1. As summer ends and autumn comes, the days get shorter and shorter. This is how trees \\"know\\" to begin getting ready for winter. During winter, there is not enough light or water for photosynthesis. Trees rest during this time and live off the food they stored during the summer. They begin to shut down their food-making factories. The green chlorophyll disappears from the leaves. As the bright green fades away, we begin to see yellow and orange leaves. Small amounts of these color1s have been in the leaves all along. We just can't see them in the summer, because they are covered up by the green chlorophyll. The bright reds and yellows we see in leaves are made mostly in autumn. In some trees, like maples, glucose is caught in the leaves after photosynthesis stops. Sunlight and the cool nights of autumn turn this glucose into a red color1. The brown color1 of trees like oaks is made from waste left in the leaves. It is the mixture of all these things that makes the beautiful color1s we enjoy during autumn. Question: What's the author's purpose of writing the passage? Options: A: To explain the process of trees' photosynthesis. B: To encourage readers to protect the environment. C: To analyze the reasons why leaves change color1s. D: To help readers understand what leaves and trees are.","completion":"C: To analyze the reasons why leaves change colors."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

As for its culinary offering, \\"The Vaults\\" positions itself in the fast food sector. Here’s where the establishment differentiates itself from the common perception of a restaurant offering an extensive array of delicacies spanning several cuisines. Instead, it chooses to focus on fast food – a type of mass-produced food designed for commercial resale and with a strong priority placed on \\"speed of service\\" versus other relevant factors involved in culinary science. This food is optimized to be quick to prepare and serve, hence the term \\"fast.\\" It may be pre-heated, pre-cooked to a certain extent, kept hot, or delivered as a ready-to-eat meal. The fast-food cuisine specialization by \\"The Vaults\\" highlights their target audience to primarily be individuals seeking quicker meal solutions.

The park is divided into three zones: WesternWorld, MedievalWorld and RomanWorld. The entertainment in all three areas consists primarily of interaction by the guests with androids programmed to act in character (the Old West, medieval Europe, and pre-Christian Rome, respectively). The androids are indistinguishable from human beings, apart from minor flaws in their hands, and guests are encouraged to indulge in any fantasy, including killing the androids. The androids are programmed to respond positively to guest requests, specifically including requests for sex. Delos's guests pay 1,000 a day for the experience.Peter Martin (Benjamin) a first-timer and his friend John Blane (Brolin), who has visited previously, come to the WesternWorld zone, where one of the main attractions is the Gunslinger (Yul Brynner), a robot programmed to start duels.

When the boy returns to give Martin the money, the convict's accomplice, Luc, decides that the boy is too much of a liability and tries to kill him. Martin saves Thomas's life killing his accomplice. Lili Ravenel, who is emotionally close and distant to her son, is worried about Thomas. He is not doing well at school, according to the school's chaplain who comes to complain about the boy's behavior. Lili, trapped in a humdrum existence, runs a nightclub that is situated on a river just at the water's edge. Pushed by her mother, she had married Maurice against her better judgment and now needs to escape the stifling effects of her union with him, but he continues to want her. Maurice threatens to remove the care and custody of her son from her. Lili has to perform her marital duties even after the divorce - while Maurice screens old home-movies of their domestic happiness long past and gone. After killing Luc, Martin arrives to have a drink at a bar by a river. That is...

And I was wondering How would Skylar feel afterwards? Options: [+] like they were doing a bad job. [+] like they were a good teacher. [+] willing to help students outside of class. The answer is:","completion":"After helping one of their students understand the work, Skylar would likely feel a combination of emotions: 1. Like they were a good teacher: Skylar would probably feel like they were a good teacher, as they were able to help the student with their work and make the material more understandable. This sense of accomplishment comes from knowing that they have imparted their knowledge and expertise to the student, helping them achieve a better understanding of the subject matter and succeed academically. 2. Willing to help students outside of class: Skylar would also likely feel more willing to help students outside of class in the future because of the positive experience they had with this particular student. They would see the value in offering extra support to students who may be struggling with the material or have questions about their assignments. This willingness to go above and beyond for their students shows Skylar's commitment to fostering their students' success and academic growth. While it is possible that Skylar could feel like they were doing a bad job, the fact that they were able to successfully help their student suggests that they have effectively communicated the material and would likely feel more confident in their teaching abilities.

Basically, my first experience was a very pushy salesperson at a wedding fair several years ago which really put me off the brand, and it took me a while to try their products again. But when I did I was really impressed, and I can honestly say that nothing I’ve reviewed since has disappointed me! Today I’m reviewing Temple Spa Trufflesque, an Ultra Hydration & Radiance Masque for the face. Trufflesque aims to give hydration and radiance to the skin, and plumps to help reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. It’s a luxury mask suitable for all skin types, particularly dry or dull skin, and it helps to rejuvenate tired skin too. The impressive list of ingredients includes black truffles, gold and silk peptides, but unfortunately these expensive additives contribute to Trufflesque’s slightly expensive price tag. The first thing that strikes me about this product is the amazing packaging. All Temple Spa products have really amazing, premium packaging, and I feel that they add to the feeling that you are about to use something really special on your skin. The dark glass jar has a gold lid and it is nestled in a gold and chocolate brown box with the most amazingly cute mask brush slotted in too. The mask itself is gold and it shimmers so prettily, if you look closely it’s almost as if you can see the particles of real gold! To apply you just paint the golden mask onto your face with the cute little brush (it makes applying the mask so easy) then leave for 15-20 minutes. The mask doesn’t dry completely, it stays a little bit tacky to the touch, and I find that it makes my skin tingle quite a bit. For extra benefits you can also then massage the mask into your skin for around 2 minutes, before removing with a damp muslin cloth or flannel.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the first name of the only child of Jacques-Joseph-Victor Saint-Saëns? ? Saint-Saëns was born in Paris, the only child of Jacques-Joseph-Victor Saint-Saëns (1798–1835), an official in the French Ministry of the Interior, and Françoise-Clémence, née Collin. Victor Saint-Saëns was of Norman ancestry, and his wife was from an Haute-Marne family; their son, born in the Rue du Jardinet in the 6th arrondissement of Paris, and baptised at the nearby church of Saint-Sulpice, always considered himself a true Parisian. Less than two months after the christening, Victor Saint-Saëns died of consumption on the first anniversary of his marriage. The young Camille was taken to the country for the sake of his health, and for two years lived with a nurse at Corbeil, 29 kilometres (18 mi) to the south of Paris. When Saint-Saëns was brought back to Paris he lived with his mother and her widowed aunt, Charlotte Masson. Before he was three years old he displayed perfect pitch and enjoyed picking out tunes on the piano. His great-aunt taught him the basics of pianism, and when he was seven he became a pupil of Camille-Marie Stamaty, a former pupil of Friedrich Kalkbrenner. Stamaty required his students to play while resting their forearms on a bar situated in front of the keyboard, so that all the pianist's power came from the hands and fingers rather than the arms, which, Saint-Saëns later wrote, was good training. Clémence Saint-Saëns, well aware of her son's precocious talent, did not wish him to become famous too young. The music critic Harold C. Schonberg wrote of Saint-Saëns in 1969, \\"It is not generally realized that he was the most remarkable child prodigy in history, and that includes Mozart.\\" The boy gave occasional performances for small audiences from the age of five, but it was not until he was ten that he made his official public debut, at the Salle Pleyel, in a programme that included Mozart's Piano Concerto in B♭ (K450), and Beethoven's Third Piano Concerto. Through Stamaty's influence, Saint-Saëns was introduced to the composition professor Pierre Maleden and the organ teacher...

As he zooms in, the dog, a jovial golden retriever, playfully comes closer to the small girl, wagging its tail excitedly and sharing in her infectious laughter. The small girl, clad in a pair of overalls and her sun-kissed brown hair tied up in a messy ponytail, takes a brief pause from her mopping and glances over at the dog with eyes full of innocence and curiosity. For a moment, she forgets about washing the floor, as she wraps her small arms around the gentle giant, embracing it with love and appreciation. The camera man pans the lens over to the stately house in the background, appearing to have been recently painted in a warm coral hue, with contrasting white shutters framing each window, seemingly inviting, idyllic for a family portrait. The camera captures the sunbeams streaming through the lush trees, creating a kaleidoscope of dancing shadows along the garden path leading to the main entrance of the house. Beautifully manicured flowerbeds filled with vibrant blossoms spread their perfume into the air, giving life and color to the scene's surroundings.

This is not a mere chore for the small girl, nor a simple task on this picturesque day; it is a testament to the love and life of the family that inhabits this serene haven. The lens moves back to focus on the girl, who has now returned to her work, but not without once again enjoying the company of her beloved canine companion, who playfully chases the mop and barks with joy, joining her in completing the task at hand. For the camera man, this footage serves as a living reminder that in a world full of noise and chaos, there exists a small pocket of serenity and happiness to cherish, a family bound together by love and responsibility, shared between humans and animals alike, an interconnected circle of warmth and harmony, manifested in the seemingly mundane yet inexplicably profound task of washing the floor on a sunny afternoon.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Blood cells tend to degrade quickly, and earlier scans for blood within Oetzi's body turned up nothing. Now a study in the Journal of the Royal Society Interface shows that Oetzi's remarkable preservation extends even to the blood he shed shortly before dying. The find represents by far the oldest red blood cells ever observed. It is just the latest chapter in what could be described as the world's oldest murder mystery. Since Oetzi was first found by hikers with an arrow buried in his back, experts have determined that he died from his wounds and what his last meal was. There has been extensive debate as to whether he fell where he died or was buried there by others. In February, Albert Zink and colleagues at the Eurac Institute for Mummies and the Iceman in Bolzano, Italy . An earlier study by the group, published in the Lancet , showed that a wound on Oetzi's hand contained haemoglobin, a protein found in blood - but it had long been presumed that red blood cells' delicate nature would have precluded their preservation. Prof Zink and his colleagues collaborated with researchers at the Center for Smart Interfaces at the University of Darmstadt in Germany to apply what is known as atomic force microscopy to thin slices of tissue taken from an area surrounding the arrow wound. The technique works using a tiny metal tip with a point just a few atoms across, dragged along the surface of a sample. The tip's movement is tracked, and results in a 3-D map at extraordinary resolution. The team found that the sample from Oetzi contained structures with a tell-tale \\"doughnut\\" shape, just as red blood cells have. To ensure the structures were preserved cells and not contamination of some kind, they confirmed the find using a laser-based technique called Raman spectroscopy - those results also indicated the presence of haemoglobin and the clot-associated protein fibrin. That, Prof Zink explained, seems to solve one of the elements of the murder mystery. \\"Because fibrin is present in fresh wounds and then degrades, the theory that Oetzi died some days after he had been injured by the arrow, as had once been mooted, can no longer be upheld,\\" he said. The team also suggest that their methods may prove to be of use in modern-day forensics studies, in which the exact age of blood samples is difficult to determine. What is a summary of this text?","completion":"This text is about Oetzi, who is an ancient frozen man that scientists are studying.

The girls' name Vanessa was invented by which 18th century Anglo-Irish writer?","completion":"The girls' name Vanessa was invented by the 18th century Anglo-Irish writer Jonathan Swift. Swift is considered one of the greatest satirists in the English language, known for his works like \\"Gulliver's Travels,\\" \\"A Tale of a Tub,\\" and \\"A Modest Proposal.\\" He was born on November 30, 1667, in Dublin, Ireland, and died on October 19, 1745. The name Vanessa came about as a result of the relationship between Jonathan Swift and Esther Vanhomrigh. Esther Vanhomrigh was the daughter of a Dutch merchant who settled in Ireland. She became infatuated with Swift, who was more than 20 years her senior, after he became her tutor in the early 1700s. They developed an intense friendship, and Swift would often send her letters under the pseudonym Cadenus, an anagram of Decanus, which means \\"Dean,\\" a title Swift held at St. Patrick's Cathedral in Dublin. Jonathan Swift created the name Vanessa by merging \\"Van\\" from Esther's last name, \\"Vanhomrigh,\\" and \\"Essa,\\" a pet form of her first name, \\"Esther\\". He used this name when referring to her in their private correspondence and in the poem \\"Cadenus and Vanessa,\\" which was published after both of their deaths. The poem chronicles the friendship between Cadenus (Swift) and a young woman named Vanessa (Esther Vanhomrigh). It is believed that their friendship was unlikely to have been a romantic one, at least on Swift's part, given his connection with another woman named Esther, Esther Johnson, who was known as \\"Stella.\\" Swift and Stella shared a close friendship, as well as rumors of a secret marriage, throughout their lives. Historically, the name Vanessa became relatively well-known after Swift's creation, and its usage grew more widespread over the centuries. Vanessa is now a common name in many countries and languages, taking on various forms and pronunciations. The invention of the name Vanessa by Jonathan Swift is a fascinating example of how a creative mind can leave a lasting impact on the world, even through something as seemingly simple as a name."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie title: Inkheart Movie plot: This section's plot summary may be too long or excessively detailed. Please help improve it by removing unnecessary details and making it more concise. (September 2010) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) One evening, whilst Mortimer \\"Mo\\" Folchart (Brendan Fraser) and his wife Teresa \\"Resa\\" Folchart (Sienna Guillory) are reading the fairy tale \\"Little Red Riding Hood\\" to their baby daughter Meggie, a red velvet hood appears out of nowhere. Several years later, a much older Meggie (Eliza Bennett) travels with her father Mo to visit an old book shop in Italy, unaware that he is secretly looking for a copy of the book, Inkheart. Shortly after finding one, Meggie comes across a marten with horns outside the shop, who tries to bite her fingers. Suddenly, a man (Paul Bettany) appears from the shadows, claiming to be an old friend while revealing the marten's name as Gwin. When Mo comes out of the book shop, he quickly recognizes the man as a person called Dustfinger, whom quickly asks to be read back into the book, only for Mo to flee with Meggie from him. Travelling across Italy, Mo takes Meggie on a visit to Meggie's great aunt Elinor (Helen Mirren), whereupon he reveals to Meggie why he fled from Dustfinger. While she was young, Mo read to her from Inkheart, inadvertently freeing Dustfinger as a result, due to a gift he possessed from birth, that marks him as a \\"Silver Tongue\\". Unfortunately, his gift also freed the book's villain Capricorn (Andy Serkis) and several of his henchman, but at the same time, losing Resa after being forced to flee with his infant daughter. Soon, Dustfinger reappears seeking Mo, accompanied by Capricorn's minion, Basta (Jamie Foreman), who quickly captures Mo and his family and takes back Inkheart, destroying Elinor's valuable library in the process.

Title: Disappointing Superhero As a major fan of superhero movies, I eagerly awaited the release of \\"Disappointing Superhero\\", but I must admit, this movie did not live up to the expectations set by its marketing campaign. I will lay out the reasons for my negative review step by step. 1. Poor Character Development: One of the key elements of a successful superhero movie is strong, relatable characters. Unfortunately, \\"Disappointing Superhero\\" failed in this aspect. The protagonist's backstory lacked depth, and it was hard to understand the motivations behind their actions. The supporting characters were equally disappointing, with very little effort put into making them memorable or significant to the plot. 2. Underwhelming Visual Effects: A good superhero movie needs breathtaking visual effects to keep the audience engaged. However, the CGI and special effects in \\"Disappointing Superhero\\" were subpar and detracted from the overall experience. In some scenes, the green screen was glaringly obvious, and the lack of attention to detail took me out of the immersive world the creators were trying to build. 3. Predictable Storyline: The plot of \\"Disappointing Superhero\\" was formulaic and unoriginal. From the beginning, it was easy to foresee the twists and turns the story would take. This predictability made it impossible to feel genuinely invested in the narrative. Even worse, the third act felt rushed, leaving a lot of loose ends untied and giving no satisfying conclusion to the story. 4. Lackluster Villain: The antagonist in \\"Disappointing Superhero\\" was one-dimensional and failed to pose a significant threat to the hero. They were easily defeated and even seemed to lack motivation for their evil endeavors. It's difficult for a viewer to feel the tension and fear that should come from a powerful adversary when the villain is written so weakly. 5. Subpar Acting: The performances from the lead actors felt forced and wooden, which ultimately made it difficult to identify with or care about the characters. It seemed as if the actors were more focused on delivering punchlines rather than delving into the emotional layers of their roles. In conclusion, \\"Disappointing Superhero\\" is a letdown for fans of the genre. Despite its enticing premise and potential for greatness, the movie suffers from weak character development, poor visual effects, a predictable plot, a forgettable villain, and subpar performances from the cast. I cannot, in good conscience, recommend this film to anyone in search of an engaging and immersive superhero experience."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

In the coming weeks, Congress will attempt to forge a health care bill from proposals developed by five House and Senate committees. The final bill will likely include a mandate that most Americans buy health insurance, subsidies for the purchase of insurance and bans on denial of coverage based on pre-existing conditions. The bill may also include a \\"public option,\\" government insurance that would compete with private insurance. The underlying presumption behind this legislation is that government health insurance should be expanded to cover the uninsured. This presumption is wrong. Government should not subsidize health insurance -- for the uninsured, the poor, the elderly or anyone else -- or regulate health insurance markets. Here's why. Subsidizing health insurance means that patients and doctors are insulated from the costs of health care, so they utilize too much -- often in the form of unnecessary tests or medical procedures whose value hasn't been proven. This excess demand, along with technological progress, means rapidly growing deficits, so governments limit reimbursements to health providers or ration care. This kills innovation and creates its own inequities. The taxes necessary to fund subsidies are a drag on economic growth. The reason the Obama administration and congressional Democrats are seeking to cover the uninsured is that health insurance is expensive. Without government support, many people could not afford health insurance. The conventional wisdom is that government should therefore subsidize health insurance for those who cannot afford it. This confuses two issues: whether government should help the poor, and how government should help the poor. If society wants everyone to have health insurance, the obvious approach is to give the poor enough money so that individuals can purchase on their own. Just because people want government to help the poor doesn't require it to pay for specific kinds of goods. If some people do not purchase insurance and then become ill, they would have to rely on private charity. Now one possible objection to designing anti-poverty programs in this way -- cash transfers, but no subsidies for health insurance -- is that it would require a lot of cash. That is not a convincing objection. Health insurance is just as expensive if provided as a separate benefit. The cash approach makes clear just how much money is involved, but it does not increase the amount. The other possible objection to the cash transfer approach holds that, if left unregulated, private health insurers would deny coverage based on pre-existing conditions. Thus, some people might get no health insurance at all. This outcome is unlikely, however, assuming health insurance is unregulated. In that case, insurers would set higher premiums for the unhealthy, but they would cover anyone willing to pay a sufficiently high price. Thus, the question is whether society should compensate those who face higher prices because of their health status? The answer is no. Advocates for such compensation would suggest that it is basic fairness for society to insure people against the bad luck of being born with lousy genes. Many differences in health status, however, arise from behavior: heart disease from overeating, lung cancer from smoking, and cirrhosis from drinking, to name a few. If society compensates everyone for differences in their health status, it is often rewarding unhealthy behavior, perhaps even encouraging it. In addition, it is logical for society to treat the differences in financial well-being due to health in the same way it treats differences due to IQ, athletic ability, race, country of origin, family background, and so on. These and other factors mean that some people, through no fault of their own, face hard financial circumstances, whether because of their ability to earn income or because of the higher prices they face for certain goods, such as health insurance. Yet if society tried to equalize all differences resulting from, say, IQ, it would kill the incentive to work hard and destroy the economy's productive capacity. Thus, most people believe society should reduce these differences -- by helping the poor -- but most also recognize that society should not attempt to eliminate all differences. This same tradeoff -- between helping the least fortunate and promoting an efficient economy -- applies in the case of health insurance. A reasonable balance is for government to provide a social safety net that protects the poor and allows them to purchase some health insurance on their own. An alternative is to provide health insurance vouchers, but only to the poorest segment of society. Guaranteeing health insurance for everyone is too costly, and it means worse health care for everyone. That is why Obamacare, and existing subsidies for health insurance, are treatments that are worse than the disease. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jeffrey Miron. What are highlight points for this article?","completion":"1. The underlying presumption behind the proposed health care bill is that government health insurance should be expanded to cover the uninsured, which the author argues is wrong. 2. Subsidizing health insurance can lead to overutilization of medical services, increasing deficits and hindering innovation while also creating inequities. 3. The author suggests that instead of subsidizing health insurance, the government should provide cash transfers to the poor, allowing them to purchase insurance themselves. 4. Unregulated private health insurers are more likely to cover individuals with pre-existing conditions at higher premiums, as opposed to denying coverage altogether. 5. Equalizing all financial differences due to factors like health status, IQ, or background would destroy economic incentives and productivity. Instead, the author proposes providing a basic social safety net or health insurance vouchers for the poorest segment of society."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Help as much as you can. Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Todd McHugh doesn't think he is a hero, but police say the California teenager probably saved a mother and her two young children from serious injury or death last month. He pulled them out of their car, stuck on light-rail tracks in Folsom, California, about 90 seconds before a train smashed into it. McHugh, 17, was northbound on his way to meet friends when the silver car in front of him turned off the road, went into a ditch and jolted to a stop on the tracks. McHugh jumped out of his vehicle and went to help. The driver, a woman who police say had fallen asleep, was behind the wheel and dazed. Her two daughters aged 7 and 10, were in the back seat, buckled in. McHugh took the woman's hand and helped her from the car. She unbuckled the kids. Another driver who had pulled over to help shouted that a train was coming, McHugh recalled. Police said the other man ran along the tracks and tried to wave down the train. It was dark and there was a bend in the tracks. The train operator probably never saw him. McHugh said the driver applied the brakes, but the train was still going fast when it came up on them. The woman, her daughters and McHugh took shelter behind his truck as the train smashed into their car, dragging it down the tracks, the teenager said. The woman's car was destroyed. Officials said the train was damaged. But none of the crew and four passengers were injured. Police said the outcome could have been far worse: \\"Had she sat there for another minute or two, she and her daughters could have been in that vehicle when the train struck it, and they could have been severely injured or killed.\\" McHugh said he \\"didn't do anything anyone else wouldn't have done.\\" Question: What can we infer from the passage?

His father was a painter and art teacher who gave his son the first lesson in drawing. He won a prize-- \\"Science and Charity\\" for his first important painting when he was only fifteen. He studied in several cities in Spain. But there was no one to teach him all that he wanted to know. When he was nineteen, he visited Paris. Paris was then the center of the world for artists. Everything that was new and exciting in the world of paintings seemed to happen there. When he was twenty-three, Picasso moved there to live and lived in France for the rest of his life. When he was over ninety, this great painter still lived his life like a young man. He was still looking for new ideas and new ways to use his artistic materials.

Question: How may I be feeling right now ?","completion":"Based on the information provided, it seems like you might be experiencing a combination of emotions. First of all, your use of the phrase \\"don't let the bad things get to me\\" implies that you might be feeling stressed or challenged by certain negative aspects in your life. This could be anything from personal issues to work/school-related stresses. Working hard at school amplifies this inference because it suggests you are under academic pressure. This could be making you feel hard-pressed, anxious, or possibly overwhelmed. Furthermore, your comment about \\"ups and downs, old moods and new humbling heights\\" suggest a fluctuation in your emotional state. It indicates you might have been experiencing feelings of melancholy or nostalgia, possibly linked to the 'old moods.' At the same time, 'new humbling heights' might suggest moments of accomplishment, joy, or optimism. Encountering 'new heights' means you are achieving or experiencing new things which may inspire pride or self-fulfillment, but the fact that these are 'humbling' suggests that they also create a feeling of gratitude or perspective. Your reference to keeping 'things light and easy. like Mexico' indicates a desire for relaxation or a need to escape from stress, likely caused by your academic commitments or other burdens. You seem to associate Mexico with positive emotions, possibly because of its reputation for sunny weather, relaxing beaches, or perhaps personal positive experiences/memory associated with it. In summary, you are seemingly going through an emotional roller coaster ride right now, experiencing stress possibly from academic requirements, a certain degree of nostalgia or melancholy linked to 'old moods,' and momentary pleasures and optimism symbolised by 'new humbling heights.' You also appear to seek relaxation or lightness, as indicated by your comment about Mexico. It’s essential to remember that it's normal for emotions to fluctuate, especially during challenging times. Using relaxation techniques, seeking support from friends or family, and taking time for self-care can all help manage these emotions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Olympic sports Olympic sports are sports contested in the Summer and Winter Olympic Games. The 2016 Summer Olympics included 28 sports, with five additional sports due to be added to the 2020 Summer Olympics. The 2014 Winter Olympics included seven sports. The number and kinds of events may change slightly from one Olympiad to another. Each Olympic sport is represented by an international governing body, namely an International Federation (IF). The International Olympic Committee (IOC) establishes a hierarchy of sports, disciplines, and events. According to this hierarchy, the Olympic sports can be subdivided into multiple disciplines, which are often assumed to be distinct sports. Examples include swimming and water polo (disciplines of aquatics, represented by the International Swimming Federation), or figure skating and speed skating (disciplines of skating, represented by the International Skating Union). In their turn, disciplines can be subdivided into events, for which medals are actually awarded. A sport or discipline is included in the Olympic program if the IOC determines it is widely practiced around the world, that is, the number of countries that compete in a given sport is the indicator of the sport's prevalence. The IOC's requirements reflect participation in the Olympic Games as well--more stringent toward men (as they are represented in higher numbers) and summer sports (as more nations compete in the Summer Olympics).

Compared to conventional milk production, organic milk production tends to have lower eutrophication potential per ton of milk or per hectare of farmland, because it potentially reduces leaching of nitrates (NO3−) and phosphates (PO4−) due to lower fertilizer application rates. Because organic milk production reduces pesticides utilization, it increases land use per ton of milk due to decreased crop yields per hectare. Mainly due to the lower level of concentrates given to cows in organic herds, organic dairy farms generally produce less milk per cow than conventional dairy farms.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What two compositions did Holst write in 1906? ? Holst's settings of Indian texts formed only a part of his compositional output in the period 1900 to 1914. A highly significant factor in his musical development was the English folksong revival, evident in the orchestral suite A Somerset Rhapsody (1906–07), a work that was originally to be based around eleven folksong themes; this was later reduced to four. Observing the work's kinship with Vaughan Williams's Norfolk Rhapsody, Dickinson remarks that, with its firm overall structure, Holst's composition \\"rises beyond the level of ... a song-selection\\". Imogen acknowledges that Holst's discovery of English folksongs \\"transformed his orchestral writing\\", and that the composition of A Somerset Rhapsody did much to banish the chromaticisms that had dominated his early compositions. In the Two Songs without Words of 1906, Holst showed that he could create his own original music using the folk idiom. An orchestral folksong fantasy Songs of the West, also written in 1906, was withdrawn by the composer and never published, although it emerged in the 1980s in the form of an arrangement for wind band by James Curnow. In the years before the First World War, Holst composed in a variety of genres. Matthews considers the evocation of a North African town in the Beni Mora suite of 1908 the composer's most individual work to that date; the third movement gives a preview of minimalism in its constant repetition of a four-bar theme. Holst wrote two suites for military band, in E flat (1909) and F major (1911) respectively, the first of which became and remains a brass-band staple. This piece, a highly original and substantial musical work, was a signal departure from what Short describes as \\"the usual transcriptions and operatic selections which pervaded the band repertoire\\". Also in 1911 he wrote Hecuba's Lament, a setting of Gilbert Murray's translation from Euripides built on a seven-beat refrain designed, says Dickinson, to represent Hecuba's defiance of divine wrath. In 1912 Holst composed two psalm settings, in which... Answer:","completion":"In 1906, Holst wrote two compositions: A Somerset Rhapsody and Two Songs Without Words."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

This earthquake ruptured at least two imbricate structures in Longmen Shan Fault System, i.e. the Beichuan Fault and the Guanxian–Anxian Fault. In the epicentral area, the average slip in Beichuan Fault was about 3.5 metres (11 ft) vertical, 3.5 metres (11 ft) horizontal-parallel to the fault, and 4.8 metres (16 ft) horizontal-perpendicular to the fault. In the area about 30 kilometres (19 mi) northeast of the epicenter, the surface slip on Beichuan Fault was almost purely dextral strike-slip up to about 3 metres (9.8 ft), while the average slip in Guanxian–Anxian Fault was about 2 metres (6 ft 7 in) vertical and 2.3 metres (7 ft 7 in) horizontal. Try to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply \\"unanswerable\\"): What was the horizontal slippage in the Beichuan Fault at the epicenter?","completion":"The horizontal slippage in the Beichuan Fault at the epicenter can be calculated by considering both components of the horizontal slip: parallel and perpendicular to the fault. As mentioned, the horizontal-parallel slip was 3.5 meters (11 ft), and the horizontal-perpendicular slip was 4.8 meters (16 ft). To find the total horizontal slip, we can use the Pythagorean theorem: Total horizontal slip = √(horizontal-parallel slip² + horizontal-perpendicular slip²) Total horizontal slip = √(3.5² + 4.8²) Total horizontal slip = √(12.25 + 23.04) Total horizontal slip = √(35.29) Total horizontal slip ≈ 5.94 meters. So, the total horizontal slippage in the Beichuan Fault at the epicenter was approximately 5.94 meters (19.5 ft)."},{"prompt":"Given the question: I can use this background: Many people enjoy riding in hot air balloons.

The statement mainly provides information about Yugoslavia's action towards foreign visitors and visa requirements during that time. To answer the original question, we need to delve into the historical background of Josip Broz Tito's involvement in Arab-Israeli peace processes. Tito, a prominent political leader and the leader of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, actively participated in the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), an international organization that was neither aligned with or against any major power bloc and aimed to ensure national independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity of non-aligned member countries. The primary goal of NAM was to promote peace, cooperation, and global development. Tito's engagement in Arab-Israeli peace processes was inherently connected to his role as one of the NAM leaders. Although there is no precise date or year when Tito first started working on the Arab-Israeli peace process, the search for peace and justice in the Middle East became one of NAM's priorities during the 1960s, and materials point to the active role Yugoslavia played in that decade. Tito managed to maintain good relations with both Arab countries and Israel throughout the 1950s, and his policy of non-alignment allowed him the opportunity to mediate the Arab-Israeli conflict to some extent. During the 1960s, Tito's efforts to mediate the conflict were hampered by the ongoing tensions and wars in the region, but he still managed to maintain diplomatic relations with both sides. More specifically, in 1967, Tito was one of the main driving forces behind the NAM's decision to convene an emergency conference of NAM Foreign Ministers in Belgrade concerning the Arab-Israeli war. Tito's efforts to bring together the foreign ministers of NAM countries to support peace and condemn Israel's aggression marked a significant moment in his involvement in Arab-Israeli peace processes. In summary, although there is no specific year when Tito began working on Arab-Israeli peace processes, his involvement and efforts to promote peace and justice in the Middle East through Non-Aligned Movement became more visible during the 1960s. The statement about Yugoslavia opening its borders to foreign visitors in 1967 does not address Tito's work in Arab-Israeli peace processes directly and does not provide a correct answer to the question."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Ask a trusted friend, family member, or neighbor to keep an eye out on your home while you’re away. It is absolutely essential that you trust this person and know that they will follow through with checking in. A next door neighbor is a convenient person to monitor your home since they are the most likely person to notice any unusual situations. Do not sacrifice convenience for trust. If you do not feel completely comfortable asking your next door neighbor to check on your home, ask a close friend or family member. Remember to return the favor and offer to do the same for them when they are on vacation. Overgrown lawns or driveways full of snow are surefire giveaways that the homeowner isn’t at home. Be mindful of your friend’s time and offer compensation for these chores. For example, if the neighbor that you’ve asked to keep an eye on things has a teenage son or daughter, offer to pay their child to complete these tasks. Always return the favor and offer to do the same when they go away on vacation. Interior lights signal that someone is at home but leaving your lights on all the time while you are away is not cost effective. A programmable light switch will turn on select lights at a certain time and then turn them off. This saves money, is energy efficient, and is a useful deterrent. An intruder who is watching your home closely may notice that the lights go on and off at certain times every day. Set a schedule for your timers that varies day by day. Never post on social media that you are leaving for a vacation. Avoid posting pictures from your vacation while you are still away, checking in at the airport or your vacation destination, or updating your friends about your vacation. Internet safety is extremely important. Many burglars learn about their potential victims through social media when they post that they will be away, how long they’ll be away, and where they’re going. Notify the post office that you will be away so they do not leave mail and packages at your door. You can also ask your neighbor to collect your mail for you if you prefer not to stop your mail altogether. Avoid scheduling deliveries, like those for online shopping, for times when you are away. Packages that are left outside your front door are easily stolen and alert others that you are out of town. This applies to your curtains, your blinds, or shutters that cover your windows. If you typically leave your blinds open during the day, consider leaving them open when you are away. Noticeable changes can alert others that you aren’t home, like if your curtains are pulled shut for two weeks straight when they are normally open. Summary:","completion":"The article discusses the importance of having a trusted friend, family member, or neighbor monitor your home while you're away, maintaining the appearance of being at home, using programmable light switches, practicing internet safety by not sharing vacation details on social media, managing mail and deliveries, and keeping consistent window coverings to prevent burglars from targeting your home during your absence."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Let me explain it in a simple way like I am talking to a five-year-old: 1. First, you need some mud, which is like thick, creamy stuff that helps stick things together. You'll also need tape, which is like a special kind of paper that helps cover the seams. 2. Start by applying the mud around the edges of the hole with a special tool called a \\"putty knife.\\" It's like a little spatula you use to spread the mud smoothly. 3. Then, you put the tape over the mud, making sure it covers the entire seam where the new piece of drywall meets the old one. This tape will help keep everything together and hide the seam. 4. Now you need to add more mud over the tape. This time, use a bigger putty knife to spread the mud so it covers a larger area and blends in with the rest of the wall. Be sure to keep it smooth! 5. Let the mud dry for some time. It might take a day to dry completely. Once it's dry, you might need to add more mud and make it smoother. 6. When the mud is completely dry, you can use a special paper called \\"sanding paper\\" to make it all nice and smooth. Then, you can paint it, and you won't even be able to see where the hole was!

Options: - dribbling - full of air - bouncing around court - punctured - round Explain why a human would choose \\"round\\" to answer the question above: A:","completion":"A human is likely to choose \\"round\\" as the answer to the question because it is the only option that accurately reflects the nature of the ball and rim involved in the process of rebounding in basketball. In this context, \\"round\\" pertains to their physical shape, which plays a significant role in making the prediction of a rebound difficult. Let's examine each option to get a better understanding of why \\"round\\" would be the most suitable answer: - Dribbling: Dribbling is an action performed by the players to move the ball across the court while complying with the rules of the game. It is not the inherent nature of the ball or rim and does not relate directly to predicting a rebound. - Full of air: Although a basketball does contain air to maintain its bounce and functionality, this characteristic is not directly responsible for the unpredictability of rebounds. Both the ball and rim need to be considered, and this option only pertains to the ball. - Bouncing around the court: This phrase might describe the general behavior of the basketball during gameplay, but again, it does not specifically address the ball and rim's characteristics that make rebounds hard to predict. - Punctured: A punctured ball would not even be suitable for playing. Moreover, it does not provide any information about the rim's features. This option is not relevant to the question. - Round: A round ball and rim are intrinsic attributes that contribute to the difficulty of predicting rebounds in basketball. The round nature of these components creates various angles that the ball may contact the rim, resulting in an unpredictable path or trajectory. Additionally, the ball's surface and elasticity may cause it to bounce in different directions when striking different parts of the rim. These variabilities make it challenging for players to anticipate a rebound accurately. In conclusion, a human would choose \\"round\\" as the answer to the question because it is the only option that addresses the physical characteristics of both the ball and the rim, which are the critical factors contributing to the difficulty of predicting rebounds in basketball. The round shape and resulting interactions between the ball and the rim lead to the unpredictable nature of rebounds, setting this option apart from the others."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Spitzer call girl: ADA was my pimp After hooking for the city’s two most famous madams, turncoat call girl Rebecca Woodard says she suddenly found herself with a new pimp — the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office. The pricey prostitute claims in her new tell-all tome that prosecutors forced her to continue to turn tricks after she agreed to wear a wire to help snare “Hockey Mom Madam” Anna Gristina in 2008. “They wanted me to keep breaking the law so they could get more information,” writes Woodard, 37, who also detailed her rough sex-for-hire with disgraced ex-Gov. Eliot Spitzer. “They encouraged me to keep working for Anna as a call girl,” she writes of her covert gig. “It was like sex slavery at the behest of the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office. “The ADA told me to work in order to garner information for him and then turn over to his office the money and any gifts that clients gave me. I actually did this,” she writes. “Technically, this ADA was my pimp.” The Post first revealed steamy details of Woodard’s book, “Call Girl Confidential,’’ written as Rebecca Kade, including claims she serviced a violent Spitzer, who grabbed her by the throat and choked her. While servicing Spitzer, Woodard was working for madam Kristin Davis. The DA’s office approached Woodard to go undercover after Davis was busted in 2008 and Woodard had already begun working for Gristina, who had sexy glamour shots taken of her and other girls to entice high-rolling johns. Woodard does not name the ADA, who was working under former DA Robert Morgenthau when the secret probe was launched, but gave several clues to his identity. Sources with knowledge of the investigation confirmed to The Post that she is referring to former ADA Mark Crooks, who worked the Official Corruption Unit under Morgenthau and his successor, Cy Vance, until taking a job as an assistant federal prosecutor in Maryland. “I highly doubt District Attorney Morgenthau was aware of the ADA’s shenanigans,” Woodard writes. “God knows if somebody pocketed the money [earned through the prostitution]. [And] this cowboy still has a job in law enforcement, in another state, at an even higher level” as “an assistant US attorney.” A spokesman for the Manhattan DA’s office declined comment. Crooks did not return messages left at his Maryland home. Woodard’s book paints her DA handlers as bumbling fools when it came to surveillance. At one point, Woodard was being prepped to record Gristina’s “money man,” accountant Jonas Gayer, during a meeting at his East Side apartment, and prosecutors wanted to run the wire around her waist and up her chest. “ ‘Are you kidding me?’ I nearly screamed,” Woodward writes. “ ‘It’s not going to work to wire my body, because the very first thing he’s going to do is feel me up.’ ” Prosecutors wound up buying her a 1,000 Chanel bag to hide the wiretap transmitter. Woodard — who claims she was raking in as much as 24,000 for some jobs — says she didn’t tell prosecutors about all her gigs. “Obviously, if I did this with every client I saw, I would have been broke, so I didn’t tell him about everybody,” she writes. After one particularly close call while wearing a wire to record Gristina and suspecting the madam was on to her, Woodward writes that she wanted out. “The ADA stared at me, and his face was turning red,” Woodard recounts. “He stormed out of the room . . . I never heard from him again.” Woodward finally landed a public defender, former prosecutor Seema Iyer, who was “flabbergasted” to hear how the ADA acted, Woodard claims. “[Iyer] made big trouble and said I could bring a lawsuit against the city,’’ she writes. But all of Woodard’s undercover work was for naught, she says. After the ADA left the office and another took over the case, “The new ADA said that all the work I did under the first ADA was thrown out because it would be inadmissable in court.” She writes that she was asked again to wear a wire, with prosecutors saying they’d arrest her for prostitution if she didn’t. “It was blackmail,” she writes. “I felt like he was trying to intimidate me into going back to work for them under these threats.’’ In 2011, she agreed to meet with another ADA, Gristina prosecutor Charlie Linehan, just “to talk,’’ she says. Linehan asked Woodard to wear a wire to help snare a rich financier who “had once asked me to procure a young boy for him,” Woodard writes. The man was “high-profile on Wall Street, in Davos, on Paternoster Square [and] had an image to protect in Manhattan and the Hamptons.’’ Linehan pressed her to threaten him that she’d “go to the media with the story that he got a b—job from an 11-year-old kid.” Woodard ambushed the man in his workplace lobby — but couldn’t get him to say anything damning.

In the context of terms of endearment, both \\"baby\\" and \\"honey\\" are often used to express affection or love towards a romantic partner or a very close friend or family member. These terms are usually used informally in conversation and are meant to convey warmth and closeness. Question 2: I want to study for about 8 to 10 hours, but my mind tells me to play. What to do, and it's my class 10th ICSE board examination? Balancing study and play during the exam preparation period is important for maintaining your mental well-being and academic success. Here are some tips to help you manage your time and focus effectively: 1. Create a study schedule: Set specific study hours each day and allocate time for each subject. Break down the time into smaller study intervals (e.g., 1-hour slots) and assign achievable goals for each interval. Include breaks and recreational activities in your schedule to avoid burnout. 2. Prioritize subjects: Identify areas or subjects where you need extra focus and allocate more time to cover those topics. Start with difficult topics and progress to easier ones to gain momentum and confidence. 3. Use a timer: Use a timer to help you stay on track with your study intervals. When the timer goes off, switch to a short break or a brief period of play, exercise, or relaxation. This will help refresh and reset your mind for the next study session. 4. Minimize distractions: Turn off or silence electronic devices that might distract you. Find a quiet and comfortable study space, and let your friends and family know when you are studying so they can help you stay focused. 5. Set playtime limits: Enjoy recreational activities in moderation by setting time limits. Engaging in physical or creative activities can actually help relieve stress and improve your cognitive abilities, but remember to stick to your planned schedule. 6. Stay organized: Keep your study materials and notes organized to facilitate effective learning. Maintain a daily or weekly to-do list to help you keep track of your progress. 7. Take care of yourself: Prioritize your physical and mental well-being by getting enough sleep, eating nutritious meals, and engaging in physical activity regularly. 8. Seek support: Reach out to classmates, teachers, or tutors for study assistance or encouragement when needed. This will help expand your knowledge and improve your learning experience. By incorporating these tips, you can strike a balance between study and play while ensuring that you give your best effort to your class 10th ICSE board examination."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: The Slashdot effect, also known as slashdotting, occurs when a popular website links to a smaller website, causing a massive increase in traffic, the effect has been associated with other websites or metablogs such as Fark, a community website created by who, that allows members to comment on a daily batch of news articles, and other items from various website? Answer:","completion":"The Slashdot Effect, often referred to as \\"slashdotting,\\" is a phenomenon that occurs when a highly popular website, such as Slashdot, links to a smaller or less-known website. This action results in a sudden and massive increase in traffic to the smaller website. The subsequent surge in visitors can cause the site to become slow, unresponsive, or even crash due to the unforeseen load on its servers. The term \\"Slashdot Effect\\" was coined after Slashdot, a technology-driven news website that gained prominence in the late 90s, and early 2000s for featuring and discussing various topics related to science, technology, and programming. Although the term is linked to Slashdot, similar effects have been observed with traffic surges resulting from links on other popular websites or metablogs. One such website is Fark, a community-driven news aggregator that focuses on offering its members a daily collection of news articles, current events, and other interesting content from various websites across the internet. Fark was created by Drew Curtis in 1999. This online platform curates the news submitted by its users and then allows the community to engage in discussions, share thoughts, and post comments on the featured content. Fark has a dedicated user base, with many members visiting the site on a daily basis to keep up to date with the latest happenings and join in on the active conversations. Fark's popularity has made it a prime candidate for causing traffic surges to smaller websites when it links to them. When this happens, the website receiving the surge in traffic may experience the same consequences observed in the Slashdot Effect, such as slow loading times or potential server crashes. In conclusion, the Slashdot Effect, or \\"slashdotting,\\" is a phenomenon where a smaller website experiences a significant increase in traffic after being linked by a popular site like Slashdot or Fark. Fark, a community-driven news aggregator that allows members to discuss various news articles and other items of interest, was created by Drew Curtis in 1999. Similar to Slashdot, Fark's popularity can lead to a significant effect on smaller websites when they are linked, causing challenges for those sites in handling the unexpected influx of visitors."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

What is the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who died in Toledo, Spain? from the following article ? Doménikos Theotokópoulos (Greek: Δομήνικος Θεοτοκόπουλος [ðoˈminikos θeotoˈkopulos]; October 1541 – 7 April 1614), most widely known as El Greco (\\"The Greek\\"), was a Greek painter, sculptor and architect of the Spanish Renaissance. \\"El Greco\\" was a nickname, a reference to his Greek origin, and the artist normally signed his paintings with his full birth name in Greek letters, Δομήνικος Θεοτοκόπουλος, Doménikos Theotokópoulos, often adding the word Κρής Krēs, Cretan. El Greco was born in the Kingdom of Candia, which was at that time part of the Republic of Venice, and the center of Post-Byzantine art. He trained and became a master within that tradition before traveling at age 26 to Venice, as other Greek artists had done. In 1570 he moved to Rome, where he opened a workshop and executed a series of works. During his stay in Italy, El Greco enriched his style with elements of Mannerism and of the Venetian Renaissance taken from a number of great artists of the time, notably Tintoretto. In 1577, he moved to Toledo, Spain, where he lived and worked until his death. In Toledo, El Greco received several major commissions and produced his best-known paintings. El Greco's dramatic and expressionistic style was met with puzzlement by his contemporaries but found appreciation in the 20th century. El Greco is regarded as a precursor of both Expressionism and Cubism, while his personality and works were a source of inspiration for poets and writers such as Rainer Maria Rilke and Nikos Kazantzakis. El Greco has been characterized by modern scholars as an artist so individual that he belongs to no conventional school. He is best known for tortuously elongated figures and often fantastic or phantasmagorical pigmentation, marrying Byzantine traditions with those of Western painting.

What might be the first step of the process?","completion":"The first step of the virus infection process is the entry of the virus into the human or animal body. This usually occurs through one of the following routes: 1. Respiratory transmission: In this mode of transmission, the virus is present in tiny droplets expelled when an infected person talks, coughs, or sneezes. These droplets can be inhaled by another person, allowing the virus to enter the respiratory system. For example, the influenza virus and the SARS-CoV-2 virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic primarily spread through respiratory transmission. 2. Direct contact: Viruses can also be transmitted through direct skin-to-skin contact with an infected individual. For example, viruses causing skin infections like herpes simplex virus can transmit via direct contact. 3. Indirect contact: In this case, viruses are present on contaminated surfaces or objects (called fomites), which can be touched by another person. This contaminated surface can later come into contact with a person's eyes, mouth, or nose, and thereby facilitate viral entry. 4. Vector-borne transmission: In some cases, viruses are transmitted to humans or animals by a vector, which is typically a blood-sucking insect, such as a mosquito. For example, the Zika virus and dengue virus are transmitted by the Aedes mosquito vector. 5. Fecal-oral transmission: Some viruses can survive in an infected person's feces and contaminate food or water supplies. If another person ingests the contaminated substance, the virus can enter their body via the digestive system. Examples include norovirus, which causes gastroenteritis, and hepatitis A virus, which can cause liver disease. 6. Bloodborne transmission: Viruses can also enter the body through contact with infected blood, semen, vaginal fluids, or other bodily fluids. This can happen through shared needles, during medical procedures, or sexual contact. Examples include HIV and hepatitis B and C viruses. Once the virus gains entry into the body through any of these transmission routes, it begins the infection process by targeting the specific cells or tissues it is equipped to infect. For instance, respiratory viruses attach to cells lining the respiratory tract, while gastrointestinal viruses infect the cells of the digestive tract. The virus then binds to specific receptors on the cell's surface, using viral surface proteins like spikes or glycoproteins, which allow it to gain entry by fusing with the cell membrane or by being engulfed by the cell. After entering a cell, the virus hijacks the host cell's machinery to replicate its genetic material, produce viral proteins, and assemble new virus particles. Once a sufficient number of virus particles have been produced, they are either released back into the surrounding environment, where they can infect nearby cells or tissues, or enter the bloodstream or lymphatic system to distribute throughout the body and reach other target organs. As the viral infection progresses and spreads, the host's immune system responds by activating various defense mechanisms, including the production of antibodies and the recruitment of immune cells to the site of infection. These immune responses help to eliminate the virus, although they can also contribute to the symptoms and tissue damage associated with viral illnesses. In some cases, the immune response fails to control the infection, resulting in severe or even fatal outcomes. However, in many cases, the immune system successfully clears the virus from the body, leading to recovery and the establishment of immunity to future infections."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Choices: - the debris bowl - the flow bowl - the land bowl - the dust bowl A: The answer is:","completion":"The Dust Bowl The Dust Bowl was a severe environmental and agricultural disaster that took place during the 1930s in the central United States, specifically the Great Plains region. This devastating event taught people that soil could be lost through plowing and growing crops, which led to widespread soil erosion. As a consequence, new methods and practices were developed and encouraged to prevent further soil erosion and land degradation in the future. The Dust Bowl was caused by a combination of factors, including drought, inappropriate farming practices (such as deep plowing), and economic depression. The severe drought during the 1930s led to a lack of moisture in the soil, making it much more susceptible to wind erosion. Additionally, deep plowing of the native grasses, which helped to hold the soil together, left the topsoil exposed and vulnerable to being blown away by strong winds. As massive dust storms began to roll across the Great Plains, millions of tons of precious topsoil were lost, leading to severe agricultural, economic, and environmental consequences. Crop yields plummeted, and many farmers were forced to abandon their lands and migrate in search of better opportunities. This mass exodus of families during the Dust Bowl era, famously depicted in John Steinbeck's novel \\"The Grapes of Wrath,\\" deeply affected rural communities throughout the affected region. The Dust Bowl prompted the U.S. government and agronomists to take action in the hopes of preventing such a catastrophe from happening again. New farming practices and methods were developed and promoted to help prevent soil erosion and conserve the land. These included contour plowing, crop rotation, planting cover crops, and using windbreaks (rows of trees) to reduce wind speeds and protect the soil. The establishment of the Soil Conservation Service (now known as the Natural Resources Conservation Service) in 1935 was a direct response to the Dust Bowl, and this agency continues to work today to help farmers and landowners implement sustainable land management practices."},{"prompt":"Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: In a very strange experiment by Andy Warhol, Empire is literally one continuous shot of New York's Empire State Building for eight hours and five minutes.

Article: Truman Capote's cremated remains invited to attend 'Breakfast at Tiffany's' Broadway premier Producers wanted to fly the ashes in from Los Angeles to attend the March 20 opening party Joanna Carson, former wife of comedian Johnny Carson, still keeps the remains in the Bel Air bedroom where the writer died in 1984 Broadway producers who want big stars at their premier usually want ones with a pulse. But the folks who put Truman Capote’s Breakfast at Tiffany’s on Broadway wanted the late author cremated remains at the play premier’s after party, since Capote himself couldn't make it. They even went so far as to offer the ashes—and their owner—a flight from Los Angeles to New York for the show. Odd guest: In honor of the late writer, producers of Broadway's 'Breakfast at Tiffany's' tried to fly Truman Capote's ashes in for their New York premier A source of the New York Post confirmed the bizarre offer. ‘We did try to get him here,’ the source said. ‘We thought it would have been poignant for the entire company.’ Former wife of Johnny Carson, Joanne Carson, keeps the In Cold Blood author’s remains in the Bel Air bedroom where he died in 1984. The two were close friends up until his death and Carson has seen the ashes argued over, stolen, returned, and nearly stolen again over the years. Old friends: Joanne Carson (here with then husband Johnny in 1969) possesses Capote's remains in her Bel Air home The ashes were famously boosted during Carson’s 1988 Halloween party, along with 200,000 worth of jewelry. However, they were mysteriously returned shortly thereafter. That’s when Capote’s longtime partner questioned whether the ashes were those of his dead lover at all. Someone again attempted to steal the remains at a showing put on by Carson of the play Tru, which is adapted from Capote’s works. Broadway turn: The beloved book was first a film starring Audrey Hepburn (right) as Holly Golightly and saw its big stage debut March 20 with actress Emilia Clarke (left) in the role It was the history of theft that doomed Capote's post-mortem trip to the theater, or so says the Post's source. ' Ultimately, the risk of theft was just too high.' In spite of the drama surrounding them, Carson has referred to her cremated friend’s remain as ‘her sanity’ over the years. And Carson claims Capote always wanted to see ‘Holly Golightly open on Broadway.’ ||||| Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) For the “Breakfast at Tiffany’s” opening on Broadway this week, the production tried to bring in one secret surprise guest: the ashes of late author Truman Capote. Reps for the show — starring “Game of Thrones” star Emilia Clarke, and based on Capote’s 1958 novella — even offered complimentary first-class round-trip airfare for the ashes and their owner, Johnny Carson’s ex Joanne Carson, to travel from Bel Air to New York and appear at an Edison Ballroom after-party. But given people’s past predilection for trying to steal Capote’s remains, it was too risky. “[Joanne] Carson was Capote’s closest confidante in his later years,” said a source, “and she keeps a portion of his cremated remains in an urn in her Bel Air home, in the room in which he died in 1984.” The ashes were infamously stolen from Carson’s house during a 1988 Halloween party — along with 200,000 in jewels — and then the remains were just as mysteriously returned in the middle of the night. Meanwhile, Capote’s late, longtime lover Jack Dunphy openly disputed whether the ashes Carson kept were even Capote’s at all. Adding to the intrigue, the same ashes were the target of another thief years later, when Carson brought them to a bash she hosted for a play about Capote, “Tru.” That culprit, says a source, was caught “before he could make it out the door” with a piece of the acclaimed novelist. “We did try to get him here,” confirmed a “Breakfast” rep of Capote’s ashes. “Joanne says he always wanted to [see] Holly Golightly open on Broadway, and we thought it would have been poignant for the entire company. I think ultimately the risk of theft was just too high, but he was certainly there in spirit.” Joanne has said of Capote, “His ashes were my sanity for . . . years. Truman often referred to me as his very own Holly Golightly come to life. He always told me you could be anything you wanted but, whatever happens, never be boring.” The star-studded black-and-white-themed after-party for “Breakfast” was hosted by Debbie Harry and Interview magazine. ||||| What is a summary?","completion":"Broadway producers wanted Truman Capote's cremated remains to attend the premier of \\"Breakfast at Tiffany's,\\" offering a flight from Los Angeles to New York for the ashes and their owner, Joanne Carson.

Please answer the following question: According to the US Geological Survey, about seven million earthquakes strike worldwide every year--but fortunately, only about 1500 of these are of a magnitude of 5 or greater on the Richter scale. Certain areas, such as California and Japan, are more _ earthquakes than others. Although the chance of being caught in \\"The Big one\\" is remote, it's wise to be prepared if you live in a region where earthquakes are common. Educate your family about earthquakes before a big one strikes. For example, they need to know to take shelter in a doorway or under a strong object if indoors, and never to run outdoors if they are inside. If outside, they need to know to stay away from power lines and buildings where objects could fall. Teach family members how to turn off gas or water lines or electrical power that may need to be shut off after a quake if severe damage occurs. Develop a plan. Where will your family meet in the event of a disaster? What if some people are at work or school? How will you know if they are safe? Where will you all meet up? Pack a preparedness kit and keep it in a safe location. In a major earthquake, it's possible that you won't be able to get into your house. Keep supplies in your car trunk or an outside storage shed if possible. Pack whatever your family is likely to need, enough for three days to a week, including food, water, medication, first aid and personal hygiene supplies, flashlights, a portable radio, blankets, clothes and shoes, cash, or camp stove, candles, matches or lighters, and a whistle.

Hip abductor machines provide resistance as you work muscles pivotal to healthy hips. Sit so that your feet are on the foot rests and knee pads are outside of your legs. Use your strength to push the pads from a closed to an open position, away from your body. Bring the weight slowly back to a stop. Do this in sets of ten at a manageable weight. Be sure to emphasize good form. Weights too high or too many reps can lead to injury. Gyms may have machines that slightly vary. If you have any questions about how to use a hip abductor machine, ask a gym employee for help. Jogging is great for overall health but can cause wear and tear to your joints, especially knees, hips, and ankles. Use cardio machines at the gym to get the same benefits of cardio, without all the problems. Use an elliptical machine. This is a low impact exercise that will increase the range of motion in your hips. Simply follow the instructions and start striding at a comfortable resistance level. This will promote the same range of motion as jogging without the impact of hitting the ground. Stationary bikes are among the best exercise options for hip problems. They're great for increasing your range of motion, keeping joints mobile, and building up strength as you progress to longer, more difficult workouts. Tread climbers work much like walking. You will have to stretch your hips to maintain a natural walking stride. Similarly, a stair climber will stretch and strengthen your hips muscles. The incline of the stair climber will force you to stretch and stabilize your muscles. Both of these should be done with caution and after consultation with your doctor or physical therapist. Cardio and machines are great but there are few strength training equivalents to free weights. Weight training can be a little more difficult than other strengthening exercises, but if done properly and safely yields great results. Use bench step up exercises to build strength. Find a dumbbell weight that you are comfortable with. Hold a dumbbell in each hand down to your side. Stand in front of a bench lengthwise. Step up with your right foot, holding your left leg to the side. Hold for three seconds then repeat with the other foot. Bent knee deadlifts get the benefits of the Olympic dead lift without the same strain. Again, find a light dumbbell and hold one in each hand. Stand with your feet shoulder length apart, holding each dumbbell with your palms facing in. Keeping your head up, shoulders back and knees slightly bent, bend forward slightly, lowering the dumbbells along your legs. Keep your body weight above your heels and slowly return to a starting position. Use dumbbell lunges to stretch your hips. Keep a dumbbell in each hand and stand upright. Step forward with your right foot, keeping your left leg stationary behind. Lower your upper body down while maintaining your balance. Using the heel of your forward foot, return to your starting position.

Larisa Grollemond is conducting a comparative study of illuminations in the Mirror of History (Speculum historiale, Miroir historial) as a graduate intern in the Manuscripts Department of the Getty Museum. The massive text, compiled in the 1200s by friar Vincent of Beauvais and translated into French in the 14th century by Jean de Vignay, attempts to compile all of world history from creation to the present into a single source. “If our twenty-first-century way of understanding everything is to put it on the Internet,” she says, “the medieval way of understanding was to create big encyclopedic texts that try to encompass all of human history and biblical history in an organized way.” Larisa, who recently completed her PhD at the University of Pennsylvania with a focus on 15th-century French manuscript culture, is focusing on the Getty volumes’ unique program of illuminations. The French translation of the Miroir historial exists in some 40 known copies, and while the text remains mostly unchanged from copy to copy, the illuminations vary dramatically, both in how scenes are depicted and in which episodes artists choose to depict. Larisa has decided to focus on the evolution of depictions of India and its inhabitants across these various copies, because the Getty copy, which dates to 1475, contains images that are different from earlier illuminated versions. While other copies don’t dedicate more than one or two illustrations to India, the Getty copy has several that draw upon the medieval tradition of the “monstrous peoples” as well as knowledge of geography, materials, and customs newly gained through trade. This work ties into broader scholarly efforts to shed light on globalization in the Middle Ages. “Scholars of medieval art have generally thought of Western Europe as the center and non-European places as the periphery. There has now been a revision of that view,” says Larisa. “These manuscripts provide an interesting glimpse into how late-medieval Europeans made sense of their world, including...

Write an article with the title: \\"Carlos Condit: 'It's not all about winning or losing'\\" Article:","completion":"Title: Carlos Condit: \\"It's not all about winning or losing\\" In the fast-paced and ever-evolving world of mixed martial arts (MMA), fighters continuously seek ways to outdo one another. It's a sport fueled by passion, discipline, and a burning desire to be the best. For some athletes, success is often measured by wins and losses, but for one man - Carlos Condit - it goes beyond that. The \\"Natural Born Killer\\" has made an indelible mark on the MMA landscape with his relentless fighting style and unyielding spirit. In this article, we will explore Condit's unique outlook on the sport and his remarkable journey thus far. Born on April 26, 1984, in Albuquerque, New Mexico, Carlos Condit was introduced to MMA at a young age. His father, Brian, was a well-respected figure in the combat sports community and served as a guiding force in his son's development. Learning from various martial arts styles, including kickboxing, Brazilian jiu-jitsu, and wrestling, Condit cultivated a diverse skill set that would come to define his career. Although his journey to professional fighting began in 2002, it wasn't until his performance in the now-defunct World Extreme Cagefighting (WEC) that he truly made a name for himself. Possessing incredible striking, submission skills, and impressive takedown defense, Condit quickly became a fan favorite. This led him to capture the WEC Welterweight Championship in 2007 - a victory that would propel him into the larger UFC organization. Within the UFC, Condit continued to impress, etching his name in the annals of the promotion's history with jaw-dropping performances against the likes of Martin Kampmann, Dan Hardy, and Dong Hyun Kim. In one of the most memorable fights of his career, Condit defeated Nick Diaz for the interim UFC Welterweight Championship in 2012. Despite his success, it was during this time that Condit's philosophy on the sport truly took form. \\"I started to realize that victories and losses were just moments in time,\\" Condit explains. \\"Yes, they define your career in some ways, but they don't have to define your self-worth as a competitor or as a person.\\" This outlook was tested when the Albuquerque native faced a series of setbacks in the form of injuries and closely contested losses. However, instead of allowing these adversities to deter him, Condit channeled them as motivation and gained invaluable insights about himself and the sport he loves. \\"I learned that you can't get too attached to the outcome,\\" he says. \\"It's the journey and the process that truly matter. You have to see the bigger picture and continuously work on evolving yourself - both inside and outside the cage.\\" This mentality has allowed Condit to approach his fights with a different perspective - one that focuses on the enjoyment, growth, and learning that comes from competition. Consequently, it has also endearingly solidified him as a revered figure within the MMA community. As Condit enters the twilight of his career, his long-standing relationship with the sport has reaped a wealth of personal growth, as well as legions of loyal fans. An embodiment of resilience and determination, the Natural Born Killer has left an undeniable impact on the hearts and minds of those who have followed his remarkable journey. In the end, Carlos Condit's lasting legacy in MMA will not solely be based on the number of wins or losses on his record. What will endure is the undeniable spirit, the passion for the sport, and the unwavering perseverance he displayed throughout his iconic career. And, in doing so, he has beautifully demonstrated that, sometimes, it's not all about winning or losing."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Consulting detective Sherlock Holmes fakes his own death in Scotland in order to investigate a number of bizarre apparent suicides that he is convinced are part of an elaborate plot by \\"a female Moriarty\\". Returning to his assistant Watson in secret, Holmes notes that all the victims were wealthy gamblers, so disguised as \\"Rajni Singh\\", a distinguished Indian officer, he stalks London's gaming clubs. It is not long before he encounters the villain of the piece, Adrea Spedding. Holmes discovers that she seeks out men short of money, persuades them to pawn their life insurance policies with her accomplices, then kills them. Holmes sets himself up as her next victim, discovering that she uses the deadly spider, Lycosa Carnivora, whose venom causes such excruciating pain that the victims kill themselves. Holmes also finds the footprint of a child nearby. Searching for evidence Holmes and Watson visit eminent arachnologist Matthew Ordway, who may have supplied the deadly creatures. Holmes soon realizes that the man he is speaking to is an impostor, but the villain makes his escape. Searching the premises, Holmes finds the corpse of the real Ordway, as well as his journals, which allude to something or someone from Central Africa immune to the spider venom. This baffles Holmes until he finds the model skeleton of a child. However, Dr. Watson points out that the relation of the skull and the circumference of the chest prove it is not a child, and Holmes deduces that the Central African thing described in the journal is a pygmy. Holmes and Watson continue their investigations at a nearby fairground, where Holmes allows himself to fall into the clutches of Spedding and her gang. Bound and gagged, Holmes is tied behind a moving target in a shooting gallery, at which Lestrade and Watson take pot shots with a .22 rifle.

His business partner, Matthew Burke (Roy Roberts) enters and walks partially upstairs when he is hailed by Jarrod. He tells Jarrod he's there to study the account books. They have a philosophical difference between their approaches to business. Jarrod proposes a buyout arrangement, and Burke either eager or desperate for the money agrees in principle. A potential investor is scheduled to see Jarrod that very evening.Bruce Allison (Phillip Tonge) and Sidney Wallace (Paul Cavanagh) arrive and are given a brief tour of the wax museum.

Doctor Jones studied two teams of workers. Team one had healthy people with normal red blood cell levels, but team two had people with sickle-cell anemia. the differences in health parameters were amazing and obvious. Hint: The primary role of red blood cells in the circulatory system is to transport oxygen to the tissues. The actual carrier of oxygen molecules is the protein hemoglobin, which binds to the oxygen and moves it throughout the body, releasing it in areas where the concentration of dissolved oxygen is low. A certain mutation in the gene for hemoglobin causes a slight change in the structure of this crucial protein, resulting in a disease called sickle-cell anemia. For people with this mutation, the hemoglobin produced by their red blood cells has a tendency to clump together, distorting the shape of the red blood cells and giving rise to the crescent-shaped cells seen above. By understanding the changes in structure that are the underlying cause of this disease, we have developed various ways to treat and manage this illness.

But just vinegar and water won't kill them - they might be able to just float there or fly away when they're done. On the other hand, adding a bit of soap to the vinegar changes the game. Soap reduces the surface tension of the water and vinegar mixture. Surface tension is like a magic invisible blanket that normally lets bugs walk on water without falling in. When the soap is added, the magic blanket disappears. So, when the fruit flies land on the yummy vinegar, they would sink into the liquid because there is no surface tension to support them, and they'd drown.

Longacre is best known for designing the Indian Head cent, which entered commerce in 1859, and for the designs of the Shield nickel, Flying Eagle cent and other coins of the mid-19th century. Longacre was born in Delaware County, Pennsylvania, in 1794. He ran away to Philadelphia at age 12, where he became an apprentice in a bookstore. His artistic talent developed and he was released to apprentice in an engraving firm. He struck out on his own in 1819, making a name providing illustrations for popular biographical books. He portrayed the leading men of his day; support from some of them, such as South Carolina Senator John C. Calhoun, led to his appointment as chief engraver after the death of Christian Gobrecht in 1844. In Longacre's first years as a chief engraver, the Philadelphia Mint was dominated by Mint Director Robert M. Patterson and Chief Coiner Franklin Peale. Conflict between Longacre and the two men developed after Congress ordered a new gold dollar and double eagle, with both to be designed by Longacre. Peale and Patterson nearly had Longacre fired, but the chief engraver was able to convince Treasury Secretary William M. Meredith that he should be retained. Both Patterson and Peale left the Mint in the early 1850s, ending the conflict. In 1856, Longacre designed the Flying Eagle cent. When that design proved difficult to strike, Longacre was responsible for the replacement, the Indian Head cent, issued beginning in 1859. Other coins designed by Longacre include the silver and nickel three-cent pieces, the Shield nickel, the pattern Washington nickel, and the two-cent piece. In 1866–1867, he redesigned the coins of Chile. Longacre died suddenly on New Year's Day 1869; he was succeeded by William Barber.

I didn’t particularly love it but it was interesting enough at the least to hold my attention. We got to class and the teacher pulled up a list of instructions on the projector. She had each of us follow the instructions and she gave us 20 minutes to complete all of them. It may even have been a bit of a race too, to see who finished it first. This becomes a lot more evident in a second. I can’t recall the exact details of the instructions, except that clearly it had to do with art such as having to draw a bunch of things. Anyways, we all went one by one down the instructions getting increasing nervous as to try to be the first one to finish. The class goes quiet while we work. Then I get to the last instruction which reads something along the lines of: “Step 15: Skip steps 1–14 and put your pencil down.” You gotta be freaking kidding me. We’re all so confused and mad at ourselves for not reading the whole of the instructions first. She turned this into a lesson for how we need to learn to read all the instructions first and then start, which was pretty clever. She got us! I remember this vividly to this day.

Avoid tomatoes with bug spots, bruises and other damage.","completion":"The most logical next event after selecting your tomatoes would be to prepare them for freezing. Here is a step-by-step guide to help you freeze tomatoes successfully: Step 1: Clean the tomatoes Before freezing, it is essential to clean your tomatoes thoroughly to remove any dirt, bacteria, or residue. Gently wash the tomatoes under running water and use a soft cloth or vegetable brush if necessary. After washing, dry them completely with a clean towel or paper towel to remove excess moisture. Step 2: Blanch the tomatoes (optional) Blanching is the process of boiling tomatoes for a short period followed by an immediate transfer to an ice-water bath. This step helps in making it easier to peel the skin off once they are frozen. To blanch tomatoes, follow the steps below: 1. Bring a large pot of water to a rolling boil. 2. Cut a small \\"X\\" at the bottom of each tomato using a sharp knife. This will facilitate the peeling process after blanching. 3. Place the tomatoes in the boiling water for 30-60 seconds or until the skin starts to loosen. 4. Use a slotted spoon to quickly transfer the tomatoes to an ice water bath to halt the cooking process. 5. Once cooled, gently peel the skin off the tomatoes. If you prefer to leave the skin on, you can skip the blanching process. Step 3: Remove stems and core the tomatoes Using a small, sharp knife, carefully cut out the stem and core from the top of each tomato. This step ensures the removal of the tough and undesirable portions of the tomato. Step 4: Cut the tomatoes (optional) Depending on your preference and intended use, you can choose to freeze the tomatoes whole, halved, quartered, or chopped. Cut the tomatoes in the desired size and shape, and make sure to remove any excess seeds and juice. If you plan on using the tomatoes primarily for sauces or stews, you may consider crushing or pureeing them. Step 5: Arrange tomatoes on a baking sheet To prevent the tomatoes from sticking together when frozen, spread them out on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat in a single layer. Make sure the tomatoes are not touching to allow for even freezing. Step 6: Pre-freeze the tomatoes Place the baking sheet with tomatoes in the freezer for a few hours or until they are firm and solid. This process is known as flash freezing and helps in maintaining the quality and texture of tomatoes when defrosting. Step 7: Transfer to airtight containers or freezer bags Once the tomatoes have been pre-frozen, transfer them to airtight containers or heavy-duty freezer bags. Label the bags with the date, type of tomato, and any other relevant information. Ensure you squeeze out any excess air to prevent freezer burn and to save space. Step 8: Store in the freezer Place the airtight containers or freezer bags in the freezer. Frozen tomatoes can be stored for up to six months to a year, although it is recommended to use them within six months for optimal quality and flavor.

An SUV had gone off the road,down a hill, and collided with a tree. When we heard the wreck, I remembered to say \\"call 911\\". My family was the first on the scene. Nick, my son, was on the cell phone with 911. He saw a friend who was a victim in the crash who was a 15 years old girl who was badly disfigured and had died instantly. It was a terrible scene. There had been six people in the truck, all between 15 and 17 years old. My husband and I checked all the victims, and I picked one who was conscious and stayed with him. I talked with him and had him lay on the ground. When I asked him if he was hurt, he said he was sore all over. When help arrived, they asked me to stay and continue working with them. I did as Debbie Romine, .my instructor, said in class, and did what they wanted. They even said thank you before they left. The sheriff deputies came by Saturday night to get our statements and play the 911 tape back, so Nick could identify all the voices in the background. They said over and over that the way he handled the call was the best they had heard in a long time. He was calm and worked with them even when he saw his friend who had died. The Sheriff's Department is sending some people over to help us work through our emotions. The first aid and CPR course I took in January really helped me.

It will come as no surprise to those working in the UK’s higher education (HE) sector that universities are currently suffused with anxiety. The University and College Union (UCU) has recently been in dispute with employers over proposed changes to the USS pension scheme, and the most sustained period of industrial action in the sector’s history has highlighted the fears staff have for the security of their futures post-retirement. Such unprecedented strike action needs to be situated within the wider context of a public sector undergoing transformation: while the concept remains contested, the influence of “neoliberal” ideas on universities can most clearly be seen in Success as a Knowledge Economy – the government white paper that preceded the 2017 Higher Education and Research Act – which states: “Competition between providers in any market incentivises them to raise their game, offering consumers a greater choice of more innovative and better quality products and services at lower cost. Higher education is no exception.” Yet what might “raising our game” mean for academic staff? The university has been described as an “anxiety machine”: the creeping marketisation of the sector along with pressure to recruit students (now “consumers”), increasing managerialism, and the implementation of processes of audit – such as the REF and TEF – to evaluate performance have arguably contributed to a progressively anxious landscape in which to labour. In 2016/17, 34% of academic staff were employed on fixed-term contracts – a figure likely to be disputed by the UCU, since in 2016 it estimated the extent of casualisation in the sector to be closer to 54% once atypical contracts had been taken into consideration. In addition to pressures facing many staff in universities – such as time-management, meeting growing employer expectations, and the evaluation of performance – “casualised” contracts present particular challenges for those facing employment uncertainty: in a material sense, this can be a case of keeping up with...

The factory is now the Eli Whitney Museum, which has a particular emphasis on activities for children and exhibits pertaining to the A. C. Gilbert Company. His factory, along with that of Simeon North, and the lively clock-making and brass hardware sectors, contributed to making early Connecticut a powerful manufacturing economy; so many arms manufacturers sprang up that the state became known as \\"The Arsenal of America\\".

Step 2: Analyze and create equations from the given information. - 5 years ago, the average age of A and B was 15 years. So, we can write this information as an equation: (A - 5) + (B - 5) = 15 * 2 - Currently, the average age of A, B, and C is 20 years. So, we can write this information as another equation: A + B + C = 20 * 3 Step 3: Solve the equations to get the variables' values. Solve the first equation for (A - 5) + (B - 5) = 15 * 2: A - 5 + B - 5 = 30 A + B = 30 + 5 + 5 A + B = 40 Since we know A + B = 40, we can substitute this value into the second equation A + B + C = 20 * 3: 40 + C = 60 C = 60 - 40 C = 20 Step 4: Calculate the age of C after 14 years. Now that we know the present age of C is 20, we can calculate how old C will be after 14 years. The future age of C = Present age of C + 14 years The future age of C = 20 + 14 The future age of C = 34 Step 5: Compare the result with the given options.

The only cost you will incur is the cost of retitling property back to your own name. Realize that the mortgage follows the property into the trust.

For example, you might leave the following: You can transfer the assets and business name of a sole proprietorship to the revocable trust. You might be able transfer your ownership interest in a partnership to the trust, although you should check the partnership document first. Some partnership documents limit your ability to make this transfer. You might also be able to transfer shares in a closely held company to your revocable trust. You may also be able to transfer your ownership interest in a limited liability company, though you will need other owners to agree. A trust can own business property but cannot operate a business.

The trust is revocable, meaning that the owner can change their mind at any time, with the only cost involved being the retitling of the property back to their name.

Write an article based on this summary: – Today is World TB Day, and its arrival is met with some gloomy new estimates about the presence of tuberculosis among the world's kids. A study published in Lancet has found that as many as 1 million children under age 15 are hit with TB each year, reports the Wall Street Journal. That's double the previously established estimate, and some two-thirds of all cases go undiagnosed. The Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School researchers were also able to for the first time put a number on the instances of what Reuters terms a \\"drug-resistant 'superbug' strain\\" of TB: MDR-TB. As many as 32,000 kids across the globe become sick with that form each year. Reuters notes that researchers have historically focused more on TB in adults, for a duo of reasons: Adults are more likely to pass on the disease; and the diagnosis methods used on adults don't always work on kids, in part because up to 30% of children who develop TB do so somewhere other than their lungs. But the attention is shifting to children in part because of what they can reveal about the transmission of the disease among adults: TB develops much more rapidly in children, signalling the presence of the disease in their adult family members or community. \\"These 1 million children are missed opportunities for preventing TB every year,\\" says the co-senior author of the study.","completion":"Title: World TB Day Sheds Light on Alarming Increase of Tuberculosis Among Children Introduction World Tuberculosis (TB) Day is a poignant reminder of the ongoing battle against this deadly disease. This year, the day is marked by some disheartening new findings on the prevalence of TB among children. According to a study published in Lancet, as many as 1 million children under the age of 15 are affected by TB each year. This figure is double the previously estimated number and highlights the fact that nearly two-thirds of all cases go undiagnosed. 1. The Situation Researchers from Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School have brought to light the concerning issue of undiagnosed TB in children, revealing that many are suffering from the disease worldwide. In addition, the study has identified the presence of a drug-resistant strain of tuberculosis known as MDR-TB, which affects over 32,000 children every year. 2. Reasons for Underdiagnosis Historically, researchers have primarily focused on TB in adults for two main reasons: adults are more likely to transmit the disease, and diagnostic methods used for adults are not always effective for children. This is because up to 30% of children who develop tuberculosis do so in areas other than their lungs, making diagnosis more difficult. 3. Changing Focus Now, attention is shifting towards children as they can reveal important insights about the transmission of TB among adults. Tuberculosis develops much more rapidly in children, which often signals the presence of the disease in their adult family members or community. By focusing on children, researchers hope to shed light on how the disease is transmitted in adults and ultimately curtail the spread of TB. 4. Prevention and Opportunities With the discovery that 1 million children are affected by tuberculosis each year, researchers emphasize the missed opportunities for prevention. By identifying and treating the disease in children, it can not only help them recover but also hinder the disease's transmission to their adult family members and the community. Conclusion The findings in the Lancet study underscore the importance of addressing tuberculosis in children, both for the youngsters' health and to better understand the transmission of the disease among adults. As World TB Day approaches, it is crucial to recognize these revelations and make a concerted effort to diagnose, treat, and prevent the spread of tuberculosis in children worldwide."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Most forms of Western music can make use of the piano. Consequently, pianists have a wide variety of repertoire and styles to choose from, including traditionally classical music, Jazz, blues and all sorts of popular music, including rock music. Most pianists can, to a certain extent, play other keyboard-related instruments such as the synthesizer, harpsichord, celesta and the organ and keyboard. Perhaps the greatest pianist of all time was Franz Liszt, whose piano mastery was described by Anton Rubinstein: \\"In comparison with Liszt, all other pianists are children\\". - Tom Shapiro (born in Kansas City, Missouri) is an American songwriter and occasional record producer, known primarily for his work in country music.

A harmonica reed is a flat elongated spring typically made of brass, stainless steel, or bronze, which is secured at one end over a slot that serves as an airway. When the free end is made to vibrate by the player's air, it alternately blocks and unblocks the airway to produce sound. - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia.

As a genre it blends the sound of Western musical styles such as country with that of rhythm and blues, leading to what is considered \\"classic\\" rock and roll. Some have also described it as a blend of bluegrass with rock and roll. The term \\"rockabilly\\" itself is a portmanteau of \\"rock\\" (from \\"rock 'n' roll\\") and \\"hillbilly\\", the latter a reference to the country music (often called \\"hillbilly music\\" in the 1940s and 1950s) that contributed strongly to the style. Other important influences on rockabilly include western swing, boogie woogie, jump blues, and electric blues. - Can't Back Down is the seventh studio album released by country music artist Collin Raye. It was also his last album for Epic Records, and the first album of his career not to produce any Top 40 country hits. \\"Ain't Nobody Gonna Take That from Me\\", the first single, reached #43 on the Hot Country Songs charts. \\"What I Need\\", the second single, failed to chart. - Country music is a genre of United States popular music that originated in the southern United States in the 1920s. It takes its roots from the southeastern genre of United States, such as folk music (especially Appalachian folk music), and blues music. Blues modes have been used extensively throughout its recorded history. Country music often consists of ballads and dance tunes with generally simple forms and harmonies accompanied by mostly string instruments such as banjos, electric and acoustic guitars, dobros and fiddles as well as harmonicas. According to Lindsey Starnes, the term \\"country music\\" gained popularity in the 1940s in preference to the earlier term \\"hillbilly music\\"; it came to encompass Western music, which evolved parallel to hillbilly music from similar roots, in the mid-20th century. The term \\"country music\\" is used today to describe many styles and subgenres. The origins of country music are the folk music of working-class Americans, who blended popular songs, Irish and Celtic fiddle tunes, traditional English ballads, and cowboy songs, and various musical traditions from European immigrant communities. In 2009 country music was the most listened to rush hour radio genre during the evening commute, and second most popular in the morning commute in the United States. - Betty Everett (November 23, 1939 August 19, 2001) was an American soul singer and pianist, best known for her biggest hit single, the million-selling \\"The Shoop Shoop Song (It's in His Kiss)\\". - Recorded history or written history is a historical narrative based on a written record or other documented communication.

Please answer the following question: Generate a question that has the following answer: The friends are stored in suspended animation. for the following movie plot: The film begins with a Brownie troop visiting a doll manufacturing company called Dolls Inc., owned and operated by the seemingly kindly Mr. Franz (John Hoyt). As the girls tour the factory, they see a number of very lifelike dolls stored in glass canisters locked in a display case on the wall. These are part of Mr. Franzâs special collection. Sally Reynolds (June Kenney) answers a newspaper advertisement for a secretary; Franz's previous one has mysteriously vanished. Although she is concerned about his obsession with his dolls, she reluctantly agrees to take the job. She soon meets a traveling salesman, Bob Westley (John Agar), who introduces himself as the best salesman in St. Louis and immediately sets about attempting to seduce her. Their relationship become serious enough that Bob persuades Sally to quit her job, promising to break the news to Franz. The next day however, Franz informs Sally that Bob has gone back home to take care of business and that she should forget him. She, however, is unwilling to accept this and goes to the police with a theory about Franz' role in her boyfriend's disappearance (\\"He made Bob into a doll!\\"), but Sergeant Paterson (Jack Kosslyn) is skeptical. Franz has developed a machine which can shrink people down to a sixth of their original size. He then uses it on anyone who tries to leave him. When he finds that Sally plans to quit, she becomes his latest victim. Franz has already miniaturized at least four other \\"friends\\". They are stored in suspended animation (which he has also invented) in glass jars in a display case in his office.

Write some highlights for the following article: Hecklers stood up and chanted repeatedly 'we believe the women' during Bill Cosby's third and final performance of a Canadian tour on Friday night. The hecklers then marched out of the theater in Hamilton as the 77-year-old comedian asked his audience not to react. Cosby is facing growing sexual assault allegations from more than 15 women, with some claims dating back decades. He has denied the allegations through his lawyer, has never been charged and has never publicly spoken of them publicly. The walk-out during Friday's show came a day after a man at Cosby's performance in London, Ontario, called the comedian 'a rapist'. Scroll down for video.

Warning: A sign posted outside of the Hamilton Place Theatre ahead ofBill Cosby's show. Scores of demonstrators brave the cold to protest against a show by Bill Cosby on Friday night. It also took place just minutes after Cosby acknowledged the controversy that has followed him on the tour, with protesters camping outside the venues with sandwich boards. 'Whatever happens here tonight if there's some sort of outburst, we just have to remain calm and things will be taken care of. It oughtn't last that long,' he told the audience. 'I want to thank all of you here tonight because you stayed with what you believed in.' An announcement at the start of the show warned the audience there might be attempts to disrupt the show and urged ticket holders to remain calm until the matter 'is resolved'. Security at the venue was tight — bags were searched and police officers and private security guards were posted along the aisles of the theatre. The three shows in Canada were Cosby's first since November when he had a string of performances canceled over the accusations. Many protesters took aim at the venues that agreed to let Cosby perform in light of the scandal plaguing him. Touch down: Bill Cosby gets off his private jet and arrives in Hamilton, Canada, on Friday afternoon. Cold arrival: Cosby landed in Hamilton a few hours before the performance, which was his last of three. During a rare moment in Thursday night's show at the same venue, Cosby alluded to his sexual assault scandal. As he saw a woman getting up from the front row of the theater, Cosby asked where she was going. She said she was getting a drink and politely asked if he wanted her to bring anything back for him, according to National Post reporter Richard Warnica who attended the event. He said no, that he had his own bottle of water and then said 'You have to be careful drinking around me.' The statement refers to a theme in several of his accusers' stories - that he drugged their drinks before raping them. Warnica says the crowd erupted in loud gasps, but that their shock soon turned to support as they laughed and gave a round of applause for the comment. Thursday night's show was the second in a three-stop comedy tour of Canada. Both nights have been the subject of protests outside the venues, as ticket-holders were heckled by demonstrators holding signs like 'rape is not joke'. Both of Cosby's show s in Canada have been the subject of protests this week. Above, some of the demonstrators outside of his show Thursday night. Before the show started, Warnica tweeted a photo of a piece of paper handed out to those walking into venue Budweiser Gardens. The slip of paper warns 'disruptive behavior will not be tolerated and will result in removal, possible legal action and banning from the venue'. One man was kicked out of Thursday night's event for yelling 'you are a rapist'. Dale Carruthers, a journalist who tried to film the man being escorted out by security, was also kicked out. Cosby's publicist later confirmed the heckler in a statement, describing the situation as 'one outburst' in a crowd of 'loyal, patient and courageous' fans. The statement ends with Cosby saying 'I'm far from finished'. Warnica says that while the venue was not full, it was far from empty and the crowd seemed to enjoy Cosby's performance. He received a standing ovation for a second night in a row. Heckled: Canadians attending both events in Kitchener and London have been heckled by the crowds demonstrating outside the event.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Article: If you do proceed to trial, your case will either be decided by a judge or a jury. Usually, the parties decide whether to have the case decided by a judge or jury. In some cases, you may want to ask for a judge and not request a jury.If you are representing yourself, a trial before a judge is likely to be more informal, and you will not have to worry about the jury’s impression of you in the courtroom. You should ask for a jury if your case has “emotional appeal” and you think the jury may be sympathetic to your cause. However, keep in mind that this can backfire if someone on the jury doesn’t like you. Keep in mind that the trial will have all of the same “parts,” regardless of whether you are in front of a judge or a jury. The “opening statement” is a type of speech given at the start of trial. It is your first opportunity to introduce yourself and your case. If you filed the lawsuit (and therefore are the plaintiff), you will give your opening statement first, followed by the defendant. In your opening statement, you should give an overview of what your case is about and what your evidence will prove. You should begin proving your case by telling the jury what evidence is in your favor and what happened to you. Keep in mind that you cannot state your own opinions in an opening statement, and if you do so you could be reprimanded by the judge. During the presentation of the case, you will call your own witnesses, and “examine” them (this is called direct examination). You will also have the opportunity to ask questions of your opponent’s witnesses (this is called cross examination). To prepare for calling and examining your witnesses, make sure that they all agree to be present at the trial. For direct examination, you should prepare a notebook with an outline of what you want to ask the witnesses. Ask questions that will encourage the witnesses to talk, instead of “yes” and “no” questions. To get comfortable with questioning witnesses, you can meet with them to practice beforehand. For cross examination, realize that you probably won’t get that much useful information, and limit or completely forgo examining the opposing witnesses. Only cross examine the opposing witnesses if you can get evidence from them that supports your version of events or discredits their trustworthiness as a witness. Always be kind and polite to any witnesses, even during cross examination. Arguing with or badgering a witness (even an opposing witness) looks bad to the jury, and could get you in trouble with the judge. A closing argument is delivered at the end of a trial, after all of the evidence has been presented and all witnesses have been called. A closing argument is the last chance you will have to address the judge or the jury. Closing arguments are usually between 10 and 20 minutes, but, if the case is extremely complicated, they can be much longer, in some cases up to one hour. Unlike an opening statement, which can be written well in advance of the trial, a closing argument will be based on the events of the trial, so to prepare an effective closing argument, make sure that you take notes throughout the trial. To see in-depth information about preparing a closing argument, visit wikiHow’s guide on writing a closing argument. Even after the trial has ended, the losing party can appeal the loss to a higher court. An appeal is a request to a higher court to review and overturn the decision of a lower court. In federal court, appeals are heard by the United States Court of Appeals. In state court systems, the appeals courts go by various names. If you think you might want to appeal the decision in your case, make sure you understand the following: How appeals are decided: generally, the courts of appeal do not want to tell the trial judge that he made the wrong decision, or “overrule” that decision. Therefore, an appeals court will usually only overturn the decision of a lower court if the lower court made a significant error of law.What a “significant error of law” is will be completely different depending on each particular case. What evidence you can present: The courts of appeals do not look at any new evidence that may have been discovered after the case was decided (either by the judge or the jury). Instead, the court will look at the documents from the case, a “brief” by both parties discussing why each one believes that they have the correct view, and in some cases, will listen to both parties argue your case in front of the court (this is referred to as “oral argument). The consequences of an unsuccessful appeal: if a party unsuccessfully appeal the court’s order, the higher court will “affirm” the lower court’s ruling (or the jury’s), and the current judgment will stand. For more information on appealing a court order, visit WikiHow’s guide on Appealing a Court Order. What is a summary of what this article is about?","completion":"This article is all about trials and the different things that can happen during them. It shares that a trial can be decided by either a judge or a jury, and the people involved will usually choose which one. It's sometimes better to have a judge decide if you're representing yourself because it can be less formal, and you won't have to worry about what a jury thinks of you. But a jury might be better if your case is emotional and you think they might feel sympathy for you. The article also explains what an \\"opening statement\\" is. It's a kind of speech given at the start of the trial to explain what the case is about and what the evidence will show. After this, both sides get to ask questions to witnesses to prove their point. Preparation and respect towards witnesses is very important. A \\"closing argument\\" is another speech made once all the evidence has been shown and all the witnesses have talked. It's the last chance to convince the judge or jury. Lastly, the article talks about appeals. After a trial, the person who loses can ask a higher court to look at the case again. But the article warns that this can be hard because the higher court usually only changes the decision if a big mistake was made. And, they don't look at any new evidence but just the documents from the case. If the appeal doesn't work, then the original decision stands."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

News article: Five months after showing up in a San Diego-area emergency room without any recollection of her name, age, family, or friends, a woman who calls herself “Sam” finally has an identity. NBC 7's Steven Luke has the details. (Published Wednesday, July 1, 2015) Five months after showing up in a San Diego-area emergency room without any recollection of her name, age, family, or friends, a woman who calls herself “Sam” has finally rediscovered who she is as she continues to battle cancer. Ashley Manetta, 53, never married and has sisters in Colorado and Maryland. She was born in Pennsylvania, lived in Flagstaff, Arizona, and several years ago found her way to Southern California, where she lived in La Jolla, Vista, and Carlsbad. The woman’s plight captured attention worldwide after NBC 7's post went viral with a Facebook reach of 21.2 million people as of Wednesday afternoon. Facebook users shared the post nearly 200,000 times, leading to thousands of tips and suggestions. Manetta’s nephew watched the NBC 7 story online and immediately called his mom to tell her about the mystery woman: Aunt Ashley. The FBI took the tip to Manetta and her friend Debbie Rough, her nurse from Tri City Medical Center in Oceanside, who championed the initial search for relatives. The phone call led to tears and details of her forgotten past. “It was extremely emotional. We were all sobbing. They’re so sorry I had to go through what I did during this time without them,” Manetta said. The FBI did not officially confirm Manetta's identity, but investigators felt comfortable with the information they've provided to help facilitate a reunion. Manetta's family did not provide independent verification of her identity. Woman With Amnesia, Cancer Searches for Identity NBC 7's Steven Luke reports on a woman found in Carlsbad with a rare form of amnesia and Stage 3 ovarian cancer. Her story has been shared all around the world. (Published Tuesday, June 30, 2015) Carlsbad firefighters responded to an emergency call on February 1 and found her in dire shape. Her blood pressure was so low she was barely conscious. She couldn’t tell paramedics anything about herself. Doctors at Tri City Medical Center diagnosed her with ovarian cancer, telling her the antibodies from the tumor possibly caused “retrograde amnesia.\\" Carlsbad police and the FBI got involved in an effort to help identify her. They said more pressing responsibilities kept them from devoting the many hours needed to solve the case. Searches of their fingerprint database turned up empty. “He [the FBI agent] said you must be a good girl, otherwise we’d have records of you,” Manetta said. FBI agents posted Manetta’s picture and story to the Interpol website in an effort to attract global attention. She spoke with an English or Australian accent and had vivid dreams about time spent in Perth. \\"Apparently I have a long time of visiting Australia for extended trips. I’ve been going there throughout my life,” Manetta said. The family lost track of her in 2013, around the same time she showed up in Southern California and attended St. Patrick Catholic Church in Carlsbad. Mystery Woman Update: Carlsbad Woman Recalls Meeting \\"Sam\\" NBC 7's Steven Luke has new information about a mystery woman with cancer who showed up in a Carlsbad hospital, unable to remember her name or past. (Published Wednesday, July 1, 2015) The FBI said NBC 7’s Facebook post and subsequent stories generated numerous tips, which helped put the pieces of the puzzle together. Manetta plans to fly back to Maryland and live with one of her older sisters. “She was just telling me she has a four-bedroom, large house and a lovely king-size bed waiting for me.\\" Manetta thanks the millions of people around the world who watched her story and prayed and tried to help with leads and suggestions. The story has seemed almost too remarkable to be true. The FBI can’t confirm or deny the circumstances, but feels comfortable with the information they’ve provided to help facilitate a reunion. Manetta’s close friends and the nurse who championed her story call her a genuine and sweet human being. They believe she has the genuine faith in God which was the first thing she remembers feeling in the emergency room. “I had peace where there should be none and I believed He would bring me back together with people that that were family and I trusted Him,\\" she said. Ashley Manetta will need to continue with chemotherapy to treat the aggressive cancer, but with family and faith she says “she knows where she is going” and now, finally, where she came from too. ||||| Image copyright Reuters Image caption Thousands of people tried to help \\"Sam\\" solve the mystery of her identity A woman whose case sparked a social media hunt after she was found on a US street with amnesia has been identified by her family. \\"Sam\\", as she was known by thousands following her story, has been named as Ashley Menatta, 53, of California. About five months ago she was found in Carlsbad, Southern California, unwell and with no memory of who she was. Her nephew identified her from a US NBC 7 television show about her, according to NBC 7 and Sam's Facebook page. He called his mother who then alerted the authorities. NBC 7 says Ashley Menatta was born in Pennsylvania and had lived in Flagstaff, Arizona. Several years ago, she moved to Southern California where she lived in La Jolla, Vista and Carlsbad. She reportedly loved travelling and never married. Her sisters, in Colorado and Maryland, are said to have lost track of her in 2013. Ms Menatta described an \\"extremely emotional\\" reunion with her family. \\"We were all sobbing,\\" she said. \\"They're so sorry I had to go through what I did during this time without them.\\" 'Great news' Ms Menatta was found \\"barely conscious\\" by emergency services in Carlsbad in February this year. She told reporters she had been diagnosed with stage three ovarian cancer after the authorities found her, and doctors removed a tumour the size of a volleyball. Doctors told her she was likely suffering from \\"retrograde amnesia\\" - a type of memory-loss brought on during the onset of a disease. Her slight Australian accent led many people, including US authorities, to suspect she may originally have been from Australia. She also had strong memories of swimming at a beach in Perth, in Western Australia, and visiting other Australian holiday spots. Australian consular officials had offered assistance in solving her case. Her Facebook page, set up with assistance from a former nurse who got involved in the case, said prayers had been answered. \\"Well, we have some great news,\\" the post said. \\"'Sam' (Ashley is her name) and I want to thank you all who have been sharing, searching, emailing, posting, private messaging, calling, texting, twittering, NBC Channel 7 in San Diego, Australian News, England News, police, Missing Australians, Australian Missing Persons Register, FBI, interpol, and everyone else!!!! \\"We could not have done this with out all of your help!\\" ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","completion":"A woman named Ashley Manetta was found in California without any memory of who she was.

In addition, it has played a vital role in the development of Western civilization and the establishment of Christianity as one of the world's major religions. Due to its religious significance, widespread availability, and the fact that it has been translated into over 700 languages, the Bible is considered the best-selling book of all time. Conservative estimates suggest that over 5 billion copies have been sold, while some sources claim that the number may be significantly higher.

Lise Eliot, author, \\"Pink Brain, Blue Brain\\" College campuses are already segregated by sex, with students often picking their field of study based on gender conformity. Single-sex Greek life exacerbates this trend. Eliza Mott, student, Princeton University Making frats coed will make them a safer place for women and increase the level of maturity of relationships across gender boundaries. Will Morrow, student, Trinity College Trinity College’s experience in recent years serves as a testament to the speciousness of the merits of coed Greek organizations. What is a short summary of the above article?","completion":"The topic is about whether or not college fraternities and sororities should be coed, meaning should they include both boys and girls. Walter Kimbrough warns that if a college pushes for coed Greek houses, national groups might quit, leaving the college to deal with local groups. Lise Eliot mentions that many students choose what they want to study based on what seems suitable for their gender, and having groups only for boys or girls can make this thought stronger. On the other hand, Eliza Mott believes that making frats include boys and girls can keep women safer and improve understanding between boys and girls. However, Will Morrow points to his school, Trinity College, as an example that mixing boys and girls in these groups maybe isn't the best idea. So, some people think it might be better to include both boys and girls in these groups, while others think it might not work so well."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

He rides into Rio Arriba, where four men, Alfonso Parral (Lee Van Cleef), Bill Zachary (Stephen Boyd), Ed Taylor (Albert Salmi) and Lujan (Henry Silva), are in jail awaiting execution. Sheriff Eloy Sanchez (Herbert Rudley) allows Douglas to see the men. In town, Douglas meets Josefa Velarde (Joan Collins) whom he met five years previously in New Orleans. She has been looking after her late father's ranch. Douglas reveals he has a daughter (Maria Garcia Fletcher). Other townspeople include Gus Steimmetz, his daughter Emma (Kathleen Gallant) and her fiance (Barry Coe). The executioner, Simms, arrives, and aside from a brief drink with Douglas, seems to show little interest in socializing or advance planning for his task. Simms holds off until the town is at church, then, while pretending to evaluate the men he is to hang, stabs the sheriff in the back. The sheriff shoots and kills Simms, but the inmates leave the sheriff unconscious, escape and take Emma as a hostage. The wounded sheriff comes into the church with the news that the prisoners have escaped. A posse rides out immediately, but Douglas waits until morning. The posse is held up at a pass when one of the four fugitives stays behind to cover the pass. Douglas catches up and corners Parral, who pleads for his life. Douglas kills him, then ropes another outlaw, Taylor, by the feet and hangs him upside-down from a tree. The two remaining fugitives reach the house of John Butler (Gene Evans), a prospector and Douglas's neighbor. Zachary kills Butler, after which Lujan steals a sack of coins Butler had.

As Julie kept asking question after question, all I could think of was how desperately I needed a normal, healthy relationship. As far as most of my relationships went, mine with Julie was great.

Read this: Incandescent bulbs are much less efficient than most other types of electric lighting; incandescent bulbs convert less than 5% of the energy they use into visible light, with standard light bulbs averaging about 2.2%. The remaining energy is converted into heat. The luminous efficacy of a typical incandescent bulb is 16 lumens per watt, compared with 60 lm/W for a compact fluorescent bulb or 150 lm/W for some white LED lamps. Some applications of the incandescent bulb deliberately use the heat generated by the filament. Such applications include incubators, brooding boxes for poultry, heat lights for reptile tanks, infrared heating for industrial heating and drying processes, lava lamps, and the Easy-Bake Oven toy.

The family of a blind stroke patient who died from pneumonia after being left outside in the pouring rain by bungling hospital nurses has received a payout from the NHS. Frank Kelly, 79, was wearing just his pyjamas when nurses 'lost him' and he was left in a car park outside Worcestershire Royal Hospital in December 2010. The retired farmer developed pneumonia and died three months later. His family have now received an undisclosed payout from the NHS after reaching an out-of-court settlement . Poor treatment: Frank Kelly, 79, died of pneumonia three months after nurses left him outside Worcester Royal Hospital wearing just pyjamas in the rain. Apology: Worcestershire Royal Hospital has apologised for Mr Kelly's poor treatment during his five-month stay at the hospital and his family has received an undisclosed payout from the NHS. They also received an apology after it emerged the incident was just one in a catalogue of errors during Mr Kelly's five-month stay at the hospital. The retired farmer was admitted to Worcestershire Royal Hospital in November 2010 after suffering a second stroke which left him blind. But the family soon took up a 24-hour rota at his bedside after being shocked by the 'appalling' care he received from doctors and nurses. On one visit to the hospital, Frank's son Martin, 51, found his father stood in the middle of the car park wearing nothing but his sodden pyjamas on a rainy day in December 2010. It later emerged he had wandered into the car park after the nurses who were moving him to a new ward lost him. Care: The family of Mr Kelly,. pictured being shaved by his son Matthew while in hospital, say staff were too busy to acre for their father and frequently failed to feed him. Dinner time: Mr Kelly's family visited him every day to feed him after being shocked at the 'appalling' care at Worcestershire Royal Hospital. Martin said: 'When I turned up to see my dad in the car park, I was stunned, I couldn't believe it. 'I stopped the car, raced over and told him I was there. 'It's so sad to think that he worked his whole life and when it came to it, he couldn't even get decent hospital care. 'We all believe that with better care we could have had dad home again.'

Martin and the rest of his family received a financial settlement from the hospital after one of Frank's own medical team advised them to take action. Martin added: 'He was not fed properly, they didn't seem to realise that he was blind. We had to take in food every day. 'He was dehydrated all the time and the communication on the wards was just appalling. We were begging for help but he was never given a chance. 'The hospital has admitted a total failure of care and that dad had an awful slice of the cake. 'We didn't do this for any financial reasons, we did it to try and highlight the failings and ensure this sort of thing does not happen to anyone else. 'We have been told it is improving but we are not convinced and we do fear what sort of care we would get if we were ever unfortunate enough to need them again.' He added that the health system had 'too many managers in suits' at the expense of nurses devoted to care. In a letter to Frank's widow Anne, 78, Chief executive Penny Venables said: 'I am acutely conscious that these improvements came too late to positively influence your father's experience and that is a matter of deep regret. 'I can fully understand how angry and frustrated you must have felt about the care he received at the time and how painful it must have been for you to witness his suffering.

She still lives in family memories, in the thoughts of her friends and co-workers, in the values she had instilled in her children, and in the lovely flower gardens that she had so carefully tended. She loved her gladioli and irises. Each fall she would dig the bulbs out of the soil and carefully wrap them in paper. The bulbs would be stored until the following spring when they would be replanted. It seemed like a lot of effort to me, but each year her flower garden was more glorious than the year before. She put the same hard work into caring for her family, instilling in her children a sense of justice and fair play, compassion, and strong moral values so that we blossomed.

Input: Background Paragraph: From the data he collected and documented, Aristotle inferred quite a number of rules relating the life-history features of the live-bearing tetrapods (terrestrial placental mammals) that he studied. Among these correct predictions are the following. Brood size decreases with (adult) body mass, so that an elephant has fewer young (usually just one) per brood than a mouse. Lifespan increases with gestation period, and also with body mass, so that elephants live longer than mice, have a longer period of gestation, and are heavier. As a final example, fecundity decreases with lifespan, so long-lived kinds like elephants have fewer young in total than short-lived kinds like mice. Story: Albert is a scientist who travels the planet looking for new species to discover and analyze. While on a safari in Australia, Albert discovered two new species of live-bearing tetrapods. In the first species, species A, the adult individuals had high body mass on average. In the second species, species B, the adult individuals had low body mass on average.

You could read in its beautifully printed brochure that the school was designed to help all those \\"children of wealthy parents, who are too busy to learn during the day due to the time spent on the difficult task of maintaining our country's high ranking in the very competitive field of computer games.\\" In other words: when a parent wanted to have some peace and quiet, he or she would leave the kid at home in front of the computer with a bag of chips. When the kid had enough, which normally happened in the evening, he would go to school for about two hours. The creator of PEES and its first principal was Krzycho Jedynak, a former junior high PE teacher in Potylica, a computer games fan and the winner of, as we could read in the beautifully printer brochure, \\"a local Amiga gaming championship\\". Understanding exactly the needs of his future students, he planned to open classes of the following profiles: platform PSP (one group), platform PC (three groups), platform GB (one) and platform Mac (cancelled due to a lack of interest). The school received an astonishing number of applications (four for each spot), which meant that many kids spent their days playing computer games and that many parents wanted time for themselves. To be accepted, young candidates had to demonstrate their social and psychological maturity and computer instincts, evaluated according to a patented method developed by Mr. Jedynak. The parents, on the other hand, had to pass an exam in using a joystick and provide a proof of income of at least 7000 zloty per month for a young family member.

Here's a question: If someone is fiddling with something what skill do they likely have? Here are possible answers to this question: - practice - skill - thief - dexterity - knowledge of music I believe the correct choice is \\"dexterity\\", here's why:","completion":"Dexterity is the most suitable answer among the given options in the context of someone fiddling with something, and there are several reasons that support this choice. Dexterity refers to the ability to skillfully and gracefully use one's hands to perform intricate tasks requiring fine motor skills. Such tasks may include playing a musical instrument, lock-picking, engaging in art or craftsmanship, or even manipulating small objects for various purposes. To elaborate further, let's analyze the other possible choices individually: 1. Practice: While practice is essential for improving and mastering specific skills, it is not an inherent attribute that individuals possess. In this context, practice refers to the act of repeatedly performing a task rather than a skill that someone might have. Therefore, it does not adequately describe the ability of someone who is fiddling with something. 2. Skill: While skill could be an appropriate term in some situations, it is a broad and general term. In the context of someone fiddling with something, the term \\"skill\\" lacks specificity and does not convey the level of detail needed to explain the ability at hand. Dexterity, on the other hand, precisely pinpoints the use of fine motor skills and adroitness in the scenario given. 3. Thief: Although thieves are commonly depicted as skilled and dexterous individuals in pop culture, the act of fiddling with something does not necessarily indicate criminal intent. Therefore, \\"thief\\" would be an inaccurate assumption to make in this case. Dexterity is the more fitting option as it is an inherent skill and does not assume the individual's motive. 4. Knowledge of music: Fiddling with something might not always relate to music, and it is essential not to limit the context only to musical scenarios. While skilled musicians often exhibit great dexterity, particularly when playing stringed instruments like violins and fiddles, the term \\"knowledge of music\\" does not encompass the broader range of possibilities involving dexterity and fine motor skills. It would be an unfair assumption to label someone who is fiddling with something as a musician solely based on their actions. In conclusion, the term \\"dexterity\\" is the most accurate answer among the given choices, as it captures the essence of an individual's abilities to perform intricate tasks with their hands. This term does not limit the context to musicians or thieves and applies to a wide range of situations where skilled manipulation of small objects or intricate tasks is involved. Hence, choosing \\"dexterity\\" is the most logical and encompassing option in this case."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

However, because it's hard to get them to sit still and \\"perform on command,\\" some professional photographers refuse to photograph pets. One way to get an appealing portrait of a cat or dog is to hold a biscuit or treat above the camera. The animal's longing look toward the food will be captured by the camera, but the treat won't appear in the picture because it's out of the camera's range. When you show the picture to your friends afterwards, they'll be impressed by your pet's loving expression. If you are using fast film, you can take some good, quick shots of a pet by simply snapping a picture right after calling its name. You'll get a different expression from your pet using this technique. Depending on your pet's mood, the picture will capture an interested, curious expression or possibly a look of annoyance, especially if you've awakened it from a nap. Taking pictures of zoo animals requires a little more patience. After all, you can't wake up a lion! You may have to wait for a while until the animal does something interesting or moves into a position for you to get a good shot.

(CNN) -- The former head of an Air Force sexual assault prevention program was acquitted Wednesday of an assault charge stemming from an incident in Arlington, Virginia, last spring, his lawyer confirmed to CNN. Lt. Col. Jeffrey Krusinski, 42, was arrested in May and accused of grabbing a woman's buttocks and breasts in a parking lot in Arlington County, not far from the Pentagon. A police report said the unidentified woman fought off her assailant, who appeared intoxicated. Krusinski was initially charged with sexual battery, but prosecutors later changed that charge to assault and battery, according to CNN affiliate WJLA. He was removed from that post after his arrest, which came two days before the","completion":"Pentagon released a report stating that there has been an increase in sexual assault cases in the military. The trial of Krusinski quickly gained national attention, becoming emblematic of the bigger, systemic issue of handling sexual assault cases within the United States military. During the trial, Krusinski maintained his innocence, with his defense team arguing that it was a case of mistaken identity, that the woman had misjudged the situation, and that the defendant was not even at the scene of the crime. The prosecutors, on the other hand, brought forward a number of witnesses who testified against Krusinski, including the victim, several bystanders, and those who had been at the bar with him that night. They also presented surveillance footage that placed Krusinski near the scene. Despite the evidences presented by the prosecution, the twelve-member jury found Lt. Col. Krusinski not guilty of the assault charge. The verdict sparked controversy and outrage among the public, particularly with advocates for the rights of sexual assault victims. Many expressed frustration that Krusinski's acquittal only seemed to further emphasize the pervasive issues relating to sexual assault within the military and the presumed culture of impunity. In response to Krusinski's arrest and the widespread public outcry, the Department of Defense amped up its efforts to address the issue of sexual assault in the military. The Secretary of Defense at that time announced new measures, including requiring a higher level of review and oversight for all sexual assault and harassment cases, as well as increasing resources for victims. Furthermore, the Krusinski case led to several bills being introduced in Congress aiming to modify how sexual assault cases in the military are handled. One such bill proposed to remove these cases from the military chain of command and instead have them handled by independent military prosecutors. Although this specific bill failed to pass, it sparked much-needed dialogue, and other legislative measures were eventually put into place to help reshape the military's approach to sexual assault cases. In the years following Krusinski's acquittal, the Department of Defense continued to implement changes designed to prevent sexual assault and provide better support for victims within the military. This included increasing the number of sexual assault prevention and response personnel and improving education and training programs within the military. While many argue that significant work still must be done to address the issue of sexual assault in the military, Krusinski's case played a pivotal role in highlighting the severity of the problem and stimulating crucial changes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He found that all body cells are not equal in size - some are large and some are small. He labeled the large cells as class A cells. Then he labeled the small cells as class B cells. He is now prepared to find the differences between them. But I can use this background: As a cell grows, its volume increases more quickly than its surface area. If a cell was to get very large, the small surface area would not allow enough nutrients to enter the cell quickly enough for the cell’s needs. This idea is explained in Figure below . However, large cells have a way of dealing with some size challenges. Big cells, such as some white blood cells, often grow more nuclei so that they can supply enough proteins and RNA for the cell’s requirements. Large, metabolically active cells often have lots of cell protrusions, resulting in many folds throughout the membrane. These folds increase the surface area available for transport of materials into or out of the cell. Such cell types are found lining your small intestine, where they absorb nutrients from your food through protrusions called microvilli . What is an answer for this question: Which cell might not have microvilli as a feature, class A or class B? A:","completion":"To answer this question, let's analyze the information provided step by step: 1. Mike is studying biology and has classified cells into two categories: class A (large cells) and class B (small cells). 2. As a cell grows, its volume increases faster than its surface area, which can limit the nutrient intake. 3. Large cells (class A) have ways to deal with size challenges, such as growing more nuclei and having cell protrusions. 4. Cell protrusions, like microvilli, increase the surface area for transport of materials into or out of the cell. 5. Microvilli are found in cells lining the small intestine for nutrient absorption. Given these points, we can conclude that class A cells (large cells) might have microvilli as a feature to help deal with their size-related challenges, such as an increased need for nutrient intake through an expanded surface area. On the other hand, class B cells (small cells) might not have microvilli since they are not as large and, consequently, may not face the same size-related challenges. Therefore, the answer to the question is: class B cells might not have microvilli as a feature."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Wilson was born on November 26, 1895, in East Dorset, Vermont, the son of Emily (nee Griffith) and Gilman Barrows Wilson. He was born at his parents' home and business, the Mount Aeolus Inn and Tavern. His paternal grandfather, William C. Wilson, was also an alcoholic. William C. Wilson decided to stop drinking alcohol immediately after having a \\"religious experience\\" when he was under the influence of psilocybin ( sy-l@-SY-bin) during a \\"soul searching\\" hike on Mount Aeolus. Wilson met his wife Lois Burnham during the summer of 1913, while sailing on Vermont's Emerald Lake; two years later the couple became engaged. He entered Norwich University, but depression and panic attacks forced him to leave during his second semester. The next year he returned, but was soon suspended with a group of students involved in a hazing incident. Because no one would take responsibility, and no one would identify the perpetrators, the entire class was punished. The June 1916 incursion into the U.S. by Pancho Villa resulted in Wilson's class being mobilized as part of the Vermont National Guard and he was reinstated to serve. The following year he was commissioned as an artillery officer. During military training in Massachusetts, the young officers were often invited to dinner by the locals, and Wilson had his first drink, a glass of beer, to little effect. A few weeks later at another dinner party, Wilson drank some Bronx cocktails, and felt at ease with the guests and liberated from his awkward shyness; \\"I had found the elixir of life,\\" he wrote. \\"Even that first evening I got thoroughly drunk, and within the next time or two I passed out completely. But as everyone drank hard, not too much was made of that.\\" Wilson married Lois on January 24, 1918, just before he left to serve in World War I as a 2nd Lieutenant in the Coast Artillery. After his military service, Wilson returned to live with his wife in New York. He failed to graduate from law school because he was too drunk to pick up his diploma. Wilson became a stock speculator and had success traveling the country with his wife, evaluating companies for potential investors. (During these trips Lois had a hidden agenda: she hoped the travel would keep Wilson from drinking.) However, Wilson's constant drinking made business impossible and ruined his reputation. In 1933 Wilson was committed to the Charles B. Towns Hospital for Drug and Alcohol Addictions in New York City four times under the care of Dr. William D. Silkworth. Silkworth's theory was that alcoholism was a matter of both physical and mental control: a craving, the manifestation of a physical allergy (the physical inability to stop drinking once started) and an obsession of the mind (to take the first drink). Wilson gained hope from Silkworth's assertion that alcoholism was a medical condition rather than a moral failing, but even that knowledge could not help him. He was eventually told that he would either die from his alcoholism or have to be locked up permanently due to Wernicke encephalopathy (commonly referred to as \\"wet brain\\").

Please answer the following question: Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: Nancy Weston (Amy Farrell), a reporter for The Globe, approaches Abraham Gentry (Frank Kress), an obnoxious private investigator, and offers him 25,000 on behalf of The Globe to investigate the brutal murder of stripper Suzie Cream Puff (Jackie Kroeger). She sweetens the deal with a 25,000 bonus for solving the case. Of course this comes contingent that The Globe gets the exclusive story. Gentry takes the case and begins the investigation of the murder with Weston in tow. When at the club, Gentry encounters a waitress, Marlene (Hedda Lubin), whose obnoxiousness rivals his. He gets through her to speak to another stripper and gets his first suspect, Joseph Carter. Soon, another stripper, Candy Cane, gets murdered and Gentry expands his suspect list to Grout (Ray Sager), an unstable veteran who takes pride in crushing the heads of corpses he found when on the battlefields of Vietnam. He relieves tension by drawing faces on squashes and tomatoes and then crushing them with his bare hands. Gentry also suspects the leader of a radical feminist group that riots in the strip club, carrying banners with catchy phrases like \\"Lewd is Crude\\", \\"Quit with Tit\\" and \\"Women Right On!\\". Pickles, another stripper, is murdered and has her buttocks mutilated with a meat tenderizer hammer before having it salt and peppered. A badge with \\"Women Right On!\\" is found at the scene. Meanwhile, Gentry buys Weston many drinks to keep her drunk and out of his way. During one of Weston's drunken episodes she admits she's attracted to Gentry. Gentry ignores this and concentrates on the case. His investigation takes him to the owner of the strip clubs in town, Mr. Marzdone Mobilie (Henny Youngman). Gentry then coerces Mobilie into holding an amateur stripper contest with a 1,000 prize, which also works as the beginning of a plan for Gentry's trap.

The band came to public attention with their performance of \\"Soul Sacrifice\\" at Woodstock in 1969. This exposure helped propel their first album, also named Santana, into a hit, followed in the next two years by Abraxas and Santana III. Lineup changes were common. The follow-up to Supernatural came three years later and was highly anticipated by international media and fans alike. On October 22, 2002, Shaman was released worldwide. Although it initially sold briskly (298,973 copies in the US in its first week) and debuted at number 1 on the Billboard 200, the album's appeal quickly wore off and it soon slid down the charts. Despite this, it went on to sell 2x platinum in the US, and achieved platinum status in several other countries including Australia. The first single released from the album, \\"The Game of Love\\", which featured vocals from Michelle Branch, debuted at number 5 on the Hot 100. The album's next four singles failed to chart in most countries, but the final single, \\"Why Don't You & I\\", featuring the vocals of Alex Band, reached number 8 on the Hot 100. Musically, the album was a return to a more conventional sound for the group, with a mainly Latin rock-based sound. With their renewed appeal worn off, another three-year wait saw the release of 2005's All That I Am. The album debuted at number 2 on the Billboard 200 but fared worse internationally, and quickly lost appeal. The album, a continuation of the Latin-rock influenced sound of Shaman, achieved gold certification in the US. A five-year break from recording saw the release of another studio album, 2010's Guitar Heaven. Musically it was a drastic change for the band, with a far heavier sound at its core and strong heavy metal influences. It debuted at number 5 on the Billboard 200 but marked another decline for the band, failing to achieve gold status. In 2012 the group released Shape Shifter, which returned to the conventional Latin rock sound and was completely album-oriented, as no singles were released from it. It debuted at number 16 on the Billboard 200.

Researchers found that over an average of 12 weeks, people having a highprotein diet lost about 1.8 extra pounds, and more body fat, than those having a standard-protein diet. Wycherley from the University of South\\" Australia in Adelaide, the lead author on the study says it's possible that the body may spend more energy and bum more calories while dealing with protein, compared to carbohydrates. Another explanation for the link his team observed is that eating protein helps preserve muscle mass and muscle mass bums more calories, even when the body is resting, than other types of mass. He says people in the studies tend to get protein from a variety of animal and vegetable sources. Vegetable sources of protein include beans. It is not obvious why a higher protein-to-carbohydrate ratio might help people lose more pounds----and one obesity researcher not involved in the new analysis questioned whether the trials were strong enough to make that conclusion. \\"The studies are generally far too short to tell effect,\\" Dr. James Levine from the Mayo Clinic in Scottsdale, Arizona, told Reuters Health in an e-mail.

The most common type of situation in which you’d need to file an insurance claim is when your car is involved in an auto accident. However, you should also file a claim if your car is vandalized or stolen. The explanation and fine print of car insurance policies appear to be long-winded and often seem extremely complicated. The best thing to do before proceeding too deeply into the insurance claims process is to read and re-read your policy. You’ll then understand the intricacies of what your own personal responsibility is in the event of an accident or other automotive mishap, and what your insurance company's responsibility is in such an incident. You might need to pay a deductible -- a fee to help cover the costs of the accident -- if you’re found to be at fault. If you’re not at fault, your insurance company might be able to help you recover the deductible from the driver who is at fault. Your insurance company’s number should be on the front of your insurance card. You might also be able to find it among your insurance policy documents or on the insurance company’s website. Contact the insurance company as soon as possible so you can find out what their specific claims process entails.

History of India Kadamba (345 – 525 CE) was an ancient royal dynasty of Karnataka, India that ruled northern Karnataka and the Konkan from Banavasi in present-day Uttara Kannada district. At the peak of their power under King Kakushtavarma, the Kadambas of Banavasi ruled large parts of modern Karnataka state. The dynasty was founded by Mayurasharma in 345 CE which at later times showed the potential of developing into imperial proportions, an indication to which is provided by the titles and epithets assumed by its rulers. King Mayurasharma defeated the armies of Pallavas of Kanchi possibly with help of some native tribes. The Kadamba fame reached its peak during the rule of Kakusthavarma, a notable ruler with whom even the kings of Gupta Dynasty of northern India cultivated marital alliances. The Kadambas were contemporaries of the Western Ganga Dynasty and together they formed the earliest native kingdoms to rule the land with absolute autonomy. The dynasty later continued to rule as a feudatory of larger Kannada empires, the Chalukya and the Rashtrakuta empires, for over five hundred years during which time they branched into minor dynasties known as the Kadambas of Goa, Kadambas of Halasi and Kadambas of Hangal.

Brett was surprised by the existence of bonsai trees.; (b). Benjamin was surprised by the existence of bonsai trees.;","completion":"Brett traveled to few countries while Benjamin was cosmopolitan, so it is more likely that (a) Brett was surprised by the existence of bonsai trees. The contrast between Brett and Benjamin indicates that Benjamin has been exposed to a wider range of cultures and experiences than Brett, due to his cosmopolitan nature. This distinction creates a probability that Benjamin has already encountered the concept of bonsai trees and is therefore not as likely to be surprised by their existence. Bonsai is an ancient Japanese art form that focuses on cultivating and nurturing small trees in containers, allowing the aesthetic beauty and essence of a natural landscape to be captured within a small space. Bonsai is an integral part of Japanese culture and has been practiced for over a thousand years. Due to its age and popularity within the country, it is logical to assume that someone with a cosmopolitan background like Benjamin would have come across this art form during his travels or studies. On the other hand, Brett, who has only traveled to a few countries and has seemingly been subject to a less diverse range of cultural experiences, would be more likely to encounter new concepts and ideas that would surprise him. In this particular case, Brett's limited exposure might not have prepared him for the intricacies and beauty of bonsai trees, leading him to be amazed by their existence. Furthermore, Benjamin's cosmopolitan background would imply a sophisticated and discerning taste, making it more probable that he would be aware of and appreciate the subtle nuances of bonsai cultivation. As a cosmopolitan individual, Benjamin would have interacted with various people from different countries and absorbed a wealth of knowledge about world cultures. It is less likely that traditional cultural practices like bonsai would be unfamiliar to him. In conclusion, considering Brett's limited travels and Benjamin's cosmopolitan background, it can reasonably be assumed that Brett would be more likely to be surprised by the existence of bonsai trees. This highlights the importance of exposure to different cultures and traditions, as it broadens an individual's understanding of the world and contributes to greater personal growth and development."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Following their 2004 reunion, the Pixies felt that recording a new song would \\"break the ice\\" between band members after their acrimonious split in 1993. As the band were announcing dates for their reunion world tour, DreamWorks contacted manager Ken Goes to enquire whether they would be interested in recording a song for the title sequence of Shrek 2. The band agreed, and frontman Black Francis and Deal began composing riffs for a song aimed at children. Deal had been experimenting with a chord progression for a while, and since her band The Breeders were then inactive, she decided to donate her new composition to the Pixies. The Pixies chose Deal's riff, as it was a \\"poppier, more kid-friendly thing,\\" and Francis agreed to let her sing lead vocals and write the new song; significantly, Francis is relegated to backing vocals on the track. Francis' move was meant to warm the previously cold relations between the two—in the previous two Pixies studio albums, Bossanova (1990) and Trompe le Monde (1991), Francis, the band's principal songwriter, had not let Deal contribute any songs or sing lead vocals. This became one of the reasons for the Pixies' 1993 split. However, the two appeared at the time to have resolved their differences: Francis praised \\"Bam Thwok,\\" as \\"a really good song.\\" despite joking in interviews about how he planned to remove as many of her compositions as possible from a hypothetical new album. However, Deal eventually left the band in June 2013, before the release of the band's next album, Indie Cindy.

The use of torture has been condemned by the United Nations.

In both instances, it represents the act of utilizing or employing something, specifically an object or an action, for a particular purpose or in a particular context. In the first sentence, \\"The use of torture has been condemned by the United Nations,\\" the word \\"use\\" refers to the act of employing torture as a method or practice. The context reveals that the United Nations has condemned this specific use, meaning that they disapprove of employing torture for any reason. In the second sentence, \\"He warned against the use of narcotic drugs,\\" the word \\"use\\" once again refers to the act of utilizing or employing something, in this case, narcotic drugs. The person is warning against engaging in the consumption or application of narcotic drugs, which may have potential negative consequences or be a risky behavior. In both sentences, the word \\"use\\" plays a crucial role in illustrating the idea that utilizing or employing the mentioned actions (torture and narcotic drugs) is not advocated by the respective parties (the United Nations and the individual who provides a warning). By employing the word \\"use\\" in these contexts, the sentences showcase that the main focus is not necessarily on the objects themselves (torture or narcotic drugs), but rather the manner in which they are being employed and their potential consequences. Additionally, both sentences implicitly advocate for alternatives to the harmful acts mentioned, further highlighting the shared implication of the word \\"use\\" in these two instances."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It is a novel that is probably more talked about than read. People think: \\"It's such a big book! It has such a serious theme!\\" The feeling that they are going to be taught a long, hard lesson often puts readers off. But really, War and Peace (1869), which tells the stories of five upper-class families in Russia at the time of the 1812 French invasion, is not to be missed. Reading this novel is one of those once-in-a-lifetime experiences, like climbing the Great Wall: You will regret it if you do not try. Earlier this month, USA Today reported that a six-episode War and Peace miniseries produced by the BBC would air next year. With a complex plot and so many characters, readers unfamiliar with the work might be most interested in the characters from the financially-troubled Rostov family of Moscow. Count Rostov has four teenage children. Natasha is in love with Boris Drubetskoy, who is about to become an army officer. Nikolai Ilyich loves the poor Sonya, a ward of the family, but his family is not happy with their relationship. The proud Vera is about to start a happy marriage with a German-Russian officer. The youngest Rostov is the 9-year-old Petya, who, like his brother Nikolai, has his heart set on fighting for his country. The lives of all are about to be changed by the upcoming great war that involves many other major characters of War and Peace, such as Prince Andrei, who goes into a military career partly in order to get away from his unhappy marriage to the socialite Lise. The novel has a great reputation among many kinds of writers and millions of readers. US writer Ernest Hemingway wrote: \\"I don't know anybody who could write about war better than Tolstoy did.\\" A comment by the great 20th-century Russian short-story writer Isaak Babel shows the rich sense of history that Tolstoy's work conveys. \\"If the world itself could write, it would write like Tolstoy,\\" Babel commented. Why do people prefer to talk about the novel rather than read it? A) The story is directly related to their daily life. B) The story is too long and has too serious a theme.

It was selected in the second round of the WNBA draft 2012 ( 20th overall ) by Minnesota Lynx .","completion":"Although both sentences revolve around the selection process that took place in the 2012 WNBA Draft and the Minnesota Lynx making the selection, the two sentences have minor differences in their structure and meaning. Let's analyze each of them. 1. She was selected in the 20th round of the 2012 WNBA Draft (second total) by Minnesota Lynx. In this sentence, the main focus is on the 20th round of the draft. It is clear that the person being referred to (presumably a female player) was selected during the 20th round. However, there is a bit of confusion with the inclusion of \\"second total\\" in parentheses. This part seems to suggest that she was the second overall pick in the entire draft, but that does not seem to fit coherently with the \\"20th round of the 2012 WNBA Draft\\" premise. The possible meanings could be: - She was the second overall pick made by Minnesota Lynx. - There is an error in the sentence, and it should actually refer to the second round and not the 20th round. 2. It was selected in the second round of the WNBA draft 2012 (20th overall) by Minnesota Lynx. In this sentence, the focus is on the second round of the 2012 WNBA draft. The person being referred to is selected in the second round, and it is clear that they were the 20th overall pick in the draft. However, the sentence uses the pronoun \\"it\\" instead of \\"she,\\" which is ambiguous and somewhat dehumanizing when referring to a person (assuming it is a player in this case). This might be a typing error or simply an oversight on the part of the author. In conclusion, the sentences do not mean precisely the same thing. The first sentence seems to have some inconsistencies with the round and overall pick information, and the second sentence contains an inappropriate pronoun. If we were to rewrite both sentences to make them more accurate, they might look like this: 1. She was selected in the second round of the 2012 WNBA Draft (20th overall) by Minnesota Lynx. 2. She was selected in the second round of the WNBA draft 2012 (20th overall) by Minnesota Lynx. The corrected sentences now express the same meaning: a female player was selected during the second round of the 2012 WNBA Draft as the 20th overall pick by the Minnesota Lynx."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This space for an informal exchange of ideas provides an opportunity to be transparent about the challenges repositories face when managing and processing architecture holdings, as well as encourages investigation and experimentation into ways new technologies may help to solve accessibility issues, such as improved interaction with digitized collections via the IIIF protocol or 3D-scanned facsimile models and virtual walk-throughs. October 27 marked the third meeting of CalArchNet, held at the Palm Springs Art Museum, Architecture and Design Center, with representatives from 13 institutions in attendance. Topics discussed included historic site preservation research methodology, leveraging statewide resources to enhance discovery of collections, security considerations, GIS mapping technologies, and the use of linked open data to make connections between collections. The day concluded with a curator-led tour of the exhibition Albert Frey and Lina Bo Bardi: A Search for Living Architecture. If you’re an archivist, librarian, or curator working with architecture...

Milan also served as the capital of the western empire in the 4th century. In the St Aquilinus Chapel of the Basilica of San Lorenzo, mosaics executed in the late 4th and early 5th centuries depict Christ with the Apostles and the Abduction of Elijah; these mosaics are outstanding for their bright colors, naturalism and adherence to the classical canons of order and proportion. The surviving apse mosaic of the Basilica of Sant'Ambrogio, which shows Christ enthroned between Saint Gervasius and Saint Protasius and angels before a golden background date back to the 5th and to the 8th century, although it was restored many times later.

Summarize this article: Traditionally, biryani is cooked in an Indian cooking pot called a biryani handi, but any thick bottom pot will work just fine. A non-stick pot/handi works best. Spread the chicken so each piece of chicken is touching the bottom and/or sides of the pot. This will help ensure that each piece of chicken gets cooked thoroughly. The rice that you cooked earlier is now ready to be added to the chicken. Create a layer of rice, adding about half of the rice on top of the chicken. With your perforated spoon, pack the rice firmly into the pot. It is okay if some water comes along with the rice, it will help things cook with the steam. On top of the rice, sprinkle on fried onions(approximately 2 tbsp), chopped coriander leaves(approximately 1tbsp), and mint leaves (approximately 8-10). You can also sprinkle on cashew or golden raisins, but these are optional. This is the second, and final layer of rice you will be adding to the biryani. Once the rest of the rest is spread evenly, add on the rest of the brown onions (approximately 1 tbsp), a little bit more coriander leaves (approximately 1/2 tbsp), mint leaves (3-5), the saffron milk mixture, and approximately 6 tbsp of ghee. An alternative and optional topping is adding some rose water. Just add about 1/2 a capful, and sprinkle it over the top of the biryani. Roll the chapati dough into long pieces and put the dough on the edges of the pot's upside down lid. You add the chapati dough to the edges of the lid, so when you turn the lid right side up, the dough seals the pot so the chicken and rice can steam cook together. Press lightly but firmly to make sure the lid is secure and tight. You can add a weight to the lid to ensure that it stays sealed, but usually if you use the dough, it is sealed good enough. Keep the biryani cooking for about 5-10 on high flame. Then, take the pot off the flame, put a cooking plate on the flame, and place the pot back on the flame with the cooking plate. This is the safest method to cook the biryani and make sure the biryani doesn't burn because of the direct contact with the heat. After about 35 switch off the flame, but don't open the biryani yet. Let the biryani sit for another 10 minutes. The dough will be a little cooked and hardened, but crack through it, and take of the top to check the biryani. A lot of steam will come out so be careful not to burn yourself. Slowly stick a large spoon on the inside side of the hand and lift to get the bottom layers of the rice out. Then, as you work your way down, bring up a piece of chicken. The pieces of chicken should have a brown coloring. Usually, biryani is eaten with your hands, and is served with raita, a cold, refreshing, yogurt condiment.","completion":"This article tells about how to cook a yummy dish called biryani.

The pair checks up on Estella Rios, the boy's pregnant, underage girlfriend. They don't agree on what should be done about her and later Father Lind finds out from Mrs. Rios that Pamela took Estalla to probably get an abortion.

Children who are suffering from an overload of art and architecture will enjoy the caves with their stalactites and stalagmites, as well as the exhibits and zoo at Le Thot. Does it follow that \\"The caves are beautiful, especially at night.\\"?","completion":"To determine if the statement \\"The caves are beautiful, especially at night.\\" follows from the provided description, let's evaluate each part of the statement step-by-step. Step 1: Assess the statement's relevance to the description The statement is related to the caves mentioned in the description, so it is relevant in that context. Step 2: Analyze the claim that the caves are beautiful The description does not explicitly mention the beauty of the caves but emphasizes the enjoyment children will get from visiting them, especially after being exposed to a lot of art and architecture. One could infer that the caves are beautiful from the presence of stalactites and stalagmites, which are often considered to be visually appealing. However, this assumption is not explicitly stated in the description. Step 3: Examine the assertion that the caves are especially beautiful at night The description does not mention anything about the visual appeal of the caves at night. Therefore, this part of the statement doesn't follow from the provided description. Conclusion: While it is possible to infer that the caves are beautiful due to the presence of stalactites and stalagmites, there is no evidence to support the statement that they are especially beautiful at night. Thus, the statement \\"The caves are beautiful, especially at night.\\" does not directly follow from the provided description."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: My mother-in-law, Dorothy, is showing me the red notebook that's almost as precious to her as my husband's baby pictures. Inside the notebook is a list of the books she has read since 2007. For some people waking up in the middle of the night is a terrible thing. But for my mother-in-law, that time is a gift. At 87, she is getting the education she never had by working her way through great literature. She has now read close to 100 books, including every single novel by Anthony Trollope, Charles Dickens, Jane Austen, Edith Wharton, Henry James and Thomas Mann. My mother-in-law discusses her passion with the enthusiasm of a young girl, although she can also be a very tough critic, writing \\"VG' for \\" very good\\" in the margins next to her favorites. So far, only a handful of books have received the top prize. Born in Ridgefield, Conn, Dorothy was the youngest daughter of an Italian gardener. She taught herself English by reading The New York Times. Eager to come to Manhattan, she became a nurse, married a dentist and spent the next several decades keeping the house and raising a family. In her later years, she put her nursing skills to good use by taking care of my father-in-law, who had lung cancer. There were many trips to the emergency room in the middle of the night and then a long hospital stay. She stayed awake to watch over him for 15 hours a day. Always a light sleeper, she developed sleeplessness as a result of the stress. It worsened after he died. Deeply sad and lonely for the first time in her life, she began waking up around 2am. Julian and Sylvia, the elderly couple next door suggest she read literature. And so Julian, a great lover of literature, became her \\"professor\\", providing books from his large library. Suddenly turned onto a world of amazing characters. Question: Why is Dorothy considered a tough critic? Options: A: Because no books are inspiring enough in her eyes. B: Because only a few books are thought highly of by her. C: Because she only reads books by famous writers. D: Because she finds fault with every book she reads.

Given the question: Depleted soils can be protected from soil erosion by groundcover plants such as naturally growing grasses in agroforestry systems. These help to stabilise the soil as they increase cover compared to short-cycle cropping systems. Soil cover is a crucial factor in preventing erosion. Cleaner water through reduced nutrient and soil surface runoff can be a further advantage of agroforestry. The runoff can be reduced by decreasing its velocity and increasing infiltration into the soil. Compared to row-cropped fields nutrient uptake can be higher and reduce nutrient loss into streams.Further advantages concerning plant growth: Gary and Joe are two farmers. Joe's farm has a depleted soil, while Gary started agroforestry a few years back, and grows cover crops. Which farmer didn't reduce nutrient runoff from his farm? The answer is:","completion":"Joe is the farmer who didn't reduce nutrient runoff from his farm. Joe's farm has depleted soil, and he has not implemented agroforestry practices or grown cover crops.

Colors are typically broadcast using a (10-bits per channel) YUV color space but, depending on the underlying image generating technologies of the receiver, are then subsequently converted to a RGB color space using standardized algorithms. When transmitted directly through the Internet, the colors are typically pre-converted to 8-bit RGB channels for additional storage savings with the assumption that it will only be viewed only on a (sRGB) computer screen. As an added benefit to the original broadcasters, the losses of the pre-conversion essentially make these files unsuitable for professional TV re-broadcasting. What assumption is made with colors being transmitted over the internet?","completion":"The assumption made with colors being transmitted over the internet is that the content will primarily be viewed on a standard RGB (sRGB) computer screen. This assumption leads to a pre-conversion of colors from the original 10-bit YUV color space used in HDTV broadcasting to a reduced 8-bit RGB color space. The pre-conversion process results in additional storage savings, allowing for easier transmission and streaming over the internet. However, it should be noted that this pre-conversion could lead to some loss of color information, which may potentially reduce the overall color quality when compared to the original broadcast signal. As a consequence, these pre-converted files might be considered unsuitable for professional TV re-broadcasting because of their reduced color quality and depth. Nevertheless, this color pre-conversion is generally accepted for internet-based transmissions, given that most users view content on sRGB computer screens which have lower display capabilities compared to professional HDTV equipment."},{"prompt":"The exercise is to decide whether the question accepts the proposed suggestion as a correct answer.

Given the question: SEOUL — Arms control experts estimate that the dismantlement of North Korea’s nuclear program could take a decade to complete, and cost 20 billion, if a nuclear agreement is reached between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un when they meet in Singapore on June 12. “The hard work has not yet begun, and it is gong to take sustained energy on the part of the United States, South Korea, Japan, China and North Korea. It’s going to be a multiyear long process,” said Daryl Kimball, the executive director of the Arms Control Association in Washington. President Trump has said he expects a \\"very positive result\\" from the North Korea nuclear summit, but he also said it will likely be the beginning of a process to resolve differences over the extent of the North’s denuclearization, and the specifics regarding what sanctions relief, economic aid and security guarantees would be offered in return. U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said on Sunday that North Korea would only receive sanctions relief after it takes \\"verifiable and irreversible steps to denuclearization.\\" This position aligns closer to the Kim government’s stance that denuclearization measures and concessions be matched action for action. And it backs away from demands made by some in the president’s national security team that Pyongyang quickly and unilaterally dismantle all its weapons of mass destruction before any concessions would be offered. North Korea is estimated to have 20 to 80 nuclear warheads, both known and covert nuclear research and processing sites, and thousands of ballistic missiles that can be launched from mobile vehicles, and submarine based launchers have been tested in recent years. With such an extensive nuclear arsenal it could cost 20 billion to achieve the U.S. goal of complete, irreversible, and verifiable nuclear dismantlement (CVID), according to a recent study conducted by Kwon Hyuk-chul, a Kookmin University professor of security strategy.

When the universe was young, there was only gas and dust. From this gas and dust, everything we now see was made. How were stars and planets created from just gas and dust? The answer is gravity. The same gravity that holds you down on Earth. The same force that causes your pencil to roll off your desk. The same force that causes it to fall to the floor. The invisible force of gravity caused dust and gas particles to be pulled together. This force is what formed all the objects in our solar system. This force formed the smallest moons.

They were the supposed sons of Rhea Silvia, who was a Vestal Virgin, and the god Mars. According to the story, after being abandoned by their parents, they were rescued by a she-wolf, who nursed and cared for them until they were found by a shepherd named Faustulus. The she-wolf, known as Lupa, had saved the infants by providing them with nourishment, which was her own milk. Legend has it that when the twins were left to die in a basket along the Tiber River, it was Lupa who found them and began to nurse them, allowing the infants to grow strong and eventually fulfill their destinies. The story of Romulus and Remus, including their suckling by a she-wolf, is an integral part of Roman mythology and culture. The myth symbolizes the relationship between the city of Rome and its people, with the she-wolf often representing the strength, resilience, and nurturing spirit of Rome.

Everything is banned by the Great Firewall,\\" says Sherman So, co-author of \\"Red Wired: China's Internet Revolution.\\" Sherman So, author of \\"Red Wired,\\" talks about China's online habits and Internet culture. With 338 million Internet users in June 2009, according to the China Internet Network Information Center (CNNIC), China is no longer a niche market of the online industry. Chinese is the second most common language on the Internet, according to The Economist, and quickly gaining ground on English. As the former technology writer for Hong Kong's daily English-language newspaper, South China Morning Post, So has been following closely China's exponential Internet developments over the past decade. Another recurring factor of success among Chinese Internet start-ups is their founders' extensive experience working in","completion":"Silicon Valley before returning to their homeland. These founders bring the technological progress they’ve witnessed overseas, along with mindset and strategies that often draw heavily from the Silicon Valley ethos. This influence is reflected in many of the more successful Chinese start-ups, many of which have founders with extensive work histories within institutions like Google, Apple, Facebook, and Microsoft. Their collective experience in running highly successful tech companies has significantly influenced the trajectory of China's internet revolution. The exported Silicon Valley experience has not only brought about a technological leap, it has also triggered cultural changes among Chinese internet users and resulted in new behavioral trends. The start-ups tapping into this are effectively translating this knowledge into their business strategies, creating unique value propositions catered specifically for the Chinese market. Many of these entrepreneurs studied and worked in the United States, where they gained first-hand knowledge about successful business practices, user experience design, and advanced technology-implementing strategies. Let's look at a few examples. Firstly, Robin Li, the co-founder of Baidu, China's largest search engine. Before establishing Baidu, Li worked for two Silicon Valley companies: IDD Information & Dow Jones. Through his experience, he got to understand how search engines work and saw the potential for this type of service in China. With this knowledge, he was able to successfully tailor Baidu's search engine algorithms to the unique needs of Chinese internet users, successfully outperforming even Google in the local market. Another key figure is Pony Ma, founder and CEO of Tencent Holdings Limited, one of the largest internet companies in China. Before founding Tencent, Ma also worked in the technology sector in Silicon Valley. Using his experience, he managed to develop one of China's most popular social messaging apps, WeChat, which has become integral in the lives of millions of Chinese daily. Many other founders with similar backgrounds are visible within the landscape of Chinese tech start-ups, from the ride-hailing app Didi Chuxing's founder Cheng Wei to JD.com's Richard Liu Qiangdong. Coupled with China's robust manufacturing capabilities and the government's aggressive push for the development of advanced technologies, Silicon Valley-trained professionals heading Chinese start-ups have managed to spearhead a digital revolution, transforming China from a country known for Internet censorship to a global technological innovator in the online industry. These knowledgeable and highly-trained founders have had a profound influence on the strategies and success of numerous Chinese Internet start-ups. Their extensive experience in Silicon Valley, the global tech hub, has provided them with a unique perspective on tech innovation and entrepreneurial strategy that they bring back to China and leverage to tailor their internet services to the local needs and trends. This has helped to mobilize an internet revolution in China that is high-speed, dynamic, and highly-responsive to user demands."},{"prompt":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

Please answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What year did the republic that experienced famine and political repression population levels restore to pre-World War II levels? A part of Belarus under Russian rule emerged as the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic (Byelorussian SSR) in 1919. Soon thereafter it merged to form the Lithuanian-Byelorussian SSR. The contested lands were divided between Poland and the Soviet Union after the war ended in 1921, and the Byelorussian SSR became a founding member of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics in 1922. The western part of modern Belarus remained part of Poland.In the 1920s and 1930s, Soviet agricultural and economic policies, including collectivization and five-year plans for the national economy, led to famine and political repression. In 1939, Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union invaded and occupied Poland, marking the beginning of World War II. The Soviets invaded and annexed much of eastern Poland, which had been part of the country since the Peace of Riga two decades earlier. Much of the northern section of this area was added to the Byelorussian SSR, and now constitutes West Belarus. The Soviet-controlled Byelorussian People's Council officially took control of the territories, whose populations consisted of a mixture of Poles, Ukrainians, Belarusians and Jews, on 28 October 1939 in Białystok. Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union in 1941. The Brest Fortress, which had been annexed in 1939, at this time was subjected to one of the most destructive onslaughts that happened during the war. Statistically, the Byelorussian SSR was the hardest-hit Soviet republic in World War II; it remained in Nazi hands until 1944. During that time, Germany destroyed 209 out of 290 cities in the republic, 85% of the republic's industry, and more than one million buildings. The Nazi Generalplan Ost called for the extermination, expulsion or enslavement of most or all Belarusians for the purpose of providing more living space in the East for Germans.Casualties were estimated to be between 2 and 3 million (about a quarter to one-third of the total population), while the Jewish population of Belarus was devastated during the Holocaust and never...

The sessions were interrupted by the escalating disagreement between Waters and Pink Floyd over who had the rights to the Pink Floyd name. O'Rourke, believing that his contract with Waters had been terminated illegally, sued Waters for £25,000 of back-commission. In a late-1986 board meeting of Pink Floyd Music Ltd (Pink Floyd's clearing house for all financial transactions since 1973), Waters learnt that a bank account had been opened to deal exclusively with all monies related to \\"the new Pink Floyd project\\". He immediately applied to the High Court to prevent the Pink Floyd name from being used again, but his lawyers discovered that the partnership had never been formally confirmed. Waters returned to the High Court in an attempt to gain a veto over further use of the band's name. Gilmour's team responded by issuing a press release affirming that Pink Floyd would continue to exist; however, Gilmour told a Sunday Times reporter: \\"Roger is a dog in the manger and I'm going to fight him, no one else has claimed Pink Floyd was entirely them. Anybody who does is extremely arrogant.\\"Waters twice visited Astoria, and with his wife had a meeting in August 1986 with Ezrin; Ezrin later suggested that he was being \\"checked out\\".

What are the most important words in the following sentence: A hot dog and french fries served in a car tray","completion":"The most important words in the sentence \\"A hot dog and french fries served in a car tray\\" are: 1. Hot dog: This is a key noun in the sentence, as it identifies the main food item being discussed. A hot dog is a common and popular food item consisting of a sausage (usually made from a mixture of meat, such as pork or beef) that is cooked and placed inside a sliced bun. Hot dogs are often garnished with various condiments, such as mustard, ketchup, onions, mayonnaise, relish, or sauerkraut, which add flavor and depth to the dish. This classic American fast food is often associated with street vendors, picnics, and sporting events. 2. French fries: This is another important noun in the sentence as it identifies the second food item being discussed. French fries are a popular snack made by cutting potatoes into long, thin strips, deep-frying them until they're crispy, and then seasoning them with salt. While the name suggests that this food originated in France, it's widely believed that french fries were actually first created in Belgium. Often served as a side dish with various types of sandwiches, burgers, and other fast-food items, french fries are generally consumed with ketchup or mayonnaise, although they can also be enjoyed with a variety of other toppings and condiments. 3. Served: This verb is crucial in the sentence, as it indicates the action and intent to provide the hot dog and french fries. The word implies that someone is giving or presenting the food items to the recipient, whether it be at a restaurant, a food stall, or any other setting. \\"Served\\" sets the scene and allows the reader to understand better the context in which the hot dog and french fries are being provided. 4. Car tray: This compound noun is essential, as it specifies the location or setting where the food items (hot dog and french fries) are being served. A car tray, usually found in drive-in theaters or diners, is a convenient device that attaches to a car's door or window and serves as a small table for holding food and drinks. This allows customers to enjoy their meals comfortably in their vehicle without the need for a traditional restaurant table. The mention of the car tray helps evoke an atmosphere of convenience, casual dining, and a nostalgic ambiance, as drive-ins and car trays were widespread in the mid-20th century. In summary, the most important words in the sentence are \\"hot dog,\\" \\"french fries,\\" \\"served,\\" and \\"car tray,\\" as they form the foundation of the scene and convey the crucial information about the food items being discussed and the context in which they're being served."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

But there is little doubt that the current food environment in Western countries – heavy in highly processed salty, sugary, and fatty food – has a big role to play. Most of the salt eaten in our diet has been added to food in the manufacturing process. This is in contrast to the small amount of salt naturally present in most foods or what is added at the table or at home in cooking. Salt can be a desirable taste, increasing the palatability of foods in addition to helping preserve it; that’s why it is commonly added in processed foods. Combining salt and fat together is thought to be a potent combination in helping to promote passive over-consumption foods. Just think of how moreish salty chips can be. Having a greater liking for salty and fatty foods is associated with eating more kilojoules overall, uncontrolled eating, and overweight in children. This link between overconsumption of food and its degree of saltiness is considered stronger than having a liking for sweet and fatty foods. Teasing out further how salt may influence the over-consumption of fatty foods, sensory researchers from Deakin University recruited 48 healthy adults to take part in a tasting panel. Over four lunchtime sessions (following on from a standardised breakfast that morning), each person ate a meal of macaroni and cheese where the fat and salt content had been manipulated. The four meal combinations were low-fat/low-salt, low-fat/high-salt, high-fat/low-salt and high-fat/high-salt. Participants were encouraged to eat as much as they wished until feeling full. Eating rate, meal agreeability, and subjective ratings of hunger and fullness were also taken. Salt promotes over-eating Eleven percent more kilojoules were consumed when the meals eaten were high in salt. And this was irrespective of if the fat content was high or low. The fat content of the meal didn’t result in people eating more food by weight, but because of its greater energy density, that meant more kilojoules were eaten. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: After eating foods high in salt most of their lives, how are people most likely to be (statistically speaking): Options: - Fans of macaroni and cheese. - Overweight or obese. - not enough information - University researchers. Answer:","completion":"Based on the information presented in the context, the correct option is: Overweight or obese. This is because the text explains that the Western food environment, which is heavy in highly processed foods full of salt, sugar, and fat, plays a significant role in weight gain. The text mentions that most salt is added during the manufacturing process, increasing the palatability of foods. The combination of salt and fat is said to promote passive over-consumption of foods, resulting in increased overall caloric intake, uncontrolled eating, and overweight, particularly in children. A research study discussed in the text observed that the participants consumed 11% more calories when the meals were high in salt, regardless of fat content. Therefore, people who have been eating high-salt foods most of their lives are most likely to be overweight or obese, statistically speaking. The other options (being fans of macaroni and cheese, being University researchers, or not having enough information) are not directly supported by the text in relation to the long-term effects of high-salt diets."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the background: An electric generator is a device that changes kinetic energy to electrical energy through electromagnetic induction. A simple diagram of an electric generator is shown in Figure below . In a generator, some form of energy is applied to turn a shaft. This causes a coil of wire to rotate between opposite poles of a magnet. Because the coil is rotating in a magnetic field, electric current is generated in the wire. If the diagram in Figure below looks familiar to you, that’s because a generator is an electric motor in reverse. Look back at the electric motor in Figure above . If you were to mechanically turn the shaft of the motor (instead of using electromagnetism to turn it), the motor would generate electricity just like an electric generator. You can learn how to make a very simple electric generator by watching the video at the URL below. Making your own generator will help you understand how a generator works. and the situation: A windmill is used to power a nearby house.

Answer the following question: Will the amount of energy generated by the windmill increase or decrease if it is turning faster than normal? Answer:","completion":"The amount of energy generated by the windmill will increase if it is turning faster than normal. Step 1: Understand that the windmill's main function is to convert wind energy (kinetic energy) into mechanical energy by rotating its blades due to the wind force. Step 2: The mechanical energy generated by the rotating blades is then used to turn the shaft of an electric generator. Step 3: In the electric generator, the rotating shaft causes the coil of wire to rotate between the opposite poles of a magnet, generating electric current in the wire through electromagnetic induction. Step 4: When the windmill turns faster than normal due to strong winds or storms, this increases the windmill's mechanical energy output as more kinetic energy is being converted into mechanical energy. Step 5: More mechanical energy then results in the generator's rotating shaft and coil of wire spinning faster, which in turn generates more electric current. Step 6: As a result, more electric current is generated when the windmill turns faster, leading to an increase in the amount of energy generated by the windmill. In conclusion, the energy generated by the windmill will increase if it is turning faster than normal due to the greater mechanical energy derived from the faster rotation of the blades, which subsequently boosts electric current generation in the electric generator."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article that answers the following question: How many percent of people were not African American?","completion":"Title: How Many Percent of People Were Not African-American? Hello little friend! Today, we are going to talk about what percentage of people are not African-American. Firstly, let's learn what African-American means. African-Americans are people whose ancestors come from Africa, and they live in the United States of America. Now, we want to find out how many people in the world are not belonging to this group. To do this, let's imagine all the people living on Earth as a big cake! Yummy, right? Now imagine that a small slice of this cake represents the African-American people. To know how many people are not African-American, we have to look at the rest of the cake, which includes everybody else. According to some information from the big people who study these things, about 13 percent of the population in the United States are African-American. But remember, we want to find out the percentage for the whole world, not just the United States. In the whole wide world, there are around 7.9 billion people. Out of these, around 44 million are African-American. So, the African-American people make up a very small slice of our big cake, which is only about 0.56 percent. That's just a little more than half a piece out of 100 pieces of cake! Now, we can find out how many people are not African-American. To do that, we take the entire cake, which represents 100 percent, and remove the small slice for African-American people. So, 100 percent minus 0.56 percent equals 99.44 percent. And there you go! Around 99.44 percent of people in the world are not African-American. That means that, out of 100 people, about 99 of them will not be African-American, and only a little more than half a person will be African-American. But remember, this is just an estimation, as the population is constantly changing and growing every day. I hope this helps you to understand the percentage of people who are not African-American in the world. The important thing to remember is that people around the world are very diverse, which means we are all different and unique in our own ways!

Theatres usually contain a stage where actors, singers, and other performers of various disciplines will come together to tell a story or express a narrative through their art. The stage may include sets and props, for enhancing the experience and providing a vivid atmosphere for the audience to immerse themselves in. Theatrical performances have been a popular form of entertainment for centuries, originating from ancient Greece. The audiences attending plays or performances would sit in designated seats or spaces, commonly known as the auditorium. The auditorium is allocated for the audience to observe the performance and is designed in a way that aligns the seating arrangement, ensuring each attendee has a clear view of the stage. The seats within a theatre are usually arranged in rows, sometimes with additional structures such as balconies, boxes, or gallery areas to accommodate larger audiences. To ensure that the audience can fully appreciate the production, the acoustics and lighting are specifically tailored to enhance and amplify both the performance and the theatre-going experience. The other suggestions mentioned, such as the show, cinema, bench, and Martorell, are not as accurate or relevant responses for the context provided in the question. A show is the actual performance or production being put on, as opposed to the location where it takes place. A cinema, while a venue for entertainment, is specific to showing movies or films and not plays. A bench is a seating structure, but it doesn't accurately represent the space where a play would occur.

The victim, 19-year-old Tulasi Shahi, from western Nepal's Dailekh district, was taking part in chhaupadi, a common practice in the west of the country in which women, considered unclean during menstruation, are sequestered for the extent of their periods. It's a ritual that Shahi had likely endured many times before, but on Thursday night, alone on the floor of her uncle's cowshed, the teenager was bitten by a poisonous snake. \\"Twice, on her head and leg,\\" the local district mayor Surya Bahadur Shahi told CNN. Shahi's family members initially attempted to treat her using home remedies, before later taking her to a local health center, which did not stock the anti-venom medicines needed. The monsoon rains had flooded the region's mountainous roads, making the three-hour journey to the nearest hospital all but impossible.

Many communities in Nepal view menstruating women as impure and in some remote areas they are forced to sleep in a hut away from the home during their periods, a practice known as chhaupadi. Tulasi Shahi was bitten twice by a venomous snake and died on Friday morning in western Dailekh district, local mayor Surya Bahadur Shahi said. “She survived for seven hours after the snake bite but died because medical treatment was delayed,” said Shahi. According to local media, her family took her to the village shaman, or witch doctor, for treatment instead of taking her to a hospital. Local police confirmed that a girl had died but were unable to provide further details on the cause. Chhaupadi is linked to Hinduism and considers women untouchable when they menstruate, as well as after child birth. They are banished from the home - barred from touching food, religious icons, cattle and men - and forced to sleep in basic huts known as chhau goth. Two women died in late 2016 in separate incidents while following the ritual - one of smoke inhalation after she lit a fire for warmth, while the other death was unexplained. Rights activists say many other deaths likely go unreported. Chhaupadi was banned a decade ago but is still followed in parts of Nepal, particularly in remote western districts. Proposed legislation that would criminalise the practice and make it an imprisonable offence to force women to follow the ritual is currently pending in parliament. Some communities believe they will suffer misfortune such as a natural disaster if women and girls are not sent into isolation when they menstruate. They are also not permitted to drink milk and are given less food to eat during their period. Activists say the government’s response to stamp out practices such as the Chhaupadi system and child marriage in the Himalayan nation has been inadequate. But officials say they are battling age-old attitudes that cannot be changed overnight. “We have launched different schemes but quickly removing practices that are deep-rooted in the society is difficult,” said Binita Bhattarai, an official from the women and child welfare ministry. “Changing mindsets and social attitudes is a time-taking process.” ||||| An 18-year-old girl has died in Nepal after she was bitten by a snake while banished to a shed because she was menstruating, under an ancient practice that has been banned for more than a decade, officials said.

This month was no different. She slept there on wooden boards laid on the ground, in keeping with a tradition known as chhaupadi that sequesters menstruating women from their families. But while she was in the hut on Thursday night, Ms. Shahi, 18, was bitten by a poisonous snake. Her mother took her to a shaman, but he could not cure her. Then she was taken to a health clinic, but workers did not have the antivenom medicine she needed, her family said. Ms. Shahi died early Friday morning. “If she was given proper treatment, she would have survived,” said Kamala Shahi, a cousin of Ms. Shahi’s who works at a government health post. “She died because of superstition.” The Supreme Court of Nepal ordered an end to chhaupadi, which is linked to Hinduism, in 2005. But it is still practiced in many of Nepal’s isolated villages, particularly in the west. A bill is pending in Parliament to formally criminalize the practice. Many people in rural villages believe that menstruating women are impure and can bring bad luck on a household. Under the chhaupadi tradition, the women are kept from taking part in normal family activities and social gatherings or from entering houses, kitchens and temples. ||||| What is a summary?","completion":"Tragedy has struck in Nepal after a teenage girl participating in the controversial chhaupadi menstruation ritual died from a snake bite.

Michael Mullen, reflected the growing impatience of U.S. officials with Pakistan's unwillingness to stop the attacks and the belief that Pakistan is actively supporting the insurgents.
